The aim of a workers compensation scheme should be to provide workers with a meaningful and sustainable outcome following a workplace injury. The majority of injured workers are committed to an early and successful return to work. The committee's inquiry was timely, as there are substantial human and economic costs of work related injuries. Premiums for employers have increased, notwithstanding a reported drop in injury rates, and there are important changes to the labour market. The challenges for the workers compensation industry over the next decade include changing work arrangements, the ageing of the work force and changing lifestyles.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The committee received 84 submissions and heard evidence from 82 witnesses across Australia. While the committee could not quantify the significance of fraud within any sector—that is, employees, employers, service providers, lawyers, insurance companies or workers compensation schemes—there was quite a degree of difference of opinion on the part of those who made submissions. It appeared that the level of employee fraud was generally considered to be low, although some who made submissions considered that there was a significant level of fraud. The committee has therefore made strong recommendations about data collection in order to be able to quantify whether fraud is significant within the workers compensation industry. There are also enhanced strategies suggested in the report to identify employer noncompliance and the need for increased accountability of service providers.</para><para>There are currently 10 different schemes operating in Australia for nine million employees. A move towards greater national consistency would provide opportunities for the various schemes to review their current activities in terms of best practice. The committee is concerned at the extent to which there appears to be cost shifting to the Commonwealth, either covertly or overtly, from state based workers compensation schemes. The primary responsibility for workers compensation should remain with the states and territories. There needs to be a network of memoranda of understanding to ensure that employees injured in one jurisdiction are not left without cover in another. Social security was not established to subsidise state based workers compensation schemes. The committee recommends a study to determine whether injured workers who have received workers compensation subsequently access income support entitlements. The extent to which Medicare is subsidising the workers compensation industry also needs to be determined.</para><para>It was generally agreed that there is inadequate data to support analysis of some national trends. The committee has a number of concerns about a national database on fraudulent activities. Also, the advice offered by lawyers may not always be in the best interests of the clients in achieving the goal of a timely return to work. Common law can often be a barrier to successful injury management or return to work. The committee believes that educational material on the various options available and the possible associated pitfalls should be forwarded to injured workers. Financial counselling and support should also be offered through Centrelink, with a view to ensuring a timely return to work where possible. The committee is particularly concerned by the level of suicide amongst injured workers and believes that this is worthy of further attention. </para><para>There are advantages to be found in the implementation of nationally consistent rehabilitation and return to work practices and in the measurement of rehabilitation outcomes to identify best practice. It was plainly evident to the committee that there is a great deal of knowledge and expertise in what is best practice in every aspect of the workers compensation industry. The committee believes that greater cooperation and liaison between the various partners would enable a number of improvements to the workers compensation industry.</para><para>In conclusion, I would like to thank all those who assisted the committee during the inquiry. My thanks particularly go to the committee for their work on this, their first report, and to the deputy chair, who worked very hard with me and other committee members to bring forward the report. I would also like to thank the secretariat for their assistance. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>15558</page.no><name role="metadata">Bevis, Arch, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEVIS</name><name.id>ET4</name.id><electorate>Brisbane</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too rise to speak on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment and Workplace Relations report <inline font-style="italic">Back on the job: report into aspects of Australian workers' compensation schemes</inline>.

Unfortunately the same professional parliamentary approach was not exhibited by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Tony Abbott, who sought to railroad the inquiry into a partisan political witch-hunt of workers that was totally improper, leading Labor members to issue a rare, if not unprecedented, press release entitled `Abbott wrecks parliamentary committee'. Unlike most members of the parliament, Minister Abbott has not worked out when to behave like a parliamentarian and when to be a politically partisan head kicker.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Committees are not part of the executive and are not playthings of ministers; they are essential and unique forums that enable the parliament, not the executive, to inquire into matters of current importance. The executive has the entire Public Service bureaucracy at its disposal to do that. We should fiercely guard the independence and the authority of the parliamentary committee system.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Partly as a result of Minister Abbott's conduct and decisions, the committee adopted a suitably wide interpretation of the terms of reference and has tabled a useful contribution to the debate on workers compensation systems in Australia. It is important to recognise that, whatever our prejudices and notwithstanding the occasional anecdote to the contrary, the overwhelming weight of evidence makes clear that fraud—particularly workers fraud—in our workers compensation system is not a major issue impacting on the overall operational costs of the system. A number of references cited on pages 26 and 27 of the report refer to this fact. I quickly refer to a couple of those. The report states: </para><quote><para>The Australian Plaintiff Lawyers Association pointed out that all official inquiries over the last two decades have been unable to identify cogent evidence that there is widespread claimant fraud.</para><para>The Queensland Government stated that the incidence and associated cost of fraud is difficult to quantify but estimated to be relatively low.</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>The Western Australian government ... concluded that the incidence of fraud in that jurisdiction is negligible.</para></quote><para>And the Chief Executive Officer of the Commonwealth's own Comcare, Barry Leahy, gave evidence that fraud is not a significant issue as far as Comcare is concerned.</para><para>The incidence of employer fraud, too, was seen to be very low, although it is interesting to note that the evidence would seem to indicate a more significant problem. The evidence from Queensland WorkCover cited at page 43 is that `hundreds of penalties are imposed every year for noncompliance'. That is interesting to compare with the figures that were given by Mr Leahy of Comcare. He noted that, out of some 18,000 active claims each year, 23 were the subject of investigation last year and, he believed, 22 the year before that.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I indicate to the member for Brisbane that the time allotted for the debate has expired.

This private member's bill does what the government failed to do: act quickly and decisively against the Hezbollah External Security Organisation. Last week I proposed through a private member's bill that parliament take immediate action against the growing threat to Australia from the Hezbollah External Security Organisation. In an unprecedented manner, this government has been forced to introduce the same legislation before this debate has even occurred. This may be the most successful private member's bill in this country's history. There have only been 15 successful private members' bills and only seven have originated in this House. Today we add to that, and we do it in record time. </para></talk.start><para>Although the government will not admit it, the threat to Australia is a direct result of the increased global terrorist activity following the war in Iraq. Yet the Prime Minister continues with the absurd fantasy that the war in Iraq has made Australians safer. Even as they erect barriers around Parliament House and armour plate the Prime Minister's personal vehicle, they want us to believe we are safer. Australians know otherwise, and they want to know as well that their security is being looked after. That is what Labor is committed to doing.</para><para>The Hezbollah External Security Organisation is a terrorist group. It is based in Lebanon and it has a global network. It has a record of terror and murder. We all know that this terrorist organisation has threatened Australians, because the Attorney-General publicly stated so last week. Therefore, we are determined to ensure that the terrorist wing of Hezbollah is blacklisted. But at the same time we see no desire, and we have no desire, to ban legitimate political and social organisations in the process.</para><para>Australians want their governments to act decisively against threats to our security and they want a strong, bipartisan approach to national security issues. The Prime Minister first wrote to me on this matter on 2 April this year. I was briefed by intelligence agencies on 3 April and I replied in writing to the Prime Minister on 8 April. In my response I specifically said:</para><quote><para>In the event the government fails to secure a listing for Hizballah through the UN Security Council ... Labor would support a specific amendment to the Criminal Code to name the Hizballah External Terrorist Organisation as a terrorist organisation within the Principal Act. </para></quote><para>Despite my offering this legislative solution almost two months ago, the Prime Minister did not write back to me on this crucial issue until 12 May and in his response he flatly rejected Labor's proposed changes. That is why I acted at the first available opportunity.</para><para>The government was not prepared to accept our approach until it was forced to do so by the weight of evidence and public opinion, and I genuinely welcome that change of heart by the government. But let us be clear on this: the legislation that it said last week was unconstitutional is now presented by the government as a solution to the very problem. It waited eight weeks to bring forward legislation that it said was so urgent. The government's backdown on this matter is a humiliating but welcome defeat for wedge politics in this country—wedge politics that we have seen far too much of by this government. </para><para>Labor stand prepared to work with governments to protect our citizens. Labor are prepared to initiate to ensure that our citizens feel safer. The truth is: this government is being forced into this position simply because of Labor's determination to act and to act quickly. We provided the solution; the government simply wanted to play politics. This is another example of the government leading and exposing its wedge politics. I commend the bill to the House. </para><para>Bill read a first time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—In accordance with standing order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title><type>Private Members' Business</type><page.no>15560</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Prostate Cancer</title><page.no>15560</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>15560</page.no><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LLOYD</name><name.id>IK6</name.id><electorate>Robertson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That this House:</para><para>(1)	acknowledges that prostate cancer is now a major cause of death in Australian men with more than 2,500 men dying from prostate cancer annually; </para><para>(2)	recognises the importance of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing as a reliable and effective method of diagnosing early prostate cancer, providing the best possibility of a successful outcome;</para><para>(3)	notes the reported collapse of a proposed national television awareness campaign about prostate cancer; and</para><para>(4)	calls on the Federal Government to examine funding options which will enable increased research into prostate cancer, and provide additional and more effective awareness programs to assist in the early detection of prostate cancer.</para><para>More than 10,000 Australian men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year and, typically, 2,600 men die annually from this disease. This makes it the second most prolific cancer for men, next to skin cancer. Many lives could be saved through the combination of a nationwide campaign, increased funding for research and a better understanding of the prostate specific antigen—PSA—test as a useful tool in the early diagnosis of the disease.</para><para>I take issue with comments from Ray Lowenthal of the Cancer Council. He stated, `We do not yet know whether early detection saves lives.' As with all cancers, early detection is critical in the treatment and possible cure. Once cancer has spread outside the prostate gland, it almost certainly cannot be cured. It can be treated and managed, but usually not cured. There is much debate, even controversy, over the importance of the PSA test. Certainly in my own case I firmly believe that the PSA test saved my life, and I know I am not alone. I have received many letters, and I would like to read part of one. It states: </para><quote><para>... I owe my survival to my enlightened GP who put me on annual PSA tests some 10 years ago. The significant rise which occurred about 2 years ago was immediately followed up, an early cancer detected and dealt with.</para><para>In contrast my brother-in-law did not have PSA tests and when he finally and reluctantly went for examination of symptoms he had been ignoring, he had a rampant cancer which had already spread to his bones. He died 18 months ago of Prostate Cancer. His widow and I feel that had he had PSA tests, and an early diagnosis he might well still be alive today.</para></quote><para>In March 2000 my local GP recommended that, despite having no symptoms, I have a PSA test, and the results showed a slight elevation. Six months later I had another test, which showed further elevation. A biopsy confirmed a moderately aggressive prostate cancer, and I underwent a successful radical prostatectomy on 17 February this year, at the Sydney Adventist Hospital.</para><para>Prior to being personally involved I, like most Australian men, knew very little about prostate cancer—despite my father also suffering from the disease. I knew nothing about the PSA test or about the incredible incidence of the disease. Recent research conducted on behalf of the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia indicates that only 10 per cent of men in the 50- to 70-year age bracket had undergone an appropriate test for prostate cancer, and many of them did not feel that they were adequately informed about prostate cancer. This appalling lack of knowledge could be costing countless lives and must stop. An awareness campaign for both the public and health professionals should be implemented as a matter of urgency. It will save lives.</para><para>Some of the letters we have received are very sad. I will read part of a letter that was written to Prime Minister John Howard. It says: </para><quote><para>Both my G.P. and I were relying upon digital examinations. In my case I was simply unaware that such a test was useless. My G.P. should have known better, but didn't. Why is it that men's lives are exposed to such lack of knowledge of simple facts? </para></quote><para>The letter goes on to say that we should do everything we can `to ensure that fewer Australian fathers end up putting their families through the agonies that I have imposed on mine'. It is a very sad letter.</para><para>Since the listing of my private member's motion on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper,</inline> I have received hundreds of letters from prostate cancer sufferers and their families all over Australia. I know that most other members have also received many supportive letters. The fact that so many of my colleagues, on both sides of the House, are in the chamber today indicates the level of interest that this motion has generated.</para><para>Much of the controversy over the PSA test relates to the effectiveness of treatment and the possible side effects. Unfortunately, many of the negative comments are based on outdated information. After the publication of my letter on this subject in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 10 March 2003, I received a critical email from Simon Chapman, Professor of the School of Public Health. In a typically academic approach, he claimed that he had consulted the world's largest database of published medical research and then proceeded to provide me with data that showed incontinence levels could be up to 50 per cent. Dr Phillip Katelaris, a noted urological surgeon, responded to Professor Chapman's claims in a letter dated 11 March 2003. The letter reads, in part: </para><quote><para>It is every man's right to know whether or not he may have early prostate cancer and whether or not he chooses to avail himself of potentially curative therapy. This goes to the very crux of consumer rights in our society. Furthermore, it is every man's right to know best practice morbidity for curative prostate cancer, not to be told by `Experts' like Professor Chapman that incontinence rates are 50%. It is interesting that Professor Chapman makes no reference to contemporary epidemiological studies, such as the Austrian study indicating a distinct advantage for early screening and intervention. I would have thought that it was a man's right to know about these studies as well.</para><para>It is not just an issue of long term cure with early prostate cancer detection, it is also a matter of avoiding the misery and complication of progressive untreated prostate cancer. That relates to recurrent bladder obstruction, pain, bleeding, retention and metastatic bone pain. Simon Chapman would not detect this human suffering by reading “the world's largest database”. It is a shame that he has no clinical experience in this field.</para></quote><para>You can see Dr Katelaris to be very passionate about this issue. I recently attended a meeting of a prostate cancer support group and met with many survivors and their wives. At that meeting there were many men with advanced prostate cancer undergoing radiation and hormone treatment. When I left that meeting I was overwhelmed with sadness and guilt. Why? Because I feel so well and because I was lucky enough to be diagnosed early and receive successful treatment. I saw sadness in the eyes of these men and their wives. I saw suffering. I saw pain. It made me determined to do what I can to end this suffering.</para><para>Government funding for research and education into prostate disease is minimal when compared to funding provided to fight breast cancer, despite the incidence of both these diseases being similar. Could it be the fact that almost 90 per cent of all prostate cancers occur in men over 60 years of age? I hope not, because 60 or 70 years of age these days is not exactly the end of a man's meaningful contribution in his life. Even if you accept this ridiculous proposition, it still means that more than 1,000 men aged between 45 and 60 will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year and every year. The government is funding Andrology Australia, an Australian centre for excellence in male reproductive health, to the tune of $4 million over the next four years. This is an important initiative, but just $1 million per year is not enough. Much more needs to be done. Australia has already made significant progress in research into medical procedures, and one way in which the department of health can show it is serious is to be financially supportive of these endeavours. </para><para>The Sydney Adventist Hospital currently has a research project utilising an endorectal MRI with spectroscopy to accurately diagnose prostate cancer. I personally volunteered to be part of this research program. We are very fortunate at the Sydney Adventist Hospital to have a dynamic, cooperative interface between clinical medicine and research scientists. I believe it is the only institute in the world that is able to coordinate a study that includes preoperative MRI assessment to correlate these findings with radical proctectomy specimens post-operatively. Yet all this is being placed at risk. The MRI monitoring and evaluating group has rejected an application for Medicare funding for this MRI machine simply on the basis of geography—the fact that there is another MRI machine in the area. This is not good enough. The losses being incurred by the Sydney Adventist Hospital on this MRI project are simply unsustainable. If the government wants to show that it is serious about increased funding for prostate cancer research, it should immediately provide Medicare support for this project, otherwise all this world leading research could be lost.</para><para>There seems to be a serious culture of resistance within the federal department of health in funding prostate cancer research and education programs. I know that there is debate and even controversy between the academic and clinical experts in this field, but this should not be a reason for resistance. Early detection is vital and will stop men suffering misery, pain and early death from untreated prostate cancer. I hope that it is not a factor of finances, because the costs of biopsies and PSA tests are minimal compared to the costs of treating someone with advanced prostate cancer. </para><para>I thank my colleagues for being in the chamber, and I thank the member for Lilley, Wayne Swan, for seconding this motion. I also thank the people in my family and my support group who have rallied around me in my battle and my recovery process. I hope that this motion does achieve some positive initiatives for the many thousands of men and their families who are suffering from this terrible disease. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>15563</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I second the motion and acknowledge the role of the member for Robertson in bringing this issue of prostate cancer to parliament for debate. It is a very important debate for the parliament and the country. There is an old saying that, in helping one another, we always help ourselves. Who amongst us in this chamber can know who in their family, in their circle of friends or indeed in this House will at some time in the future be touched by cancer? The more we do as a society, the more we do as the custodians of the public health, we do for each other but we also do for ourselves. We are all in this together—male, female, young and old.</para></talk.start><para>Today we are talking about prostate cancer, but we could easily be talking about breast cancer, cervical cancer or throat cancer. It is in the nation's interest that more is done to detect, diagnose, treat and cure the ravages of this disease. As a survivor of prostate cancer, which claims the lives of 2,600 men each year—a similar number to the number of women who die from breast and lung cancer—I have a direct emotional attachment in this issue. I readily acknowledge that. But it is said by people like Professor Alan Coates, CEO of the Cancer Council, that people like me and the member for Robertson may be too emotionally involved in this issue to be objective. I readily concede that I am emotionally involved in this issue. I watched my father die the most agonising death from the spread of an aggressive prostate cancer. He survived the war but he could not beat the death sentence of prostate cancer. </para><para>Surprisingly, when I was diagnosed in 2001, in spite of my father's experience, I knew very little about this disease. A diagnosis like that brings a feeling of powerlessness from which, for many, instantly flows a deep feeling of terror. In my experience and my father's experience, this terror can only be dealt with in one way, and that is with knowledge. In many cases, access to reliable information and good, relevant medical advice calms the situation. That has certainly been the case in my situation. It enabled me and my family to cope. Knowledge gave us the power. Knowledge gave us the tools to fight this disease and face the future. I believe it is this experience that qualifies me to accurately and emotionally discuss and be objective about this issue.</para><para>The first and most important point is a very simple one that is not readily acknowledged—that there is a very low level of knowledge about prostate cancer in our community. That is really why Jim and I are here today. The research is absolutely damning. Only five per cent of Australian men and women between 46 and 70 see prostate cancer as a serious disease. Forty per cent of men are too afraid, embarrassed or even pig-headed to be examined and tested. These are damning figures. Yet we know that men with a first-degree family history of prostate cancer are three times more likely to develop the disease themselves. Only one in 10 men are tested for this disease, compared to seven in 10 women for breast cancer and nine in 10 for cervical cancer.</para><para>In the medical revolution of the last 20 years where great strides have been made in detection, prevention and cure, public education campaigns have saved lives. But that is not the case when we come to prostate cancer. Repeated public statements by Professor Coates of the Cancer Council and now his board have set back the campaign for greater public awareness and confused many people. Professor Coates has said that he personally will not get tested for prostate cancer and has also publicly advised men not to get tested. He says to men, `Don't bother to find out,' arguing that testing has not yet proven to be reliable and that the disease is not in all cases a killer. His statements have caused great distress and confusion to many men currently making their decision about treatment.</para><para>Having been through the dark tunnel of diagnosis and, following surgery, emerging into the light of now a full recovery, I will not stand by and see a generation of men and their families sidelined by the medical equivalent of Hansonism—a head-in-the-sand approach which completely ignores modern realities. The ivory tower elitism of some cancer experts like Professor Coates, who refuse to empower Australian men by sharing their knowledge about prostate cancer and its treatment, is a disgrace. They oppose an awareness campaign because they do not give Australian men and their families enough credit to weigh the evidence and come to sensible decisions. This arrogance is absolutely lethal.</para><para>These are strong words but, to fully understand something, you must not only experience it but also try and change it. The deeper I have looked at this issue, the more appalled I have become. My criticisms may be harsh but they are necessary. Like the member for Robertson, I will do everything in this place to make sure that we do get an accurate and informative public awareness campaign, because the alternative is to sentence many Australian men to death. It is as simple as that. </para><para>Professor Coates has already torpedoed a multimillion dollar Prostate Cancer Foundation campaign to raise community awareness, which would have advised men to visit their doctor to become better informed. He is absolutely opposed to such a campaign, and he continues to spread inaccurate and scientifically false assertions. In his endeavours he appears to have the support of the federal health department and perhaps the federal minister.</para><para>I want to deal briefly with some statements that have been made by the chair of Professor Coates's board, Professor Lowenthal, in a letter to all members of parliament. Page 1 of that letter states that, as a nation, we do not know whether early detection saves lives. This is just Hansonism—stick your head in the sand and ignore modern realities. We do know that a 48-year-old man who is detected with prostate cancer will die from it. What we do not know statistically is whether mass screening will reduce mortality. But do we let the 48-year-old and others like him die when we know that early detection does save lives, particularly when we know that international data shows that we can affect mortality rates? Data from Canada, the United States and Austria has shown that mortality has fallen considerably when early detection has been a matter of national policy.</para><para>The letter from Professor Coates and Professor Lowenthal also includes an outrageous statement that screening:</para><quote><para>... should not be performed if an individual wants to maximise his quality of life, minimise the risk of complications and only undergo medical tests which they clearly know as beneficial.</para></quote><para>It goes on to state:</para><quote><para>... many men go on to have treatment that may have been unnecessary.</para></quote><para>Can members imagine the outcry if these statements were made about breast cancer screening and testing? These statements are all code for the Cancer Council being opposed to a public campaign that (1) identifies at-risk groups of men, and (2) alerts all men to issues of prostate cancer. Why? Because Professor Coates and the Cancer Council do not want men to make additional visits to doctors for physical examination or PSA tests, or both. It is that simple. That is, they do not want to spend the money. That is, awareness campaigns lead to testing. Professor Coates does not advocate information; what he advocates is ignorance.</para><para>The facts are these. If prostate cancer is detected early, curative therapy does save lives. As for there being side effects, surely that is up to the man and his family to evaluate and decide on. Professors Lowenthal and Coates do not want to have an information campaign to give a man the information he needs to save his life. They argue that more men die with prostate cancer than from it. That is completely untrue; it lacks any scientific validity. Men are now living longer, giving the cancer more time to spread beyond the prostate. More men are now diagnosed much younger—even in their 40s—and prostate cancer tends to be more aggressive in younger men.</para><para>Also Professors Coates and Lowenthal play to outdated stereotypes of the consequences of surgery. They can be very serious, I admit, but medical outcomes are improving all the time. However, Professors Coates and Lowenthal never mention the alternatives. As one prominent urologist said to me, `You can't have sex in a coffin.' That seemed to be a very pertinent point to make. What I can say is that men can only make informed decisions if they can access accurate information and medical advice.</para><para>At a meeting with prominent medical specialists, Professor Coates has said that he did not want an information campaign which suggested that men talk to their doctor because `it would lead to testing'. That is the whole problem. They do not want to spend the money on testing; it is as simple as that. To further discourage information campaigns, this current Cancer Council letter in the hands of members states: </para><quote><para>... screening for prostate cancer is different to screening for breast cancer in that rigorous medical studies have proven that screening for breast cancer saves lives.</para></quote><para>That is a blatant lie. This statement is disproved by an article in the December 2001 edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Lancet</inline>, which followed an earlier paper by the highly regarded Cochrane review—there is no more or less proof about the effectiveness of screening for breast cancer as compared to prostate cancer. Of course we should screen for both. We should screen for all cancers, if the means are available. So the situation is roughly equivalent. There is no more evidence that a 48-year-old woman detected early with breast cancer will live longer than a man who is detected early with prostate cancer at a comparable age. We spend something like 20 times the amount on breast cancer research than we spend on research into prostate cancer. We are all in this together. This is not an argument about one form of cancer against another. It is an argument about one cancer which has been sidelined—left in the cupboard, if you like—with no-one wanting to talk about it, and the consequences are that it has not had the resources that it ought to have.</para><para>The truth is that Professor Coates and his board are not the peak prostate cancer clinical body; the Urological Society is. It is about time that the Cancer Council stopped running this disgraceful campaign and started putting out accurate information. Australian men, like women, deserve accurate information so they can make informed decisions—informed decisions on the most common cancer killer of Australian men. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>15566</page.no><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name><name.id>HK6</name.id><electorate>Herbert</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—During this sitting today three Australian men will die from prostate cancer. They are three Australian men who do not need to die. I think that underlines the necessity and the importance of the motion that has been presented to the parliament this afternoon. Unlike the member for Robertson and the member for Lilley, I am not emotionally involved in this particular issue. But many men are. Because I am not emotionally involved I can speak with clarity and support sensible ideas in relation to issues where we can do better for our male community in Australia today.</para></talk.start><para>I welcome this discussion. Some people think that perhaps you should not talk about prostate cancer—that perhaps it is something that should not be discussed openly. Times have changed, and I think it is particularly relevant that this matter should be discussed in the Australian parliament. I want to thank Les Payne, Malcolm Wallace, Bert Verheyen and Des Peters, who are the leaders of a prostate cancer support group in Townsville. They have been to see me on a number of occasions. They are passionate advocates and very strong supporters of the member for Robertson's motion this afternoon.</para><para>I think it is very clear that, in relation to breast cancer, women are extraordinarily aware of the dangers. The member for Lilley has pointed that out. But men are not aware of the dangers of prostate cancer. I think that is the nitty-gritty of this problem. I am particularly pleased, member for Robertson, to see paragraphs (3) and (4) of your motion. Paragraph (3) notes the reported collapse of the proposed national television awareness campaign about prostate cancer. The importance of that was, of course, to get the understanding out there—the understanding that is needed for men to know what potential problems are there and what they might be able to do about them. </para><para>I am also pleased to see the member for Robertson, in paragraph (4), calling on the federal government to examine funding options that will enable increased research into prostate cancer. According to the Cancer Council, it is very important that there be more research into this area. Currently, there is a good deal of controversy—we have heard it articulated already in the parliament—even within the medical fraternity. It is only through quality research that these issues will be resolved and we will get the best outcome not only for the government and the medical community but also for the patients themselves—those people who potentially could have prostate cancer. Better understanding and a balanced education program are extraordinarily important, and I wholeheartedly support the member for Robertson's motion.</para><para>I illustrate my concern this way. About three years ago there was no breast screening process on Magnetic Island in Townsville. I thought that was unusual and that women on Magnetic Island should have access to breast cancer screening. I arranged for the cancer screening unit to go to Magnetic Island for the very first time. About three months later I was on the island and a woman came up to me and said, `You know, you saved my life.' It is a really humbling experience to have that happen. She had not intended to go and be screened but, because the facility was available, she went, was screened and was found to have an aggressive breast cancer that was curable. That is a wonderful thing. The same should occur in relation to prostate cancer. Men should be aware of, and have the opportunity to have full information on, how they might protect themselves against this deadly cancer. I started this discussion by saying that a man dies of prostate cancer every three hours in our community. This cancer is curable if it is detected early, so let us do that. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>15567</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the contributions of the member for Robertson and the member for Lilley, and congratulate them on bringing this important issue to the House. Cancer is a disease that has enormous impact on the lives of those who develop it. It is an insidious disease that is often viewed as a death sentence by a person when he or she is diagnosed with it. It impacts not only on the individual who has the diagnosis but also on that person's family. It has a psychological impact, the treatments associated with it have enormous impact, and there are always side effects associated with those treatments.</para></talk.start><para>Today this House turns its attention to prostate cancer, a disease that is responsible for the deaths of over 2,500 Australian men each year. It is important for we in this parliament to note that two members of this House—the two members who are jointly sponsoring this motion, the member for Robertson and the member for Lilley—have been victims of prostate cancer. Both are relatively young men and, as I said, both are supporting this motion. It shows just how common the disease is that two relatively young members of the House—two members out of 112 male members—have been diagnosed and treated for the disease in the last two years. It also demonstrates that this disease must be taken seriously. It must be taken seriously by the medical community, by the Cancer Council and by men.</para><para>Prostate cancer, like most other cancers, is difficult to detect. The cause is unknown, although there is information that supports the theory that there is a tie within families. I think that men who have close relatives who have had prostate cancer should take the threat very seriously. As I say, the cause is unknown, and the treatments have unwanted side effects and varying degrees of success, as is the case with all cancers. The most commonly used tool is the PSA test, which measures the PSA levels in a person's blood. It is a strong indicator as to whether a person has prostate cancer. For one in three people that have elevated levels of PSA and go on to further testing it is shown that they have prostate cancer. That demonstrates quite effectively how important this test is. </para><para>Testing can and does identify the presence of prostate cancer. What is needed is a test that differentiates between aggressive and non-aggressive types of cancer. Unless we have more research and more education, this will not happen. If we want to achieve this, we must have those dollars. We must have money for research and longitudinal studies. We really need the government, the medical community and the research community to take this seriously. It is a very important issue that is affecting our community. Prostate cancer has become a lot more predominant in recent years. That is an issue that should be researched as well.</para><para>There has been controversy over whether men should be checked routinely for prostate cancer. The most important thing is for men to have the information—to be aware that prostate cancer is so prevalent within our community, that there are tests that can assist them and identify the cancer and that there are many treatments for it. It is important to recognise the symptoms of prostate cancer. As I do not have very much time remaining, I will not go through the symptoms, but I recommend that anyone who is at all concerned should see their doctor.</para><para>It is the role of government to invest in research and health promotion. Much more research is needed into prostate cancer—its identification, cause and treatment. It is a disease that afflicts many men in Australia. Its incidence appears to be increasing. Public awareness of the disease can be increased only through active promotion by the government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>15568</page.no><name role="metadata">Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr SOUTHCOTT</name><name.id>TK6</name.id><electorate>Boothby</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Members of parliament and people in medicine always have an urge to do something: `If you see a problem, do something: correct it.' In the area of prostate cancer, it may seem counter-intuitive that early detection is not always going to lead to lives saved. In breast cancer and colonic cancer, the focus is on early detection and getting the cancer out with surgery, using radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy or whatever. Prostate cancer is very different. You have a whole spectrum from almost benign disease to very aggressive disease. I urge members to look at the web site www.prostatehealth. org.au, which is part of the prostate collaboration and which I think has been generated by the repatriation hospital in my electorate as part of the Lions Australian prostate site.</para></talk.start><para>As members of parliament, we should encourage evidence based practice. In terms of prostate cancer and this motion, anything which leads to an increased relationship between men and their GP is positive. I wish to endorse most of the motion by the member for Robertson, but I want to qualify some of it and perhaps question whether widespread screening leading to early detection is actually going to lead to lives saved. The important thing—rather than just having population screening—is to understand the natural history of prostate cancer. The authors of an article in the <inline font-style="italic">British Medical Journal</inline> of 6 October 2001, looking at the British evidence, talked about surveys which concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the introduction of PSA screening because of concerns that it may not improve survival or quality of life and may thus cause more harm than good. </para><para>Having a PSA test is an individual matter. It is important to balance the risk of the cancer—and to understand how it might behave—and the risk of unnecessary treatment and side effects. It is an individual decision. What people need to do is, firstly, assess the threat with their general practitioner, and, secondly, think about what they will do if they find early stage or low-grade prostate cancer. They need to think about whether they will have the cancer treated or not. Then they need to discuss with their partner and their GP where their preference lies between the risk of the threat and the problems with the treatment.</para><para>As I said, testing in prostate cancer is an individual decision. It should be an informed decision. Any awareness campaign needs to encourage people to spend at least 20 minutes with their general practitioner and to read the sorts of documents that are available on the prostate health web site. People need to know about prostate cancer. They also need to know about the tests, the diagnosis and the treatment.</para><para>Most prostate cancers are slow growing. Ninety per cent of them are in men over 60. Many are not a threat to life. For example, a quarter of men in their 50s, 40 per cent of men in their 60s, and 60 to 80 per cent of men in their 80s will have some microscopic evidence of prostate cancer. In the majority of cases, this is not life threatening.</para><para>It is true that surgery or radiotherapy can cure early cancer. A PSA test can show prostate cancer at an early stage, when the cancer is often asymptomatic. But the treatment can also lead to the side effects of impotence and incontinence. The cancers grow at different rates. We do not always know whether treatment is necessary. There are high-risk groups such as people who have had a father and a brother with a cancer at an early age. For these people, a PSA test would be prudent. But then there are people with lower risks—men younger than 40 and people with no family history. Many men over 75 will have prostate cancer. In most cases it is not threatening their life; in most cases they will ultimately die from something else. But there are men aged 50 to 75 who are at moderate risk of cancer and are being threatened by it.</para><para>The PSA test is useful—people need to consider whether they are going to have one or an annual screen—it also needs to come with a rectal examination. In the treatment of prostate cancer, sometimes the best thing to do if the cancer is early stage and low grade, is to watch and wait—defer treatment. With prostatectomy and radiotherapy, there are other side effects: impotence, incontinence and sometimes, with radiotherapy, bowel injury. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>15569</page.no><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PLIBERSEK</name><name.id>83M</name.id><electorate>Sydney</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The member for Boothby pointed out that universal screening for prostate cancer is perhaps not useful, but this motion does not argue for universal screening; it argues for screening for groups of men that are at risk. The debate we have gotten into with the Cancer Council of Australia and others—that universal screening is not desirable—really detracts from the fact that, for many people, screening is not just desirable, it can save their lives. Without telling people about the importance of screening, without telling them about the likelihood of prostate cancer, and without letting men know about screening processes that are available to them we will not make a dent on the death rate from prostate cancer.</para></talk.start><para>The member for Boothby was suggesting that early detection is not necessarily desirable because in many cases prostate cancer is very slow growing. I understand that argument but I have to say that, if you are one of those men for whom early detection means the difference between life and death, you do not hold very strongly to the argument that early detection can have its drawbacks. Certainly it has its drawbacks in a statistical sense, but for some men it is the difference between life and death. It is the difference between dying in your 50s and dying in your 70s, and I certainly would not be dismissing that as unimportant. </para><para>We say that only men get prostate cancer—that is very true. But women suffer from prostate cancer as well. One of the reasons we need to talk about screening procedures and about really thorough public education campaigns is that, while of course we care about the health of the men who are affected by prostate cancer, we need to remember that whole families are affected by the possible loss or illness of a man who suffers from this disease. After skin cancer it is the second most common cancer in Australian men, and it is the second most common lethal cancer in Australian men after lung cancer. Over 2,500 men die each year of prostate cancer, but a much greater number live with it—that is true. We have 10,000 new diagnoses every year. For many of those men, their cancers grow slowly and they may not require treatment. But that decision is for those men and their families to take. It is not up to us as parliamentarians and it is certainly not up to public educators to say that people should not worry about this. They should be educated, and there is no way of doing that without a public education campaign.</para><para>If we start telling men that they should not worry, it gives them the perfect excuse not to have a test for prostate cancer, which is a test many men are frightened of. They will not decide against being tested because they have made a thoughtful, well-informed decision that prostate cancer testing is not for them; they will decide against the test because they are frightened of it and because it may be unpleasant. If they have prominent Australian doctors telling them that it is not necessarily a wise or essential thing to do, for many men—who perhaps have a family history of prostate cancer or a higher than usual risk profile for other reasons—it is the perfect excuse not to be tested.</para><para>The majority of prostate cancer deaths—83 per cent, in fact—occur in men over the age of 70. To some people 70 might sound old, but it is not old anymore. I know very healthy, fit, active people who are well over 70, including my own parents. They have many years of life left in them. To disregard particular conditions because they appear predominantly in older people seems to say that if people are not in the work force anymore they are not of much use to society. Many people in their 60s and 70s make an enormous contribution. I will conclude by saying that I believe we need to see a much greater investment in research about the causes of prostate cancer—lifestyle factors such as diet, the impact of heredity, genetic factors—and about the efficacy of treatment options so we can properly inform people who face a diagnosis of prostate cancer. We cannot do that by hiding our heads in the sand.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>15570</page.no><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MAY</name><name.id>83B</name.id><electorate>McPherson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the last few weeks I have learned a lot about prostate cancer through Mr Don Baumber and my local support group. I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the motion that is before the House. Statistics indicate that over 2,500 Australian men die from prostate cancer every year. That is around one death every 3½ hours. It is the most common cancer in Australian men after skin cancer and the second most lethal male cancer after lung cancer. One in 11 Aussie men will develop prostate cancer by the age of 75. However, it occurs rarely before the age of 45. Almost 90 per cent of prostate cancers occur in men aged 60 years and over, and 97 per cent of deaths from prostate cancer occur in men aged 60 or over. </para></talk.start><para>Figures for prostate cancer almost exactly mirror those for breast cancer in women. However, my own research indicates that, unlike women in relation to breast cancer, most men are either basically unaware or, at best, only vaguely aware of their risk to prostate cancer, while others are simply unaware they even have a prostate or of its vital role in sexual function and health. Who is at risk? We know that the majority of prostate cancers occur in men aged over 60 years, but it would appear that men with a family history of prostate cancer are at a higher risk of getting the disease. What causes prostate cancer? This is a difficult question to answer and the absolute cause is not known, although just getting older would appear to be the most significant risk factor in its development.</para><para>Researchers are currently investigating factors such as family history, physical activity and diet to determine if any of these have a role in the development of prostate cancer. The motion before the House today notes the reported collapse of the proposed national TV awareness campaign on prostate cancer—a campaign to raise community awareness about the cancer. Research conducted on behalf of the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia in 2001 indicated that only 54 per cent of men felt adequately informed about prostate cancer compared with 80 per cent of women who felt informed about breast cancer. I would have thought that, with those sorts of research figures, a national awareness campaign to inform men about the risks of prostate cancer and encourage them to talk to their doctor about whether they should be tested was the ideal way to get the message across.</para><para>Sadly, the major corporate sponsor of the TV campaign withdrew their funding offer of $1.5 million because of opposition from leading cancer organisations and the federal Department of Health and Ageing. Information indicates that some organisations opposed the campaign because of what they believed to be an apparent lack of scientific evidence that early diagnosis of prostate cancer saves lives. I understand the campaign was aimed at encouraging men to visit their doctor and discuss whether or not they should be tested. In my mind, this would have been a way of raising the awareness of prostate cancer and certainly would have had men stopping and thinking about whether or not to make that appointment. The campaign would have sent a signal to Aussie men and would have at least heightened the awareness for men in the crucial age bracket that they need to be better informed about the cancer and the choices available to them with regard to testing, the long-term prognosis for those who are detected with the cancer and the treatment options that are available.</para><para>There are differing views on whether or not PSA testing is reliable and whether or not it saves lives. I am not a doctor but, from all I have read, the PSA testing appears to be a reliable and effective method of diagnosing early prostate cancer. However, I do not believe that a national screening program is justified until there is a high level of evidence to suggest that screening does reduce deaths from the cancer. Having said that, I believe that more should be done to raise the awareness of prostate cancer and to provide information on the pros and cons of testing so that men can make informed decisions on whether or not to undergo testing and possible surgery.</para><para>It would appear from the statistics available that a national awareness and education program is warranted, and I would certainly encourage the federal government to explore avenues by which such a program could be developed and the information delivered in a practical and worthwhile way to enable maximum exposure to what is a very serious problem claiming the lives of far too many men. Don Baumber, the Convenor of the Gold Coast Prostate Cancer Support Group, has indicated in correspondence to me: </para><quote><para>Those men that do seek out information for themselves report dissatisfaction in that the information is inadequate, incomprehensive and inconsistent.</para></quote><para>These inadequacies must be addressed so that Aussie men feel confident that they can make informed decisions about the choices available to them for testing and treatment.</para><para>I commend the member for Robertson and the member for Lilley for bringing to the attention of the federal parliament the urgent need for further research in the area of prostate cancer and the urgent need for a national awareness program to assist in the early detection of prostate cancer. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>15572</page.no><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name><name.id>JH5</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too have been contacted by the Secretary of the Illawarra Prostate Cancer Support Group, urging that I support the private member's motion that has been moved today by the member for Robertson and supported by the member for Lilley.

It is important that we bring greater public awareness to the issue of prostate cancer.</para></talk.start><para>Prostate cancer is, as other speakers have pointed out, the second most lethal male cancer. I was surprised to read that its incidence is almost the same as that of breast cancer in women: almost one in 10 men over the age of 50 will develop prostate cancer during his lifetime; more than 10,000 new cases are diagnosed every year; and, regrettably, there is a very high incidence of death—around 2,600 men per year die from this form of cancer.</para><para>When you look at the incidence of breast and prostate cancer, there is a glaring difference, and that is that the community—and women, in particular—have responded over the past period of time to very successful public awareness campaigns and programs. Awareness is very central to the motion before us today. Women generally know of the risks to them of breast cancer and other gynaecological cancers affecting the female population. But it seems to me that the same priorities and effort have not gone into raising the awareness of the Australian community, and men in particular, to the risks of prostate cancer.</para><para>I am not sure whether this is a so-called male phenomenon, but I have been interested in reading about this issue, particularly the views of those who are not supportive of greater emphasis being given to prostate cancer and the constant references to potential side effects from treatment. There is a lot said about the possibilities of incontinence and impotence as a result of treatments. That is somehow being argued by some in the academic elite as a reason for not giving prostate cancer the kind of emphasis that we are urging in this motion. It would almost be like saying to women, `One of the side effects of treatment may be that you have to have your whole breast removed or even both breasts removed.' I am sure that most women, like men, would consider that option in discussions between them and their family if that option meant that their life would be saved and they would have a chance of living their life to the full. I think it is amazing that there is all this emphasis on incontinence and potential impotence rather than on the means of potentially saving lives.</para><para>I am only a lay person, but I would defy the academics and those who speak from an elitist point of view in this debate to tell me why it is that, in the case of prostate cancer, the earlier the diagnosis the better the prognosis for the patient does not apply. It applies in every form of cancer that I am aware of—and I speak not totally dispassionately, because I lost a husband to cancer. His cancer developed into secondary cancer from, I believe, the lack of early diagnosis and, unfortunately, some misdiagnosis. Any lay person will tell the academics that the earlier you detect something the better the prognosis and the better the chance of living life to the full. </para><para>In the context of this debate I also want to raise the issue of Zometa, a new treatment that my support group is urging be on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is a very costly treatment, but I understand it is very effective in treating the awful spread of prostate cancer into the bones, which sometimes happens with prostate cancer.</para><para>I commend both the mover and seconder of this very timely motion. If we can adopt the same sense of urgency, the same national importance and the same program of awareness raising and research which we have done in the field of breast cancer, we will have done something positive for our community. Many future lives may be saved if we adopt the proposals contained in this motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>15573</page.no><name role="metadata">Hull, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs HULL</name><name.id>83O</name.id><electorate>Riverina</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I congratulate both the member for Robertson and the member for Lilley in bringing forth this motion to the House. We have certainly come a long way in bringing these issues to the forefront and for men to be comfortable in discussing their health, as we have witnessed here today.</para></talk.start><para>Education is crucial for all men to gain a better understanding of the diseases that can affect them and impact on their lives. Men in rural and regional areas often find it difficult to discuss their health. Many hope that by ignoring the problem it will simply disappear. Moreover, investigation and diagnosis is not a simple matter of just attending a doctor, so mostly their health takes second place to everything else. In some cases in my electorate, it would mean days away from their farming properties or their small businesses in smaller regional communities whilst they travel to major centres, regional centres or city centres in order to have diagnosis and testing take place. Of course that all leads to them being away from their livelihood—their farms, properties, small businesses et cetera—with nobody else to pick up the reins. So instead they think to themselves, `Maybe this will go away if I don't confront it and if I don't actually allow it to enter my lifestyle.'</para><para>I believe it is important in that case that education campaigns should be appealing to all men, both in metropolitan and in rural areas. While it is imperative that any education program and campaign is focused on men, I think all sectors of the community need to be made aware of prostate cancer. Every one of us has a father, a brother, a partner, a friend or a colleague who may in his lifetime be diagnosed with prostate cancer. With an understanding of the disease, testing and treatment, individuals are far better informed and are able to support their loved ones and are particularly able to encourage them to have the necessary testing in order that they can start to address this issue before it is out of hand.</para><para>For many in the community prostate cancer is seen as a disease that affects just older men, yet statistics show that while it is rare for men under 40 years of age to be diagnosed it is possible. It is certainly not just older men who need to be aware of prostate cancer but men of all ages. The medical community is aware that many older men have small amounts of prostate cancer in their gland but lead normal lives without any problems. So in understanding the disease, the community should also understand living a normal life with prostate cancer is indeed possible. </para><para>Testing for prostate cancer is not as simple as it may seem. It is quite an invasive procedure. For many diseases or illnesses a number of relatively simple tests are required, whereas the side effects of tests to identify prostate cancer can be pretty serious. The Cancer Council of Australia still cannot confirm if early detection saves lives. It is a decision that needs to be made by each individual, taking into account his age, preferences and life situation with much education, knowledge and assistance thrown in. Men need to be given the options available to them in a simple and easy to comprehend manner. The current problem facing men suspected of having prostate cancer is that there is no test available that is good at differentiating between aggressive cancers and those that can be left without treatment. Prostate specific antigen detected in a blood test is the first indicator for men who are concerned that they may have prostate cancer. The existence of high levels of PSA indicates that cancer is present.</para><para>I support the Chief Government Whip's calls for funding options to be examined by the federal government to enable increased research into prostate cancer and to provide additional and more effective awareness programs to assist in the early detection of this cancer. The choice that men need to make in having a test for prostate cancer is balancing the risk of having a cancer which can be detected, cured or slowed down against the risk that detection and treatment of an early prostate cancer may not be necessary and could reduce quality of life. As a society we have come an enormous way in detecting, treating and saving lives from cancer as well as being able to openly discuss this disease. I encourage everyone to continue funding research into the main types of cancer that many ordinary Australians face daily on the basis of giving not just quality of life but indeed a choice—a choice as to whether you want to undertake it or you do not. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>15574</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name><name.id>84S</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to support the motion by the member for Robertson, which I understand is in effect cosponsored by the member for Lilley. This is certainly one of those issues where bipartisanship is totally appropriate and fully justified.</para></talk.start><para>In my home state of Tasmania there has been a significant attempt to raise awareness of prostate cancer and, in particular, to encourage men to consider health checks and treatment. We have also been very prominent in treatment. In my own electorate, we have a very fine cancer treatment facility, the W.P. Holman Clinic. The Holman Clinic describes itself as a leader in Australia in using high-dose rate brachytherapy for cancer of the prostate by providing a method of intensifying the radiation dose delivered to the affected area. It is appropriate that the clinic has placed a high emphasis on the treatment of prostate cancer as Tasmania has reported the highest rate of prostate cancer after the ACT—156.3 per 100,000 population. On the other hand, it has also been suggested that Tasmania may have a higher reported rate because of the awareness campaign that has been run and the uptake of prostate specific antigen testing.</para><para>According to figures provided by the Tasmanian Cancer Council for 1999, the most recent year for which such is available, prostate cancer was the most common cancer in Tasmanian males, with 276 new cases diagnosed. While the number of cases was greater than that of any other cancer, numbers have continued to decline since the peak in 1994 when 420 new cases were reported. But, sadly, prostate cancer accounted for 13 per cent of all cancer related deaths in Tasmania for that year, with 71 men dying of the disease. This is far higher than it should be. It is thus essential that we remain vigilant about the need to keep Australian men, particularly those in the most at-risk categories, aware of the existence and implications of prostate cancer. </para><para>In this regard, I specifically refer to paragraph (3) of the member for Robertson's motion, which draws attention to the reported collapse of a proposed national awareness program. There is a very high chance if prostate cancer is detected and treated before it extends beyond the prostate itself that it can be cured. Even if it is not detected early, its development can be restricted by hormone treatment. There is thus every reason and a high level of justification for awareness programs about prostate cancer. All sides of this parliament have been strong supporters of awareness, screening and treatment programs for breast cancer. We should not hesitate to take a similar line with prostate cancer.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

He applied for a refugee visa on 14 March 1996 and then applied for an exercise of ministerial discretion on 29 January 1998. There are strong humanitarian reasons why this visa should be granted, as my constituent believes he was being harassed and targeted by government troops for suspicion of assisting the LTTE and was fearful for his and his family's safety.

Again, there are strong humanitarian reasons why this visa should be granted, as my constituent was fearful for his safety due to his ethnicity and his belief that government troops and police were targeting people who were considered to be sympathetic to the LTTE. His case was supported by his two young sons, who provided affidavits to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. He had arrived in Australia to attend his wife's funeral. In light of recent events surrounding the minister's exercise of his discretionary power under section 417, it remains unclear to me why my constituents were unable to receive a favourable decision.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cancer Council of New South Wales</title><page.no>15575</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>15575</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to draw the attention of the House to another great display of the magnificent community spirit alive in the Sutherland Shire in Sydney. Over the weekend I had the pleasure of attending the launch of the Sutherland Shire's Relay for Life, a 24-hour relay which raised over $75,000 for the Cancer Council of New South Wales. Over 1,000 people participated in the 75 teams and as individual entries. They collectively walked and ran thousands of kilometres around the Sylvania Waters Athletics Track over the 24-hour relay. Through the dedication of these people and the generosity of the local business community and private individuals, over $75,000 was raised for the Cancer Council's research programs, educational initiatives, and patient and family support.

The government name health as a priority issue and yet they reject the $8 billion under the Commonwealth-state health agreement.

As a government, we can point to the upgrading of the Pacific Highway, which I think every Australian would now agree has been a major and worthwhile program. I hear a lot of people saying, `It's great to see major national infrastructure projects going on.' The Pacific Highway project is worth about $3½ billion—almost of the order of the Snowy Mountains scheme.

Having said that, I have to say that I am extraordinarily disappointed that the Scoresby Freeway is now in serious jeopardy. Out of the $750-plus million we have made available in Victoria, there is $425 million for the Scoresby Freeway—but it was to be a freeway, not a tollway. We went as far as to write into a formal agreement with Victoria that it would be a freeway, not a tollway. That was signed without any duress at all by the Victorian Minister for Transport. We want to keep that promise. We have frozen the funding; it is available to be picked up when Victoria agree with the terms of the MOU that we signed with them. The Victorian Labor government does not want us to keep our promise.

The <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Age</inline> reported that, on the basis of the OECD revenue statistics, including social security contributions, Australia is the sixth lowest taxed country in the OECD. In fact, the countries that have lower rates are the United States, Mexico, Korea, Japan and Ireland, marginally below Australia. Above Australia in terms of the tax to GDP ratio, according to the OECD, are countries like New Zealand, Switzerland, Canada, the United Kingdom, Norway, the Netherlands, France, Austria, Belgium, Germany and, of course, all of the Nordic states. According to the OECD, Australia is sixth from the bottom, with some countries which do not have social security systems anything like Australia's, such as Mexico and Korea, the only ones that are below it. That confirms Australia's position as a low tax to GDP country.</para></talk.start><para>After reporting that, the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Age</inline> reported something else even more interesting. It reported Labor's pledge to cut tax and to spend. This apparently was a speech given to the Fabian Society by none other than the member for Fraser. I have heard of Labor's plans to spend more, because Labor claims more should be spent on Medicare, Labor claims more should be spent on health care agreements, Labor claims more should be spent on pharmaceutical benefits and Labor claims more should be spent in relation to higher education. Labor claims more should be spent in relation to practically every area of government activity. What I did not understand was that Labor plans to increase spending in all of those areas by cutting taxes. I thought to myself, `Why haven't we thought of that before? All you have to do to spend more is to cut taxes.' </para><para>So I read very carefully as to how this was all going to be done down at the Fabian Society from the member for Fraser—his first big economic outing on how he is going to spend more by cutting taxes. I thought I would get some idea of the taxes he was going to cut, because we all know he thought the tax cuts in the budget Tuesday a fortnight ago were not large enough. Alas, there was no idea at all about how to cut taxes. There was just a grab bag of promises which are unfunded to spend more and cut less. And, of course, we should not leave the third leg of the trifecta out—the promise we had from the member for Hotham. Remember that, BS? BS: bigger surplus Crean. We tax less, spend more and have bigger surpluses—Labor's plan for the economy.</para><para>I do want to say in defence of the Fabian Society that they did have one person down there who decided that it was time to call Labor's policy for what it was. Dr Keating—not the Keating who was a onetime Treasurer but Dr Michael Keating, former head of the finance department as well as of the Prime Minister's department—slated Labor for criticising Treasurer Peter Costello on the grounds of tax. He said that Labor should instead be considering increasing taxation. He said:</para><quote><para>Taxation can't be divorced from expenditure needs, and expenditure needs are likely to rise in future ...</para></quote><para>Dr Michael Keating knows what everybody in Australia knows—that every time the Labor Party promise to spend more, behind it is a promise of increased taxation.

This suggests that inventories will be substantially contributing to growth in the March quarter, with the national accounts due to be released on Wednesday. In addition, company gross operating profits increased by 1.4 per cent in the March quarter to be 8.6 per cent higher over the year. Company profits were up a very strong 20.7 per cent in the March quarter and are up 44 per cent over the year, which is pretty extraordinary really when you think about the year that the Australian economy has been through in relation to the international downturn, the war in Iraq, the threat of SARS, the increase in oil prices that were brought on by the war and, in addition to that, the drought.</para></talk.start><para>Detracting from the March quarter national accounts, however, will be the rural sector. The impact of the rural sector is still flowing through into national accounts and, as has been pointed out before in this House by the Deputy Prime Minister, the minister for agriculture and others, the drought has not yet ended. The drought will be showing up in relation to the March quarter. It is a once-in-a-century drought; the worst ever recorded, according to Australian meteorological records. The main impact is that farm production in 2002-03 is expected to fall by 27 per cent and to detract one per cent from GDP growth. That is an extraordinary detraction from a once-in-a-century drought which has not yet ended. The fact that the Australian nonfarm economy continues to grow so strongly means that Australia continues to lead the industrialised world, notwithstanding such a significant downturn in relation to drought.</para><para>We hope that the drought will end. It has ended in some parts of Australia but not in all parts. Unless it rains very shortly, winter crops will not be able to be planted and will go through another season without contributing. In terms of farmers, that means that their incomes again will be very subdued and they will be drawing down on the assistance that the government has put in place in relation to drought assistance and farm management deposits.</para><para>The picture we get of the Australian economy again is this. In the midst of an international downturn and a once-in-a-century drought, the Australian economy continues to grow because the nonagricultural product is strong, led by company profits, underpinned by low interest rates and also underpinned by the fact that the new tax system takes taxes on business inputs out of the system and gives them an opportunity to invest and to grow.

Minister, if it is unfair to charge students $135,000 in full fees for a medical degree, why do the proposed unfair changes allow the University of Melbourne to charge even more? If the minister would not pay that much for a degree, aren't full-fee degrees out of the reach of most Australians? </para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>15587</page.no><name role="metadata">Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Dr NELSON</name><name.id>RW5</name.id><electorate>Bradfield</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Education, Science and Training</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question.

I appreciate that she has an ongoing interest in Zimbabwe after she was there for the Zimbabwe elections as an observer. Beginning today the opposition in Zimbabwe is going to conduct a series of what they call `democracy marches'. It is worth noting that, typically, as a government we would not become involved in the political affairs of other countries. But it is entirely understandable that the opposition in Zimbabwe would want to mount protest action against the oppression of the government. There are reports that the Zimbabwe government is determined to `crush these protests', to use their words. There have been reports of armoured vehicles and soldiers moving into the centre of Harare in preparation to do just that. This government would urge the government of Zimbabwe to exercise restraint and allow people to protest peacefully in a democratic society. After all, the government of Zimbabwe says that it is democratic, in which case it should allow the right of peaceful protest. </para></talk.start><para>The situation in Zimbabwe nevertheless continues to deteriorate at every level. In addition, state-sponsored violence, human rights violations, erosions of the rule of law and a general climate of impunity for the regime are features of this crisis. There does not seem to be any short-term prospect of change. It is worth noting that the economy in Zimbabwe is in such a disastrous state that, with an inflation rate of 269 per cent, the Zimbabwe central bank can no longer afford to purchase ink and paper in order to print banknotes. That really is the ultimate definition of the failure of an economy: that they cannot even afford to print banknotes. Zimbabwe was once the bread basket of Africa—or, at least, of southern Africa. Now it can no longer feed its people. The World Food Program estimates that about 7.2 million people in Zimbabwe, which is over half the population, need food aid.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83T</name.id><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Griffith!</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83T</name.id><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Griffith is defying the chair.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name></talker><para>—On 20 May I was in London to participate in a meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, a group of eight foreign ministers from a selection of Commonwealth countries.

While the troika that the Prime Minister presides over is currently responsible for the Commonwealth's response to the issue of Zimbabwe and has suspended Zimbabwe from the councils of the Commonwealth, I did use the opportunity of the CMAG meeting in London to press the other countries participating in that meeting to ensure that the CMAG kept as much pressure on the government of President Robert Mugabe as was possible.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The truth, though, is that for one reason or another there is no consensus in CMAG to maintain pressure on the government of President Mugabe.

I table that paper in the House today because I know that it will be of interest to a number of members of the House who are interested in the issue of Zimbabwe.</para><para>Let me just say in conclusion that the Prime Minister, through the troika, has been responsible for the suspension of Zimbabwe from the councils of the Commonwealth. We will continue as best we can to place pressure on the government of Zimbabwe to engage in dialogue with the Movement for Democratic Change, to uphold international norms of human rights and to start to make some progress in restoring the Zimbabwean economy.

These actions were taken by the Burmese authorities ostensibly in response to incidents that took place on 30 May when there were clashes between Aung San Suu Kyi supporters and pro-government supporters in the northern part of Burma. Aung San Suu Kyi was travelling in that part of the country at the time.

I note that the United Nations Secretary-General's special envoy on Burma, Mr Razali, is due to visit Burma on Friday of this week. I hope that during his visit it will be possible for him to take up with the Burmese government these concerns of the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi.

We very much hope that if Mr Razali continues with his visit to Burma at the end of this week he will be able to have some success in encouraging the Burmese authorities to understand the importance of engaging in serious dialogue about constitutional reform and the liberalisation of governance in Burma, and the upholding of international norms of human rights.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Parramatta Electorate: Program Funding</title><page.no>15592</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>15592</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations representing the Special Minister of State and relates to the activities of a registered organisation under the Commonwealth Electoral Act.

The first point is that members of parliament and ministers are not responsible for the administration of Liberal Party fundraising, and should not be responsible for the administration of Labor Party fundraising—I do not know what the arrangements are on the other side of this chamber. The second point is that, if anything untoward has happened in respect of any fundraising and any disclosure, it will no doubt be looked at by the Australian Electoral Commission, which will take appropriate action. The third point is that it is not unusual at all for political parties to amend their disclosures. In fact, I am advised that the national Australian Labor Party has amended its disclosure for the relevant year twice. I am advised that the Australian Labor Party ACT branch has amended its disclosure twice. I am advised the Australian Labor Party NSW branch has amended its disclosure once. The Northern Territory branch has amended its disclosure once. The South Australian branch has made one amendment to its disclosure. The Queensland branch has amended its disclosure twice. The Victorian branch has amended its disclosure twice.

As the Treasurer mentioned just a few moments ago, the drought in Australia is far from over. There is some welcome rain outside, and in some parts of Australia the wheat planting has been able to commence—particularly in Western Australia but there has also been some quite good plantings in parts of the eastern states—but in other areas there has not yet been adequate rain to enable planting to commence. In other places, the crops that have just come up are already starting to face some stress.</para></talk.start><para>So whilst there has been rain in some places—indeed, in some of the city areas and on the coast, quite generous rain—the reality is that most of the drought stricken areas of Australia are still facing significant difficulties. The Commonwealth is continuing to assist drought stricken farmers. On the latest figures I have received, 14,600 Australian farm families are now receiving income support and 3,480 are receiving interest assistance. The Commonwealth remains committed to helping drought stricken farmers through these difficult times.</para><para>The honourable member asked whether other benefits are being withdrawn. I have already reported to the House on a number of occasions that the Victorian government, as soon as the state election was over, revoked drought assistance in the state of Victoria—a despicable action which demonstrated that Victoria's drought assistance was all about election stunts, not about providing real assistance to farmers.</para><para>I can recall warning, before the New South Wales state election, that a similar thing was likely to happen in New South Wales. I am sorry to report to the House that that indeed is precisely what is happening. Not with any fanfare, but quietly and secretly, the New South Wales government have been delisting areas that were previously eligible to receive drought assistance. On their web site over the last four to six weeks, you see that New South Wales have delisted from areas eligible to receive drought assistance parts of the Tweed-Lismore area, parts of Kempsey, parts of Gloucester, parts of Moree, parts of Tamworth, parts of the Walgett Rural Lands Protection Board and all of the Narrabri, Northern Slopes and Maitland Rural Lands Protection Boards. The farmers in those areas are no longer eligible to receive any assistance from the New South Wales government. </para><para>This was all done quietly on their web site. Indeed, the farmers in Tamworth were reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Daily Leader</inline> on Friday as saying that they were not told about the fact that the drought relief had been axed until three weeks later—when I made it clear in their local media that it had been withdrawn by the New South Wales government. The New South Wales government did not even have the courage to tell them that they had axed their drought relief. This is an area that is receiving exceptional circumstances assistance from the Commonwealth. Indeed, some of the other areas where the New South Wales government have axed their relief are, we are told, going to be the subject of new EC applications. So New South Wales is asking the Commonwealth to declare these areas to be in exceptional circumstances while they are quietly revoking their eligibility for state assistance.</para><para>What a contrast that is with the occasions when the drought assistance was announced. Premier Carr was rushing around New South Wales with plane loads of journalists to make announcement after announcement about drought assistance for the farmers. I am told there were over 50 announcements. Most of them were pretty empty and provided very little assistance, but there he was with all these journalists from outer Sydney and the metropolitan media to announce drought assistance for the farmers. But is Premier Carr travelling around the drought stricken areas of New South Wales to announce he has revoked the assistance?</para><para>The reality is that we are seeing the collapse of the facade of care for drought affected areas. As soon as the state elections were over, the Labor Party were no longer interested in the concerns of drought affected farmers. This is a despicable action by the New South Wales state government—following on the lead of Victoria. They have no concern for farmers. This roll back of drought aid is the only roll-back we have heard from Labor for a long time, and they ought to be ashamed of it.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Visa Approvals</title><page.no>15594</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>15594</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.

I can inform the member for Moore that, under the Court government, there were more than 200,000 Western Australian workplace agreements. These were abolished by the incoming Gallop government and replaced by a form of individual contract subject not only to the no disadvantage test but also to a form of union veto. Since May of last year, there have been 37,000 Australian workplace agreements registered in Western Australia. How many Western Australian individual contracts have been registered? Not 10,000, not 1,000, not even 100—just 12 Western Australian individual contracts have been registered. This flight from the Western Australian system is a vote of confidence in the federal system. The Gallop government set these contracts up to fail, and fail they have.

If they take the rebate off ancillaries, which has been suggested, this will slug Australian families who have private health insurance an extra $230 a year. And if they remove the whole private health insurance rebate, that will mean a tax slug of $750 to Australian families who have such insurance. Just last week, the opposition again suggested slashing the rebate when they asked: </para></talk.start><quote><para>... why does the rebate apply to ancillaries? Could you contemplate a system where the rebate was capped so far as individual payments are concerned and means tested so far as individual payments are concerned?</para></quote><para>This is a statement from the shadow spokesman for health, the member for Perth. So we know what Labor will do; they are considering a range of options, including rolling back the entire private health insurance rebate, capping means testing and taking it off the ancillaries. This means that they should explain to those nine million Australians that going to the dentist, getting new spectacles or having physiotherapy treatment, for example, will be 30 per cent more expensive under the Labor Party. They should explain why those one million people on incomes of less than $20,000 a year are going to be slugged up to $750 in tax increases under the Labor Party should they ever win government. The ALP will not come clean about this but we know that they are a high-taxing party when they are in government.

Two weeks ago I was in Brisbane to release the draft water quality protection plan—a program that seeks to protect the quality of water flowing into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon from the threat of sediments and nutrients. Today I am pleased to announce another major effort by the Howard government to protect the Great Barrier Reef and put it on a sustainable basis for the long term.</para></talk.start><para>This morning I released the draft zoning plan under the representative areas program for the reef, which increases the high protection zones on the reef from some 4.5 per cent of the reef to over 30 per cent. The effect of this plan will be to put the reef on a long-term sustainable basis. It will lead to an increase in the fish in the reef and the size of those fish. It is a plan which has been welcomed up and down the Queensland coast and across Australia.</para><para>The reason why this plan has been so widely welcomed and received is the highly consultative process used by the government to develop the plan. Thus far, there have been something like 1,500 community service announcements on regional television in Queensland and 38,000 hits on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park's web site, leading to some 10,000 submissions being available to help draw up the plan. I am delighted with the response from interest groups in Queensland, particularly from the recreational fishers. The member for Herbert drew my attention to a report in this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Townsville </inline><inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> quoting Mr David Bateman, Chief Executive Officer of Sunfish Queensland—the major representative organisation for recreational fishers—who said:</para><quote><para>What they've come up with, with the increased yellow zones throughout the marine park, will give our members the space to go fishing, and we consider it very reasonable.

In particular, of course, the plan has been welcomed by the billion-dollar tourist industry on the Great Barrier Reef. The tourist industry attracts people to the reef through its thriving biodiversity—the fish populations, the coral, the dugong and the other animals that frequent the reef. This plan will make sure that that tourist industry has a secure basis to plan for the future.

The world in which we now live is a very different world from what it was 50 years ago. It would be unthinkable, for example, that 50 years ago there would have been serious debate in either Australia or the United Kingdom regarding the place of the monarchy in our society.  </para><para>The world has changed a great deal over the last 50 years. It is, therefore, all the more remarkable that over that period of time the Queen has displayed a remarkable consistency of commitment to her duties and her responsibilities, has displayed an amazing commitment to duty and has acquired an experience and understanding of world affairs that would, I believe, enable her to equal or indeed better the experience and understanding of world affairs of most of the people who have exercised political office and power in different countries over that period of time.</para><para>In 12 years, the Queen, if she is still on the throne, will be the longest serving monarch in British history. She now is one of the longest serving monarchs and, given the extraordinary longevity of her mother, it must be a reasonable expectation that she will in fact turn out to be the longest serving monarch in British history. It is, of course, remarkable to reflect that, when she became Queen, Winston Churchill was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Robert Menzies was Prime Minister of Australia. Over that period of time, she has been sovereign to 10 British prime ministers and the same number of Australian prime ministers. </para><para>She has displayed a remarkable interest in the affairs of the multiracial Commonwealth. Other members may well have heard a very interesting program on Radio National this morning which involved a discussion with, amongst other people, that very famous and I think very talented British author, William Shawcross, who had some very interesting things to say about the Middle East roadmap being a road through Baghdad—but I will not allow that to intrude any more. He made some very interesting observations. One of the more interesting observations was the very relevant one that, in the time that she has been on the throne, the Queen has displayed a very strong, consistent and genuine interest in the multiracial Commonwealth and has displayed a commitment to achieving solutions to Commonwealth problems which has been at all times quite persistent and quite determined.</para><para>It is fair to say that, over the period that she has been on the throne, the attitudes of the public towards the monarchy have changed. There is legitimate debate within Australia about the role of the monarchy in our community, and that is part of the democratic process. In 1953, when she was crowned, it would have been unthinkable that the party I now lead, the Liberal Party of Australia, would have allowed its members a free vote on the issue of whether or not this country should become a republic. It is an indication of how things have changed, but I think it is also an indication of how one thing has remained the same—that, despite the different views within the community and within political parties regarding the role of the monarchy, the respect and regard for the Queen herself as an individual and her personal popularity and the personal belief of so many people not only here but in other parts of the world that she is in every sense a talented and dedicated person who has a very strong sense of duty and a very strong commitment have remained very consistent and strong.</para><para>I am reminded—if I can digress for one moment on the attitude of people holding different views on the role of the monarchy—of a report I read some years ago of one of the early meetings of the Republican Movement in Sydney, where it seemed to have some of its origins. This meeting was attended by the former Premier of New South Wales, Neville Wran, who was a very strong republican and a person whose political views I did not share but whose political skills I quite respected. As the time over lunch wore on and as discussion turned to how the republic would be brought about, he warned all those gathered around him that one of the things that would make the battle difficult, no matter what people's views were on the institution, was the personal regard in which the monarch was held by different generations of Australians. I think that is but one of many indications of the extraordinary regard and affection in which Her Majesty the Queen is held by people, whatever their political views and constitutional views may be. </para><para>Mr Speaker, as you reflect upon the experience that the Queen has had in her time as monarch and you reflect upon the history of the British monarchy, you are perhaps reminded—in touching on some debate we have had in Australia in recent weeks—that the institutions are remarkably resilient and remarkably durable. I think many people will know from their reading of history—not many in this room from their own personal experience—that at the time many people regarded the abdication crisis in 1936 as being likely to herald the end of the monarchy. In reality, the two monarchs that followed the abdication of Edward VIII have proved to be two of the most popular, two of the most dutiful and two of the most well-regarded monarchs that have sat on the throne in the history of that institution—which does remain the second oldest institution in Western civilisation after the see of Rome.</para><para>The links between Australia and Her Majesty the Queen are, of course, very extensive. She has visited this country on 13 occasions and she has always been accorded a warm and, I think, very genuine welcome. Although, inevitably, with the passage of time and the more blasé attitudes towards institutions, including the monarchy, within our community, the reaction of people has been different, it has, nonetheless, been the case that, on every occasion, she has been seen in this community as being a person who is very genuinely interested in and committed to and who has very great affection for the people of Australia. In any conversations that one has with her, she has a remarkable interest in and knowledge of affairs in this country.</para><para>I think she has been a person who has carried out her duties with remarkable dedication, great good humour and consistent commitment to duty. Through all the changes and through all the challenges of the last 50 years, she has continued to impress the people of the United Kingdom and the people of this country with her commitment and her dedication to duty.

Whilst it is no surprise that I and many on this side of the House are republicans and believe that we should have an Australian as our head of state, that does not diminish our respect for Her Majesty the Queen. I have had the opportunity to meet her on many occasions over a long period, and hers have been 50 years of remarkable success for the institution and for her personally. She has ruled at a time of enormous social and political change, but she has ensured that the royal family has evolved with the times. She has kept it modern and relevant, while maintaining the traditions which underpin its legitimacy and popular support. </para></talk.start><para>I pay tribute to her great interest in the Commonwealth and, in particular, the significant transition of an equal body of nations into a group of nations that pursue important political, developmental and environmental concerns. She has fulfilled her constitutional responsibilities as Queen of Australia with great aplomb and has always fully and properly respected Australia's independent and democratic institutions. She has taken an active interest in the welfare of Australia's citizens, and she is currently the patron of up to 20 community organisations dedicated to serving the Australian community.</para><para>I think it is also fair to say, as the Prime Minister has remarked, that the period over which the Queen has reigned has seen significant changes in the way in which Australians respond to her, although they respond no less affectionately. I agree with the comments the Prime Minister attributed to Neville Wran; I think that the circumstances of her personal involvement have seen the affection not just for her but for the monarchy itself sustained a lot longer in this country across a broader section of the community than might otherwise have been the case. The early days of her reign were marked by huge popular enthusiasm, as we are all reminded when we see those early visits. And, even though it is true that the crowds in recent years have not been as great in number and that Australians' attitudes to the concept of the monarchy have changed, the Queen herself is still held in the highest regard by the overwhelming majority of Australians.</para><para>Enthusiasm towards a young Queen has matured, I believe, into a quieter respect and admiration for her strong sense of duty and her commitment to the role. It also manifests itself in a genuine concern for Her Majesty's personal welfare. I think Australians of all political persuasions felt for the Queen last year at the passing of the Queen Mother and of Princess Margaret. The great success of the Golden Jubilee year shows that the Queen remains a most popular and respected head of the royal family. On behalf of the opposition, I join with the government in supporting this motion. We wish the Queen many years of continuing happiness.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—This is a motion of celebration endorsed by both sides of the House.

and</para><para>(8)	affirms its commitment to a tax system that is progressive.</para><para>I have moved this motion in order to bring closer attention to the inequities and entrenched poverty trap many people in Australia are confronting today. As a relatively wealthy country we should be able to do more for our less well off, but we are failing them. With increasing pressure upon family budgets in areas such as health, education and children's services, the need to make our social welfare and tax systems fairer is a critical development required.</para><para>It is often argued, particularly by those on the other side of the House, that Australia's top marginal tax rate of 48.5 per cent, including the Medicare levy, is too high and comes into effect at too low a level. It is said to act as a disincentive to work, reducing efficiency and productivity and encouraging tax avoidance. Indeed, the Treasurer only four years ago in this House mocked Labor, asking: </para><quote><para>Why would you support a system ... whereby people that are just getting past average earnings, maybe doing a bit of overtime, have to pay $1 in $2 in tax?</para></quote><para>The reality is that the combination of the social security system and the taxation system delivers effective marginal tax rates far higher than those the Treasurer was referring to when he made those comments.</para><para>The awful truth of it is that the highest marginal rates are being paid by those on low and middle incomes—those least able to afford it—not by those receiving high incomes. A person trying to move from unemployment into the work force can face an effective marginal tax rate of up to 87 per cent, and higher under some circumstances. An adult claiming Newstart who earns some extra money currently pays 17 per cent tax on that income. On top of that tax, if he or she earns more than $62 in a fortnight then every dollar earned above that amount reduces the Newstart payment by 50c. That is an effective rate of 67 per cent. If they earn $142 per fortnight—$71 per week—Newstart is reduced by 70c for every dollar, producing an effective marginal tax rate of 87 per cent.</para><para>If the Treasurer were right, and 48.5 per cent is a disincentive for those in higher paying jobs, how much harder must it be for someone who is unemployed, most often earning an hourly rate considerably lower than average, and facing a tax rate higher than those on 48.5 per cent? While there are a lot of good non-financial reasons for an individual to take up work that is offered, you can understand how little incentive there would be for a person taking home, say, $2.60 per hour—which is 13 per cent of the amount paid to a person receiving $12 per hour. Perhaps we should ask the Treasurer why he supports a system where people who are earning less than the average income lose a lot more than 50c in every dollar they receive. This is not a new problem. It has been a problem ever since social security payments were introduced, but the problem was once confined to a small, albeit significantly disadvantaged, sector of society.</para><para>As the final report of the McClure committee discusses in the section on incentives and financial assistance, with the introduction of the flawed family tax benefit, the problem has been extended so that it affects nearly twice the number of people than previously. And, in conjunction with the introduction of a parental income test for youth allowance, the ludicrous situation has been created where a family could be worse off if their paid income increases. So much has already been said about the numerous other problems with the family tax benefit—and I am sure more will be said this afternoon in debating this motion—particularly about the propensity of the system to drive ordinary families into debt, that you would think the government would have got the message and reformed this a long time ago. Instead, the government have ensured that families on middle incomes, between about $30,000 and $50,000, are faced with a tax rate of 30 per cent, plus a 30 per cent clawback of family tax benefit entitlement on extra income earned. This is an effective marginal tax rate of 60 per cent, and it is paid by ordinary families on ordinary incomes.</para><para>That government is not concerned about the interests of the poor and disadvantaged, and it does not really surprise me, but I would have hoped that we might at least see some action from it on looking after middle Australia—the area it professes to represent. The youth allowance system is the worst of the lot. The parental income test for youth allowance—whereby the allowance is reduced by $1 in every $4 over the threshold—combined with the personal income test, family tax benefit and income tax, can deliver an effective marginal tax rate exceeding 100 per cent. As the McClure report points out on page 30: </para><quote><para>... certain additional benefits are lost when a dependent child moves onto YA, notably FTB and rent allowance. Furthermore, the lower threshold for the YA parental means test results in a “sudden death” loss of all of the YA when the parents move off allowance.</para></quote><para>Let me give you just one story about how the social security, family tax and income tax systems have combined to discourage a constituent in my electorate from continuing employment and improving his lot. Mr C is a single father residing in Sunbury, and he has five children. He receives the disability support pension and family tax benefit A and B. It is a tough enough job bringing up five kids and overcoming a serious injury without having to live off a limited income; nevertheless, Mr C survives and by all accounts is a loving and caring father. </para><para>Recently, Mr C has been offered work driving a school bus. It is not too demanding on him physically and it is great for his self-esteem after many years out of the work force. Although it would put him under considerable time constraints, given the requirements of fathering five kids, Mr C hoped that the money he would earn would relieve some of the terrible financial pressure he and his children are under. It could mean new school shoes for the youngest boy, who has always had to put up with hand-me-downs from his older siblings, or it could mean he would be able to afford to pay for swimming lessons for his oldest daughter. But he got caught in the family tax benefit-disability support pension-youth allowance poverty trap.</para><para>Even though the hourly rate that he earns is quite reasonable, the end result of Mr C working full time is a net gain of about $90 a week. Mr C is prepared to do that—he wants to work and he needs the money—but he has found that, in earning that money, his access to other benefits such as the health care card has been reduced. He also has other costs as a result of working—such as increased transport and child-care costs—that further erode any benefit he might get from employment. We want Mr C to take employment opportunities that are presented, but the system we have at the moment not only does not help but also actively discourages people to find employment. </para><para>I would like this House to affirm its support for a progressive tax system. A progressive tax system is supposed to mean, among other things, that people on higher incomes pay higher tax rates. As I have shown, there are certain elements of the Australian tax system that are not progressive. The government may claim that it supports a progressive tax system, but its policies continually work to undermine this principle. The government, of course, introduced the goods and services tax—the singularly most regressive tax ever imposed upon the Australian community by an Australian government—and now it has overseen the creation of a family tax benefit scheme that penalises ordinary families trying to get ahead.</para><para>In January this year, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations addressed that bastion of the less well off in our society, the Young Liberals. While he acknowledged the problem of poverty traps, he had no answers. In his speech entitled `Reform with a social conscience'—which, given the speaker and his fondness for the term `job snobs', should be renamed `Reform with a guilty conscience'—he recognised systemic failure without attributing any fault to the Howard government. Nor did he mention the adverse effects of GST upon those on low to middle incomes. </para><para>In Sunday's <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>, economics editor Tim Colebatch, in comparing OECD countries' tax and welfare systems, indicated that working single parents are `locked in the most severe poverty trap of any Western country'. He went on: `The trap is that if he/she earns another dollar, 70c of it would go to the government.' This is a disgrace and it should be changed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Is the motion seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMP</name.id><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Grierson</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>15610</page.no><name role="metadata">Ley, Sussan, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LEY</name><name.id>00AMN</name.id><electorate>Farrer</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It gives me great pleasure to speak to this private member's motion moved by the member for Burke, who has presented a wide-ranging and somewhat confusing motion which relates generally to the effective tax rates that a person receiving allowances and benefits may face under various circumstances. During his speech, the member said that this government is not concerned about the poor and disadvantaged. I remind members opposite about some of the poorest and most disadvantaged Australians, our Indigenous Australians, and comments made about their circumstances by Noel Pearson, who says that the worst thing that you can do is to consign this group of people to a place at the bottom of the welfare system. He talks about demanding their place in the real economy, not just the passive economy. This highlights an important fact, which is that welfare is not a good place to be. Indigenous Australians and other poorer people are not in that position because of effective tax rates. They are in that position for all sorts of reasons that need to be unravelled and examined by both sides of this House, but it is certainly not because of effective tax rates, which is the narrow and somewhat prescriptive view that has been taken today.</para></talk.start><para>It is important to recognise at the outset that this government is committed to providing a range of incentives to help unemployed people find work and achieve self-sufficiency. With this in mind, many of those receiving benefits are in fact in a transition period in their lives—as we would recognise when you receive Newstart benefits—where they are looking for work and are receiving an allowance to cover this. But this is a temporary situation—at least, it is with this government, which has created over one million new jobs since coming to office. Under Labor it might not be so temporary. We anticipate that not everyone on Newstart will always be on Newstart, so the effective tax rates that our attention has been drawn to are not going to apply on and on. This government believes that people are generally better off working than receiving income support, because paid work increases self-reliance, makes people feel part of the society in which they live, prevents that feeling of isolation, and promotes families and communities that thrive.</para><para>We accept that there are taxation disincentives, but they are not necessarily the reasons that people do not continue to seek work. We recognise that there are some situations where the reward that you get for the work you do can act as a disincentive and, amongst other things, encourage the cash economy. This government has acknowledged this in the consultation paper <inline font-style="italic">Building a simpler system to help jobless families and individuals</inline>. Consultation around the paper, which is under way at present, will guide the government's thinking about how we reform income support for working age people. The system in place is good, and we are working to make it better. I do not believe that we need to apologise for it. One of the features of any tax system is that the simpler it is, the less fair it becomes. So the challenge is always to balance equity with simplicity and efficiency. People are critical of the family tax benefit, but we are providing support where support is most needed. By being as equitable as we can, complexities obviously creep in. </para><para>We have been acting to improve incentives for unemployed people. In the Australians Working Together package, the working credit measure makes irregular part-time or casual work more attractive because it raises the $62 threshold where payments to workers start reducing. It should also be noted that the majority of Australian families have better work incentives as a result of the new tax system introduced by this government. Income testing arrangements allow people to earn income without automatically losing their full allowance or other assistance. Some income testing is required to ensure that the social security system remains both targeted at those most in need and financially sustainable. I point out that the combined effects of the income support reduction, income tax and the income support rebate result in some variation in the effective marginal tax rate across the income ranges that have been identified.</para><para>Clearly, the welfare system that we have is oriented more towards paying people benefits than getting them into work, and we must accept a suitable safety net in this country. We will not reduce benefits, but nor should we increase wages at entry levels. We must look at other measures. I believe one important and very successful measure is Work for the Dole. Under this program, long-term Newstart beneficiaries are less likely to be trapped in a welfare system. The cruellest thing you can do is run a system that sucks the unemployed into welfare and leaves them on welfare forever, contributing to that dire social ill, intergenerational unemployment—and I refer to those comments by Noel Pearson mentioned earlier. This is about reducing unemployment. One narrow perspective is effective tax rates, but to reduce unemployment you need three things. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>15611</page.no><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GRIERSON</name><name.id>00AMP</name.id><electorate>Newcastle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the private member's motion put forward to the House by the member for Burke. It asks us to recognise that our social security system currently combines with the taxation system to deliver to this nation's lowest earners effective marginal tax rates that are higher than those any other income group is asked to pay. The motion also calls on the House to affirm its commitment to a taxation system that is progressive. </para></talk.start><para>The current system of taxing any income earned by those entitled to certain social security benefits is punitive and, as such, acts as a disincentive to gain paid employment or increase salary levels. Under this government, the system has an in-built trap that claws back moneys through a taxation penalty system as soon as someone receiving benefits or entitlements improves their work or financial situation. So, for those on our lowest incomes, there is instantly a taxation penalty for any financial gain or employment success. Low-income earning families are well and truly trapped, discouraged from getting ahead but left struggling to make ends meet on benefits that could never be regarded as generous. This reality was acknowledged by the OECD report card on the Australian economy, which clearly stated that in Australia:</para><quote><para>... marginal effective tax rates remain high for many low-income earners, which tends to create poverty traps.</para></quote><para>Even the OECD knows that there are different ways to measure the health of a nation's economy. A nation's bottom line has a lot to do with the degree of opportunity that exists for each individual to create some personal wealth. With 2½ million Australians living in poverty, this government continues to actively discourage wealth creation by low- and middle-income families through its social security system and the marginal taxation rates that apply. </para><para>But the tax trap also applies to middle-income Australians who are raising a family or supporting students. One example that was given by the member for Burke is the family tax benefit, which is available to middle-income earners who earn between $30,000 and $50,000. Over 10,000 people in my electorate receive family tax benefits and they are faced with this disincentive to increase their income. Much attention has been given in previous debates to the FTB's flawed income estimation system that delivers a debt to families that earn more than they anticipated. Most Australians understand how their taxes are collected, but they do not expect—as was the case with one of my constituents in Newcastle faced with a family benefit tax debt—to have a financial institution give, at the demand of Centrelink, information about and withdraw money from their personal bank account, an account separate to the one normally accessed by Centrelink, even though the constituent was still within the negotiating period regarding payment arrangements for that FTB debt. This government apparently has no regard for privacy laws when it comes to collecting the debt fallout from its flawed family tax benefit system.</para><para>We have also heard of the ludicrous situation where Youth Allowance recipients and their families can receive a marginal tax rate exceeding 100 per cent. When families are investing in their children's future and in the future of this nation, they should be rewarded and not punished. Under this government's taxation system, the working single parent can pay 70c tax on every single additional dollar earned. However, the reality for single income families is that benefit entitlements do not go far enough in meeting the costs of raising children. Such costs include visits to the doctor, where most families need to find almost $40 for every visit; over $20 for every prescription; up to $10 for any performance at a school; and sometimes hundreds of dollars for children to participate in educational excursions. These are not luxury items; they are just the costs that families face every day.</para><para>You do not have to be an economist to work out that under the current system it just would not pay to find extra work. I am not an economist—and I do not think Noel Pearson is—but I am a former educator and I know quite a lot about behaviour theory. Research shows that time after time the most effective behaviour modification systems are those that are built on incentive and reward, those that empower the individual. Perhaps this is what Mr Pearson means when he talks about a welfare system that gives power to individuals to exercise some control over their own destiny. It is time that this government learned a little more about real human behaviour and reformed this inequitable taxation system—a system that sees the rich getting richer, the middle getting squeezed and the poor being kept in their rightful place, according to the taxation hierarchy.</para><para>This motion calls on the government to reform the tax, welfare and family payments systems to avoid poverty traps and disincentives to work. It also calls on the House to affirm its commitment to a taxation system that is progressive. The existing progressive taxation system has generally been accepted by the Australian public and it is seen as a fair way of calculating what we should contribute to the social economy of the nation. Most Australians do not mind paying their tax if they are receiving services. Most Australians do not mind providing a safety net for the aged, the chronically ill, youth establishing their education for their future careers and those who live amongst us who have fallen on hard times.

Since coming to office, this coalition has been absolutely committed to replacing what basically is a culture of welfare dependency with a spirit of self-reliance and to empowering people to achieve, as opposed to lowering them to the lowest common denominator. Labor policy, in comparison to that of the coalition, drags Australians down to the lowest common denominator, with some sort of misplaced notion of social justice, when all Australians really want is a fair go and an opportunity. This government offers opportunities, whereas the members opposite promote welfare dependency.</para></talk.start><para>Those opposite are in a state of disarray as their traditional base deserts them. The old hackneyed Labor dogma is really wearing thin out there. As I travelled here early this morning, I listened to the <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> radio program on which there was discussion of the fact that the grim reaper, Mr Roozendaal, was coming to bring a message. I understand that the members for Banks, Greenway and Lowe will be very interested in that message. I do not know the contents of the message that Mr Roozendaal has to bring, but basically the message is that the members opposite are out of touch. We talk about poverty traps, but really the best way to alleviate a poverty trap is to reduce unemployment. Labor have form on unemployment, with over one million people being unemployed at the time of Labor being in office. There is no social justice in unemployment and there is no self-esteem in unemployment, and Labor has great form there. When the member for Hotham was minister for employment, he scored pretty well on the unemployment scales—he scored a 10.3 per cent unemployment rate. He certainly was not the king of unemployment. The king of unemployment title went to the member for Brand, with a 10.9 per cent rate of unemployment. </para><para>The fact is that jobs build self-esteem, jobs empower and jobs are the way to create a better way of life and a higher living standard. This government has created over one million jobs. That is the best way out of a poverty trap, to get people back to work and to raise their self-esteem. In my electorate there is an organisation called the Men's Shed. The Men's Shed caters for men who are down on their luck and suffering the hardships of unemployment. Part of the role of that shed is to bring men together in allowing them to try and rebuild their self-esteem. That is what this government is about—providing jobs, building self-esteem and building self-reliance.</para><para>The members opposite knocked Work for the Dole. The old Labor dogma says that it is slave labour et cetera. But the Australian people love Work for the Dole. The participants love Work for the Dole. They enjoy contributing to the community. They enjoy the opportunity to learn new skills. Best of all, they are 76 per cent more likely to get a job and get out of the poverty trap by contributing to that scheme. </para><para>The motion also refers to the Youth Allowance. Youth unemployment under Labor peaked at 34½ per cent. That is hardly showing concern for youth. That unemployment rate has been halved under this government. Interest rates have also been mentioned. One of the major elements in the wellbeing of families is a stable economic environment. Under previous Labor governments we had the recession we had to have, which harmed a lot of families. We also had an interest rate of 17.1 per cent. What does that mean? On a mortgage of $100,000, the saving incurred by an average family—the saving out of their pocket—is $200 a week. Under Labor it was an interest amount of $327 a week; under the coalition it is $106. </para><para>Why were interest rates so high? Because members opposite could not balance the books. They were busy out there in the market; they were selling the farm, selling off our assets and, at the same time, competing in the money markets for loan funds because they could not run a balanced budget. The only response that members opposite have to any situation is increased government spending and increased welfare. This government empowers families and builds a stronger Australian community; it is committed to a balanced budget and good economic management. Members opposite are purely interested in dragging people down and committing them to welfare outcomes. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>15614</page.no><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name><name.id>849</name.id><electorate>Braddon</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I believe it is a fact that Australia's top marginal tax rate of 48.5 per cent, including the Medicare levy, is too high and that it comes into effect at too low a level.

I said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>According to a recent KPMG report, Australia is the sixth highest taxing nation, ahead of its major competitors, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong. Significantly, in terms of personal tax, Australia is also the fourth highest taxing nation in the developed world. According to the KPMG report, Australians now pay as much income tax as they did before the GST was introduced. This includes the much vaunted and self-promoted tax cuts promised by Prime Minister Howard. Contrary to comments made at the time, it appears these tax cuts were no more than compensatory carrots.</para></quote><para>My colleague the member for Burke has clearly demonstrated that there is much more to the taxation story than this general overview. Clearly, the Australian taxation system is still regressive. The member for Burke has demonstrated that the further one is down the income scale, the greater the comparative and relative tax burden can be. The member for Burke is to be commended for his work in exposing what is a reality for thousands of Australian families. As the member for Burke has demonstrated, the reality is that the combination of the social security system and the taxation system delivers effective marginal tax rates higher than those required of, and paid by, the more income wealthy. Low- and middle-income people are the people least able to afford these higher marginal tax rates. In my speech of 5 March I specifically targeted the issue of high taxation rates in this country. I said:</para><quote><para>... the twin problems of a comparatively low-income threshold to enter the highest tax rate and—</para></quote><para>the insidious, all-pervading—</para><quote><para>bracket creep are acting as disincentives for working additional hours.</para></quote><para>I also pointed out that Brian Toohey, in his major study of the taxation system in Australia and as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on 2 February 2003, concluded that, even on raw numbers, Australia's top marginal rate was on the high side. In the same article, he asserted: </para><quote><para>The real sting is that it cuts in so far down the income scale, scooping up another 270,000 taxpayers since July 2000.</para></quote><para>He went on to substantiate that in more detail. My speech of 5 March continued:</para><quote><para>More significantly and compounding this issue—</para></quote><para>the one Mr Toohey reinforced—</para><quote><para>is the fact that lower income families face effective or marginal tax rates that are almost double those for the highest earners. Whilst there is a case to reduce the 47 per cent tax rate, there is a more pressing need to tackle the 90 per cent effective marginal tax rates for low- and middle-income families throughout Australia.</para></quote><para>My colleague the member for Burke's motion clearly demonstrates that. It moves that the House:</para><quote><para>(7) calls on the Government to reform the tax, welfare and family payment systems to avoid the development of poverty traps and disincentives to work; and</para><para>(8) affirms its commitment to a tax system that is progressive.</para></quote><para>We all know about the family tax grab and the problems associated with the administration of that. Nobody in this House could deny that. In my speech of 5 May, I said:</para><quote><para>The Labor Party believes that tax credits are the best way to deliver tax assistance to middle- and low-income families and to assist in the transition from welfare to work.

But, unfortunately, those people involved with welfare and welfare organisations supported Labor's tax credits and said that they wanted the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to look positively at tax credits and the support that Minister Abbott has given to Labor's tax credit.

I know that if we had had more time the members for Casey and La Trobe would also have contributed. All of us have for a number of years dedicated ourselves to pursuing the matter of a toll-free Scoresby Freeway running from Ringwood in the north to Frankston in the south. For over seven years we have spoken with one voice on this issue on behalf of the people of the eastern and south-eastern suburbs. We also welcome the maiden contribution on Scoresby by the members for Chisholm and Isaacs. As the federal ALP contemplates its leadership, it might have been more appropriate for the member for Hotham to lead on this issue and pressure his counterparts in Victoria to honour their promise. After all, the promised tollway goes through his electorate.</para><para>It is unfortunate that we are brought to a position where such a motion is necessary. Last year on 24 September the Victorian Premier, Steve Bracks, on 3AW said:</para><quote><para>We're not going to build projects with tolls, that's our policy, it has been our policy, no tolls on the Scoresby or Eastern freeways, no shadow tolls—that's our policy position.</para></quote><para>All of us, as we sat in our cars along Springvale Road, Whitehorse Road or Burwood Highway would have felt a great deal of relief and comfort in hearing the Premier make such an unequivocal statement.</para><para>This commitment was echoed throughout the following state election campaign by the Bracks, Batchelor and Brumby cabal. The voters in the east can still clearly recall Bracks' co-conspirators—the newly elected state ALP members—supporting it with their statements, their handshakes and their grins. They can still recall the ALP electoratewide mail-out saying that the only threat to a toll-free road was the state National Party. `Bracks will build it, build it on time and build it without tolls' was the great claim. I am afraid to say that the Bracks ALP government do not know how to deliver any infrastructure project on time, on budget or in full. But they do know how to deflect attention away from their incompetence and how to shift the blame to other parties, making excuses such as, `We can't deliver Scoresby because of Kennett's public transport contractual arrangements,' `We can't deliver it because of the high cost of the Eastern Freeway extension tunnels,' and `We can't deliver it because of Canberra.' It is always someone else's fault. Well, I say to Bracks, Batchelor and Brumby: if you cannot deliver infrastructure projects on time, in full and on budget, then give the game away. Moreover, I call on Batchelor, if he cannot deliver a toll-free Scoresby as promised, to hand over the keys to the VicRoads bulldozers, earthmovers and graders to a government that can deliver. </para><para>The Bracks betrayal was made on 14 April 2003. The resulting response from the local community has been like no other. Over the past month and a half, my electorate office—and I know also the electorate offices of my colleagues, the members for Aston and Dunkley—has been inundated with responses. Thousands of surveys have been returned to my office. Furthermore, signature after signature continues to be received via petitions. Yet Bracks and Batchelor believe the hard yards have been done and tolls are inevitable.</para><para>It is incumbent on me to report to the House the comments from thousands of angry constituents in Deakin. The local paper has done its own survey and has found over 87 per cent of the public are angry over the betrayal by Bracks and his team of local ALP accomplices, headed by Tony Robinson, Dympna Beard, Peter Lockwood and Carolyn Hirsh. Since the decision was made the usually outspoken member for Mitcham, Tony Robinson, has gone to water on the issue. He cannot be found; Tony is missing in action. Yet he owes his very existence to a `no tolls on the Eastern Freeway' campaign going back to 1999.</para><para>We have news for the meek ALP local members. In my office alone we have received over 2,600 pieces of correspondence and over 2,000 signatures on a petition demanding that Bracks honour his agreement with the people of the east. There is no greater issue on the lips of those in the east and south-east of Melbourne than the broken promise of tolls. Scoresby and roads remain four of the top 10 issues in my constituency. Bracks and Batchelor now want us, the federal members and the federal government, to support their betrayal by also breaking our promise. Yesterday, Peter Batchelor, after the launch of the `Scoresby no tolls' bumper stickers by my colleague the member for Aston, called our campaign `grubby local politics'. Asking us to break our promise, Mr Batchelor, is grubby local politics. We are not going to absolve your lack of morality in failing to honour the contract and your promises by doing the same thing.</para><para>And Batchelor is not alone in his deflective attempts. As reported in Fairfax's <inline font-style="italic">Maroondah</inline><inline font-style="italic">Journal</inline> on 20 May, John Brumby told a business breakfast:</para><quote><para>There is no government in Australia that can fund a project with that type of budget. There just isn't!</para></quote><para>Why didn't he tell the public that prior to the election? It really does make a mockery of using the public transport contractual arrangements as an excuse.</para><para>As for state Labor member for Silvan Province, Carolyn Hirsh, describing the federal government's call for the agreement to be honoured as `political blackmail' in the <inline font-style="italic">Maroondah</inline><inline font-style="italic">Leader</inline> on 20 May 2003, I find it absolutely naive and offensive of Ms Hirsh to make such a claim. She along with her colleagues sold out the people of the east. To hold a government to its promise is not blackmail, Ms Hirsh; it is called making you and your government accountable. In calling for our meek acceptance, I fear the Victorian government, aided and abetted by its federal members up here in Canberra from the eastern suburbs, are missing the point. This matter is not debatable. An agreement was struck between the federal and Victorian governments in October 2001. No amount of heavy-handed tactics can stem the rage about that broken agreement.</para><para>Even as recently as last week, Peter Batchelor, the Minister for Transport, had a series of meetings with local councils, pressuring them to desist in their opposition. He visited four councils—Maroondah, Yarra Ranges, Knox and Frankston—to read them the riot act. `Come aboard or we'll play hard ball on future funding,' was the implied threat from Batchelor. No wonder councils such as Whitehorse Council have been scared off, fearing a possible loss of road funding. </para><para>The MOU clearly outlined that the road running from Ringwood to Frankston would not be tolled. The Commonwealth has advanced funds and made the forward estimate for the allocation of its $445 million share of the cost of the project. In anticipation, the Commonwealth forwarded close to $25.3 million for the environmental preliminary studies to be carried out along the site. I understand a further $63 million has been allocated in this year's budget. I congratulate the federal government for its consistent support of this project and note that the Treasurer, Peter Costello, has once again allocated funds in the forward estimates. This is leadership from the Liberal federal members of parliament for Victoria. We have not seen that same level of leadership from those members from the ALP who are affected by this freeway.</para><para>In contrast to this solid commitment by the federal government, I well remember the flag-waving publicity stunt by Peter Batchelor at the start of the geotechnical bore drilling in Ringwood just prior to the election. On the site, I confronted him on the state's financing arrangements. He reassured me in the presence of other witnesses that a report would be due soon and would not include tolls as an option. `Slippery Pete' is how we know him out in the east. All I can say to him is, `You poked the people of the east in the eye over the Nunawading by-election scandal and you've come back for a second poke. There won't be a third.' In fact, I have some gratuitous advice for local state ALP members: if you want a chance of holding your seats next time round, don't invite Batchelor to your electorates in the eastern suburbs.</para><para>The Commonwealth has an agreement. More than that, it signed a contract with the state. In years gone by, a mere gentleman's handshake stood in the place of a signed legal agreement. These days we reinforce the gesture with documents, memorandums of understanding and the like. But to Bracks, Batchelor and company, this was still not enough. They have shown their contempt not only to the federal government but to the motorists and public of the eastern suburbs. As simple as it sounds, as in any other commercial context the Commonwealth is legally empowered to enforce the conditions of the contract. As a leader of the alternative government and as a member for an electorate affected by the tollway, the member for Hotham owes it to the Australian public to make sure that those sorts of contracts between federal and state governments are honoured. He owes it to his constituents to stand up and insist that Bracks honour the contracts with us.</para><para>For Steve Bracks and Peter Batchelor to be talking about the hard decisions is an absolute joke. If I can paraphrase another federal ALP leader: this is a toll we had to have. But we will not be laughing on the night of Tuesday, 10 June. On that night a second public meeting has been organised to follow the one that was organised by the member for Aston. I have invited the state Labor MPs to come along to the Karralyka Centre in Ringwood to justify their about-face and explain why they sold out their constituents. Honour is an important element in public life. The decisions we make should reflect our character. We want a toll-free road. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Is the motion seconded? </para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Billson</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>15619</page.no><name role="metadata">Corcoran, Ann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms CORCORAN</name><name.id>009CW</name.id><electorate>Isaacs</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Let us get a few facts about this issue on the table. The vast majority of people and businesses in the south-east of Melbourne want the Scoresby Freeway, or the Mitcham-Frankston freeway, built. The cost of this huge project will be about $1.8 billion. The federal government has committed to $445 million—less than a quarter of the project's cost. The state government has committed the balance of $1.4 billion.</para></talk.start><para>A little while ago the Victorian government was faced with a difficult choice. The budget situation had changed dramatically from the position the government was in when it committed itself to the $1.4 billion for the Mitcham-Frankston freeway. A large part of the change in circumstances was due to the sudden withdrawal of National Express from the public transport service. The Victorian government was forced to suddenly find $1 billion to keep the public transport system operating. The Victorian government's choice was between continuing its commitment to the Mitcham-Frankston freeway and reducing services in other areas, changing the way it funded the freeway or not proceeding with the freeway at all.</para><para>Faced with this awful situation the government took the best decision it could. It told the Victorian community what had happened and apologised for not being able to meet the freeway commitment. The Victorian government recognised several things in the process. It recognised that the people and businesses in the south-east of Melbourne wanted the freeway. It recognised that local governments all along the route—Frankston, Kingston, Greater Dandenong, Casey, Monash and Whitehorse—have all said that the freeway is needed and needed now. It recognised that reducing other services was not on—that schools and hospitals, for example, are critical to the wellbeing of people and not to be toyed with. It made the very sensible judgement that tolls on the new road would allow the new road to go ahead without cutting into other critical services.</para><para>It is time that other issues were also recognised. A large part of the reason for the unexpected budget situation was the collapse of the private consortium's involvement in the public transport system. National Express walked away from their contractual obligations because they could not sustain the costs involved. They talked about losses of hundreds of millions of dollars. The National Express contract was negotiated and signed off by the previous Liberal Kennett government—a government that had an obsession with the notion that anything in the public sector was done in a second-rate fashion and that the private sector could do everything better. The private sector occupied an almost god-like status in the eyes of the previous state government and, worryingly, the private sector occupies that status in the eyes of the present federal government. This glorified private sector experiment just did not work and the present Victorian government has been left to pick up the pieces. The next thing to recognise is that, in picking up the pieces and making the best decision it could, the Victorian government did not walk away from explaining itself. It did not talk about core and non-core promises; it stood up and explained the situation. It did not back away from the tough decision and it said sorry. This is a refreshing change from what we have seen here in the federal parliament.</para><para>While I am on my feet I want to put on record my support for the City of Greater Dandenong's plea for the South Dandenong bypass. I urge that, in the negotiations for the contract to build the freeway, room or opportunity is left to make some change to what I understand are the present plans around Dandenong. I ask that the minister seriously consider altering the present plans to remove the full diamond from the interchange of the freeway at Cheltenham Road. Instead, a half diamond should be built, with the opportunity to build a run onto the freeway in what will become the Dandenong bypass. Essentially this means a road connecting Chandler Road to the South Gippsland Highway. This would mean that traffic would not congest Cheltenham Road through Dandenong—already a difficult situation—and it would allow easier access to the freeway for traffic to and from further out—namely from areas in the City of Casey. I do not support this motion. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>15620</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wholeheartedly support this motion and I am appalled that my adjoining colleague chose to talk about something other than the most significant infrastructure issue facing the community that we represent. The Scoresby Freeway was a promise—a promise made in good faith, one had hoped, by the Bracks government, but as time has gone by we have found that it was not made in good faith at all. Unlike what the member for Isaacs tried to suggest, the same crowd that were in government before the election were in government after the election. If anybody was to know about the state of finances of Victoria it was them. They were there; they were not deceived like the Howard government was when Minister Beazley in the former Keating government said before the 1996 federal election that the budget was in surplus—and it was $10½ million in deficit. There were not challenges like that. This was grief all of their own making.</para></talk.start><para>The people that were guiding the Victorian government were the same people before and after, so it is arrant nonsense to suggest that there is any sort of comparison to be made there. They stooged the voters of the southern and south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne and then had the gall to promise several hundred million dollars more for a bypass ring-road around Geelong. So bereft were they of a commitment to the Scoresby Freeway that they junked that, trashed their no tolls promise and then went off and promised to spend money somewhere else. It is an appalling example of how the people of the eastern and south-eastern suburbs have been let down by Labor. The ALP have recklessly played with the future of our community and its citizens, displayed a breathtaking indifference to their aspirations and traded on the hopes of ordinary people, their communities and their trust, for the grubbiest of short-term political gains. Labor lied. This much is uncontested by anybody. Labor lied, and they have disadvantaged our community because of it.</para><para>There is no single endeavour that will enhance the viability, vitality and living standards of our region more than this project. Let me remind people why Scoresby matters and why a toll-free Scoresby is the way to go forward. The Scoresby corridor contains up to one-third of the population of metropolitan Melbourne. Up to 50 per cent of Melbourne's manufacturing and production activity is located in the Scoresby corridor, producing a major source of exports for Australia and an annual turnover of $35 billion.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

The project, when factored into a general equilibrium model of the Victorian economy, is estimated to boost GDP by $400 million per year and add 0.3 per cent to Victoria's rate of growth. It links the centres of Frankston, Dandenong, Knox and Ringwood. Why does that matter? It matters for a range of reasons. For the community that I represent—and, in fact, in the area represented by the member for Isaacs—there are 450 hectares of vacant industrial and commercially zoned land waiting to be developed. That land is waiting for investors: why don't they come? They do not come because the transport network is cactus. It is not up to it, and they go and invest elsewhere, disadvantaging our community and leaving that land just sitting there vacant. We are crying out for some decent links to ports, airports and interstate highways. The picture is clear, it is plain and it is simple for everybody to see. Three-quarters of all tourists coming to Greater Frankston and to the Mornington Peninsula come from the Scoresby catchment. It is a project that all the councillors had road trains up to Canberra talking about, all saying, `Feds, where is your money?' We put $445 million in real money on the table, while we heard about fake promises and spin doctoring from the ALP. I said, `I am not convinced that the ALP in Victoria are committed to this project.' Didn't we say that they were behaving as reluctant converts? They have done that ever since it occurred. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us talk about this great revelation that all of a sudden there is a problem here. Back on 7 July 2000, state and federal Labor Party members of parliament were briefed on Scoresby. They were not only briefed on Scoresby; they then had the Macquarie Bank in a few hours later to talk about it. This occurred on 7 July 2000. We have already heard reports about Transurban being approached by the Labor government in Victoria to see if they would cop a toll on Scoresby. We have heard about how the RACV was approached. This is a stooge that was a number of years in the making, and it is just unbelievable that the Labor Party could say that it is anything different. They were told back on 7 July 2000 that, if you tolled the Scoresby Freeway, the net economic benefits would be neutral or negative.</para><para>It is forecast that 55 per cent of the Scoresby traffic will not use the freeway if there is a direct toll. That was the advice given to the state and federal members of the Labor Party, but they still went ahead. Why do they hate our people in this part of the world? Do they know that more than 55 per cent of our people are from two-car families, because they need cars to get to school and educational institutions and to leisure activities? Why do they so hate the residents of the south-east and the eastern suburbs of Melbourne where 80 per cent of travel undertaken by women is in cars? What is wrong with women in cars? The ALP hate our community. They have let them down appallingly, and they knew what they were doing. They got the advice from respected transport economists, they understood the implications of tolling Scoresby and they went around betraying the electorate.

However, I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on the important issue of the Scoresby Freeway and the actions of the Victorian state Labor government in constructing this important infrastructure. It is a road the community want to see built as soon as possible, and the community are pleased that they will finally see it built after years of empty Liberal promises, empty Liberal stunts. Let us talk about stunts. Let us talk about standing out there with people and ads. </para></talk.start><para>There is, I believe, genuine recognition in the broader community, the Victorian parliament and this parliament about the importance of the Mitcham-Frankston freeway. Unlike my colleagues opposite, I have not had one phone call to my office concerned about the tolling of this road—not one. It is just a pity that, when it comes to this road, the federal government has only ever played politics. It has played politics with this important infrastructure that will facilitate economic growth in the east and south-east of Melbourne.</para><para>The recent history of this project is very simple. We only need to remember the politics played in the Aston by-election and what was done by the Liberal government there. Let us not talk about who plays politics with this road. The Victorian government have committed to the project but, due to the outrageously incompetent administration by the previous government of the public transport system, the government have been forced to turn Scoresby into a toll road. This has cost the Victorian government politically, but it is a cost they have borne. They have borne it on the chin and they have had the guts to say sorry, unlike the Liberal federal government about the numerous promises it has broken.</para><para>But it is a measure of the Victorian government's commitment to the road that it has gone ahead, has been open with the community and is going to build the road. This is in stark contrast to the federal government, which, rather than having acted in the interest of Victorians—who will benefit from the economic growth that this road will facilitate—has at all turns attempted to exploit this vital infrastructure for political gain. I want to bring a couple of facts before the House. The Commonwealth government has already breached the memorandum of understanding with the Victorian government by never committing 50 per cent of the government's contribution to the road. The preamble to the MOU reads:</para><quote><para>... that the Federal Government will contribute 50% of Government contributions to the construction costs of the Freeway. The Victorian Premier, the Hon Steve Bracks MP, has committed Victoria to fund 50% of Government contributions for the construction cost of the Freeway. </para></quote><para>Despite knowledge that the Scoresby portion of the freeway will cost $1.3 billion, the federal government has committed only $445 million. That is only 37 per cent of the cost, not 50 per cent. The Victorian state government is committed to building this road while the federal government just plays politics. The communities to the east and south-east of Melbourne understand that the construction of this vital infrastructure is in the interests of their local economy and the economy of Victoria as a whole. These are facts that are not disputed by anyone.</para><para>It is instructive to see that mayors of the local municipalities that will be affected by the Scoresby Freeway all want to move forward and ensure that the road is built. Mayors whose municipalities are contained within Chisholm and those for the cities of Monash, Whitehorse and Kingston have all spoken of their wish for the road to be constructed. The Mayor of Monash has said:</para><quote><para>... we want this freeway built now and we want it built right, and we will work with the government to get the best outcome for Monash.</para></quote><para>The Mayor of Whitehorse has said:</para><quote><para>Council looks forward to continuing opportunities to meet with the government and work together on getting the road built.</para></quote><para>And the Mayor of Kingston has said:</para><quote><para>The Mitcham-Frankston Freeway is essential for the economic development of this region and for this reason we welcome the Government's unequivocal commitment to the project. </para></quote><para>The road will be built. The Victorian government is committed to it; local communities are committed to it and the only level of government that continues to play politics with this road is the federal government. The federal government is prepared to play politics with this road: the money has suddenly disappeared. The time for games and political stunts has passed. It is time for the Howard government to park the political bandwagon and to help to drive this project with the Bracks Labor government for the benefit of the eastern and south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne and for the economic development of the area that everybody recognises is important. It will come with the development of this road.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>15623</page.no><name role="metadata">Pearce, Christopher, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PEARCE</name><name.id>A8W</name.id><electorate>Aston</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is my great pleasure to rise in the House today to support the motion put forward by the member for Deakin. From the outset I would like to say that we have heard a lot of discussion in this place about the Scoresby Freeway but it seems to me that there are a couple of key issues that are quite often forgotten. I think the most important thing to bear in mind is that as a result of the Victorian state government's decision the losers are the community. It is the people who live and work within the corridor that lose out from this decision. It seems to me that we hear a lot of talk about a lot of things, but unfortunately the Victorian state government do not seem to understand the impact that this decision is going to have on people. Yesterday, when I launched the Scoresby `No tolls' bumper sticker campaign in my electorate there was a person that stopped on Ferntree Gully Road and was interviewed by one of Melbourne's TV stations. That person was saying that he is very concerned that he may lose his livelihood as a tradesperson because he will need to use this new tollway and it is going to cost him an enormous amount of money.</para></talk.start><para>So I think, firstly, that is the issue that has been forgotten—the actual impact that it is going to have on the lives of families that live up and down the Scoresby corridor. It is that impact that concerns me. How are these families and these small business operators going to be able to run their businesses and go about their normal daily activities and afford to pay the tolls being imposed on the freeway?</para><para>The second point that is very important to remember is that we hear a lot from our Labor colleagues about the fact that we want this road to go ahead. That is not in question. Everybody wants this road to go ahead. It is not a matter of whether or not the road should go ahead. Of course, everybody wants the road to go ahead. That is not what we are talking about. What we are talking about is a point of principle: it is a point of doing what is right versus doing what is wrong. You can hear a lot of debate about this issue but at the end of the day the Victorian state government went to an election and they promised me, my wife, my family, my next door neighbours, the people across the street from where I live and the people that operate their business next to my electorate office—they promised each and every one of us—that they would build the Scoresby Freeway.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Pyne</name></talker><para>—They were lying.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Sturt will withdraw that comment.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Pyne</name></talker><para>—I withdraw it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>A8W</name.id><name role="metadata">Pearce, Christopher, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PEARCE</name></talker><para>—Now they have decided to impose tolls.

All I can say is that since I have been the member for Aston there have been no broken promises in Aston. When I ran for the Aston by-election, I promised the people of Aston that I would work hard to see the Scoresby Freeway built. I then ran 17 weeks later in the general election and I promised that again. If the state government and the federal opposition think that I am going to do what they did and break my promise to the people of Aston, I am not going to. It is a serious issue: it is an issue that the people of the outer eastern suburbs and southern suburbs of Melbourne will have to sustain for 30 or 40 years. My young son will be almost my age by the time these tolls are supposedly withdrawn. He will be an adult with his own family and he will still be paying tolls on the Mitcham-Frankston tollway. This is the wrong decision, it is unprincipled, it is unnecessary and the state government could do it a different way. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The time allotted for private members' business has expired.

I am prepared to turn over a new leaf ...</para></quote><para>He has not so much turned over a new leaf as polished his switchblade and driven it into the standards of this place. Last week in parliament, the Leader of the Opposition engaged in over-the-top attacks on the Governor-General and the Prime Minister, using language that even he did not understand. He accused the Governor-General of moral turpitude. When asked on the ABC's <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> program on 26 May by the host, Tony Jones, whether he knew what it meant, he could not tell the interviewer, even though he was given the opportunity on five separate occasions.</para><para>So we had the Leader of the Opposition calling the Governor-General depraved, wicked, base and shameful, when he did not even know himself what he was doing. It was an extraordinary example for the Leader of the Opposition to give. What hope do we have for standards in this place and for the misuse of parliamentary privilege if that is the example that the Leader of the Opposition gives his frontbenchers and backbenchers? Not much, judging by the activities of some other members of the opposition. </para><para>The member for McMillan, in his maiden speech, said of Liberals, `What can you expect from a hog—except that it will grunt?' That was in the maiden speech by the member for McMillan. The member for Grayndler shouted, `Sieg Heil!' at another MP in this chamber. His hypocrisy is vomitous. Listen to what he had to say in his maiden speech, quoting Martin Luther King: </para><quote><para>There is no progress in hate ... like an unchecked cancer, hate corrodes the personality and eats away its vital unity. Hate destroys a man's sense of values and his objectivity.</para></quote><para>Well said, but unfortunately he is not practising what he preaches. And this week and last week, we have seen the member for Reid and the member for Lalor's disgraceful, low attempt to smear the minister for immigration. </para><para>But the worst follower of the Leader of the Opposition's example is the Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf, or `Comical Ali', of the parliament, the member for Werriwa. Like `Comical Ali', he is very quick to shoot his mouth off with rhetoric, but the rhetoric does not match the record. I have known and watched the member for Werriwa for 10 years in this place, and there was a time when he revelled in having considered, thoughtful debates outside the square and in making useful suggestions. Some of them were quite good ideas. He should return to those days when he gave considered speeches about policy issues; he would do himself a lot more good. He is letting himself down, he is letting his party down and he is letting this parliament down by engaging in his self-described `maddie' behaviour. </para><para>How mad is that `maddie' side of the member for Werriwa? Only last week, he was glorifying the assault on the Treasurer by Red Bingham when the Treasurer was at university. I wonder if taxi drivers do U-turns in Melbourne to avoid Red Bingham like they do in Sydney to avoid the member for Werriwa. He has slandered, defamed and traduced many good Australians with his abuse of parliamentary privilege—as well as the Queen Mother and George W. Bush. He has attacked in this place in the last few years Malcolm Turnbull, Anne and Gerard Henderson, the Sydney Institute, Greg Lindsay, Peter Saunders, the Centre for Independent Studies, Janet Albrechtsen, Piers Akerman, Christopher Pearson, Paddy McGuinness, Andrew Bolt, Brian Toohey, Miranda Devine, Michael Duffy, Phillip Adams, Laurie Oakes, Michelle Grattan, Jack Waterford, who is the Editor in Chief of the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>, Kerry Packer, Tony Staley, Tony Abbott, Andrew Parker and the entire Liberal Party in general. It is quite a list of people who cannot defend themselves that the member for Werriwa has slandered in this place.</para><para>Outside parliament, he has plenty to say about his own colleagues—Laurie Ferguson, Martin Ferguson and particularly the man he calls `knucklehead', Kevin Rudd.

Bob Carr offers us an insight in the new book by Marilyn Dodkin, <inline font-style="italic">Bob Carr: the reluctant leader</inline>. When the member for Werriwa was dudded for preselection in the safe New South Wales seat of Liverpool, Bob Carr wrote in his diary: </para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>As soon as I got the news I summoned Peter [Anderson] and did a news conference in which I boldly endorsed him as my choice. Earlier I'd had a phone conversation with Mark Latham, unsuccessful right-wing candidate and staff member. He in tears. Hung up on me. He later phoned in to resign. Bugger him. He failed to do the grassroots organisation that was necessary for a clear cut, unambiguous win. We bled on the canvas for three weeks as a result. </para></quote><para>What? `He in tears.' Did I hear right when I read it out? So it is true—the member for Werriwa does have a yin and a yang. Obviously, while Balmain boys do not cry, Liverpool boys do! Labor's self-styled hard man, head kicker and bovver boy is, after all that, really just a bit of a Caramello Koala—soft in the centre. By way of contrast, what Bob Carr had to say about the Prime Minister is also indicative: </para><quote><para>To my intense relief [Howard] says he won't—cannot—overturn a recommendation of the Grants Commission unless the States are unanimous. Strong. Fair. I won't hear ill of this man. </para></quote><para>Bob Carr got it right on both points. </para><para>Parliamentary privilege has a purpose in this place. It is designed so that MPs can raise issues of real concern that they could not otherwise raise without facing potentially expensive legal action. It is not supposed to be used to make this place degenerate into a slander house. It has a specific purpose, and the member for Werriwa constantly breaches its purpose. The member for Werriwa, ironically, has himself written about raising the standards of public life and of his dedication to ethical ideals. I wonder if he would be so courageous if the Privileges Committee of this House actually facilitated members of the public to use the right of reply that was granted to them in 1997 under the changes to the standing orders that we passed at that time. Under those changes, members of the public can apply to the House to have their side of the story placed on the public record. Since 1997, how many do you think have applied and been granted permission by the Privileges Committee? Not one has been granted permission by the Privileges Committee to appear and have their side of the story placed on the record in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. In the Senate, it is commonplace; in this place, the Privileges Committee has never let it happen—not once. </para><para>I know that some of the people whom the member for Werriwa has sullied in this place would like the opportunity to respond and to apply to have their story recorded in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, but they do not do that, because they do not see any point, because they think the Privileges Committee will not allow it, since the record is zero since 1997. I hope that, if applications are made to the Privileges Committee in the future by people who feel that their reputations have been traduced, defamed and slandered by members of this House, the Privileges Committee will take a much more open-minded view to allowing people to have their stories placed on the record so that they can protect and defend their reputations. If the Privileges Committee were to do so, it would send a clear message to members of this House like the member for McMillan, the member for Grayndler, the member for Reid, the member for Lalor and the member for Werriwa that using parliamentary privilege as a weapon to attack one's colleagues was not what parliamentary privilege was intended for in the first place and that parliamentary privilege has been seriously undermined by the actions of some of our colleagues in recent years.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Families: Living Standards</title><page.no>15626</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>15626</page.no><name role="metadata">Livermore, Kirsten, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LIVERMORE</name><name.id>83A</name.id><electorate>Capricornia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to use this debate today to speak up for the increasing number of Australians who are finding life more and more difficult, particularly those bringing up our nation's children. Every new set of statistics you read tells you that inequality is growing in this country. Whether you are talking about absolute income figures or relative positions, the gap between the rich and the rest of the community has deepened and widened in recent years, and the Howard government seems more than happy to let it keep drifting. The figures are mind-boggling. If you are doing well in this country, you are doing exceptionally well.</para></talk.start><para>The annual incomes of the top five per cent of earners in Australia are roughly equivalent to those of the entire bottom 40 per cent. The wealthiest five per cent of Australians have enjoyed a 28 per cent jump in their earnings over the past five years—an increase of over $31,000 a year—yet this government has the gall to walk into the Industrial Relations Commission each and every year and oppose a wage rise for the lowest paid workers in this country. High-income earners are doing all right out of this government; they get their private health insurance rebate, millions of dollars for elite category 1 schools and the baby bonus. If you are a seriously wealthy but failed executive, you get a 30 per cent subsidy on your golden handshake. You have to hand it to the Howard government: they look after their own. Meanwhile, those on the wrong side of the divide, those on minimum or even average wages, the unemployed and the disabled, see their chances of a decent life, let alone their dreams of a better life, disappear as the services they rely on—state schools, public hospitals, bulk-billing doctors and employment services—fall apart under a government that does not know about hardship and does not care. </para><para>I believe that we are at a crossroads in our country's development. We have to ask ourselves: do we want to pay lip service to the principle of egalitarianism that has defined our nation up until now or will we commit to making fairness and equality of opportunity the birthright of every Australian in a meaningful and tangible way? Clearly John Howard and his ministers are not asking those questions. If they were, surely we would have seen some action by now to address the growing levels of financial hardship and inequality in our community that threaten the stability and cohesiveness of Australian society. You have to ask yourself: what are they waiting for? How bad do things have to get? It is not like the evidence of what this is doing to families in our community is hard to find.</para><para>I will help the government out with some statistics that show it is no accident that people feel they are being left behind. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, there are now 1.2 million salary earning households suffering financial stress. Eighty-seven per cent of the additional jobs created in the 1990s paid less than $500 per week. Currently, 28.6 per cent of Australian households earn under $500 a week. There are 800,000 children growing up in families where neither parent has a job. Nearly one-third of our work force are casual employees. Behind those statistics are real stories, real lives and real people who are being denied the opportunity to make the most of their lives and the lives of their children. As their representatives in the federal parliament we are not just along for the ride as this country plots its course. We have to be prepared to take a certain measure of responsibility for every kid who could not afford to go on a school excursion today and for every parent who had to make a choice between taking their child to a doctor and buying them school books. Make no mistake—that is what is happening in households every day.</para><para>In its submission to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into poverty in Australia, the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union quoted figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics Household Expenditure Survey. They paint a picture of working families living on a knife edge: only one medical emergency or broken-down car away from debt and despair. One in five working Australians cannot go out once a fortnight; over a quarter of Australians cannot have a week's holiday away from home once a year. In any one year, 30,000 low-income working families go without meals and one-fifth cannot raise $2,000 for an emergency. I will give the House an illustration from the LHMWU's submission that describes what that means for a family—the stress that comes from relentless financial pressure and the disappointment of not being able to realise the dreams that you have for your kids. Maria is a 30-year-old married mother of one son. She earns $487 per week after tax working in the hospitality industry. Her husband is employed casually and their incomes support Maria's pensioner mother. The three generations of the family share a two-bedroom flat. In her testimony to the Industrial Relations Commission, Maria said: </para><quote><para>We would love to buy a house for Martin to have a backyard and if we have any other children. However, based on our current incomes and the fact that my husband is not in permanent employment, neither of these are likely to happen.</para><para>I would like to get private health insurance but just can't afford it. My teeth need to be fixed but I am scared to go to the dentist in case it costs a lot of money.</para><para>We try to go on holidays at Christmas time each year but did not go last year because of my husband's redundancy and now being casual he doesn't receive any holiday pay.</para><para>I do not save enough money to save anything for emergencies. Each fortnight I go to a loan company who will cash a cheque before pay day. By the time I receive my pay it is already half spent. This is a vicious circle I can't break.</para></quote><para>The failure of the Howard government to understand the daily struggle just to get by that so many people in our community experience is shameful. In fact, it is more than shameful; it is criminal. The hardship being experienced by so many Australians is not the result of carelessness or neglect on the part of this government; it is the direct and inevitable result of this government's policies—policies that have seen an explosion in low-paid, casual and short-term jobs and that at the same time have eroded universal services, such as health and education, that used to provide Australians with security, opportunity and dignity regardless of their income.</para><para>This speech came about as a result of a conversation I had with a woman who lives in Yeppoon in my electorate. I will just call her Sharon. Sharon came to tell me about her family's circumstances and the struggle they have to just keep their heads above water. Her husband works full time and earns $420 per week. He would like to do some overtime, but that would make their position worse in terms of tax and Centrelink payments. Sharon has a casual job in the hospitality industry, but it is costing them too much to run two cars so they are faced with the dilemma of selling Sharon's car. Of course, then they have to do without her income.</para><para>With teenage children, food and school expenses take up much of the family's budget, so clothes come from St Vincent de Paul or they just do without. There is no money for holidays or treats, and the cost of their children's ambitions to go to uni is just too daunting for her to think about. Sharon said to me, `We are trying to do the right thing, but we are just getting nowhere.' Sharon wants to know that someone understands what her family is going through, that someone is listening and that there is some light at the end of the tunnel.</para><para>The Labor Party are giving this issue the attention it deserves. We are trying to make the living standards of Australian families a priority for whoever governs this country. We have initiated the Senate's inquiry into poverty and financial hardship that is right now exposing what life is really like for working families and the unemployed in our community. It is a long way from the relaxed and comfortable vision that the Prime Minister promised seven years ago and it condemns his government's failure to provide support for families in the crucial areas of job security, health, education, housing affordability and savings.</para><para>That support will come from the kinds of initiatives that the Australian Labor Party is developing—things like our plan to restore bulk-billing, matched savings accounts, income tax credits that are properly integrated with the social security system so that people are rewarded for work and not penalised, and, of course, our ongoing commitment to the living wage. In his recent budget speech, the Treasurer committed $100 million to the job of rebuilding the country of Iraq. That might be the government's priority, but we in the Labor Party are firmly focused on the job of rebuilding a fair and just Australia. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Autism</title><page.no>15629</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>15629</page.no><name role="metadata">Hull, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs HULL</name><name.id>83O</name.id><electorate>Riverina</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I rise in the House to congratulate Andrew Brien and his organising team for a very successful conference on autism that was held here in the ACT yesterday at the National Convention Centre. This is the first time a conference such as this has been held outside a major city. It enabled parents, practitioners and departmental people to share information and to network. It gave parents the opportunity to just share with somebody who understands. It also gave them the opportunity to access factual information that is reliable and is able to be acted upon. It was also great to see some of the departmental people in attendance, particularly those from Family and Community Services, in order that they could understand the confronting issue of autism.</para></talk.start><para>I attended the conference for a very short time but, whilst I was sitting there, I happened to be in the segment with the dads of autistic children. I was absolutely in awe of those fathers—who were there to openly and honestly discuss the issues—and in awe of the courage that it took to come forth with honesty on their children's behalf. That was inspiring to me.</para><para>The cause of autism is not known. There are many theories about it. There does not appear to be a single cause, but it is now thought that in a number of cases there may be some sort of genetic component. What is true is that the style of parenting does not cause autism. The latest research indicates that about one person in 100 has an autism spectrum disorder ranging from very mild to profoundly impaired. The way that each person is affected and the extent of that effect differ between individuals. That is why autism is sometimes so very difficult to understand and to manage.</para><para>Autism is lifelong. There is no cure, although with early diagnosis and intervention, appropriate therapies and educational programs you can make significant progress. Yesterday we heard of the milestones children had reached, making significant progress in their lives. People had thought that a child might never speak; now the child is reading fluently. Under so-called normal circumstances, we might take it for granted that a child may be able to just get on and ride a bike without trainer wheels. Once this milestone is achieved in an autistic child, it is as though he has climbed Mount Everest. One person commented that when Hillary climbed Mount Everest it was groundbreaking, but every day there is an achievement in the life of an autistic child is a milestone for them and their parents.</para><para>At the conference, I heard of issues associated with the difficulties that families face in their role as parents and the way in which they are confronted with personal situations. Dealing with autism can impact on a family's lifestyle and their ability to hang together as a family. One area of concern is that, in some areas, it is reported that about 80 per cent of families go through a marriage break-up due to the inability of one or both partners to cope with the very trying and restrictive case management issues involved.</para><para>As a child grows older, impairments that he or she may have had usually diminish with appropriate therapy and educational intervention. However, the impairments will always exist to some extent. A person with autism will always need some form of assistance, depending upon their level of disability. People with autism vary enormously in terms of their personalities, intelligence levels, skills, behaviour, ability to interact with others and ability to participate in the world around them. At the conference it was clearly pointed out that, should you have an external and physical disability such that your behaviour is not so-called `acceptable behaviour' in the community's eyes, it is acceptable. It is acceptable if a child has a physical look that may suggest that there is something wrong with the temperament or the health of that child. Because autistic children are generally perfect looking little children and have no appearance of any kind of disability, society does not expect them to behave in the way that they sometimes cannot help behaving. It is less acceptable for them. Yesterday, I heard issues raised by dads saying that in some areas they had been confronted with people saying, `Either you smack that child or I'll smack that child.' They are some of the difficulties that some of these families are confronting. </para><para>Other obvious difficulties are that it is very hard for families to keep relationships going with their friends. If your child is not behaving in what we call a socially acceptable way, it is very hard for people to understand—it is very hard for people who are not absolutely committed to the care of an autistic child to cope with it. People with autism have significant difficulties in communicating with other people. The type and extent of the difficulties varies widely. While I was at the conference yesterday I realised that not every autistic child excels in maths or is a genius in some other area such as we might see depicted on television or movie screens. The fact is that their difficulties vary widely. They generally have difficulty in expressing themselves and in understanding what other people say and mean, especially when referring to more abstract concepts.</para><para>While some autistic people can speak fairly well, other sufferers may have a very limited ability to speak, despite having normal intelligence as measured by non-verbal tests. Learning at school may be limited unless the type and extent of the communication difficulties are identified and there are precise strategies put in place tailored to the specific needs of that child to help him or her understand instructions and move forward in a learning capacity. Regarding social skills, people with autism or Asperger's syndrome have significant difficulties in forming relationships with other people. Of course this is a terribly tiring and demanding role for the parents. As I said, I cannot help but come back to the commitment of those parents—it is absolutely outstanding that about 180 people attended the conference.</para><para>Autistic people struggle to understand social rules governing relationships and interactions—rules that everyone else takes for granted as normalcy. As a result, they can be unresponsive to, or reject, attempts by others to interact with them. This leaves families totally isolated and, indeed, the isolation can also impact on the sufferer of autism. If there is no adult help given, an autistic child remains isolated from all people. Other children give up trying to initiate interactions and play, both in the classroom and in the playground. I am aware that that is sometimes confusing for children who attempt to undertake friendships with autistic children. These little children cannot understand the divergence of attitudes of an autistic child, so they find they question themselves and are upset with their relationship with their friend and not able to understand it. It does not just impact on the families; it impacts on the friends of those autistic children and their families as well.</para><para>People with autism have very inflexible behaviour and a very restricted range of interests and activities. They like to follow exact daily routines and they may be highly attached to seemingly ordinary objects, such as stones, and insist that these always be carried with them. Sometimes it is hard for the general public to understand these issues. I would like to point out that autism is a disorder. Yes, autism can be improved with early intervention, but it is a lifelong illness. It requires the understanding of governments, the understanding of departments—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Telecommunications Infrastructure</title><page.no>15631</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>15631</page.no><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name><name.id>YU5</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This evening I am going to outline to the House the extraordinary recent track record of the world's worst ever communications minister, Senator Alston—the man who is in charge of major institutions and critical policies and who has managed to mangle everything he has touched. From Telstra to the ABC, from digital to broadband, from the ACA to the ABA: everything he has touched has turned into a disaster. He has left a swathe of disasters in his wake.</para></talk.start><para>Under his administration, Telstra has been a catalogue of complete disasters. The network is crumbling with gas bottles being used all around the network to prop up the air pressure for temporary fixes. The gel that was applied to improve the network has turned into a disaster. There are figures about network reliability that are almost as good as Saddam Hussein-like plebiscite figures. The government has responded to the concerns about communications in regional Australia by having its own inquiry headed by a mate of the Deputy Prime Minister and a member of the National Party, Mr Estens. That was seven months ago, yet the government has failed to respond to the very limited recommendations of that whitewash inquiry.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Anthony</name></talker><para>—You wanted to break it up!</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Causley)</name></talker><para>—Order!

Thousands of workers are being sacked by Telstra as the network crumbles. IT capacity is being outsourced to India, so we will see several thousand workers lose their jobs and the IT heart of Australia sent over to India. Capital investment is continuing to decline and, of course, Telstra has lost billions of dollars in Asia. Line rental fees are up. They were $11.65 only three years ago and now they are heading towards $30 per month. According to recent estimates, that is reaping Telstra upwards of $200 million a year in extra revenue, even after you take into account reductions in call costs that are very minor.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We still have inadequate competition. Telstra still totally dominates the market. That is why we are falling behind the rest of the world in broadband. When I first took over this portfolio about 18 months ago, Australia was 13th in the world and not doing very well. We are now 21st in the world under Senator Alston, and yet he refuses to take any action about this and as yet, again, there is no response to the report of the Broadband Advisory Group. While all of this has been happening, the Telstra share price has plummeted. It actually went below $4 not so long ago, in part because of the bumbling incompetence of the minister and the way he dealt with a number of issues in Telstra, including his stunt of calling an inquiry that he then cancelled the day before it was due to commence and announcing major regulatory changes to the competition regime without consulting Telstra. </para><para>We have also seen in recent times exposure of some aspects of Telstra's behaviour that really do defy description: plasma TVs worth $15,000 to $20,000 being provided free of charge for months to both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to keep them all cosy and comfortable with Telstra—which they are supposed to be administering—stadiums being named with Telstra's name and brand at a cost of around $70 million over 10 years; huge corporate entertainment bills; and, the most recent outrage, the disclosure that the Telstra CEO, if he is sacked for nonperformance, will benefit to the tune of over $1 million in redundancy payouts—a great reward for failure. To top it all off, T3—the full privatisation of Telstra—which this government has been trumpeting as a key agenda item for this parliament, has been deferred until 2005-06. The end result: a disaster on every front.</para><para>Believe it or not, this minister for communications has actually got everything wrong. He has got wrong every single issue that you can name with respect to Telstra policy and telecommunications policy. Is there anything at all going right? The answer is no. This is truly a unique record throughout the world. He is the Wile E. Coyote of communications. He has an inexhaustible supply of Acme dynamite and he is busily, bit by bit, applying it to every aspect of telecommunications policy.</para><para>It is a similar story with the ABC. This government and Senator Alston, as the minister, started by slashing funding to the ABC in a full-on brutal assault back in 1996, and subsequent funding increases have essentially been with strings attached for political purposes. They have attempted to stack the ABC board, appointing people like Michael Kroger, a notorious political head kicker and close mate of the Treasurer, and Ron Brunton, an ideological zealot whose credentials for being on the ABC board were described by the minister as `he has actually written some things that the ABC covers in its programs'—some record justifying appointment to the board. Their appointment of Donald McDonald—an appointment that they thought was going to be a means of bringing the ABC to heel—blew up in their face because he turned out to be a man of integrity, a true conservative and a defender of the ABC. They have tried to turn the ABC into a Liberal Party branch meeting.</para><para>Now the inadequate funding of the ABC is all coming home to roost. The two digital channels, which were a small but significant part of a very limited digital rollout in Australia, have collapsed because of inadequate funding. We have seen the ABC unable to extend its metropolitan and major provincial city services—like Radio National, Triple J, Classic FM and NewsRadio—to many other regional areas. The latest disaster in this catalogue of disasters is the full-on attack on the ABC that the minister launched last week, with an absolutely ludicrous dossier that would have taken hours and hours of work in his office, going through transcripts on <inline font-style="italic">AM </inline>seeking to prove the ABC's reporting of the war was pro-Iraq and anti-American—anti-American, mind you, not anti-Australian—when this reporting was very similar in tone and content to the reporting of the war of major reputable news organisations around the world.</para><para>The minister sought to establish that the ABC is biased. What he has in fact established is that he is seeking to turn the ABC into a Liberal Party propaganda arm. The minister is spending all his time and all his energy not on a response to the Estens report about regional telecommunications and not on getting Australia back in front—back to its world leadership role—in broadband, where it should be, but on attacking the ABC because he wants to nobble it, cripple it and turn it into a propaganda arm of the Liberal Party. He is the Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf of Australian politics, the `Comical Ali' of communications—ranting nonsensically while everything collapses around him. </para><para>On digital TV we have had a datacasting auction that failed, two channels that ended up nowhere, and high-definition television going nowhere—he has had to change the rules on that several times. The minister for communications supported multichannelling, but nothing has happened. He has gone to cabinet a couple of times and sought to get multichannelling for the commercial networks, and that has got nowhere. Now, of course, contrary to his statements, the minister for communications has had to suffer the indignity—which he was warned about on several occasions—of the ABC cancelling its digital multichannels. Only 50,000 to 60,000 digital units have been taken up by consumers around Australia. The digital rollout was proceeding at an absolute snail's pace; now it is in reverse. Now Australia is gloriously heading back to the world of analog. The digital rollout that this minister set in place five years ago is now heading in reverse.</para><para>Cross-media ownership—the most outrageous attack on democratic institutions that this minister for communications has been responsible for—has been a catalogue of disaster and difficulty for him. First he could not get his proposal through his own party room—he could not get it through the National Party—and then he was unable to get it on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, so he had to go through a special motion in the chamber just to get the matter on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>. And now, of course, he cannot get it through the Senate. He wants to abolish the cross-media ownership laws so that we can have two or three people dominate completely our commercial media and totally dominate public debate and public expression. But he wants to do it in a totally convoluted and shambolic way: a notion of editorial separation where we would have to have editors in various media outlets, with organisational charts, flowcharts and diagrams being scrutinised by some sort of government agency—an absolutely ludicrous proposition which has rightly been condemned by the Press Council as an attack on freedom of speech.</para><para>But where is this issue? It was the first issue that was raised after the November 2001 election. It was the first issue that emerged in public debate after that election and it is still in the Senate. I will make a prediction now: when this parliament is dissolved, that matter will still be in the Senate. And he has not even gotten round to the issue of the deregulation of Australia Post. But we can rest assured that he will get around to that. That is on his agenda, and he will muck that up too. It is time that `Digital Dick' was put out to pasture. He has been angling for a diplomatic appointment for years. For the sake of Australian consumers, for the sake of the Australian information economy, for the sake of Australian communications networks and for the sake of Australian democracy I beg the Prime Minister to appoint him High Commissioner of Botswana as soon as possible. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Drugs: Medicinal Marijuana</title><page.no>15633</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>15633</page.no><name role="metadata">Gallus, Christine, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GALLUS</name><name.id>CU4</name.id><electorate>Hindmarsh</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I want to address an issue that has bedevilled governments and societies since 3000 BC. But first of all I dedicate this grievance debate speech to an 83-year-old friend of mine who believes that smoking marijuana would relieve the pain associated with his prostate cancer and would alleviate the debilitating pain suffered by his 80-year-old wife, who has arthritis in her leg, her hip, her hands and her feet—in fact in all her joints. Currently he clearly does not have access to marijuana and he is not sure where to go for it or what its legal status is were he to acquire it. </para></talk.start><para>On that basis I had a look at the legislation. Not surprisingly—or perhaps surprisingly, depending on which way you look at it—it differs between the states. In New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania it remains a criminal offence to possess marijuana. In Queensland you can get two years imprisonment for having marijuana—and I am not talking about large amounts; I am talking about amounts less than 50 grams—and/or a $60,000 fine. Indeed, you can actually get up to 15 years imprisonment in Queensland. In New South Wales and Western Australia it is a $2,000 fine and/or two years in jail. In Tasmania it is a $5,000 fine and/or two years imprisonment. In Victoria, South Australia, the Northern Territory and the ACT the possession of a small amount of marijuana is a less serious offence and no conviction is recorded unless the fine is challenged or not paid. In Victoria the fine is $500, in the Northern Territory it is $200, and in South Australia and the ACT it is between $50 and $100. So you can see why my 83-year-old friend and his wife are somewhat confused as to the status and what would happen to them if they could get a hold of marijuana.</para><para>The current statistics on use are not good in Australia but the best surveys that we have come up with so far indicate that 33 per cent of people have used marijuana in Australia. That compares very closely to the levels in the United States—32 per cent in the States have used it. The US has some very good surveys, and that figure has come up over and over again. Of that 32 per cent who have used it, five per cent indicated that they are current users. Moving from that to medical use, eight states in the United States of America have guidelines which allow medical use, and I believe several more states are looking at this. In 2001 Canada declared that the medical use of marijuana would be allowed. We know the situation in the Netherlands where you can get it in a coffee shop. Both the American and British medical associations have recommended clinical trials of smoked marijuana for a variety symptoms.</para><para>This brings me to what has brought this debate up, other than my elderly friend: the New South Wales Premier declaring that he would consider the medical use of marijuana in the state of New South Wales. I am no great fan of the Premier of New South Wales; however, I think at this time he has made a good move. He says:</para><quote><para>After a long period of careful deliberation, the Government now intends to establish a medicinal cannabis scheme in New South Wales.</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>Under the proposal ... patients will be able to access cannabis through a new Office of Medicinal Cannabis to be established within the New South Wales Department of Health.</para></quote><para>While we can say that is an excellent move forward for the people of New South Wales who are in pain or are suffering from AIDS or any other of those wasting diseases which marijuana has been shown to help, again it adds to the confusion facing my elderly friend and his wife because they are in Victoria and this will not apply to them.</para><para>However, it is a move that is being echoed around the world. I refer to the Institute of Medicine, a United States organisation which was recently asked by the White House to have a look at the use of marijuana for medical purposes. The recommendations of this highly prestigious and conservative organisation include that trials for patients with debilitating symptoms, which includes pain and vomiting, be allowed under much the same way that has been suggested by New South Wales if there has been a failure of all approved medication to provide relief and this is documented and if the symptoms can reasonably be expected to be relieved by the marijuana; that such treatment would be subject to medical supervision; and that an oversight strategy would have to be put in place. That seems to be a highly reasonable way of looking at the situation and it is from an organisation that can hardly be called left wing. </para><para>However, I would be doing the IOM an injustice if I suggested that they said there were no problems with it. They have looked at a number of problems. On dependence, they basically dismissed the argument that, if people are allowed to go on marijuana, they will become dependent on it. They said there was no physiological reason why this should be so. Indeed the figures in the Netherlands would also indicate this. Although marijuana is legal there, the incidence of using marijuana is no greater than in the United States. There is also the argument that it could be used as a gateway drug to heroin, but in the Netherlands the incidence of young people moving on to harder drugs is 0.3 per cent compared to 1.7 per cent in the United States, where marijuana is banned. There are good reasons for dismissing those two arguments against the use of marijuana for medical purposes: one, it is a dependence drug, because it is not, and, two, that it is a gateway drug, because it is not—although clearly people who have used harder drugs have started off using marijuana.</para><para>Having removed those two arguments against the medical use, two very important arguments remain—that is, the arguments in regard to schizophrenia and the smoking of marijuana, as it is similar to the smoking of tobacco. I will firstly address the issue of schizophrenia. There have been three studies lately that have looked at marijuana smoking and schizophrenia. One was an Australian study which for seven years followed 1,600 Australian school pupils aged 14 to 15. Daily cannabis use was associated with a fivefold increase risk of depression at the age of 20. Weekly use was linked to a twofold increase. I know that there have been other studies that have questioned those findings; however, the fact that they did find this is quite disturbing. Similarly, a study in the UK evaluated data of over 50,000 Swedish conscripts and found that those who used cannabis by the age of 15 were four times as likely to have a diagnosis of a minor schizophrenic disorder by the time they were 26.</para><para>It is because of these figures that the Prime Minister has expressed cautious approval of the move in New South Wales. The Prime Minister has said that he would certainly look at permitting the medical use of marijuana but not if it involved smoking the drug. However, I would like to make a plea for the elderly people in the community who have chronic pain, who cannot have it relieved any other way and who would enjoy the social aspects of sitting down in their own home to smoke marijuana once or twice a week to relieve their pain. In this case we cannot be looking at the long-term effects that it has on young people nor at the effects of tobacco smoking—which we all know of and would not want to encourage in the younger members of our community—but at the effect marijuana has on those who are chronically ill or elderly and for whom it is highly appropriate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Mental Illness</title><page.no>15635</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>15635</page.no><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name><name.id>83S</name.id><electorate>Chisholm</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is a cry for help in my constituency—a loud cry, which unfortunately is echoed in every other electorate represented in this House. It is an agonising cry for help from those who, in most cases, are least able to seek help for themselves either from unnecessary embarrassment or simply from the inability to do so. It is a desperate cry that, if made, often falls on deaf ears or, if heard, often is ignored due to fear or lack of understanding. A cry, even if it is made on someone else's behalf, still brings an unwanted stigma from those in our society who are unable or do not want to understand. </para></talk.start><para>The group within our society I refer to are those in our community, our neighbourhood, our street or our family who suffer from mental illness. Mental illness will affect one in five adult Australians a year. That is a staggering 20 per cent of all Australian adults. They will suffer from schizophrenia, bipolar disease, depression, anxiety or Alzheimer's disease—just to name some of the more common forms of mental illness. Aside from the destructive effects of severe mental disorders, what is also frightening is that six per cent of these sufferers will commit suicide—that is about one in every 17 people suffering from such an illness compared to one per cent of the population as a whole. Sadly, suicide is the main cause of premature death amongst people with mental illness.</para><para>What is also tragic about mental illness, which I alluded to in my introduction, is that it carries with it a real stigma. Although it is a disease like any other—diabetes, asthma or even heart disease—sufferers are given little sympathy or support; rather, they are labelled with derogatory names and cruel titles. Many times, if a sufferer is fortunate enough to have close family, the stigma extends to them as well.</para><para>I recently took great offence and objection when I read an article in a major national newspaper that referred to a serial killer as `the Schizo'. This not only offends sufferers and their families; it also propounds any misgivings about the disease and shows the ignorance and irresponsibility of the newspaper. It has taken many years to bring mental illness out of the darkness, and to use such a label just cloaks the disease with incorrect and unwarranted negativity.</para><para>A publication more deserving of mention and one which should be praised has recently been released by one of my constituents—a remarkable person, indeed. In his book <inline font-style="italic">You are not alone: a sane guide to mental illness for children,</inline> 15-year-old Dan Halloran aims to help young people who have a parent or family member with a mental illness. Dan's mother, Virginia, who sadly passed away last year and to whom the book is dedicated, suffered from schizophrenia. Although a loving and dedicated mother, her behaviour was at times unpredictable and necessitated her being separated from Dan at an early age. In his book Dan and other children in similar circumstances offer advice on how to cope in such a situation. It is a groundbreaking book that has never been produced before.</para><para>Dan's plight was recently documented in the ABC program <inline font-style="italic">Australian Story</inline>. I hope people saw it. His spirit, maturity and strength are truly remarkable, especially considering his young age. He has had the courage to use what were personal and hurtful experiences to help others in similar situations and not to be frightened by what might be said of him or his family by an ignorant minority. Dan and John Halloran are remarkable people, and I wish them well in their life journey.</para><para>Ignorant people exist in all levels of society and include, I am embarrassed to say, even those in this very House. I was absolutely stunned recently when I heard the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, say in an interview that he did not think depression was seen as a mental illness by the broader community. This was in response to a question on whether he was concerned that DIMIA does not currently classify depression among detainees as a mental illness. One cannot help but wonder in which millennium Minister Ruddock lives or, possibly more pertinent, where he has been hibernating for the past 50 years or so. Depression is recognised nationally and internationally as a major mental disorder. Sadly, it is one of the most common forms of mental disorder suffered by our community today. Until Mr Ruddock and others in his position of responsibility come to terms with it, they are doing nothing—actually, they are doing more than nothing: they are doing harm—to raise the awareness and understanding towards mental illness. Having said that, I must be honest and say that this general ineptitude on behalf of the present Liberal government comes as no surprise to me. As always, when it comes to helping those who need it most, this government seems to take perverse pleasure at giving them even less. </para><para>To illustrate what I mean, for the year 2000 the Republic of Ireland spent just over eight per cent of its total health expenditure on mental health specific programs and for the year 1999-2000 the UK spent 6.6 per cent of the total UK Health Authority expenditure on mental health. But what about Australia? This government has the dishonour of having spent only 3.4 per cent of total health expenditure in 1999-2000 on mental health. Although this figure has recently risen—it is a bit sad, really, that it has actually risen to 3.4 per cent—it is still pitiful compared to what is actually needed in this area.</para><para>My condemnation is supported by the recent report Out of hospital, out of mind<inline font-style="italic">!</inline><inline font-style="italic">—a report detailing mental health services in Australia in 2002 and community priorities for national mental health policy for 2003</inline><inline font-style="italic">-2008</inline>. This Mental Health Council of Australia report highlights the inadequacy of the federal government's role and its disgraceful lack of contribution to this important issue. Of the many recommendations in this report, the first action that is noted as necessary is having real monetary investment. That means raising mental health expenditure to at least 12 per cent of total health expenditure. This is more than reasonable considering mental health accounts for at least 20 per cent of total health costs due to death and disability. Other First World countries, by comparison, already report spending between 10 and 14 per cent of their total health expenditure on mental health. This same report also notes that 38 per cent of persons with mental disorders access care from their GP. This accounts for about 10 million encounters with GPs per year, a total of about seven per cent of all problems managed by GPs. The premeditated and disgraceful decline in bulk-billing orchestrated by the Liberal government in the latest budget will therefore place further pressure on this already very limited access to basic care services necessary to persons with mental illness.</para><para>Another action the report calls for is real intent, accountability and national leadership. This means that under the auspices of the federal government there needs to be developed an agreement with state governments to support and review mental health reform. However, based on the absolute lack of interest and the arrogance shown by the health minister in her dealings with her state colleagues in the recent past, this will, unfortunately, also be a difficult aim to achieve for the present Liberal government.</para><para>On the subject of the input by the states, I take this opportunity to congratulate the Victorian state government for its continued effort in this area. Firstly, it should be noted that the states contribute nearly double the amount that the federal government contributes to mental health. Secondly, Victoria is the leading state in the extent of structural reform, with resource distribution greater than all jurisdictions combined. Thirdly, Victoria is the top-ranking jurisdiction in the development of disability support services provided through NGOs. Also very worthy of mention is that the Bracks government is funding 25 separate depression research projects through the Victorian Centre of Excellence in Depression and Related Disorders, to the tune of $2.1 million. This research funding is part of the Victorian Labor government's commitment of $3.5 million per year over five years toward the treatment of depression.  </para><para>Lastly, and on a local level, I want to praise the continued work that is being done by Upton House, a mental illness facility within the Box Hill Hospital, an important hospital within my electorate. Their valuable, hands-on assistance to mental illness sufferers has been and continues to be exemplary and very worthy of mention. </para><para>In concluding, it is unfortunate yet quite apparent that those afflicted with a mental disorder, unlike others afflicted by other diseases, receive no sympathy. No-one laughs at or mocks a person with arthritis or diabetes, yet a person with a mental illness is very often ridiculed. This needs to stop. We as a parliament need to do more. This government needs to do more. I believe that, as the representatives of all Australians, we in this House are given the responsibility to ensure that all Australians are treated with dignity and respect. We must, therefore, set the example by providing these people that are in need and crying out for help with the support and assistance that they deserve and to which they are entitled. Regrettably, inaction and comments like those of Minister Ruddock just push this issue back into the Dark Ages, where the Liberal government has kept it for far too long. </para><para>On the issue of mental illness, I would like to commemorate the death of Greg Wilton, one of our colleagues, who took his own life. A mental disorder at the time probably contributed to his suicide. The system failed him. We spoke in this House at great length about needing to ensure that that did not happen again. To ensure that this situation does not happen again, we on both sides of this House need to realise that mental illness is a serious issue and accord it the attention it deserves.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Howard Government: Economic Policy</title><page.no>15638</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>15638</page.no><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name><name.id>PK6</name.id><electorate>Canning</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is on the record that one of the issues I am committed to is ensuring conditions for the working poor, particularly for such families in my electorate of Canning, continue to improve. By its very definition, the working poor need to work or have a job. These low-income workers should be able to keep more of their gross income for their families and themselves. It should not be eroded by a raft of taxes, charges and economic forces. A distinction needs to be made between the low-income workers of Australia and the welfare mindset. I will indicate how a Howard government has set out to reward these genuine workers and seekers of work.</para></talk.start><para>As I have said before, there is nothing more upsetting than seeing men and women working long hours to provide a better quality of life and opportunities for their children, only to sadly observe they are making little headway. For those who genuinely want to work to improve their lot, the Howard government continues to introduce measures to ensure the working poor and low-income earners get to keep more of the money they earn so they can provide better opportunities for themselves and their families. I am proud to be part of a government which has introduced measures and policies so that low-income earners retain more of their earnings and have a better ability to use that retained income for their families. Importantly, these measures also provide greater incentive for lower income earners to work and to distance themselves from the welfare system.</para><para>There are many ways in which people who might fit into this category have, directly and indirectly, been assisted by seven years under the coalition government. During this time an extra 1.3 million new jobs have been created. A strong economy means more jobs, and responsible economic management by this government has helped reduce the unemployment rate to around six per cent—the lowest figure since Labor's peak of 10.9 per cent unemployment in December 1992 when Kim Beazley, now the member for Brand, was minister for employment—from the average unemployment rate of 9.2 per cent during Labor's last two terms in office. </para><para>By their own shadow minister's admission in a speech he gave on 18 March 2003 in the House, under Labor:</para><quote><para>Unemployment is, without question, still one of the greatest policy challenges we face.</para></quote><para>In contrast, the coalition government has turned this state of affairs around so that employment has increased to almost 9.6 million, the highest level ever, and the rate of job creation has been nearly three times as fast as jobs growth under Labor. Full-time jobs have been the coalition's hallmark. Since March 1996, full-time jobs have grown by 584,900—over 10 times more new full-time jobs than Labor created in its last two terms of government. Since the 1996 election, the number of unemployed Australians has fallen by 16.2 per cent to 619,900. The peak under Labor was 934,000 in December 1992—a vast difference.</para><para>The working poor and low-income earners have also benefited from home loan interest rates which, under the coalition government, are at their lowest levels for almost 30 years. Home mortgage rates are now at 6.55 per cent compared to Labor's record of 17 per cent. This means that the average borrower is paying $300 per month less in interest costs compared to then. The first home owners grant has also enabled many young people and low-income earners to realise the dream of owning their own home. Without this assistance, that goal might never have been achievable.</para><para>The coalition has a long history of reducing income taxes. In 2000, income taxes were reduced by $12 billion a year, and the replacement of wholesale sales tax by the GST means that those who previously escaped paying taxes now have no option but to pay their fair share of tax. Lower tax rates and increased thresholds mean the working poor are better assisted, because families get to keep more of their hard-earned income and also benefit from the increases in family benefits and child-care support. Under the new tax system, a single-income family on $38,000 per annum with two young children is over $57 a week better off because of the increases in family benefits and annual tax cuts.</para><para>Low-income earners are also gaining from the government's commitment to delivering real increases in the wages of Australian workers and more flexible workplaces. Labor's record in this area is abysmal. Under Labor, award wages for low-paid workers fell in real terms—a situation Labor ministers publicly boasted about, claiming it was a deliberate economic strategy. During the last financial year of the previous Labor government, real wages growth was zero. Over the life of the much lauded Labor-ACTU accord, even low-paid workers suffered a five per cent decline in real wages. Under Labor, the number of working poor actually increased.</para><para>The coalition has introduced—and continues to try to introduce, despite obstruction from Labor and the minor parties in the Senate—workplace relations reform. Despite the interference, the coalition has managed to create more jobs, better pay and higher productivity. For example, Work for the Dole opportunities have provided young Australians with improved employment prospects and delivered better opportunities for over 215,000 participants. A study into Work for the Dole has found that job seekers who have participated in this program have a 76 per cent better chance of finding jobs than those who have not. Labor intends to scrap this program. </para><para>Mandatory literacy and numeracy testing in schools will provide all children in their formative years with the best possible start by working to improve their ability to read, write, spell and acquire basic maths skills, ultimately leading to better job prospects later in life. And the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate has made private health insurance more affordable, and more than one million Australians on incomes of less than $20,000 per year have taken out private health cover—so it is not for the rich.</para><para>The coalition recognises that nearly 70 per cent of Australians do not go on to higher education and has revitalised the vocational education and training sector so that there are now more than twice as many apprenticeships and traineeships as there were under Labor. During the last two years of the Labor government, apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the working age population declined to the lowest level for two decades. New apprenticeships have more than doubled since the years when the Labor Party were in office. There were 367,800 new apprentices in training in September 2002—compared to 135,000 under Labor in 1995—which represents an increase of 13 per cent from the previous June and is more than double the 1995 numbers; a commendable record.</para><para>Low-income families have also profited through this government's baby bonus. This initiative recognises that one of the hardest times for families financially follows the birth of a first child, when a family could lose one of its two incomes for a period. A total of 118,000 Australians received the baby bonus payment. The vast majority of payments—$31.4 million, which is 82 per cent of the total of $38.2 million—went to people with taxable incomes of less than $20,000. I believe the opportunity exists in the future for corporate Australia to put in place programs addressing incentives for families in the workplace.</para><para>The sad fact is that there will always be people who fall through the cracks through marriage breakdown, financial hardship or any number of contributing factors. While all Australians would agree that a safety net should exist to provide for these people in hard times, the government makes no apology for trying to reduce dependence on the welfare system or for introducing policies that strengthen the importance and wellbeing of the family structure. The working poor must be given the opportunity to make inroads and to provide for themselves and their families. All of the initiatives I have spoken about give them an enhanced opportunity to do just that.</para><para>The Labor Party have sat in opposition for seven years and while they profess to champion the cause of the working poor—and I have heard a number speak in that vein today—no-one else has a clue what their policies are about or what they stand for. It is just empty rhetoric. They say that they are in favour of Medicare, but they propose tax rises in order to provide this support. They will increase taxes on a mother giving birth to her first child by abolishing the baby bonus, and they will abolish the private health insurance rebate. The price tag with Labor is always the same: higher taxes. This is further borne out by the comments of Senator Conroy. When caught out by a young school student asking how Labor would pay for their initiatives, he said they would have to raise taxes or scrap programs. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>15641</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>15641</page.no><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name><name.id>HH4</name.id><electorate>Scullin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My grievance today relates to the situation we confront in post-conflict Iraq. There has been an eerie silence on this since this parliament reconvened for the budget session; in fact, there have been only two speeches in this place devoted directly to Iraq and the consequences of the conflict. If you compare this to the two lengthy debates the House held on the ministerial statements of the Prime Minister in the autumn session, you will see how ironic the silence is. It is as if the job were all over—all finished. We have had the Prime Minister's ministerial statement, we have had a reply by the Leader of the Opposition and as yet we have had only incidental references to Iraq in the budget debate.</para></talk.start><para>The two issues I go to today are the credibility of the reasons for the deployment of troops and the incursion into Iraq by the coalition of the willing, and the lack of a credible program in post-conflict Iraq for winning the peace. There has been plenty of discussion—and in recent times the amount of discussion has become even greater—about the fact that the weapons of mass destruction which were used as the reason for a potential UN action against Iraq have not been found. We remember the debates here in which the Prime Minister, supported by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence, said on the basis of intelligence reports from both the United Kingdom and the United States that it was imperative that Australia be involved in an action to remove weapons of mass destruction from the hands of Saddam Hussein and the regime that was then in control of Iraq.</para><para>Much of this discussion was on the basis that the inspection team, UNMOVIC, set up by the United Nations was not doing its job. But what did Hans Blix say in his reports? He described the extent to which the inspections had been made, the actions that had been taken and the fact that nothing had been found, and he asked for more time. At no time did he say that his job was complete. At no time did he indicate that; in fact, he said the work needed to continue. But what was the cry in return? The cry was that it was up to Saddam Hussein to ensure that there was no conflict in Iraq by destroying the weapons of mass destruction, whilst at the same time the message coming out of Iraq was that they claimed not to have those weapons.</para><para>So it is very important to note that the Prime Minister's February statement, especially, was totally devoted to the connection of Iraq with weapons of mass destruction and with terrorist actions. In his March statement the rhetoric of the Prime Minister was still about WMDs—weapons of mass destruction. But, following the decision to deploy Australian troops to the Middle East, slowly but surely there was a subtle change in the way in which the case for that deployment was presented in this place. We all remember that day after day dorothy dixers were asked of the Minister for Foreign Affairs about human rights abuses by Saddam Hussein's regime. It was never in question that some of the things Saddam Hussein had done during his reign in Iraq—the way in which human rights were abused—were things that we would like to have seen wiped out. But that was not given as the reason for Australia's involvement with the coalition of the willing in the conflict in Iraq.</para><para>It strikes me as strange that, even in the aftermath, there has been no debate about the reasoning behind our involvement, because the way in which the decisions were made to involve Australia in this conflict are sure to form the basis for future decisions about different conflicts. There is no doubt that the United States itself has given no indication that it is not determined to follow this up with incursions into other regimes. The doctrine of pre-emption is there; it is written in history. That is the problem. The Australian public, in the context of Australia's involvement, needs to be sure that the basis for decisions made by the Australian government is credible and is of sufficient strength to require placing the lives of our troops on the line. </para><para>It almost goes without saying that all Australians are proud and thankful that the Australian troops that were deployed to Iraq and the Middle East and were involved in the conflict have returned home safely. We admire the fact that they did the tasks that were given to them by the government with great diligence and efficiency. But, having said that, I do not wish to see them placed in a similar situation on the basis of information that now seems to be at least a bit flaky. That is the debate we have got to have. I have said all along that on a number of these questions I hope to be proven wrong. The fact that we may be proven right about the doubtful nature of the way in which we got involved is cause for a great deal of disquiet. It has been said that the term `WMDs' should mean not `weapons of mass destruction' but `words of mass deception'. That is what we have to avoid in future.</para><para>I turn in conclusion to post-conflict Iraq and the difficulties that we see. Next week it will be two months since the American marines rolled into Baghdad. It is two months next week since the visions of the toppling of the statues of Saddam Hussein were heralded as a conclusion, heralded with great reception by the Iraqi people. But the truth behind those scenes is a much different picture. If you look at reports that are coming out of Iraq at present, you see the difficulties. There are some estimations that there are more victims of looting, by gunshots or stabbing, in hospitals in Iraq now than there were victims of the conflict. That is a sad thing, because the winning of a peace in the Iraqi situation is going to be difficult. It is something that we should be concentrating on; it is something which we should be seeing our way clear to attain. There are reports that the incidence of diarrhoea and cholera in Basra are even higher than normal, and that is of concern because the chain of supply of medicines is being disrupted by looting and other problems. If we look at the repair of important infrastructure, we see that as quickly as it is repaired somebody goes around and pulls it apart. As these things are happening in Iraq today, we need to concentrate more on our efforts to ensure that the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people are addressed.</para><para>We should also be looking at putting in place structures so that there is a sustainable administration to replace the discredited Saddam Hussein regime. This is important, and it will not be decided by military might. Perhaps the winning of the conflict was the easy part, because the technology was there. Now we have inspectors still looking for those weapons of mass destruction, and we remember that UNMOVIC, at the time of its last report, had something like 86 inspectors, at a maximum. There is now a 14,000-person Iraq Survey Group. Some 300 of those are inspectors; the rest will be interrogating people who have been captured as part of the conflict. I hope that they find more evidence than two empty containers that might have been used as laboratories, because it is important that a decision by a government to deploy troops into a conflict be on a better basis than we saw over the last few months in the run-up to sending troops to Iraq. It is important that, in future, the Australian people are treated with a great deal more trust about information—that we are not at the mercy of spin doctors who try to create a situation that is out of all proportion to the realities. I hope that the debate will be held, I hope that the truth will be known and I hope that the Australian public can have greater confidence in our decision makers. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

However, we are here to discuss appropriations and <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>. Not being an economist but someone who is very interested in matters of the Treasury and how they affect my community on the north-west coast of Tasmania and King Island, since 1998 I have had to try and assess the import, intentions and outcomes of various budgets by the current Treasurer. My assessment is that the Treasurer is a squanderer. He has squandered a massive surplus over these years. It was a surplus squeezed out of Australian families and workers by a variety of means—the GST, the insidious bracket creep, the $3 billion worth of additional levies that face Australians through increased costs, massive service shedding, asset sales and increased pay as you go user-pays services.</para></talk.start><para>Four years ago this squandering Treasurer promised that this very budget would be in surplus by $14.4 billion. Where has the surplus gone? I have heard just about every second member on the other side, when they got up to discuss this squandered budget, say, `We've had a terror campaign to wage, and we've had a war to wage,' as my colleague and friend the member for Scullin just alluded to. Let me tell you that that has not squandered $14.4 billion. Despite this being the highest taxing government ever in Australian history, today's figures show a surplus of just $2.2 billion—not $14.4 billion but $2.2 billion. Not all of it has been spent on fighting terror and a war in Iraq; it has been squandered on political decisions to buy votes.</para><para>On the budget's prediction of an average four per cent wage increase, a worker earning $40,000 today will, after 12 months, pay $480 more in tax on their income, yet they will be rewarded with only a $208 tax cut. That is a fact. The government is returning much less in tax cuts than it has taken through bracket creep. That is a fact. The smallest tax cut—that is, just $4 a week—goes to families earning $30,000 to $50,000 a year. </para><para>What do families have to look forward to from this budget? Most families will pay more for a trip to the doctor. Most families will pay more to educate their children. The tax changes will still leave average families paying tax of more than 60c for each additional dollar earned, and they will reduce benefits. Contrary to the comments made by a previous speaker, the member for Canning, that this government assists families to get out of debt traps and poverty traps, the facts speak for themselves—the government does not assist families. When families move into higher income tax brackets the government will tax them—gleefully take that tax and offer them $4 a week in return. That is the fact. What does the budget offer to the majority of struggling families in my electorate on the north-west coast of Tassie and King Island to cope with these increased costs and charges? Do not hold your breath, Mr Deputy Speaker—it is a whopping $4. We on all sides of this House will receive more. How is that fair, equal and equitable? Yet they are the words that this government used to justify me getting a larger tax cut than those on incomes much lower than mine. </para><para>Australian families have worked hard to make this economy strong, and the Howard government has failed to repay them for their efforts. Each of the government's hits to Medicare, education and family tax benefits on its own will far outweigh this miserly tax cut. The $4 a week tax cut will be swallowed up over 12 months by just five visits to a doctor who does not bulk-bill. These are the same families this government wants to slug an extra $5.50 every time they buy essential medicines. These are the same families that, due to the government's insidious clawback, will get, on average, $400 less in family tax benefits than was promised this financial year by the government. These are the same families that this Treasurer and those opposite expect to pay more in HECS or to take out loans to pay for their education and their children's education. These families face up to $32 a week in increased HECS debts and up to $125 a week in education loan repayments. These are the same families that will not be eligible for a health care concession for bulk-billing and that will be required to pay more for a visit to the doctor.</para><para>This squeeze on families has two effects. Firstly, it will increase families' costs far beyond any benefit gained from tax cuts as it shifts the cost of services more and more onto families and away from an ever-rapacious taxing government: `We'll tax you, but we won't give you the services; we'll tax you and you'll pay for these services'—a lovely system—`and, I'll tell you what, we'll do it in the name of choice.' People on low income do not have choices. Secondly, it will make our society less fair as it imposes a pay-as-you-go user-pays system based on the ideological hoax of providing so-called choice and market force delivery. The long overdue but wimpish tax cut in this budget will do nothing to take away from this Treasurer's record as the highest taxing Treasurer in Australia's history.</para><para>On the government's own figures, tax revenue will surge from $159.8 billion in 2002-03 to $166.5 billion in 2003-04. More than three-quarters of this extra revenue grab will be from extra tax on individuals. This is before considering the GST. Once the GST—that is, $32.1 billion in 2003-04—is added back in, as the government's two financial watchdogs, the Auditor-General and the Bureau of Statistics, say it should be, the real tax take is $198.6 billion. The highest taxing government in Australia's history has offered the smallest tax cut in Australia's history.</para><para>So where has this historic high tax take gone? It has been little more than squandered. The hoax of all this is that the tax cut is so miserable it does not even give back the bracket creep of $3.3 billion that the government is harvesting this year. Fewer than 10 per cent of taxpayers will face a lower marginal tax rate because of these threshold changes. Clearly, this Treasurer is the highest taxing Treasurer in Australian history. He remains the only Treasurer in our history to collect on average more than 17 per cent of national income in income tax. Even with his tax cut, income tax revenue will surge from $127.9 billion in 2002 to $134.2 billion in 2003-04.</para><para>There has never been an Australian government as reliant on income tax—that is, the tax on the income of individuals—as a proportion of its total tax take as this one is. It is rapacious in its tax intake, and this is despite the fact that the Prime Minister promised that the GST would take pressure off income tax. But why should we be surprised that that has not happened? The Prime Minister promised it and it has not happened, but why aren't we surprised? The Howard government in its budget remains addicted to introducing new hidden taxes or maintaining the $3 billion of existing levies and taxes by any other name. That is a matter I spoke about at length in this House on 5 March 2003—that is, these hidden taxes of $3.3 billion, these levies which they are still taking at a rapacious rate, particularly the Ansett levy. </para><para>The budget papers clearly outline a cynical exercise that this Treasurer and the Prime Minister have carried out to pay for their very unhealthy, unfair Medicare proposal—that is, `How shall we pay for this? How shall we give with the one hand and take with the other; how shall we use our smoke-and-mirror tricks that we have developed over the years to perfection?' It is quite simple: you reduce the funding to public hospitals by $1 billion to $1.5 billion to fund your Medicare package of $917 million. That is how you do it. For those who cannot sleep at night, I suggest they read Budget Paper No. 2; it contains very good reading to show you how you give with one hand, take with the other, have a little bit left over and beat your breast and stand up here unctuously and say that you are here to support the Australian people and their families. </para><para>I do not need to remind the House what this duplicity will result in in our public health institutions. This budget confirms Australia's worst fears about Medicare. But we should not be surprised because this Prime Minister, from the 1980s onwards, has shown that he is no supporter of Medicare; he never was and never will be. There is only one supporter of Medicare in this House, and it is the Labor Party. For the last seven years the Howard government has been running down bulk-billing—that is a fact—to a point where bulk-billing has declined by 12 per cent from the high of 1996. I notice that that is not a figure that those opposite brandish around very frequently in this House. After 13 years of Labor, bulk-billing was at its highest rate in the history of Medicare; now it is at its lowest, but we do not hear about that fact.</para><para>Both the Prime Minister and the health minister have refused to guarantee that bulk-billing will not continue to fall under the government's Medicare changes. The Howard government's Medicare changes can mean only one thing: many Australian families will pay more for a visit to the doctor. Under the changes, doctors will be allowed to bulk-bill concession card holders, but they will be given the green light to charge copayments for everyone else. It is a fact that there are seven million Australians who currently have pensioner and concession cards. That means that two out of three Australians will miss out under John Howard's plan; for them, bulk-billing will progressively diminish and perhaps eventually end.</para><para>Australian families who have two children and earn more than $32,300 a year are not eligible for a healthcare card. For them bulk-billing will end bit by bit and visit by visit to the doctor, and they will be asked to pay more for the privilege of seeing that doctor. The architect of Medicare, John Deeble, has described the effect of the government's package as follows:</para><quote><para>... there will be GP co-payments for most people ... These would be uncapped and unpredictable and only a fool would believe that they will not rise or eventually extend to other services.</para></quote><para>So, clearly, the Howard government's commitment to creating a two-tiered health system stands in stark contrast to Labor's belief in a universal and institutionalised health insurance system. Without easy access to bulk-billing—under threat as it is with the Howard government's unhealthy Medicare plan—access to medical services increasingly will rely on an individual's capacity to pay rather than on their health needs. I think you will find that substantiated by a very interesting parliamentary services paper by Amanda Elliott on 13 May 2003 on Medicare and universalism, which has some interesting definitions and commentary relating to this whole debate and also discusses the impact of these proposed changes on the concepts of universalism and institutionalised health insurance. It clearly establishes the principle that this government is now working on: in effect, to dismantle Medicare. </para><para>Effectively, the government's proposals further implement what I call a user pays, pay-as-you-go health system. Not only will a visit to the doctor cost more for most families but also essential medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will cost more. This government has persisted with its unfair plan to increase the price of essential medicines despite its admission that 5.5 million prescriptions for pensioners, concession card holders and Australian families will go unfilled because Australians under financial pressure cannot afford to pay the higher price. Price increases of up to 30 per cent for essential medicines on the PBS will hit the sickest and the poorest Australians hardest.</para><para>Just to add another real concern to this, we know that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is on the negotiating table for the so-called US-Australia free trade treaty. We all know what that could mean. US pharmaceutical companies are absolutely livid at this government's control—its monopoly, thankfully—on the prices we pay for these pharmaceuticals. If the United States pharmaceutical manufacturers can have that monopoly broken down in any way, of course it is to their advantage. Knowing that they are making money out of the system now makes you wonder what they would make out of it if we did not have this important health brake—this important safety brake—that the Australian government has on the pharmaceuticals available in this country. We know the PBS works because, as with Medicare, other countries are looking at our system and wanting to replicate it. There is no greater success or compliment than to have others try to replicate your system.</para><para>The other major plank in this government's drive to a user pays, market force system of essential service delivery is its so-called higher education reform package or, more accurately, higher education slug. The 30 per cent increase announced in this budget on the average HECS fee will cost students and their families $1,650 per year by 2005. That is $32 per week more that students may be required to pay. Under the Howard government the average HECS fee will be up by over 116 per cent. Student and family debt is set to increase dramatically under this package. We already know that Australian families now live under record debt levels. Yet all this government can offer is, `We'll increase the costs of medical health and higher education, and we'll give you four bucks and the GST. How's that?'</para><para>Students and their families will have to go into further debt to pay for their full fee university places. Student debt is projected to increase by $800 million. So far, under the Nelson proposals, students will be able to borrow $50,000—although I notice that the minister is now wavering on that and may up it. That is tremendous! Students could then have some more debt. That $50,000 will partially pay for students' university fees. They will be charged a rate of interest of 3.5 per cent plus CPI. That will add over $16,000 to a $50,000 loan, which is a new burden of $125 a week. You can just see the students and their families lining up to take up these loans so that they can go and do the most prestigious courses. They will be lining up to do them and saying, `Give me more debt.' </para><para>I have raised in this House several times the matter of the cost to families and students when students have to move away from home to study. There was not one mention of it in the budget. On top of all the other costs that they will be required to bear, you can add another $8,000 to $10,000 per year forked out of their pockets. That will make students go and do part-time work or part-time university to make up the extra costs to pay for their accommodation and living allowances. It is totally and utterly unfair. But there has not been a word about it in the budget—or from the other side either. You cannot tell me that they do not have students in these positions.</para><para>I put out a little pamphlet in my electorate called <inline font-style="italic">$4</inline><inline font-style="italic">:</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">it'</inline><inline font-style="italic">s not enough</inline>.

This year there are a number of budget initiatives that will have a direct benefit for the people of Paterson. These include roads, defence, health and education.</para></talk.start><para>Before I go into the specifics of the budget, I want to talk about economic management. When a government can manage the economy effectively despite forces outside its control, it can spend the money where it needs it most. There is no question that the Howard government has succeeded in managing the economy despite one of the worst droughts in history, a war, severe bushfires, the threat of terrorism and a downturn in the international economy. The Howard government has been able to pay back a hefty $63 billion of the $96 billion debt left by the Labor Party. This equates to an annual saving of $5 billion in interest payments. This is money that can be reinvested into programs to help families, support people who want to take on an apprentice, hospitals, securing our borders and quality education. It demonstrates the kind of economic management that is responsible, and it has been one of the great pillars of this government.</para><para>Let us look at the economic record of the Howard government. The Howard government has had $22.9 billion in total surpluses over the last five budgets. Debt has fallen to five per cent of GDP, Australia's AAA credit rating has been restored and more than one million jobs have been created since this government came into office. Interest rates are currently the lowest they have been in some 30 years, saving Australians about $3,950 on a home loan of $100,000. The overdraft rate for small business has dropped significantly, to around eight per cent, and we have one of the most strongly growing economies in the world.</para><para>When I look at the members opposite, I can only wonder what would have happened to Australia if Labor had been in power in the circumstances that faced this country last year. Let us have a look at Labor's record on the economy. The ALP racked up $80 billion of debt in their last five years of office, peaking at 20 per cent of GDP. Labor spent more in interest payments in 1995-96 than in education. Australia's credit rating was downgraded twice. The national unemployment rate was around 8.6 per cent when Labor left office; it peaked nationally at 10.9 per cent in 1992 and at over 17 per cent in the Hunter. Interest rates were 10.5 per cent when Labor left office; mortgage rates peaked at 17.1 per cent in 1990. Small business did it extremely tough, with the overdraft rate peaking at 20.5 per cent in 1989. With an economic management record like this, I can only imagine that Australia would be in real strife right now if Labor were running the country. Thankfully, they are not—not only because we cannot afford to go back to Labor but because Labor ignored the needs of all Australians. </para><para>I mentioned earlier that there are some particular funding measures in this budget that have had special significance for the residents of Paterson. Firstly, I would like to address road funding. There are many members here from both sides of the House who represent regional electorates and who understand the importance of road funding to regional communities. Good infrastructure does not just mean a safer trip for motorists. It also is an attraction for businesses and development in communities.</para><para>Dungog council, which is in my electorate, has over 100 roads that it has to maintain and upgrade, and it has quite a small income base from which to gather its funds. There is a range of projects that Dungog has been fighting for and that it has achieved through the Dairy Regional Assistance Program and the Regional Assistance Program. These projects are aimed at generating employment and stimulating the local economy. Equally important in Dungog is the need for better roads. It is an issue that I know Mayor Steve Low is very passionate about. Programs like Roads to Recovery are providing much needed funds to councils. So far this program has provided over $1.4 million to council roads in Dungog. I am pleased to see in this budget that the Roads to Recovery funding will continue for 2003-04, with $302.2 million being allocated, and that more funding will be provided to local councils from the Commonwealth.</para><para>Another federal road program which is popular in my electorate of Paterson is the Black Spot Program. This particular program provides funding to improve dangerous locations. Again, it provides a great deal of money to local councils. Some $45 million will be spent on the Black Spot Program in 2003-04. Again, I am sure that local councils are looking forward to the funds flowing their way. Since the Howard government came to power, over $7.5 million has been spent on black spots in Paterson. That includes $1.8 million on the Bucketts Way, $2.47 million on the Lakes Way, $300,000 on the Myall Way, over $400,000 on Nelson Bay Road and in excess of $1 million on roundabouts on the Raymond Terrace Road. These are but a few examples of where work has been carried out. Interestingly enough, the Black Spot Program is a program that Labor scrapped when in power—to the horror of many councils. Fortunately, the Howard government understands the importance of such funding; it not only has brought this program back to life but will continue to fund it into the future, because this program saves lives.</para><para>Aside from national roads programs that received funding in this budget, some key roads that affect residents in Paterson received funding. It was announced that the Weakley's Drive project will receive $25 million over three years. Many members here will know that this is a project that I have been working very hard to make happen and that I have been very vocal about. The project involves the intersection where the end of the F3 freeway meets the New England Highway. It is, without doubt, one of the most dangerous intersections in the Hunter region. At peak periods, motorists experience long delays to get through this intersection, and its record for crashes has been well documented. One of the major problems with the intersection is that a large range of vehicles have to use this road. There are all the vehicles travelling between Newcastle and Maitland, trucks from Brisbane and beyond to Sydney, heavy trucks from the recycling depot, trucks and buses from the transport hub, school buses, and motorists travelling from Thornton, Beresfield, Tarro and Woodberry. The region itself has outgrown this intersection. In order to keep up with local growth rates, an upgrade is urgently required. </para><para>I have spoken about this need many times here in this parliament. Since November 2001, I have put the case in three speeches, in a notice of motion, in letters to transport ministers and the Prime Minister, in a budget submission earlier this year, in a meeting with the minister in my electorate in December last year and in the petition presented on behalf of my community to this parliament. It is this work and effective lobbying by members of my community that resulted in this great budget announcement. Since the announcement has been made, it has been quite interesting to see a number of faces pop up taking credit for the funding. They are faces I have not seen before on this issue, but nonetheless the funding is there and this project will be delivered.</para><para>Another project that I am passionate about and that has received funding in this budget is the Bucketts Way. This road links the communities of Krambach, Gloucester, Stroud, Booral and Stratford to the Pacific Highway. It has been neglected by the New South Wales government for many years. Councils such as Gloucester and the Great Lakes have been drip-fed their funding for this road, which is an issue I took to the government during the election campaign. As a result, the Prime Minister committed $20 million to this road and in the recent budget the first allocation of funding was announced. In 2003-04, $3.5 million will be spent on a range of projects. I stress that this road is not a federal road—indeed, it is a state road.</para><para>The fact is that the Commonwealth has direct responsibility for two roads that affect the residents in Paterson: the New England Highway and part of the Pacific Highway. To help local councils and speed up the progress of the work of making this road safer for motorists the government will be investing some $20 million on the Bucketts Way over four years. It is funding that councils have welcomed, and I thank the Mayor of Gloucester Council, Barry Ryan, the general manager of Gloucester Council, Norm McLeod, the Mayor of Great Lakes Council, John Chadban, and the general manager of Great Lakes Council, Keith O'Leary, for their assistance and support for this project.</para><para>Another road project that received funding is the Karuah bypass on the Pacific Highway. I had the opportunity last week to visit the site of the bypass and look at the construction in progress. It is really an amazing feat of bridge engineering and is expected to be completed by December 2004, ending the long bottleneck at Karuah. The government will increase its funding on the Pacific Highway by over 34 per cent to $57.8 million this year. Defence projects in Paterson also received funding in the budget, which will create local jobs and boost our local economy. The government announced some time ago that it planned to purchase the airborne early warning and control aircraft and that RAAF Williamtown would play an important role in this project. Budget 2003-04 confirmed this role with the announcement that $19 million will be spent on the construction of the AEWAC headquarters. This project has already started and the parliamentary secretary recently visited the site for the start of that construction. </para><para>This project has significant benefits to our local area. The AEWAC headquarters will involve around 200 construction jobs and more indirect jobs related to the prefabrication, supply and distribution of material. Once operational, 350 permanent positions will be created at Williamtown. I believe they will start sometime in February. That is around $15 million in extra pay packets coming into Port Stephens, and there will be more families in the area. It also means that the government will be spending $2.1 million over 2003-04 for a child care facility at Williamtown RAAF base. Naturally, with more families coming into the area, support for these defence families is very important, so I welcome this child care facility.</para><para>The work being carried out at the RAAF base also means that a sewerage line will be going through the area. There has been a need in the community for this infrastructure for a long time now and the commitment given to RAAF Williamtown through this government and the importance it has in Australia's capabilities will also mean that facilities like the sewerage line will be part of the works to be carried out. That will help further development in the area. The budget also involved the announcement of $515 million in major capital projects for the AEWAC planes. This is a significant investment in Australia's defence capabilities and it shows the importance of RAAF Williamtown in defence planning in the future.</para><para>Budget 2003-04 saw an enormous commitment to health care in this country, and the government has been very supportive of health measures in the Hunter region. An example of that is the Maitland After Hours GP Service. This service has been so successful that it has now been granted approval to expand throughout the Hunter region. Last November this government—the Howard government—also announced a grant of $27,654 for the Hunter Rural Division of General Practice to develop and implement an after hours primary Medicare service plan. The after hours service is a project I would dearly love to see up and running in the Forster-Tuncurry and Cape Hawke Hospital.</para><para>Earlier this year, I invited the Minister for Health and Ageing to Paterson to meet with local doctors and representatives from the health industry. I would like to see more doctors come into the communities in my electorate, in particular in the townships of Karuah and Lemon Tree Passage. I would also like to see more bulk-billing in regional areas and as such I am particularly pleased with the measures in this budget that encourage doctors to do this. My office has phoned all of the GP practices in Paterson, and one of the problems we have found is that there is a heavy concentration of bulk-billing in some areas and no bulk-billing at all in others. So, it is not evenly distributed throughout my communities. For example, there are quite a few GPs in the Great Lakes area, but no-one bulk-bills. In comparison, the majority of doctors in Medowie, Beresfield and Raymond Terrace offer bulk-billing services. In Paterson, residents can access bulk-billing in Raymond Terrace, Tea Gardens, Beresfield, Shoal Bay and Medowie, but they are unable to access bulk-billing in Nelson Bay, Salamander Bay, Gloucester and Forster.</para><para>The initiatives announced in the budget will go a long way to attracting doctors to bulk-bill their patients, and as such I look forward to these initiatives being passed in the Senate to assist residents in Paterson. For example, doctors will receive incentives to bulk-bill 7 million people covered by a Commonwealth concession card and, of course, all Australians will remain eligible to be bulk-billed if their doctor chooses. For example, for doctors in outer metropolitan areas that cover some practices in the Hunter, GPs will have an annual payment of $10,250, while for rural centres it will be $18,500. </para><para>Another measure involves reducing up-front medical costs. At the moment there are many people who go to the doctor who have to pay their GP fee and then go to a Medicare office or claim facility. Under the changes proposed by this government, patients without a concession card attending participating practices will only have to pay the gap between the Medicare rebate and what their doctor chooses to charge. Once you have visited your doctor, there is no more to do and no more to pay. For regional areas in particular, I know this will be a very welcome initiative as many areas in my electorate rely on the easy claim facilities and are not as fortunate as those living in the city, who are able to visit Medicare offices.</para><para>My electorate also has a significant number of veterans and there are measures in this budget to assist them, with the introduction of a veteran access fee paid to local medical officers registered under the repatriation scheme. At a cost of $61.7 million over four years, GPs registered under the Local Medical Officer Scheme will be eligible for a veteran access fee of $3 for each consultation with an eligible veteran or war widow patient, in addition to the 100 per cent of the Medicare benefit schedule currently paid for gold and white repatriation health card patients.</para><para>The government is also committed to free hospital treatment for all Australians. To support our hospitals, the Commonwealth will provide an extra $10 billion to help them run public hospitals under the 2003-2008 Australian health care agreements. This means that over the next five years the federal government will provide states and territories with up to $42 billion to support the provision of free public hospital services. It is an incredible commitment to hospitals and I certainly hope the states sign up to it, even though they dismissed this funding out of hand before they even looked at the detail.</para><para>The government will also be putting more funding into training doctors and nurses. From 2004 there will be an extra 234 publicly funded medical school places each year. Students who take up these places will be bonded to areas of work force shortages for a minimum of six years. On top of that, there will be an additional 150 training places added each year to the GP training program. Up to 800 practices will also be able to employ a nurse or an allied health worker with the extension of the nurses program. This includes positions such as physiotherapists.</para><para>I will also add some points on education. Over the last year I have had the privilege of visiting many of the schools in my electorate which have benefited from Commonwealth funding. Gloucester Public School, for example, received over $1.7 million from the Commonwealth for the construction of a multipurpose hall, a covered outdoor learning area, a food service unit, a library and four new classrooms; St Josephs at Bulahdelah received over $539,000 for the construction of a building services store, three general learning areas, a library, a physical education store, a canteen and toilets; Salt Ash Public School received $350,000 to go towards two classrooms and to refurbish the administration area; Medowie Christian School received $300,000 for the construction of three general learning areas; and Morpeth Public School received $12,000 for a covered outdoor learning area—not to forget the federal funding for the Forster-Tuncurry campus which has opened this year. There is also a new school being built in Clarence Town, there will be additions at Anna Bay and Soldiers Point schools—and the list goes on. They are but a few examples of how the Commonwealth is supporting education in Paterson. It is investing in our schools and investing in our children's future. In 2003-04, the Commonwealth will spend $6.9 billion on Australian schools, which represents an increase of $528 million on last year. </para><para>I am also pleased that the New Apprenticeships scheme will receive $2.8 billion over four years. With a number of businesses in my electorate that take on apprenticeships, this is definitely a program that I am pleased to see continue into the future with increasing investment. This funding will build on the success the government already has in training, which has increased from 142,400 in December 1995 to almost 375,000 at the end of last year.</para><para>As I mentioned earlier, I am pleased with the funding that has been allocated to my electorate in this budget. There are also a number of programs that businesses or community groups in my electorate can benefit from, such as the Regional Solutions Program or Saluting Their Service, which I will continue to promote. As a federal member, I take a great deal of pleasure in the partnership you can form to bring a project to life. It is a partnership that this government has been very successful at, and I look forward to continuing that work over the next year. I commend the budget to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>15657</page.no><name role="metadata">Edwards, Graham, MP</name><name role="display">Mr EDWARDS</name><name.id>83R</name.id><electorate>Cowan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I first want to place on the record and recognise a matter which I know is close to your own heart, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie; that is, the tremendous win that Perth Glory Soccer had in Perth over the weekend. I think it is a great reflection of the team and the tremendous amount of work, dedication and professionalism which have emerged from that club—which have come about only after perseverance and a number of blues and problems. I do not think there is a sports lover anywhere in Australia who would deny Perth Glory their success.</para></talk.start><para>A crowd in the vicinity of 40,000 was there to see the victory, and I think that is a great tribute to Western Australian sports followers and to the sport of soccer—a sport which I know, as a past minister for sport in Western Australia, has gone a fairly long and tortuous route. It was tremendous to see Perth Glory gain the Grail over the weekend. I hope that their win and the profile it has given soccer will benefit all the young kids who love the game and all the soccer followers who want to see the game thrive in Australia. It was a tremendous effort which should be noted in this place. We talk about all sorts of things here—for example, politics and wars—and it is pretty easy to get stuck into each other but, as I think someone else remarked, this is much more important than life and death; this is about sport. I think sometimes that should help to put things into proper perspective—particularly after listening to the previous speech.</para><para>I do not want to go down the route of politics too much tonight. I want to talk about an issue which has interested me for some time: anti-personnel mines. I was fortunate enough to be invited by a group called MIVAC—the Mines Victims and Clearance Trust—to address a lunch in Tasmania on Friday and then to speak at a public meeting. MIVAC is an initiative of Australian Vietnam veterans who cleared landmines there and who have seen firsthand the devastation caused by these indiscriminate weapons. The group has broadened to include humanitarian aid workers, members of peacekeeping forces and also many interested civilians. </para><para>While MIVAC have started off in Tasmania, they have members from many other states and it is their intention to establish a chapter of MIVAC in each state and territory in Australia. I encourage Vietnam veterans from all states and territories to have a look at the tremendous work that this Tasmanian group is doing to see whether it can be emulated in other parts of Australia.</para><para>Primarily, the aim of MIVAC is to be a fundraiser. Money raised will be allocated to projects identified to the trustees by Australian de-miners and other non-government organisations or federal government agencies which are, or have been, involved with de-mining, health or education projects overseas. A few examples of the projects they are looking at include medical assistance to individuals affected by mine warfare; farming equipment supplied to communities, enabling them to hopefully become self-sufficient; assistance for Australian mine-clearing operations; provision of artificial limbs through an Australian medical team for those injured by landmines; and support to schoolchildren whose communities have been affected by landmines.</para><para>Secondly, MIVAC wants to undertake to communicate these projects to all parts of Australian society, including schools, clubs, the media and the general public, by giving talks, holding awareness meetings and giving interviews. MIVAC is a voluntary organisation and this will ensure that 80 or 90 per cent of funds collected will be effectively delivered to reach the people in need around the identified projects. The concept of MIVAC is not only to bring relief to those people living in areas affected by mine warfare, it also provides a positive focus to those who served overseas in any capacity and who are concerned about what has been left behind on their return to Australia. I want to congratulate this group of Vietnam veterans, and the others who have come around them to support them. I want to wish MIVAC well. They are a dedicated group of community minded people and I know that, given some of them have had the experience of laying mines, putting them in situ and training with them, they know the devastation that these things cause.</para><para>We attended a lunch at Parliament House in Hobart last Friday and there was a good roll-up of people. We then had a public meeting that was attended by about 25 to 30 people. There was a good representation from the community, including members of Soroptimist International. This group has just raised over $1 million worldwide for the provision of prosthetics for landmine survivors in their Limbs for Life campaign. Other groups there were the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, the Medical Association for the Prevention of War, the Quakers' peace and social justice committee, the Women in Black, the RAE Association, the Peace Coalition of Vietnam Veterans and a few others. I know the MIVAC group were very pleased to have tremendous support down there from Lara Giddings, who is the member for Franklin. I am told that she is happy to cross over her electoral boundaries in support of this group.</para><para>The issue of landmines is a big one. I have read a lot of statistics and facts. Sometimes you have to weave your way through them and try to interpret them, but there are estimations, for instance, that every year there are something like 25,000 mine incidents, mainly involving civilians. Of that 25,000, approximately half are killed and half are injured. Virtually all of those who survive require an amputation. Most of the children, young people and kids at play who stand on or activate landmines—I understand about 80 per cent of them—die. That is a horrific number. Even if people want to argue whether 25,000 is right or whether it should be 20,000 or 23,000, the fact is this: if the same number of people were dying every year as a result of, say, the SARS epidemic, there would be tremendous focus and support going into such an area. But because they are landmine victims and because they do not impact on the big dollars that are generated through tourism, and because the landmines campaign now does not have someone as high profile as Princess Diana was—who gave a tremendous profile and support to those people who were injured as a result of landmines—the focus and the profile is just not there, and it needs to be. As I said, if as many people died or were as seriously injured each year through a SARS virus then the tremendous amount of focus, media space and hysteria almost that we have seen in relation to SARS would bring tremendous focus to the other issues about which I am talking. I guess the reason that there is such a difference in the focus is that with SARS a lot of big international companies around the world are losing money because of the impact on tourism. Because that does not happen in the area of landmine victims, it just does not get that focus. </para><para>There has been some tremendous work done by governments in recent years, including the Australian government. But there has also been some tremendous work done by individuals, groups and people in the community—those people, for instance, who came together to fight the landmines issue with the international campaign to ban landmines. It has been a tremendous reflection of what can be done to address such serious issues when people from all over the world can come together, stand shoulder to shoulder and pull on some of the big corporations and governments across the world and demand that some action be taken.</para><para>There are and have been some tremendous things done, as I said, but it is true to say that the focus has come off this issue. It has been covered over by the talk of terrorism and some of the international things that we have seen happen in the last couple of years. As a result, this very deserving issue has lost some traction. An example of that occurred with the previous American administration. The US budget for 2000 included something like $60 million for research into finding alternatives to landmines—that is, finding other military equipment or strategies that could replace landmines. The US had a policy that, by the year 2006, it would have signed up to and moved to ratify the Ottawa convention. America is a country of great influence and leadership in these areas. It is a pity that it has now changed its policy. The current administration is reviewing that policy and saying that it will not be able to sign up by the year 2006 and it will not be spending as much money. It is not going to spend that amount of $60 million on trying to find alternatives to landmines.</para><para>It is not just America. China and Russia are a couple of the other countries which have yet to sign up to this agreement. Here is a list of some of the countries that have not yet signed up to ban landmines: China, India, Iran, Israel, North Korea, South Korea, Kuwait, Myanmar or Burma—where, unfortunately, we have just seen that Aung San Suu Kyi has been taken into `protective' custody again. Also on the list are Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, our fairly close neighbour Singapore, Sri Lanka—although Sri Lanka earlier this year did give a commitment that, as soon as it was able to, it would join the ban on landmines—Turkey and, as I said, the United States. A lot of work remains to be done. A lot of countries are yet to confront and deal with this issue. I know that America would say that it has a special problem on the Korean Peninsula. It does have a problem there and we recognise that, but ignoring landmines and turning its back on them will not help resolve the very serious issues confronting civilians when it comes to landmines. </para><para>In January this year, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines and the Landmine Monitor regional meeting held in Colombo, Sri Lanka expressed a number of concerns. Among them were that 19 countries of the region remain outside the Mine Ban Treaty, including eight of the 14 mine producers remaining in the world: China, India, North Korea, South Korea, Myanmar, Pakistan, Singapore and Vietnam. They also noted that five countries of the region—Brunei, the Cook Islands, Indonesia, the Marshall Islands and Vanuatu—signed the Mine Ban Treaty in December 1997 but have not yet ratified it. They also noted that China has the world's largest stockpile of antipersonnel mines—calculated at something like 110 million. Pakistan, the fourth largest, has six million mines; India, the fifth largest, has four to five million; and South Korea has two million in stock. They also noted that since December 2001 India and Pakistan have laid more mines than has been the case anywhere else in the world. </para><para>They called on a number of nations to accept a challenge in relation to these things and they called on all the countries of this region to support efforts to achieve that. The media release from the regional meeting states:</para><quote><para>All governments of the region to support efforts to achieve a total antipersonnel mine ban by non-state actors by, among other measures, allowing NGOs to safely engage non-state actors on this issue and by humanitarian mine action by non-state actors ...</para></quote><para>Further, they called for ASEAN and other regional and subregional bodies to develop a concrete and comprehensive program of mine action in the region, including advocacy and support of the Mine Ban Treaty. They called on all governments of the region to enhance their cooperation, coordination and transparency in all aspects of mine action between themselves and with Asian members of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, including its Landmine Monitor researchers. They also called on donor governments to provide adequate resources to support comprehensive mine clearance, mine risk education and survivor assistance programs in all mine affected countries in the Asia-Pacific. The last call was for all relevant stakeholders to continue to vigorously work towards the creation of a mine-free Asia-Pacific. </para><para>It is my strong view that every child in this world should have a birthright which includes the right to go out and play—to play with their friends without the fear of stepping on landmines. They have the right to go about the things that kids in countries do, such as collecting firewood or herding sheep, goats or cattle. As part of their birthright, every child should be able to do those sorts of things in safety. As long as there are these landmines and as long as countries continue to produce them, sell them, stockpile them and use them indiscriminately, that birthright will never be realised. </para><para>One doctor said recently that we are clearing this planet limb by limb of landmines. The great tragedy is that so many of those limbs belong to young kids and that, once they have stood on a mine and lost a limb, they are condemned to an incredible life of poverty and misery because of the social nature of these countries. We in this world can do better than that, and it is only through the leadership of countries such as Australia that we will be able to do that. I know that Australia has played a good, strong role. I support that, but I think that there is more that we can all do. I commend the bill. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>15661</page.no><name role="metadata">Kelly, De-Anne, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DE-ANNE KELLY</name><name.id>FK6</name.id><electorate>Dawson</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to deal with three topics tonight in discussing the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>: the education measures announced in the budget and also in the higher education reforms, the changes to health, and communications and the ABC. </para></talk.start><para>With regard to education, the $15.8 billion that has been put into higher education in this budget includes an additional $1.5 billion over 10 years specifically for higher education for a total of $10 billion over 10 years. It is imperative that education is affordable and accessible to students right across Australia and I believe that the changes that the minister has made, particularly with regard to higher education, will make it more accessible to students in rural and regional areas—and, I trust, more affordable.</para><para>Central Queensland University is a band 3 university and will get an additional loading of five per cent on the funding that they would otherwise have received. James Cook University in North Queensland, a band 2 university, will have an additional loading of 7.5 per cent. Further, many of the additional places will go to growth areas such as regional Queensland and, I understand, Western Australia. That is timely, because there have been many young people in those areas who have not had the access to higher education that perhaps their counterparts in other areas of Australia have had with the same—to use an old-fashioned phrase—matriculation result.</para><para>There is partial deregulation of the system for higher education. Universities will be able to set fees that recognise the socioeconomic reality of the pool that they draw their students from. That really is welcome. I believe that it is most unjust to expect that taxpayers in my electorate, those who are apprentices or perhaps going to work in the mills or the mines, should pay a proportion of the education of somebody who has the opportunity to earn considerably more than they do over their working life. At the same time, there is no differentiation: these taxpayers in my electorate equally subsidise those who are well able to subsidise their own education and those who do not have the capacity to do that. The HECS changes are very welcome in that regard, particularly for full-fee paying students who now have the opportunity of being able to pay their education off over a period of time as other students do.</para><para>The changes are very welcome for someone coming from a rural and regional area where there have been insufficient places in the past and where access has been difficult. In many cases, it still is; the local university campuses certainly need a broader range of subjects and faculties, but it is coming. I am pleased that the minister has resisted the pleas from those in areas of sandstone universities that attention be given to them. I firmly believe that higher education has to be accessible right across Australia, so I am very supportive of these changes. I believe they will benefit people in my area as they will students across Australia.</para><para>I would like to move now to health and the changes that the minister has announced in the Fairer Medicare: Better Access, More Affordable budget package. The government announced in April that they were going to invest $916.7 million over four years to ensure that medical services would be, again, more accessible and affordable—the sort of thing that we are trying to see in education. For the first time, we will see that doctors will have a financial incentive to bulk-bill patients with concession cards. That is very welcome. I understand, for instance, that from November this year a GP in a capital city will get an additional $3,500 a year as an incentive to bulk-bill those concession card holders; places like to Geelong or Newcastle will receive $10,250 a year; rural centres—Toowoomba, I presume Mackay, Cairns, Broken Hill—will receive $18,500; and remote and outer rural areas will receive $22,050. </para><para>For many GPs that will offer an incentive to bulk-bill those concession card holders, and that will be very welcome—as will the $3 payment for each consultation with a veteran who has a gold or white repatriation health card. Bulk-billing in Dawson is running at about 65 per cent; it is up from about 58 per cent two years ago, so it is on the increase. We are certainly not at the dizzying heights of some of the inner city electorates where it is in the 80 or 90 per cent range, nor are we in the very despairing situation of many of the more remote electorates where bulk-billing is very low. Nonetheless, a great number of people in my electorate go in and pay the fee to the doctor when they have finished being seen for the consultation. These changes will make it a great deal more attractive for those low-income families who do not have a concession card. They will just pay the difference between the Medicare rebate and whatever the doctor's fee is. For them, rather than having to pay out $40 or $45—perhaps a couple of times if they have a few kiddies with them or they have all got colds or whatever—they will be paying $10 or $15 up front and not having to worry about getting their Medicare rebate and going to the Medicare office, or Medicare Easyclaim, as they currently are. So it is a far more attractive proposition for patients, particularly low-income patients, who will not have to find the full amount up front.</para><para>As welcome as the minister's changes are—particularly those to private health insurance which allow for the insurance of out of hospital medical expenses—they do not change the fact that, ultimately, there are not enough doctors in rural and regional areas. When you look at the vast number of referred attendances in the cities, it is quite plain to see that there are more doctors in the cities than in the country. I firmly believe that the only way we will change this is by looking at geographically allocated Medicare provider numbers.</para><para>At the heart of Australian life is the principle that people should have fair and equal—or, at least, comparable—access to servcies; perhaps we cannot have access to every service, much as we would like to. It is not going to be possible to have a brain surgeon, for instance, working in every country town. But at present there is certainly a maldistribution of doctors across Australia. Ultimately, the government will have to face the fact that, while these incentives have great merit and will go some way to making health care more accessible and affordable, there is no way you can persuade doctors to leave metropolitan cities and serve in country areas. In particular, rural and remote areas and Aboriginal communities have even more difficulty than most of us do, and much stronger measures, such as geographically allocated Medicare provider numbers, will have to be taken in the future.</para><para>I turn now to the budget as it relates to communications and the arts, with special emphasis on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The ABC's triennial funding base will be maintained in real terms for 2003-04. The government will provide the ABC with $488.7 million in 2003-04, $501 million in 2004-05 and $512 million in 2005-06. The ABC will receive a total of $742.6 million in 2003-04, taking into account additional funding sources such as that for ABC Pacific. While there has been no overt increase in funding, funding is being maintained.</para><para>Those of us in rural and regional areas who depend on the ABC obviously would have preferred the ABC receive more funding. Nonetheless, we are in a difficult budgetary climate. We are facing one of the worst droughts in the last 100 years across much of Australia. Having seen Australia participate in a righteous war in Iraq, we are looking at the needs of our defence forces over the next 10 years and the requirement to properly resource our young defence personnel. This budget, in a difficult situation, maintains funding in real terms for the ABC and a whole host of other programs. The Treasurer has done very well; this budget balances our security needs with the need to go forward and the need to maintain programs. </para><para>There has been debate recently about editorial accountability in the ABC, but we should focus on financial accountability as well. I would like to deal with the latter first. In the recent Senate estimates hearings, one of the senators went fairly close to the heart of the problem. I will deal firstly with where I think financial accountability could be improved. Recently, in response to a question Senator Santoro elicited that there was a $25 million shortfall of which, I understand, $20 million was due to digital conversion and some technical shortcomings—factors that could have been better managed.</para><para>If financial accountability were much tighter—and this is not a criticism of the board or the new CEO of the ABC—there would be a great deal more sympathy with funding requests. I will give a small example from my own area. Radio National recently sent a Brisbane based reporter to do a reef based story in Mackay about jellyfish or crown-of-thorns starfish. The journalist was flown up for a couple of days, leading to accommodation costs and, obviously, the cost of the flight. Many of our local journalists in the ABC are very capable people and I am sure that several could have undertaken the role. When this journalist arrived back in Brisbane, Radio National decided that the editing could not be done there—and, while I know Brisbane is a bit of an outpost, I think they have pretty good capability to do editing—so the journalist was flown to Sydney.</para><para>It is only a small example, and it may just be one of those things that occur. I do not wish to be sanctimonious about it or pretend that every level of government—even my own electorate office—could not be more efficient in administrative matters. But I think it is symptomatic of the fact that there needs to be a sharper look at accountability. Channel 7 and Channel 9, for instance, have two overseas bureaus and fly journalists in and out as required. The ABC has 15 bureaus—in Amman, Auckland, Bangkok, Beijing, Brussels, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, London, Moscow, New Delhi, New York, Port Moresby, Tokyo and Washington. That is a considerable number of bureaus and it may well be that they are all necessary. On the other hand, it may be necessary to look at the way in which the existing funding is allocated and at whether some of it could not be used to better effect.</para><para>I would like to make a few points about the financial situation at the ABC. While there is concern over funding and the fact that funding is only being maintained, I would be very disappointed—as I have mentioned—if resources were diverted from rural and regional services to what appear to be extraordinarily well resourced studios in Sydney and Melbourne. I realise that this is a decision to be made by the ABC. I would certainly have liked to have seen additional funding. That has not been possible, although the funding is being maintained. There are areas of the ABC that could be looked at a bit more closely. I hope we do not see what normally happens in statutory organisations which are dissatisfied with their funding arrangements; I hope they do not decide to take funding from some of the most vulnerable parts of the organisation, which happen to be rural and regional services.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McGauran</name></talker><para>—And digital television. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Kelly, De-Anne, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DE-ANNE KELLY</name></talker><para>—Yes. I do not believe that that will be the case. I hope it will not, because our rural and regional radio services in particular are very much stretched. I know that the people in my own area work very hard and very long hours to put out their local news. The member for Corio is laughing! The ALP thinks it is funny that I mention that ABC people in rural areas work hard—they do. It is lovely to know that the ALP thinks that is funny. I am sure the member for Corio will mention it in his address.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I go now to the matter of editorial accountability. There has been quite a debate recently about bias in the ABC. Bias is a bit like beauty—it is very much in the eye of the beholder. But I think there is a wider question about balance and bias in the ABC which concerns the unique role the ABC has in Australia. It was entirely through the reporting on ABC radio in particular—and that includes News Radio and Radio National—as well as ABC television that most of my constituents had access to detailed information and a broad range of views on the recent Iraq conflict.</para><para>In rural areas most people do not get a daily newspaper. For those who do, the newspapers have very much a local focus. They might talk—quite properly—about local families who have people in the defence forces and so on, but there did not appear to be an opportunity to flesh out the arguments on both sides about the recent military action in Iraq. Local television, while it is fair and balanced, is not a medium that lends itself to complex debate; it tends to run short stories. That is entirely appropriate to the medium but, again, it is not easy in a 15-minute local or perhaps even statewide news bulletin to flesh out the arguments and provide the information people need to be able to make an informed judgment or form an opinion on something as important to Australia as the recent deployment of troops to Iraq.</para><para>It is here that the ABC really has almost a sacred duty. It is the only medium that can reach people right across Australia at any time of the day. Even if you live in one of the most remote parts of Australia you can probably still listen to ABC news, <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">World at Noon</inline>. In a complex world it will become increasingly important that the ABC be able to deliver to people right across Australia a broad range of views, detailed information and the opportunity to make an informed judgment on the events of the day.</para><para>The ABC needs in some ways to develop more of a corporate culture that enables it to focus on professionalism, and I think that Mr Balding, the new CEO, is working to enhance those credentials through greater attention to corporate governance. But that does not change the fact that only the ABC can deliver every day to my constituents and to our constituents right across Australia detailed information, a broad range of views, and opinions for and against whatever the argument of the day may be and allow them to make an informed judgment. It is absolutely fundamental in a democracy that every citizen be able to do that. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>15664</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>—the budget bill or, to put it more accurately, the sandwich and a milkshake bill. In doing so I support the amendment moved by the member for Fraser, Mr McMullan. This is a budget that lacks vision. It is a budget that punishes ordinary Australian families, and no amount of $4 sugar coating will make the bitter pill easier to swallow. The government gives with one hand and slugs with the other. A $4 a week tax cut is supposed to offset the disgraceful neglect of our health and education system. It does not, and people know it. </para></talk.start><para>The government's changes to Medicare will give doctors unrestricted access to the family's hip-pocket nerve. The smallest tax cut in history from the biggest-taxing government in history—that is what this budget is all about. The Treasurer wanted his `Tax cut' headline in order to cover up the grubby deal that is being handed down to families in regard to Medicare and education. The $4 a week means that if you wait two weeks you could go to the cinema for half-price on Tuesday night. Save for a month and you could get popcorn and a drink as well. Of course, if you wanted to take somebody with you that would be another month's worth of savings. That is what this government is offering: a milkshake and a sandwich if you are lucky.</para><para>At the same time bulk-billing is being destroyed. The government, in their classic Orwellian manner, claim they will fix Medicare. They are fixing Medicare in the way that a shady businessman would fix a racehorse or a greyhound—fix it so that it will never run again. They claim benevolence and generosity in putting $917 million into this so-called Medicare package when of course they are ripping $918 million out of the public hospitals to do it. In Greenway, over 94 per cent of doctors bulk-bill. The changes that are being proposed to end bulk-billing for all but concession card holders will adversely affect almost 27,000 households, or 80,000 people, in the Greenway electorate alone.</para><para>This budget does nothing to address the future of our country; it is a narrow, visionless piece of drab accounting. It puts back into the tertiary education system only a fraction of what has been ripped out over the past six years. Over $270 million has been cut from the federal funding of the University of Western Sydney since this government came to the treasury bench. Next year the University of Western Sydney will share a bare $68 million with the other 38 universities in Australia. Western Sydney is one of the fastest-growing regions in Australia. `Region' is a very important word. Western Sydney is a region; it is an identifiable geographical region with long-established boundaries. It has a population of some 1.7 million and comprises 12 federal seats, 24 state seats and 14 local government areas. The economy of the region of Western Sydney has a gross regional product of some $54 billion per year, making it the third largest economy in Australia—behind Sydney CBD and Melbourne. Yet the University of Western Sydney, which serves our region so very well, is not considered by the government to be a regional university. There appears to be no set definition for what a regional university is. It seems that a regional university is whatever the government wants it to be on any given day, and it changes for whatever reason the government cares to think of at any particular time. The mission statement of the University of Western Sydney is: </para><quote><para>To be a University of international standing and outlook, achieving excellence through scholarship, teaching, learning and research and service to its regional, national and international communities, beginning with the people of Greater Western Sydney.</para></quote><para>The words `region' or `regional' appear eight times in the statement of mission goals and values of UWS. The statement finishes with a list of core values. The final one, placed there for emphasis, is `relevance and responsibility to our communities'. </para><para>I challenge the Minister for Education, Science and Training—who is here in this chamber—to explain to the House and to the 1.7 million people who live in Western Sydney why their university, the one that was established specifically for their region, is not considered a regional university. It took the University of Sydney and the University of Melbourne 100 years to establish themselves as centres of excellence. It has taken many other universities decades to establish their reputations. UWS is a new university, and the funding cuts it has experienced since 1996 have had the effect of tying one arm behind its back. Over the next three years, there will be 510 fewer students at UWS than there are today. Our population is growing, and this government is presiding over falling numbers at our universities. Falling student numbers, budget cuts, fee increases and higher student debt are the enemies of access, and access is the key to equality.  </para><para>This budget represents fee increases, this budget represents higher student debt, this budget is the enemy of access and equality. It is not fair, it will not create a fair society. It will not allow future generations to share in the opportunities that time and innovation will bring. The budget allows universities to increase their fees to students by 30 per cent above HECS. The new student loan system, ensuring a real interest rate of three per cent above CPI, will raise an extra $800 million in student debt. HECS payments will increase by $32 per week—eight times the $4 tax cuts. The new system of student loans, ironically called HELP, will add an extra $16,000 to a $50,000 loan—an extra $125 per week in repayments and over 31 times the $4 tax cut. The government gives with one hand and slugs with the other. </para><para>To add insult to injury, the federal government has also walked away from TAFE. Not one more cent was in this budget to support TAFE. There are no additional places at TAFE to address the serious skill shortages facing Australian industry. The world is changing and the new technologies are the future of our society. If our people are to share in the prosperity that these new technologies can bring, then we must ensure that they receive adequate training. TAFE is a vital rung in the education ladder, and yet this government has no interest in it. At a time when we need to be investing in our nation's future through improvements in our education system, this government is walking away from that responsibility. </para><para>There are now twice as many students in TAFEs as there are in universities, yet there is still a huge unmet demand for places. Across Australia there were around 38,000 unmet places last year. At the Western Sydney Institute the figure was over 3,200. Casualisation of the teaching work force at TAFE might look good to the accountant but it does nothing for the long-term education requirements of the sector; and surely the education outcomes for the students are more important than the accounting outcomes for the institutions. Some people may say that TAFE is a state issue—pass the buck. It is too easy to pass the buck. The federal government must take its share of responsibility, because this is an issue that affects everybody.</para><para>Funding cuts and funding freezes in the TAFE sector must stop. If we are to compete, vocational education is vital. Well-resourced TAFE colleges with equipment that is not obsolete are fundamental. What employer will hire somebody if they have been trained on a machine that has been obsolete for five years? TAFE requires support and constant upgrading or it will lose its relevance, and Australia will be poorer for it. </para><para>Labor has a plan for education—a new deal for Australian families. It starts with early childhood learning, because the formative years are so critically important to an individual's future. Labor's education plan starts with early childhood and it never ends. We believe in lifelong learning. Our communities change, our societies change and, as time goes on, challenges grow and we must have a population that is able to adapt. Flexible lifelong learning programs, training and retraining, are the keys to creating a flexible and adaptable work force. </para><para>The government's only response to this critical need for our future seems to be fear and fridge magnets. The future that we can create with investment in education, training and the skills of our work force will be nothing if we do not do something to address the catastrophic effects of the neglect of our natural environment. Salinity, land clearing and overdevelopment are destroying our natural resources. The new housing estates in the north-west sector of Sydney are being built on the breadbasket of Sydney. Some of the best farming land in the country has now been built out by residential development. Twelve per cent of New South Wales agricultural output comes from around one per cent of the land, located in the Sydney basin. This is worth around $1 billion annually, with a flow-on effect of up to $5 billion. With every new housing development, valuable and, more importantly, productive agricultural land is being lost. Drought is destroying the inland farms and, as a consequence, we are having to increasingly rely on imported food products. We are losing coastal farming land to development and inland farming land to salinity and drought. It is simply unsustainable in the long term.</para><para>The Natural Heritage Trust set up by this government has been exposed as a pork barrel joke. The environment is a serious problem and we need to have serious solutions. We need a national strategy and we need national leadership. Labor will provide that leadership. Labor will ratify the Kyoto protocol, which will help address the catastrophic effects of global warming. Labor will save the Murray, the lifeblood of many farming communities. Simon Crean, our leader, announced in his budget reply that Labor will establish the Murray-Darling Riverbank. A new government corporation, Riverbank will be kick-started by federal funds and will attract state government and private sector contributions. Riverbank will invest in innovative projects that will set a new direction for water use in Australia. Federal Labor will provide the national leadership that is so desperately needed in this vital area.</para><para>Health care is about our future, and the government wants to tear it down. Education is about our future, and the government will not invest. The environment is about our future, and the government walks away. Another pressing issue regarding our future is superannuation, and again we see the government sitting idly by and hoping nobody will notice that they are doing nothing about it. The Treasurer wants to reduce the superannuation surcharge. It was not in this budget; there was no mention of superannuation in this budget at all. This is the great reform that the Treasurer wants. Of course, as is usual with this government, unless you earn $90,500 per annum, his changes will not affect you at all. This is a government again looking after the top five per cent of income earners in this country while ignoring the average Australian family. Labor will address this by giving every working Australian a superannuation tax cut. Labor will cut the superannuation contribution tax from 15 per cent to 13 per cent, which will mean thousands of dollars extra for people's retirement.</para><para>It was Labor which introduced compulsory superannuation to help deal with the long-term impacts of our ageing population. Only Labor had the long-term vision—something that has not changed in the intervening years. The Treasurer wants high-income earners to get more in retirement. Labor wants to give everybody more in retirement. The choice is startlingly clear. On the government side, you have ministers interested in feathering the nests of the already well off. On this side, we want everybody to share in the wealth that is created by the hard work of everyday Australian families. As Joe Caddy, the chair of the social policy and research committee of Catholic Welfare Australia, wrote recently in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on the budget: </para><quote><para>I am afraid that we will wake up in 10 years and discover that the unique egalitarian nature of this nation has simply faded away. We have to reverse this trend rather than fuel it, as the budget has done.</para></quote><para>In the same article, Mr Caddy also wrote:</para><quote><para>Make no mistake—we are heading for two Australias. We have more wealthy Australians today than we had 10 years ago, while the number of Australians relying on government benefits and assistance from welfare organisations is on the increase. Poverty is not restricted to those without jobs but includes the new working poor.</para></quote><para>To support that statement relating to more wealthy Australians than ever before, we have an article in today's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> entitled `The rich will double their wealth in three years'. Part of the article says:</para><quote><para>According to a recent study by the Boston Consulting Group, there are 500,000 rich households in Australia, and they control more than 63 per cent of the nation's wealth. </para></quote><para>I believe that is a very telling statement, and it is an independent verification of the statement from Mr Caddy. A further quote from Mr Caddy is:</para><quote><para>The budget involved a major escalation of the push to force Australians into a more user-pays model for basic social services. The burden of these extra costs will fall on the working poor and will exacerbate existing inequalities.</para></quote><para>In the region I represent, Western Sydney, one thing we are not short of is reports. Now we have another report commissioned by WSROC, the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils. This report shows that areas around the major cities in the region—Penrith and Blacktown—have reached saturation point and now there is almost an equal flow of people out of the area as there is into it. But the area still suffers from growing pains arising out of being Australia's fastest growing residential area. There have been some major improvements in road construction in my electorate, such as the completion of Old Windsor Road and the commencement of the Western Sydney Orbital. I am pleased to see that construction has commenced on the orbital with some funding from the federal government. However, that road will have a toll—a toll that is quite unjust for the residents of Western Sydney. To travel in their own area on what is really a part of a national highway, they will have to pay a toll. It is predicted that for people from areas such as Glenwood to get into Blacktown, which has the major shopping centre in the area, they will have to pay 80c initially. It is unfair for local residents to have to pay to travel on what is really their own suburban road. However, it appears as though that decision has been made.</para><para>The area is still suffering from a lack of overall planning from a federal government perspective. We believe that the federal government should be more involved in this type of general planning, particularly for new residential areas. In most cases, we have seen considerable residential development prior issues relating to public transport, employment, education and health services being addressed. On the socioeconomic side, we need to understand that new and thriving suburbs are being built on top of infrastructure provided years ago for what are now well established areas. The rail system, for example, has not kept pace with population growth or distribution. These new residential areas will bring their own challenges in the future—two incomes being needed to continue to pay the mortgage and a falling birth rate are two issues that will impact on future generations.</para><para>The British sociologist Catherine Hakim, whom some of the members of the government side often quote, has warned in her book <inline font-style="italic">Models of the family in modern society</inline> that substantial debt required to finance a home purchase means that some women delay child rearing while others who would prefer to be at home with their children are forced to work full time. Mr Coller from the Anglican Rooty Hill office, referring to assistance given to working poor families in Western Sydney, said, `Over 40 per cent of a family's budget goes towards housing costs, the highest in history.' </para><para>What is happening is that we are expanding too fast and we are not laying down the necessary economic, physical and social infrastructure to sustain our communities into the future. Economically we are becoming a divided community, as Joe Caddy pointed out. Many people are unable to keep up due to age, ill-health and underemployment. According to the Bureau of Statistics, 574,000 Australians were underemployed last September as well as 628,000 being unemployed. Over the past 10 years we have seen unemployment, long-term unemployment and underemployment all increase, while many in full-time employment are now working in excess of 40 hours per week. What Labor stands for and what we all should stand for is a fairer society. That is why the retention of Medicare and bulk-billing is so important. </para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you would agree with these remarks. Let us be generous. Let us even be extravagant. Let health care be a growth industry. Let us attract more young people into the medical professions by ensuring that they are generously rewarded for their skills and commitment and the responsibilities they accept. This budget is not a budget for the future and it is not a budget for families; it is a budget that will create problems in the long term. It is a cynical budget, giving a pittance with one hand while slugging a fortune with the other. It will make life tougher for ordinary Australians over the long haul. I am sure all Australians recognise this and will judge the government accordingly. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>15669</page.no><name role="metadata">Hawker, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAWKER</name><name.id>8H4</name.id><electorate>Wannon</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise in this debate on <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline> to support the eighth Costello budget. I congratulate the Treasurer on yet another excellent budget, one that I think every member of the government is very proud of. Also just in passing I must note a comment made by the member for Greenway. He lamented the fact that in New South Wales a toll is being placed on a road. I would hope that he might extend such remarks to the state Labor government of Victoria, which is now talking about trying to build the Scoresby Freeway. The Commonwealth promised $425 million to make sure of its being built. The state would only have to match that, but it is apparently not prepared to do so now and wants to have a road toll instead—and I am sure the member for Greenway would disapprove of that too. </para></talk.start><para>As I say, this is another excellent budget by the Treasurer, ably supported by the Prime Minister and every member of the government. There are a few salient points we ought to reinforce yet again about the fact that this budget, contrary to the comments of some opposition members, reduces taxes—there is an income tax cut there—and at the same time continues to produce a surplus, which is sound economic management. It is sound economic management particularly given that there is a drought which has caused so much devastation across so much of rural Australia, given the fact that we have had to finance our part in the Iraq war and, of course, given that there has been a big increase in security spending. I know that all members would agree with the sentiments of increasing our security, but we also know that it has to be paid for. When you put all that together, I think it is a very impressive result. </para><para>It goes further than that. This budget talks about a 3¼ per cent growth in the coming year, and I think we ought to put that into some sort of context. While 3¼ per cent is reasonably impressive, when you look at other countries, particularly OECD countries, it is extremely impressive. Looking at the latest <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> and at the <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> poll of gross domestic product forecasts this year and next year, we find that not only does Australia come at the top alphabetically but it also comes at the top on the growth figures. You could not get a better example of just how high Australia is rated in the world when you read in the <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> that we are at the top of the table when it comes to growth in this year and in the next year amongst OECD countries. That is a measure of how this government is helping Australia to perform well above the average. Even the Reserve Bank—which is never noted for overstating the case—in its May <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>, in which there is the statement on monetary policy, makes the observation that the Australian economy `has continued to perform relatively well against the background of a difficult international environment'. That from the Reserve Bank gives support for the excellent work that the government, particularly the Treasurer, is doing.</para><para>We could compare that with some of the comments we have heard from the opposition. Frankly, all they talk about is wanting to increase the cost of health care. They talk about possibly removing the rebate on private health insurance. As everyone knows, that is just code for increasing taxes. Because we now have a significant proportion of the Australian population back in private health cover, to remove part of that would do nothing more than increase costs, which is the equivalent of an increase in taxes. Likewise, those opposite seem to have great difficulties with the excellent work that the minister for education is doing with his higher education policy—which I think is quite an outstanding effort. As has been pointed out in this chamber day after day, that policy is a way of allowing more Australians to get to universities. Yet the opposition seems to be constantly carping, bringing up negatives and failing to observe what clearly is a very beneficial policy for young Australians and, indeed, for the whole of Australia.</para><para>I would now like to turn to a couple of other issues. The first one is the question of budget equity and financing inside the parliament. I am sure that all honourable members will be quite interested in this and I hope that they will listen closely. Earlier this year I put a question on notice to the Speaker. I wanted to get some indication about the comparison between the budget of the Department of the House of Representatives and that of the Department of the Senate. From this some very interesting figures have come forth. I wanted to find out what the comparative budgets for the two departments in this building were, how they related to the number of members and senators and, particularly, what that meant for committees. As Chairman of one of the standing committees, I am very conscious of the difficulties House standing committees are facing in trying to provide proper backup and service to the members all-party committees. I think that all members appreciate the value of our House committees and support them.</para><para>These figures tell a very interesting story. Let us start from the premise that members and senators are treated equally in most ways. We have equal salaries and we have, basically, the same allowances, travel entitlements, superannuation and so on. It raises the question: how does that translate into the departments? Interestingly, if you look at the overall budgets for the departments' activities you find that, again, they are the same or almost the same. They are both just over $28 million. Then you start to think, `Hang on, what about when you translate back to the number of members and senators?' If you just do simple arithmetic you find that, according to the department of the House, it is $192,480 per member. The Department of the Senate seems to have some difficulty in answering that question. They say: </para><quote><para>This figure is not related to the number of senators.</para></quote><para>I thought that that was exactly what the question was. They go on to point out:</para><quote><para>The security costs for all of Parliament House, including its environs, are shared equally by the Department of the Senate and the Department of the House of Representatives.</para></quote><para>That is interesting but not necessarily the same point. It is one thing that it is equal, but it does not go back to the question of senators and members. As we all know, there are twice as many members of the House of Representatives as there are senators. Yet the budgets are the same.</para><para>When we try to go back to what it means for committees we find that each department gives an estimate of the cost of committees, which is only part of this $28 million. I then asked the question: how many committees are there for each department? The Department of the House of Representatives has 28 committees and the Department of the Senate, in its response, says that it has 33. However—and it is important to note this—it says on its web site:</para><quote><para>In October 1994 the Senate restructured its committee system by establishing a pair of standing committees—a References committee and a Legislation committee—in each of eight subject areas.</para></quote><para>In other words, the same committee does two lots of work: legislation and references. So to count them as 33 is really a bit of double counting. If we bring them back to 25 we then can start to look at the budgets of the relative committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Remember: there are twice as many members as there are senators. According to the figures produced by the department of the House, the average actual budget per committee is $225,000-odd. The Senate tried to say that it was $245,000 but, if you cut the number of committees back to 25, the actual figure is $323,320, which is nearly a third, or nearly $100,000, more.</para><para>My point in asking this question was to highlight the fact that House of Representatives committees, if you look at it from one perspective, are working on very tight budgets. I think that those of us who are very much involved in those committees recognise that it is not easy. The committee secretaries have to share two committees nowadays, which they did not have to do in the earlier days, and that is putting a lot of strain on the staff. Of course, it means that the workload has certainly become far greater.</para><para>The question then is: if the Senate believes that it needs so much for its committees—nearly $100,000 more for each committee—why is it that the House has to make do with so much less? I think that is a very important question, and it is one that I hope will be addressed. Frankly, I believe that members of the House deserve better. I am not trying to suggest that the Senate does not need the number of committees it has or the resources it has. I just think that it seems a trifle curious that there is such an imbalance between the two chambers of this parliament when it comes to the resources that are being allocated to standing committees.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr King</name></talker><para>—Are you suggesting that we should abolish the Senate?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hawker, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAWKER</name></talker><para>—I had a very interesting interjection there, which I had better acknowledge, but I do not think it is quite relevant to tonight's debate. I would now like to turn to another subject in the time available: the impact that bushfires have had on Australia this year, and some of the consequences of them. A very interesting conference was organised back in March. It was addressed by Dr Phil Cheney of the CSIRO. I think that anyone who has been involved with bushfires would know that he is probably Australia's most pre-eminent expert on the whole question of bushfires and bushfire control, having had four decades of experience working in that area. Dr Syd Shea, Professor of Environmental Management at the University of Notre Dame Australia and former head of Western Australia's Department of Conservation and Land Management, and Dr Kevin Tolhurst, of the Forest Science Centre at the University of Melbourne, also addressed the conference. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It was a very useful conference that brought out some of the frustrations that so many in Australia are feeling nowadays about the way the bushfires were allowed to occur—and I choose those words carefully—the impact they had and the reaction afterwards when so many of those who probably should have been a bit more open in admitting their failures and where things had gone wrong were doing so much to try to cover up—and I choose the words `cover up'—what has been a real policy failure in Australia when it comes to managing our fire prone forests.</para><para>At the conference, the experts were told that prescribed burning was the most effective tool for controlling major bushfires in Australia—something that most people know but something that has been constantly worked against by a number of policy decisions. Prescribed burning is also seen as environmentally beneficial, because it replicates the conditions under which Australia's forests and scrub lands evolved. There is no doubt, as the conference was told, that the devastation that occurred in eastern Australia's forests, parks and farms at the beginning of this year was cruelly exacerbated by the failure to conduct adequate prescribed burning. That is a very important point.</para><para>It is difficult not to conclude that much of the 1.6 million hectares of parks and forests that were destroyed this year could have been saved had proper prescribed burning been carried out. The question is: why was it not carried out? The three experts noted that there were limitations on the skills and, equally importantly, the resources available to conduct prescribed burning and that there were elements of community opposition to such burning. That is a nice polite way of saying that, as the delegates from fire affected regions put much more strongly, there has been a lot of ill-informed debate going on in Australia in the last few years, particularly from some of the green groups. They have been the ones most opposed to prescribed burning and, equally, those most vocal in trying to expand the size of our native forests and parks, at the same time not demanding of the state governments—because it is a state responsibility—adequate resources to properly manage them.</para><para>This failure of policies has brought about the devastation that we saw earlier this year. It is not just the devastation within the public land, but also the devastation on adjoining private lands that have been burnt out, and burnt out so comprehensively, in a way that has caused extreme misery for those who are affected.</para><para>The point that seems to get lost on some of these green groups is that, if the scale of human suffering—that is, the burnt out homes and the scorched farms—was terrible, the damage to the natural environment was awesome. It is a cruel reminder to say that millions of small marsupials and other native animals died in these infernos. The question is not what we did to try to stop it but what we did not do that allowed those fires to reach such horrific proportions. There is no doubt that one of the points that has to come out of the inquiries—one of which is being conducted by the House of Representatives—is that there are obligations on public land managers similar to those on private land-holders when it comes to helping prevent the spread of fires. Clearly the failure to prevent the build-up of fuel on neighbouring public lands was a significant factor in the intensity of the fires that struck in their own areas. What better example is there than Canberra, with over 500 homes lost? </para><para>But it was not only the fuel. A lot of these areas were choked with noxious weeds, providing a sanctuary for feral cats, dogs and goats, which in turn invade private property. It is not just the fires; it is all the other problems associated with the lack of resources to manage these public lands. That is the sad thing about it. The ACT Sustainable Rural Lands Group made a presentation. Their evidence was very similar to the evidence they gave to the ACT Coroner investigating deaths from fires in 1991. It really is quite tragic.</para><para>Unfortunately, nowadays we have state governments that are far more enthusiastic about creating electorally popular national parks than they are about funding the management of those parks. It has certainly come back in spades with these horrific fires and the tragedy that has come with them. Despite many warnings, people have refused to face up to this.</para><para>The question that often comes to my mind is this: why haven't the media joined in with the local knowledge and questioned state governments more? Unfortunately, it is hard not to conclude that this is just further evidence of the ever widening gap between the city and the country. People in the city no longer appreciate the experience of those in the country who have lived with fire all their lives, who know how to manage the risk and whose views are being increasingly ignored, at the peril of our parks.</para><para>One aspect is interesting, and I will develop this theme further on another occasion. The Institute of Public Affairs, in a recent publication, made the observation that only 10,000 hectares of Australia were logged in the last year, and 1.6 million hectares were burnt last summer. All this timber was either lost or partially destroyed. It does seem that we have an extraordinary imbalance. Pressure to reduce or eliminate logging in public lands is coming through from those who claim to be conservationists, yet at the same time they are quite happy to see the land locked up, with a build-up of fuel that creates these infernos when they come through every few years. It is important to remember that often they come through from natural causes, started by lightning and in other ways.</para><para>It is worth just looking back at a bit of history on this. The management of our public lands is not something that has come into question recently. Management through fire—the judicious use of fire—is something that has been around for a long time. I recently looked at a publication called <inline font-style="italic">The People of Gariwerd</inline><inline font-style="italic">:</inline><inline font-style="italic">The Grampians</inline><inline font-style="italic">'</inline><inline font-style="italic"> Aboriginal Heritage</inline>. It is about the Grampians in western Victoria. This book documents some of what the early European settlers found when they came to Australia. For example, in 1840 one settler wrote:</para><quote><para>... on our way we met a party of natives engaged in burning the bush, which they do in sections every year. The dexterity with which they manage so proverbially a dangerous agent as fire is indeed astonishing. Those to whom this duty is especially entrusted, and who guide or stop the running flame, are armed with green tree boughs, with which, if it moves in the wrong direction, they beat it out.  </para></quote><para>The book goes on to talk about firestick farming and how the Aboriginals managed this land. The question is: why have we forgotten this?</para><para>In conclusion, I would again like to say what an excellent budget the Treasurer has brought down and to again raise the question of why it seems that the Department of the House of Representatives is being treated less than fairly when it comes to the budget. Finally, to come back to the bushfires, I would like to say that I hope that, from these inquiries, particularly the House of Representatives inquiry, we are going to get some commonsense brought back into the whole question of management of public lands so that we can try to manage them better and not see infernos and the tragic loss of not only private property but also many of our native animals.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>15674</page.no><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr QUICK</name><name.id>AV5</name.id><electorate>Franklin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This budget, like so many put up by the Treasurer, has disappeared off the media radar screen, but not for most Australian families. The budget, like those stones I used to flick across the river, bounced several times and then sank without trace. True, it raised some instant comment as it skimmed stylishly. True, it sent out large ripples as it sank beneath the surface, and those ripples did cause wash around the edges. In discussing this budget, I am not going to boringly rave on about statistics, percentage increases and alleged decreases, or whether or not states and territories have matched funding. Rather than ideologically attacking the budget, I believe it is far better to realistically assess the budget against its impact on families in my electorate. Let us take off the blinkers and the rose-tinted glasses and genuinely see what it means for them. Following this, I wish to raise issues that I see as crucial to the development of society and the well-being of its citizens here in my electorate and throughout our great country, then I will judge the budget's influences on those issues.</para></talk.start><para>My electorate, like those of all of us in this place, has individual needs and particular requirements. A predetermined budget template does not necessarily see those needs met and addressed. I tried to look at this budget's impact on my families—I will attempt to personalise it. Having various ministers stand up in this place and wax lyrical about the hundreds of millions of dollars being proposed to be spent in the out years is fine, but what does it really mean for families in Bridgewater, Lauderdale, Blackmans Bay, Cygnet, Lindisfarne and Dover? Families in my electorate need jobs and job security. Those with pre school-aged children want to be able to access child care facilities, and be able to afford this care. They want their school-aged children to have the best available cost-effective educational opportunities. They want to be able to access a doctor locally, and preferably one who bulk-bills. They want to be able to readily access Job Network programs if made redundant. They want to be able to have their frail, aged parents gain places in hostels and nursing homes.</para><para>Health is the right of all Australians. It should not matter where you live or how much you earn. All Australians are entitled to access affordable quality health care. The consequences of the philosophy that people should pay for this right can be seen when a sick child is not treated by a doctor because her parents simply do not have the up-front fees, or when a 94-year-old man is being separated from his lifetime partner because he does not meet the subjective bureaucratic ACAT criteria. These cases—the reality of what is happening to people in my electorate—are what the budget should address so that we can pride ourselves in our universal health system, that is for all Australians. Health is one of the most important issues for Australian families. The lack of funding for the state governments in the Australian health care agreements is not understood in the glib media coverage it receives, but it certainly is by someone on a hospital waiting list who understands that more funds are needed if his or her operations are to be scheduled quickly. I believe all Australians have the right to expect access to doctors and to a health system that treats people with dignity and respect throughout their lifetimes. </para><para>I have nothing but respect for health professionals but, no matter how good these people are, without a properly funded and resourced system there are going to be major problems. This may seem unsubstantiated, so I would like to share some cases that my constituents have brought to my attention. Hospital waiting lists are of great concern to many people. One of my constituents recently wrote to me:</para><quote><para>I had an unfortunate accident and was fitted with a colostomy bag which the hospital informed me would be removed in six months time. Now two years later on I rang the hospital to see what was happening only to be told it will be several more years before this minor surgery can be performed. I understand the hospital system is over loaded but this is totally unacceptable and inhumane way to treat tax payers and citizens.</para></quote><para>The only advice I could pass on to this man was that the limited availability of the specialist surgeon and the number of urgent cases on the waiting list had led to the hospital's inability to confirm a date. A review by a specialist may move him up the list. There was only one colorectal surgeon at the Royal Hobart Hospital with so many patients requiring surgery for illnesses such as bowel cancer. One wonders when minor surgery will be seen to—in this case minor surgery would give this 40-year-old constituent a much higher quality of life.</para><para>Another case that touched the hearts of my staff and me was that of Mr James Gribbin. Mr Gribbin, a 94-year-old man, was continually assessed by the Aged Care Assessment Team—ACAT—as low care. His 94-year-old wife was in a high care nursing home. Mr Gribbin desperately wanted to gain admission to the same place but was not even on the waiting list due to his assessment as low care. Mr Gribbin was hospitalised three times this year—once for a stroke, once for pneumonia and once for malnourishment. Mr Gribbin required a walking frame for mobility, no longer held a driver's licence and received visits from the district nurse, home help and Meals on Wheels. Mr Gribbin was in hospital again in April, where a reassessment took place. Yet again he was classified as low care. While in hospital he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, with a prognosis of only a few weeks to live. On compassionate grounds alone it would seem obvious that the solution should have been to place Mr Gribbin in the high-care category to enable him to be considered by the home his wife was a resident in.</para><para>Finally, after much discussion and many phone calls, the federal Department of Health and Ageing put forward a suggestion: that the home could take in Mr Gribbin with their own assessment. But, by this time, it was worked out that Mr Gribbin was gravely ill and he chose to be placed in the Whittle Ward, the palliative care hospice. Mr Gribbin died on 25 April this year. After spending most of their adult life together, Mr and Mrs Gribbin were separated because Mr Gribbin did not meet a partly subjective, bureaucratic criterion. Without real compassion in guidelines, the humanity of aged care is devalued.</para><para>The demise of bulk-billing and the attack on Medicare has resulted in people who simply cannot afford to take themselves or their children to their local GP, putting yet more pressure on our emergency departments, which are already suffering from lack of funds. Medicare was founded to ensure universality in our health system. It is not about free health. As taxpayers and citizens, Australians have already paid for it with taxes and their Medicare levy. The latest offering from the Howard government, the so-called `fairer Medicare', penalises the people who pay for Medicare and reduces Medicare to a safety net for a two-tiered system. </para><para>Bulk-billing increased every year under Labor governments, but it has been in decline since the Howard government was elected in 1996. Bulk-billing by GPs has fallen by 11 per cent since the Howard government came to office. I am afraid to say that, in my electorate of Franklin, the rate of GP bulk-billing has fallen to 53.6 per cent—a decline of almost five per cent in the last year. The average patient contribution in Franklin has risen by 12.5 per cent to $9.34. What this means for the average family is that, hopefully, they or their children get sick on payday. Families without health care cards are expected to pay upfront fees. A constituent of mine recently asked whether the doctor would bill her, and she was told that you pay on the day. This meant that she could not see her GP.</para><para>The latest package that the Howard government has offered will see families with two children, who earn over the cut-off point for a health care card, $32,000, pay even more to visit a doctor. I can assure you that there are many families in my electorate who cannot afford this increase. This limits their choice and many will go to hospital casualty departments, putting even more pressure on public hospitals—yet the Howard government is offering the states and territories less in hospital funding. The package offered by the Howard government is heading towards an Americanised, user pays, two-tiered health care system. It is not merely political rhetoric that a `fairer Medicare' from the government will lead to unfair outcomes. Francis Sullivan of Catholic Health Australia said:</para><quote><para>This package disproportionately hits the hard up and the sick and erodes the value of the Medicare entitlement for people without concession cards. Families and people on meagre incomes will find bulk billing elusive.</para></quote><para>Tim Woodruff of the Doctors Reform Society stated:</para><quote><para>Working families with one income will be reduced to taking just one of three sick kids to the doctor and then sharing the treatment in a desperate attempt to afford health care.</para></quote><para>As I said, the issue of Medicare has been prominent in this budget.</para><para>My GP, Dr Riddoch, has raised this subject with me on numerous occasions. I received from him on Friday a concise, constructive solution to what I consider a real national health problem—one that will not go away. It needs bipartisan support and should be considered in terms of what is best for Australian families, not from a position of cost-benefit analysis. He says in his letter:</para><quote><para>The Scheduled Fee and its reduced rebate failed to keep pace with the cost of living, and have done so ever since. This is why the AMA recommended fee for a standard GP consultation is now about twice the Scheduled Fee.</para><para>All along the majority of GPs, even if they have not bulk-billed have generally continued to charge pensioners and health care card holders, lower income earners and many children lower fees. By so doing they have demonstrated their altruism, but at the same time they have continued to subsidise the health system and have inadvertently fed the lie that the price of a standard GP consultation is worth $25.05.</para><para>Almost all GPs would bulk bill if the rebate were appropriate.</para><para>Compare GP fees with those of other professionals and tradesmen. They are lower than a visit to the hairdresser.</para><para>Small wonder that General Practice is in a state of crisis. Why train for years, remain committed to continuing education, work for long hours, deal with many varied and complex health issues and put up with being so undervalued? </para><para>Successive Federal Governments—</para></quote><para>and I will add here, mine too—</para><quote><para>have imposed a mass of impositions on GPs. There are more certificates than the proverbial stick can be poked at. Examples include special certificates for Centrelink, authority for the PBS, extra forms for childhood immunisation.</para></quote><para>In relation to medical indemnity, he goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Contrary to the utterances of the Minister for Health, and her colleague the Minister for Revenue &amp; Assistant Treasurer, this has not been handled well and, for us in Tasmania at least, does not offer a secure future.</para></quote><para>He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>What can be done to improve the situation?</para></quote><para>·	The most important and immediate action must be the restoration of the confidence and self-esteem of the current General Practice workforce.</para><para>·	They should receive adequate remuneration for their services. When Medibank was created we were “rewarded” with 85% of the “common fee”. The Relative Values Study has shown that an appropriate fee for a standard consultation should be in the range of $45-50, 85% of which is $38.25-42.50.</para><para>·	There are many other items of GP which deserve to be remunerated more highly, notably home and nursing home visits.</para><para>·	Together with a raising of the status of GPs should come increased funding for places in medical schools and in GP training programs. Ideally there should be one program—in my opinion this should be run by the RACGP.</para><para>·	The recent plethora of time-consuming incentives for General Practice ... should be abolished.</para><para>·	A “no fault” insurance scheme for the victims of medical misadventure should be introduced.</para><para>He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Failure to implement these essential changes will result in further degradation of General Practice to the detriment of health care throughout Australia.</para><para>Yours faithfully,</para><para>Dr Graeme Riddoch</para></quote><para>I now turn to the much vaunted, by the government at least, Job Network. What a shambles the Job Network competitive tendering process has been. What a waste of resources and time and what an insult to the long-term unemployed in this country. Let me put on the record how this government have short-changed the unemployed of this country. Since they came to government in 1996, seven years ago, the number of long-term unemployed has barely changed. From the inception of the Job Network process, it has become a lottery to see who will be awarded contracts and for the duration of each contract transition, believe it or not, the system shuts down for two months. In my electorate of Franklin, `Geoff' came to my office because he had qualified for intensive assistance during May but none of the Job Network agencies was able to register him during the transition period. He had the opportunity to commence work as a security guard but he needed assistance to pay for his first aid course and the security licence.</para><para>In Bridgewater, an area of exceptionally high unemployment, Job Network 3 has cut down the number of providers from three to two. Mission Employment was closing and could not take him on. Job Futures were setting up but their contract commences from 1 July. Workskills, which were continuing, were adamant, as was the department, that nothing could be done to help `Geoff'. My office put a call through to the minister's office and they were very helpful. They helped organise for Workskills to take `Geoff' on and he was able to commence work. The question that arises is: why does it require ministerial intervention to get someone registered for and access to intensive assistance? One wonders how many other people across Australia are affected in the same way but do not have access to ministerial assistance? How good is a system that virtually shuts down for two months to change providers? I really feel for the long-term unemployed who have to ply their way through such a ridiculous system. </para><para>Before I leave this subject, Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the fact that half the Job Network provider offices are closing by 1 July. There will be fewer than 1,000 offices for the country and many regional areas will be without direct access to a provider. In Bridgewater, as I have said, the number of providers will be reduced to two. For the eastern shore area of Rosny there will be only two providers, reduced from five—a great choice for the unemployed. One wonders and speculates that Job Network 4 will probably see just two or three providers for the whole country. By that stage it will be close to a complete privatisation of the CES, except that it will have been done by stealth over 10 years.</para><para>There is much more that could be said and elaborated on about this budget—the issue of early intervention, the crisis in the unmet need for child care for thousands of Australian families and, in my mind, the wrongful emphasis by this government in restructuring education. Where is this government's real commitment to liaise with and adequately resource state education ministers to see the following issues properly addressed: smaller class sizes for every one of our early childhood students and the mandating of full-time specialist teachers in the areas of music, physical education, libraries and special education in all Australian schools with over 150 students. I would argue that concerns over $150,000 university fees are irrelevant if students entering our high schools will not be taught by premium maths and science teachers. Many of those students are not capable of coping socially and academically.</para><para>In the last few moments, I would also like to raise the issue of the inability of many of my constituents to access legal aid. Once again we have this territorial stupidity between state and Commonwealth governments about whose fault it is and who is specially required to top up funding. I am lucky that just around the corner from my electorate office there is a wonderful community legal centre. It is the first point of call for many people who do not understand the complex nature of our legal system. But to send people around there only for them to be told, `It doesn't seem to quite fit the criteria'; `The funding is only for Commonwealth issues'; `This is a state issue'; `Go away and see a lawyer' is just like saying to poor old Mr Gribbin, `You're 94 and you don't meet the criteria. Fend for yourself. You are one of those victims of society.'</para><para>We are a country rich in resources and in wonderful people. We have so much going for us. In the last few parliaments I have said that our priorities are all screwed up. I am not a great advocate for spending endless amounts of money on defence. I think that some of the initiatives taken by this government in our allocation of resources in the area of antiterrorism and the like would be better placed in strengthening our communities. We need to be proactive rather than reactive. Hopefully state and territory ministers can get together, come up with packages and stop this stupid silo mentality. Let us make decisions for the benefit of all Australians and ensure that in this wonderful country there are opportunities for all to reach their potential. I thank you for the opportunity to speak on the 2003-04 budget. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>15679</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>. I suggest to the House tonight that this is the most significant budget for the Howard government and the Treasurer since the 1996-97 budget. In world terms it compares most favourably with any other budget delivered in this fiscal year. This budget not only achieves the trifecta that has been so eloquently spoken about by the Treasurer—namely, a balanced budget, tax cuts and meeting expenditures of an unusual kind—but also addresses major structural issues, particularly in the areas of health and education. </para></talk.start><para>In my address I want to deal, firstly, with some general aspects of the budget, which I wish to draw to the attention of those who have elected me and others and, secondly, with three special issues: firstly, the SARS debate and certain opportunities that it opens up economically for Australia; secondly, securing Australia both domestically and overseas in the current international terrorism context; and thirdly, and importantly, heritage conservation in which, in this budget, an important vision has become a reality. If time permits, I then want to briefly address some aspects of the Labor alternatives and draw my remarks to a close in that context.</para><para>It is worth while going back to the remarks of the Treasurer in 1996—by the very same Treasurer, I am pleased to say, who delivered this budget. He noted that the program anticipated at that time was one for families, small businesses, older Australians and to improve health care and plan and repair the nation's finances. Of the inherited deficit, he said:</para><quote><para>We could not stand back and ignore the problem. Although we did not create it, we will take the responsibility to fix it.</para></quote><para>He was referring there to the extraordinary series of deficits which had been handed down by Labor administrations and which were the core challenge then facing the financial and economic regimes in the country. </para><para>In this year's budget the Treasurer spoke somewhat differently. He spoke about the challenges for security and prosperity and about the need to address structural change in education and health. Those challenges were addressed in the context of a series of budgets that have delivered a million jobs since March 1996 and a level of growth and prosperity that has not been seen before in this country over a sustained period.</para><para>How does the budget continue those outcomes? Perhaps the first and most important way is to propose a series of tax cuts. These have been scorned by our opponents, but they do add up to significant tax cuts for various groups of our people. For example, the threshold increases in relation to income tax cuts for persons whose annual taxable income is between $21,600 and $30,000 are up to 10 per cent. The annual reduction in tax liability for someone on a taxable income of $21,600 is $329, which is an estimated percentage reduction of 10.7 per cent. In addition to those tax cuts, there is an increase in the low-income tax offset to $235 per year—an increase of $85 per year.</para><para>It is unnecessary to go through the detail of these measures, which are set out in the budget papers, but it is important to note that it is not only income tax cuts but also benefits through tax cuts for senior Australians through the senior Australians tax offset that have been proposed in this budget. This allows many senior Australians to earn up to an additional $500 annual income before they have a tax liability. The same proposals provide that Medicare levy thresholds for senior Australians will be increased to ensure that they do not pay Medicare levies until they begin to incur an income tax liability.  </para><para>There are also tax cuts involved in the international taxation arena. These are designed in a comprehensive way to ensure that Australia is encouraged as a regional headquarters for foreign groups and to improve our country's attractiveness as a continuing base for multinational companies. It is important that we address those structural problems; otherwise countries that envy our record and have highly competitive regimes at the moment will, for their own reasons, attract Australian companies and potential companies overseas, which will impact negatively upon our employment and growth. It is therefore important that the Senate approach these reforms very seriously and constructively, as advised by the board of review.</para><para>I want to mention a couple of measures that, in my assessment, are significant in the overall context of this budget. The Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation, which was recently established under the terrorism insurance legislation and about which I spoke in the House not so long ago, will be established with a $5 million equity injection, leading through collections to a $100 million equity base per annum which will be built up over time to ensure that there is a proper backdrop for terrorism insurance in this country. </para><para>Another important reform is the support given to the CLERP 9 reforms in relation to improving disclosure by Australian corporations. This issue has been aired through a number of inquiries and royal commissions. It is significant that the budget is addressing the concerns of commissioners and others who have commented upon these problems relating to corporate collapses in the last couple of years and is responding positively to the proposed reforms. Apart from that, the Financial Reporting Council will achieve an expanded role. APRA, the important regulatory body for prudential regulation, will receive a significant injection of funds, and its structure will be reformed and financed adequately to ensure that it continues to play a significant and enhanced role in prudential regulation so that the business community, ordinary customers and consumers will have greater confidence in the operation of our free enterprise economy.</para><para>It is against that background that it is worth while remembering that, apart from the significant achievements that this budget achieves nationally, it is also applauded internationally. The OECD <inline font-style="italic">Economic Survey</inline><inline font-style="italic"> of Australia</inline> in its March 2003 review states:</para><quote><para>Australia's current and recent economic outcomes place it among the top performers in the OECD.</para></quote><para>A little further down it states:</para><quote><para>The Government's commitment to reform, its willingness to commission expert advice and to heed it, to try new solutions, and to patiently build constituencies that support further reforms, is also something that other countries could learn from.</para></quote><para>Another comment worthy of note, which relates to the importance of achieving economic policy objectives, states:</para><quote><para>Dogged pursuit of structural reforms across a very broad front, and prudent macroeconomic policies firmly set in a medium-term framework, have combined to make the Australian economy one of the best performers in the OECD ... </para></quote><para>Immediately following the budget, the respected commentator William Pesek Jr on Bloomberg News commented:</para><quote><para>Unusual, indeed. While most major economies are struggling, Australia's is thriving. In the U.S., Japan and Germany, it's stagnation and rising unemployment that folks worry about. Here, it's how to keep the good times going.</para></quote><para>He continues:</para><quote><para>But domestically, it's hard to see Australia as anything but a role model for the world's biggest economies.</para></quote><para>He also states: </para><quote><para>Australia isn't getting much credit domestically or internationally, and that's a shame.</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>Yet if you're looking for an example of an economy that's forging its own path, independent of the weakness slamming most, Australia is it.</para></quote><para>By way of budget comparison, these points are worth making. This budget is expected to record a budget surplus of $2.2 billion—or 0.3 per cent of GDP. According to data from the OECD's <inline font-style="italic">Economic Outlook</inline> April 2003 edition, in the 2004 fiscal year the UK is expected to record a deficit of 2.2 per cent of GDP. In Australia, this would be a deficit of around $16.2 billion. In 2004, the US is expected to record a deficit of 4.2 per cent of GDP. In Australia, this would be a deficit of around $30.8 billion. When one compares the record internationally of the government, one sees that this is not just a very significant budget but perhaps the most significant budget in fiscal terms in the contemporary world—certainly amongst the OECD countries with whom Australia is traditionally compared. It is on that basis that all Australians can be proud to have a government that has put in place a budget which has brought such strong results for continued prosperity and also for continued change and reform. </para><para>Let me comment on a couple of issues that I have mentioned earlier which, it seems to me, are worthy of note in the current context. The first is SARS. It must be said that one of the issues that faced the framers of this year's budget was the unusual and unexpected expenditures required. The first, of course, was the war in Iraq. There were very significant expenditures which were not expected and had to be provided for in the budget context. That has been achieved. Another was SARS and the epidemic which has now, on one estimate, affected by death or illness some 8,000 persons around the world. It still does not appear as if the epidemic has been brought under control. Most adversely affected, especially in our part of the world, are Hong Kong and China, although Singapore and Taiwan have also been seriously affected. Professor Warwick McKibbin of the Centre for International Economics and a member of the Reserve Bank board has estimated that SARS would cost Hong Kong some 5.5 per cent of GDP in this fiscal year and China some 2.4 per cent of GDP.</para><para>I have had an opportunity to discuss these matters with some leaders in the tourist industry, including the Australian Tourism Export Council, who have indicated that, far from seeing this as a challenge for Australia, it ought to be seen as an opportunity. While the epidemic is progressing and is to be brought under control there are opportunities for Australian businesses, especially in the area of tourism. For example, it has been estimated that some two million Japanese visitors have elected not to proceed to China in the first six months of this year. Australian tourist authorities and businesses could do well to look in that direction and encourage them to come to Australia. We could do well to promote our country as the clean, green nation that it really is. Our stability and security, which have been obvious in the last eight years or so, ought to be used not just as a basis for securing our future but also as an attraction for others such as those tourists who might otherwise go to China—or, indeed, in their case, in the first six months of this year stay at home.</para><para>Likewise in relation to investors, it has been suggested that banking industry investors have withdrawn from the growing markets of China and possibly Taiwan and Korea. Australia should do what it can in the current climate, at least until the current epidemic is over, to seek to attract those investors to this country. In this context, I have recently written to Mr Draffin, the Chief Executive Officer of Invest Australia, suggesting to him that the policy division of Invest Australia examine and investigate the potential investment opportunities for international businesses in tourism, in banking and in other areas so as to continue to establish Australia as a strong, clean and green economic zone for the purposes of investment, tourism and other services. </para><para>There are other possibilities open to us in this regard. The Rugby World Cup later this year itself opens up opportunities for us to encourage tourism to this country and to spread this country's name around the globe to a number of areas and a number of businesses and people who would otherwise not be considering travelling and promote this country as a clean, green destination. In that regard, I would urge the Tourism Export Council of Australia, with Mr Peter Shelly as its able managing director, Invest Australia and other authorities to give very careful consideration to these opportunities. It does not mean that we should try to do down our neighbours—of course it doesn't; we should do our best to try and help them. But, on the other hand, if opportunities are going begging and Australia is in a position to exploit them, we should do what we can to continue to establish this country as a place of initiative and to maintain and improve the levels of prosperity that we currently enjoy.</para><para>The second issue that I wanted to mention concerned the interests of securing this country. This budget spends an additional $2.1 billion on defence in addition to the $645 million spent on the war in Iraq, the $100 million for humanitarian relief for reconstruction in that country and the $411 million for domestic security, especially in the area of intelligence gathering. Mr Rohan Gunaratna, the security expert, has eloquently explained that countries like Australia cannot hide from the terrorism scourge. We cannot roll ourselves up into a little ball and hope not to be noticed. We have to address the challenges of international terrorism—and that is what we are doing. The best way that we can do that, as he and others have said, is by ensuring that we have the best intelligence sources and that we are continuing, as we have done in recent times, to punch above our weight.</para><para>Let me speak of a third issue of importance. One of the major achievements of this budget for me and for my constituents has been the government's funding commitment to the protection of our heritage. I know that residents in my electorate will particularly welcome the decision to commit $115.5 million over eight years to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust, which has responsibility for managing two sites within Wentworth. The trust is the institutional face of the Howard government's visionary commitment to Sydney Harbour and its foreshores, and it has been doing a magnificent job in restoring and preparing management plans for the sites within its charge. Public interest in trust land is understandably high, and it is of great credit to the leaders of the trust, Kevin McCann and Geoff Bailey, that they have brought those community interests together in such a way.</para><para>In my electorate, the former marine biological research station at Watsons Bay and the Macquarie light station—an icon of the eastern suburbs—will both benefit as a result of this budgetary decision. I know that they will continue to be heritage places of great significance to the local community, and I am delighted that the trust can proceed with its planning functions confident of a long-term and secure funding base.</para><para>The budget also included the exciting announcement that over $52 million has been allocated to fund a new heritage program, Distinctively Australian. This program provides a financial base for the reforms the government has proposed to the way in which the Commonwealth manages places of national heritage significance. It provides a considerable financial backbone to the proposed new heritage regime, and I hope that the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004 will be quickly passed in the Senate so that Distinctively Australian can become operational. </para><para>The proposed regime involves the establishment of a list of heritage places—those sites, be they Indigenous, built or natural, that are truly of national significance. For the first time, these sites will enjoy the protection of the Commonwealth to the extent of our constitutional power in this area. Distinctively Australian will also ensure that the Commonwealth is able to assist property owners in protecting, managing and promoting places on the national list. I mention promote because the national list offers a wonderful opportunity for local communities to maximise the tourist potential of these sites. Just as tourists are often attracted to World Heritage sites because of their international recognition and importance, I believe that visitors will be drawn to places that have the status of being on Australia's National Heritage List. I am enthusiastic about these reforms because they come at the end of a long process of community consultation and input, including that undertaken by the Australian Heritage Commission while I had the honour of being its chair. That community involvement included Australia's first ever National Heritage Convention in 1998, which made a valuable contribution to the government's deliberations on these issues and was one of the highlights of my time as the chair. I congratulate the minister and the chair of the Australian Heritage Commission, Tom Harley, for their drive and initiative. Once again we see demonstrated the government's commitment to an area virtually ignored by the previous Labor government. I commend the budget to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>15683</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I begin my speech on the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline> by saying that a government should be judged by how effectively its budget delivers a fair and equitable society in a financially responsible way. A good government governs for all its citizens, not just a few. In Australia, we have come to expect that our governments will be inclusive and that, within the financial constraints of the day, each government will deliver a budget that creates opportunities for all, encourages innovation and creates a framework that will ensure that all those who need a little extra assistance get that assistance.</para></talk.start><para>Unfortunately, the philosophy of the Howard government is to make the strong stronger and marginalise even further those in our community who look to the government for assistance and support. The government are slaves to the doctrine of competition; they believe that the winner takes all. The ideologues within the government are pushing Australia even further down a path that will see us become a two-tiered society with two classes of citizens: those who are very rich and those who are very poor.</para><para>It was interesting to read the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> today entitled `Generation $ stretching the poverty gap'. The article identified that while, on the one hand, 20 per cent of wealthy Australians control more than 50 per cent of the country's wealth, on the other hand, the poorest 20 per cent of Australians control only one per cent of Australia's wealth. These figures show just how much our Australian society has been allowed to slip and how much some people in Australia have been marginalised. Australia is a wonderful place for the select 20 per cent to live, but if you are in that bottom 20 per cent it is a pretty miserable place to live. </para><para>I found some other figures detailed in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Catholic Weekly</inline> in 2000. The article stated:</para><quote><para>Forty-two per cent of Australian men aged 25 to 44 earn less than $32,000 a year, according to Prof Bob Birrell of the Centre for Population and Urban Research at Monash University. This is less than 66 per cent of the average weekly wage.</para></quote><para>This means that it is harder for people to buy a house and it is harder for people to start a family. The article went on to say that one-third of Australian men in their early 30s have no partner and are forced to either live at home with their parents or live in substandard conditions. In Australia, we have a very low birthrate, which is of great concern to us as we have an ageing population. The birthrate is 1.7 and, as a nation, we need to address this issue. To do that, we need to look at the issue of families and come to terms with the fact that families are struggling. We need to support the 20 per cent of people, talked about in today's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, who are really struggling.</para><para>The other article I referred to says:</para><quote><para>Of men aged between 45 and 65, 51 per cent earn less than $32,000, and a staggering 26 per cent earn less than $16,000.</para></quote><para>This demonstrates quite aptly the fact that in Australian society we have some people who work very hard, work very long hours and are very poor. The article also mentions the issues of unemployment, insecurity in employment and the impact that the casualisation of the work force has had upon people and how this has affected their ability to earn a reasonable living, buy homes and live the kind of life all of us have lived.</para><para>Given that there is an obvious problem with the distribution of wealth in Australia you may ask, `What is the Howard government doing? What has it done to create this situation? What has done to create a more equal society?' The answer is quite simple: it has given us more of the policies that have created the problems we have in Australia. The Howard government gave us the GST and is now seeking to destroy Medicare and make university education the prerogative of the wealthy. It is a government that has no commitment to the environment. Its only commitment is to big business and the dollar. It gives lip-service to restoring our river systems—in stark contrast to the Labor Party, which provides a solution and makes a commitment to the restoration of the Murray River.</para><para>It is a government that has continually failed our frail aged, who rely on the government to ensure that they receive proper care. It has cut funding to nursing homes and introduced the RCS—the classification scale that has led to a running down of our nursing homes and put a great burden upon those residential facilities that are seeking to provide quality accommodation. It is difficult to attract nurses to residential care facilities, both nursing homes and hostels. There is a shortage of registered nurses and assistant nurses in these facilities, and there is no way anything in this budget will change that fact. The government has done nothing to reverse the situation whereby nurses working in aged care facilities continue to receive less money than those working in the health system.</para><para>This is the government that is determined to sell Telstra. It is the government that has watched Telstra's network deteriorate and seen the sacking of thousands of workers and it is the government that is supporting the sacking of a further 3,000 workers and the disappearance of a further 4,200 jobs. This is the government that is guaranteeing the CEO of Telstra, Dr Ziggy Switkowski, one year's salary—$1 million—if they sack him whilst opposing the ACTU's attempt to increase the redundancy package for workers from eight weeks to 16 weeks. This is the government that has inflated the price of Telstra shares to make the budget's bottom line look better. </para><para>In the Hunter and on the Central Coast of New South Wales—where the Shortland electorate is located—we are feeling the effects of the government's ideological determination to sell Telstra. We are feeling the effects of a network that has been allowed to deteriorate and we are feeling the effects of thousands of Telstra jobs being slashed. I have been advised by numerous Telstra workers of many problems that exist in the electorate. Eight workers have already been retrenched in the Newcastle-Lake Macquarie area and six workers have been retrenched on the Central Coast. Staff are being forced to work on weekends and to start early and finish late.</para><para>Staff from outside the area are having to be brought in to maintain the network. These staff are paid $132 a day extra in travelling allowance, above their wages, plus excess travelling time. Newcastle staff have been working in Merriwa, and staff from as far away as Dubbo have been working in the Hunter and particularly on the Central Coast, where there have recently been a number of problems. These have definitely been exacerbated by the government's actions. All staff are pressured to work overtime because of the shortage of staff. On Fridays they are sent an SMS message to work on Saturdays. They cannot change their rostered days off, because there is no flexibility there. They are unable to take their holidays, because there are no replacements, so they have to continually put off taking holidays. This means that staff are carrying well in excess of the eight weeks they are supposed to carry.</para><para>It is of particular concern that the maintenance that is taking place on our network is substandard simply because workers do not have time to properly complete the jobs they are allocated. On the Central Coast many of the wires and cables in the highly sensitive network are being protected by plastic bags! Is this the way to ensure that we have an adequate service? Telstra's network has been allowed to run down. The government has failed to invest in it and has constantly attacked the work force.</para><para>The people of the Central Coast have been subjected to many hours without phones. We lose our phone service on a regular basis on the Central Coast and at Lake Macquarie, and it is very disappointing that the government has failed to recognise this. I recently raised an issue in the Main Committee relating to an extensive outage. I called on the member for Dobell to join with me in asking the government to restore funding to Telstra—to make a commitment to Telstra and a commitment to the people of the Central Coast. Unfortunately, his response was to attack me.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>15685</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Mr Scott was on remand for more than a month in Berrimah Prison, near Darwin, when he died in 1985. He was detained on a charge of using obscene language. It was a very minor offence, but the circumstances around the case are anything but minor. Mr Scott was found hanged in his prison cell.</para></talk.start><para>Fifteen years later, a team of American and British forensic scientists found that Mr Scott's death was more consistent with strangulation. Their findings are detailed in a forensic report that was prepared at the instigation of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation in the United States. These First Nations people from Connecticut have lent enormous assistance to Letty Scott, the widow of Douglas. The forensic report was requested by the Pequots on 1 November 1999, and the expert committee provided its report on 29 June 2000. It was instigated after the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody found that Mr Scott had hanged himself. The forensic team was led by Dr Henry Lee, then Director of the Connecticut State Police Forensic Science Laboratory and professor of forensic science at the University of New Haven. The team also included a professor of medicine from the University of Pittsburgh, the co-director of the New York Police Medicolegal Investigations Unit, and a forensic medical examiner for the Metropolitan Police in London.  </para><para>The committee set out to answer some unresolved questions and to `review the available documentation regarding the death of Douglas Scott'. In their summary and observations in the report, the committee said, `There appears to be a significant possibility that the death scene integrity might be compromised.' The committee cast doubt on the idea that Mr Scott hanged himself—a conclusion it reached only after sifting through the evidence with trained forensic eyes. The report noted:</para><quote><para>Based on the height of the ceiling in cell number 8, and the height of Douglas Scott, it is impossible for Douglas Scott to tie the sheet around the ceiling grate by standing on the floor. If Douglas threaded the sheet through the grate openings and tied the knot he would have needed to stand on the bed, wall table or stool.</para></quote><para>On the basis of the evidence supplied to it, the committee rules out the possibility that Mr Scott would have used the stool to climb up and prepare the sheet for his suicide. In fact, the stool appears in some photographs but not in others, prompting the committee's concern about an `unexplained difference in articles located within the crime scene' in the photographs available. At the same time, there were no diagrams or measurements concerning the heights of the bed and the wall table, or as to their relative position to Mr Scott. Similarly, no evidence had been prepared that would allow the committee to assess whether there were fingerprints or footprints on the table. Questions were also raised about whether Douglas could have threaded a sheet through the grate in the ceiling and whether the grate could have supported his weight for any extended period.</para><para>Based on all the information that was provided to them, the committee concluded that whether the manner of death was suicide or homicide could not be accurately determined. The report states:</para><quote><para>The reported and visible external and internal injuries, along with observations regarding the scene in which the death occurred, raise serious concerns about the security of the death scene and the possibility of the cause of death being other than suicidal. Additional information is necessary for determining the manner and circumstances of the death of Douglas Scott.</para></quote><para>Mr Speaker, earlier I showed a copy of the report to my colleague across the table, the honourable member for McEwen.

We are a people attracted to the sea. Around Australia our coastal towns and cities are experiencing population growth as baby boomers make the big shift towards the beach. </para></talk.start><para>Gold Coast city has long been a destination of choice for retirees and sun seekers; as such, it is under ever-increasing pressure from population growth. While significant areas of the city's hinterland and foreshore open space are now being preserved by the current city council, new and infill development along the coastal strip has over the years eroded important conservation areas. Only a few significant parcels of high conservation value remain in the densely populated coastal strip. One in particular is under imminent threat—at the hands of Queensland's Labor government. It is a site of just over 5.5 hectares and is one of the few lowland remnant native forests left on the Gold Coast.  </para><para>I want to put this bushland, known as the Miami Bushland, in context. As I mentioned, the surrounding coastal plan is highly developed; as a consequence there are few remaining areas in this part of the city landscape which provide a viable habitat even for common fauna, so the Miami site is of high conservation significance. This elevated forest includes massive ancient eucalypts—some of which are 150 to 250 years old—which support a large range of native birds and animals. Birdlife such as rainbow lorikeets nest in the ancient hollow limbs of these trees. The bird population will start to be whittled away if these trees are destroyed, and the wildlife in the area will disappear, because, of course, with our ecosystem all species are interdependent. </para><para>The bushland plays host to some significant species, including—and I will use their common names—the flemingia pea, the olive bush, sandfly zieria and tall sawsedge. The tall sawsedge is the only known food plant of the endangered swordgrass brown butterfly, but I am afraid that up until the present time we have been unable to establish that the Miami Bushland is a habitat for the swordgrass brown butterfly. </para><para>Queensland Health and the Queensland state government own this rare natural asset. The Gold Coast Hospital Board purchased it many years ago for a proposed hospital in Miami. The land has sat unused since that time and it was expected that the Gold Coast City Council would swap the land with the state government for a parcel of land in Southport, which was to have been the site of a commercial parking station ancillary to the Gold Coast Hospital. </para><para>Since then, a letter to a resident from the Queensland minister for health, Wendy Edmond, has indicated that the Miami land may be surplus to their requirements and, if so, will be listed on the government land register so that other government departments have the opportunity to express an interest in acquiring the property. As there is no identified requirement within government, Queensland Health have indicated their intention to offer the land for sale on the open market. Therefore, if the government wishes to sell the land on the open market for development, they have the ability to undertake a ministerial rezoning. This would mean that substantial residential development could take place in this forest.</para><para>Councillor Jan Grew, whose council division covers the Miami bushland, has been a strong advocate of keeping the bushland in its present state. Councillor Grew recently urged councillors to support a resolution that the Gold Coast City Council renegotiate the land swap arrangement with Queensland Health to exchange the Miami bushland for the land in Southport. That resolution was adopted by the full council on 9 May 2003.</para><para>There have been many public rallies and petitions to keep the urban bushland in its present state. I urge the Queensland state Labor government to listen to the people and give favourable consideration to this land exchange. The land swap would be a win-win for all concerned. There is no doubt that this is a very special and rare piece of bushland. Once it is developed, it is gone forever. I sincerely hope that the Labor state government recognises its environmental significance and enters into a land swap with the Gold Coast City Council. If it does not, in the years ahead what is now the Miami bushland will just be another residential development. But if the state government does enter into the land swap with the Gold Coast City Council, it will leave an enduring legacy by ensuring the protection of one of the last remnant forests in the Gold Coast city. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Holt Electorate: Child Care</title><page.no>15688</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>15688</page.no><name role="metadata">Byrne, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BYRNE</name><name.id>008K0</name.id><electorate>Holt</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to talk about an issue of concern in my electorate—child care. It is an absolute necessity for many Australians families, particularly those living within my electorate of Holt. In 2001, there were 38,115 children aged between zero and 11 within the city of Casey, a council district within my electorate. Many of the parents of these children work. They have to work to pay bills, to pay mortgages and to pay for petrol. Because they work, their children need child care and, as they grow older, before and after school care. Yet the Howard government has provided no assistance for new child-care centres in huge growth corridors like those in my electorate. Mr Costello's 2003 budget was an opportunity, particularly in my electorate, for the Howard government to provide real, tangible help to these families. The government has failed. It has failed to take this opportunity. It has failed to provide any extra child-care places for the third year in a row.</para></talk.start><para>Without extra funding for child care, the parents in my electorate will be forced to stay at home. It is a forced decision that a majority of families simply cannot afford. The majority of families cannot afford to have one parent at home full time for five years. By the time a child is in its second year, some 57 per cent of mothers are working. By the time the child has turned three, roughly 68 per cent of mothers are back in the work force. Child care is not an indulgence or a luxury. It is a necessity, without which ordinary Australians and the Australian economy would be worse off.</para><para>One of my constituents, Jennifer Tranter, felt so strongly about this issue that she contacted my office to reinforce how important child care was to her family. Jennifer and her partner have two children: Hannah, aged four, and Blake, aged 18 months. Both Jennifer and her husband work full time. Jennifer said:</para><quote><para>If I couldn't send my kids to day care, I would not be able to go to work. With only my partner's income to live on, we would in a worst-case scenario end up losing our house. Day-care is just so important to us.</para></quote><para>Though other nations have begun to recognise the importance of child care and to act to increase investment in child development and care, this government has done the reverse. It has refused to acknowledge the increased community demand for child care and does not recognise that many mothers need to return to work after the birth of a child. I quote Jennifer Tranter again:</para><quote><para>I don't know anyone who stays at home to look after their kids. People just can't afford to. I know many couples who are in the situation where one partner works days whilst the other works nights just so they can have the Australian dream of owning a house and give their kids a good future.</para></quote><para>The Howard government has elected to provide incentives for mothers who stay at home whilst ignoring many of these families and women who want to return to work. The abandonment of child care has resulted in national shortages—shortages which are starkly evident in my electorate of Holt. This is illustrated in an article entitled `Child care “in crisis”' in the <inline font-style="italic">Berwick News</inline> written by Jodie Welsh, whom I think the member for Dunkley would know reasonably well. The article states: </para><quote><para>Some Casey parents may be forced to leave their primary school-aged children at home alone because of an alleged shortage in before and after school care places across the municipality.</para><para>According to at least a dozen local parents, who were earlier this week struggling to find care for their school-aged children after a centre in Narre Warren changed ownership, the municipality is facing—</para></quote><para>in her words—</para><quote><para>a “crisis” in terms of placements available.</para></quote><para>Local parent Leanne Cartledge contacted my office to express her concern at the lack of placements available for children attending the local school—Berwick Primary School. Leanne's daughter, Kirralee, was once able to attend a child-care centre which provided before and after school care to Berwick Primary School students. This centre was recently taken over by a corporate child-care chain, and Kirralee's parents were informed it would no longer offer before and after school care. Leanne and her husband, Steven, have tried in vain to find an after school placement for their daughter.</para><para>Although Berwick primary does have a before and after school program, demand for the service, particularly in this growth corridor, is so great that the school cannot possibly accommodate the number of children seeking placements. Some families have been on the waiting list for this service since July last year. In recognition of this demand, the school is currently awaiting approval of its application for a further 30 places for the after school program. Yet Leanne has informed me that even if this application is successful the school may not receive an adequate number of places to meet the enormous demand the program receives. She states:</para><quote><para>The school have informed me that they have applied for extra places but may not receive the full 30.</para></quote><para>Leanne has canvassed every option in vain. None of the City of Casey child-care centres have any after school placement spots. She decided to try and transfer to another school, only to find that that school had waiting lists. She contacted Nanny Services, only to be told that demand for nannies in the area is so high that it outstrips demand. This lack of child-care places in this area is unacceptable. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Dunkley Electorate: 2nd Mornington Sea Scout Group; Mornington Heritage Rail</title><page.no>15689</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>15689</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I report that community spirit and volunteerism is alive and well in Mornington, the place where I am fortunate enough to live. They are at their best when there is a marriage between personal interests and hobbies and the selfless community support and service to others displayed by so many leading members of the Mornington community. On the weekend and in recent weeks, we have celebrated two examples of this.</para></talk.start><para>On Sunday I was pleased to join the 2nd Mornington Sea Scout Group in celebrating its 50th anniversary—50 years during which the group has developed young people in their seamanship, an understanding of the characteristics of personal growth and team work, and in learning new skills; 50 years of providing that support to the local community. It all started back in May 1953 when some very persuasive leading member of the scouts community got on to the ANZ Bank, at a benevolent time perhaps, to provide the first hut on the beach for the sea scout group. It was obviously in need of expansion a few years later and development was started on the new scout hall that can now be seen at Scout Beach, Mornington.</para><para>Blair Williams, the group leader, and Libby Vagg, President of the 2nd Mornington Sea Scouts Group, outlined to those gathered on Sunday the vision ahead for the group, which included addressing the cost of scouting. The group has not been spared from the implications of the public liability crisis that is now being resolved progressively by governments. The speakers cheerfully shared with the group that numbers participating in the group's activities are increasing, but the cost of scouting is still an issue to be addressed—and that is a challenge for not only this group but many others as they battle to raise the funds needed to support their activities. </para><para>Looking ahead, the group is discussing a kitchen renovation project in trying to get some hot water into the building—it is probably one of the rare public buildings around that does not have hot water—so that it can provide shower facilities and a second toilet for many of the women and girls who participate in the program. An extension to incorporate these improvements and an area to store its trailers are all part of the vision the group has for its development. The ANZ are back on board though. I was delighted that Paul Groves, the Mornington branch manager of the ANZ, turned up for the 50th birthday celebrations and, as an anniversary gift, provided $1,000 as a start for a building account, as those dedicated individuals seek to expand the services available through their activities on the beach at Mornington. So the Rovers, Venturers, Scouts and Cub-scouts and Joeys are all thriving and going very well. That is just one example of some of the exciting community-spirited and community-minded activities going on in the Dunkley community.</para><para>A second one, though, is probably more known for its appeal to the visitor community and I emphasise that, if you want to recharge your batteries in Greater Melbourne, come down to the Mornington Peninsula. One of the great things on offer is the Mornington heritage rail, which now boasts a `run-around loop'. I did not quite know what a run-around loop was—I knew it was not <inline font-style="italic">Run-around Sue</inline><inline font-style="italic">—</inline>but a run-around loop is actually very important because it enables the locomotive to operate in both directions from the front of each train travelling between the Mornington and Moorooduc stations that are part of that heritage rail.</para><para>The official opening was sensational. It was performed by Kevin Burt, President of the Mornington Peninsula Rail Preservation Society. A jazz band was playing against the backdrop of a steaming locomotive engine. There was the feeling of yesteryear and it had an eye to the region's future tourism appeal. Local state MP Robin Cooper quite deservedly praised the railway committee of management, its members and volunteers for their vision and dedication in transforming the railway into a leading heritage tourist attraction before cutting the ceremonial ribbon—and the band kept playing. Tony Sheer, President of Mornington Peninsula Tourism, was there. He said that the run-around loop was symbolic of how the heritage rail in particular and tourism in general on the peninsula was heading in the right direction. Local Mornington Shire councillor and council delegate to the committee of management, Josephine Smith, provided the glamour for this yesteryear occasion. She was enthusiastic about the heritage railway's future and assured the Mornington Railway Preservation Society of her ongoing work and commitment.</para><para>With the support of the federal government and with rail track from the spur line of HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Cerberus</inline>, with the local shire providing assistance with ballast—which is the rocks and stuff that keep the track in place and make sure that it dries out—and with the assistance of local civil engineering construction companies and a dedicated band of volunteers, the railway preservation society has transformed a dilapidated rail asset into a real feature of tourism on the Mornington Peninsula. I commend them all, including Howard Girdler, whose vision has been driving this project for many years. To anybody with a bit of an interest in very big trains who would like to dedicate some time and energy to the Mornington Peninsula Rail Preservation Society, your energies would be well received, as new marketing initiatives, locomotive restoration and further fundraising lies ahead. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Migrant Resource Centre</title><page.no>15691</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>15691</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise as a representative of Melbourne's multicultural west and most particularly as the representative of my electorate of Lalor. Many families that now call Australia home had their start in Melbourne's multicultural west. Many of these people have come from situations of war and conflict, and many have lived through incredible suffering that we can only imagine. My electorate of Lalor is home to a number of people from the older communities—if I can use that terminology—the communities that arrived post-World War II in the great wave of Australian migration, through to the more newly arrived communities, particularly people from the communities of the Horn of Africa who are now making Lalor their home.</para></talk.start><para>For some 22 years Melbourne's west was served by the Inner West Migrant Resource Centre. Unfortunately, this centre has been forced to close its doors. This MRC started as a small service based in Footscray in the electorate of Gellibrand and over the years it has grown into the major service provider for ethnic communities in the western region. The Inner West MRC has an established branch office in Hoppers Crossing, which is in my electorate. This centre has provided settlement support for hundreds of refugees and migrants over its long years of operation. The services provided are a vital part of the network that assists newly arrived people who come to Australia and, most specifically, the people who come to live in the west of Melbourne.</para><para>I have been saddened by the closing of the MRC and the branch office at Hoppers Crossing and, of course, I am concerned about the future provision of services for people who need them and, most particularly, for newly arrived migrants who need them the most. The services provided by the MRC included assistance with housing, education, health and employment. All of these services are absolutely vital if people are to make a successful transition to life in Australia, particularly in the early years of that new life when the transition is at its most difficult.</para><para>Many people have given countless hours to the MRC—the staff, on a paid basis, who have done above and beyond what they are paid to do; and the many hundreds of volunteers who have been associated with the MRC over its life. Mr Speaker, I am sure that you, like me, are always amazed by the degree of voluntary contribution that people in the community will engage in, and this was true of the Inner West Migrant Resource Centre and the Hoppers Crossing branch office.</para><para>As a result of this contribution by both the staff and the volunteers, the Inner Western Region Migrant Resource Centre has developed as a pool of great knowledge, skills and expertise. I fear that now, in the transition to new arrangements, these could be lost. These skills have aided the development of the community and individuals, and losing them would be a matter of great regret for the community as a whole. The Inner Western Region Migrant Resource Centre and the Hoppers Crossing branch office have been forced to close because of a financial problem that is, at the moment, in the hands of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and those of the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs. It is not my intention to dwell on the circumstances that led to the development of those financial problems but to say that I want to look towards the future. </para><para>The MRC has now shut its doors, and the workers involved have lost their jobs. Many people from migrant backgrounds who are looking for assistance are now looking elsewhere for that assistance. For example, I understand that my local council, the City of Wyndham, is being approached by large numbers of people. I also understand that the department will be conducting a meeting to discuss the future of service provision in Melbourne's west and in my electorate on Friday this week. I think that the task before all of us—the government, the minister, me as a local representative and, indeed, the other representatives of Melbourne's west—is to work together to find a way for vitally needed settlement services to continue to be provided in this period and to harness the best of what has been done over the last 22 years by the Inner Western Region Migrant Resource Centre. We must ensure that these valuable skills and knowledge are not lost as we build the service provision for the future. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Hansen, Mr Len</title><page.no>15692</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>15692</page.no><name role="metadata">Kelly, De-Anne, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DE-ANNE KELLY</name><name.id>FK6</name.id><electorate>Dawson</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak of one of the community leaders in my electorate of Dawson. Len Hansen lives in Mackay. He was a volunteer soldier who enlisted in 1939 and served with the AIF from May 1940 until the end of the war in the Pacific in 1945. He served in North Africa—in Libya, Tobruk and El Alamein. He was one of the group that has been recorded for posterity in the many histories written of World War II—he was one of the famous `Rats of Tobruk'. He also saw service in the New Guinea campaign—at Lae and Finchafen, on the Huon Peninsula and in Borneo. He retired from the Army with the rank of Major, which he still holds on the Retired List.</para></talk.start><para>Len followed a business career until his eventual retirement in 1981. Through all of these years he has retained a close relationship with his community. He made valuable contributions to Scouting, the Red Cross, the Institute of Management, the Army Reserve and Rotary. In 1998 he received a multiple Paul Harris fellowship from Rotary International and the President's Award from the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants.</para><para>Len remained extremely active in the local community after his retirement, particularly in relation to the Army. He has only recently retired as Chairman of the Mackay branch of the Australia Defence Association, a position he held for many years. Along with Councillor Don Rolls of the Mackay City Council, he raised significant funding to build a lasting memorial in Mackay to commemorate the heroic achievements of the Rats of Tobruk. I am pleased that the Commonwealth made a major contribution to this very worthy cause. This monument now stands in memory of the gallantry of the Rats.</para><para>In 1985 Len assumed the chairmanship of the Mackay branch of the Australian National Flag Association, a position he has only recently relinquished. His support for the existing Australian flag never wavered in the nearly 20 years he held this position. He has, for many years, organised an Australian National Flag Association stall at the annual Mackay show. He also runs stalls at the major shopping centres on ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day. Len organises a flag raising ceremony each year to honour National Flag Day. I believe that, thanks to Len's efforts, the Mackay branch is the most active branch of ANFA in Australia. </para><para>Len Hansen is an avowed constitutional monarchist and a proud supporter of our system of government. He organised his own television campaign in regional Queensland in support of the no vote in the constitutional referendum in 1999. Certainly, the republican proposition put in that referendum was overwhelmingly rejected by voters in regional Queensland. As the local leader of the Australian National Flag Association, which is a non-political, non-sectarian organization that relies wholly on volunteers, he has done a remarkable job.</para><para>I take this opportunity to thank Len Hansen for his efforts on behalf of the Mackay community and wish him well in his retirement. Having said that, I think most of us in Mackay cannot imagine that Len will ever actually retire and take it easy, such is his commitment to his community and the various causes he has espoused over so many years. Len, thank you on behalf of Mackay. We are deeply grateful for your contribution to the community.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>21:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>15693</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">House adjourned at 9.28 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>15693</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following notices were given:</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>JK6</name.id><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McClelland</name></talker><para> to present a bill for an act to amend the <inline font-style="italic">Workplace Relations Act 1996</inline>, and for related purposes.

Shipments are sent to over 200 nuclear medicine centres in all states and territories (capitals and country areas) and to a number of industrial customers.  ARI also ships to overseas customers, including customers in the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand, New Zealand, Malaysia, China, Taiwan, Burma, the United States and some European destinations.</para><para>It should be noted that ARI is not the only entity in Australia that is involved in the routine transportation of radioactive materials.  Other entities routinely transport a wide range of radioactive materials across Australia (for example, smoke detectors, industrial gauges and mineral ores).  However, details of such shipments are not available, as they are a matter for the relevant State and Territory authorities.</para><para>(2)	Delivery distances range from a few kilometres (for example Lucas Heights to Liverpool) to thousands of kilometres.  </para><para>Within Australia, packages are often sent to their destination by air, including to destinations as close to Sydney as Brisbane or Canberra.  This is due to the short-lived nature of the particular radioisotope product being transported.  For example, the product with the shortest half-life supplied by ARI is FDG (Fluorine-18 deoxyglucose), with a half-life of only 110 minutes.  For these short-lived products, air transport is chosen due to the speed of delivery.  For longer-lived products, transport by road becomes viable for Australian destinations. </para><para>(3)	All packages are transported (initially) by road, while approximately 70% would travel further by air by either freighter or passenger aircraft, including to some country NSW destinations, and then by road to the point of use.  Given the short half-life of most ARI isotopes no sea or rail transport is used.</para><para>(4)	Within Australia, there has only been one incident involving a vehicle carrying radioactive waste since 1980. In December 1994, a small amount of liquid was found to have seeped from a drum containing very low level waste soil that was being transported by road from Lucas Heights to Woomera. Some 98% of the soil being transported had levels of radiation so low as to not require compliance with the Australian Code of Practice for Safe Transport of Radioactive Substances (1990). Nevertheless, as a precautionary measure, it was being transported in accordance with the code.</para><para>The spill was discovered near Port Augusta, South Australia during a routine load inspection. No radioactivity above background levels was found in the spilled material, and the spilled waste was contained on the tray of the truck. The incident posed no threat to the health and safety of workers or the public.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education, Science and Training: Program Funding</title><page.no>15698</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1495)</subtitle><id.no>1495</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>15698</page.no><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Grierson</name><name.id>00AMP</name.id><electorate>Newcastle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, upon notice, on 13 February 2003:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Does the Minister's Department administer any Commonwealth funded programs for which community organisations, businesses or individuals in the electoral division of Newcastle can apply for funding; if so, what are the programs.</para><para>(2)	Does the Minister's Department advertise these funding opportunities; if so, (a) what print or other media outlets have been used for the advertising of each of these programs and (b) were these paid advertisements.</para><para>(3)	With respect to each of the Commonwealth funded programs referred to in part (1), (a) what is its purpose and (b) who is responsible for allocating funds.</para><para>(4)	With respect to each of the Commonwealth funded programs referred to in part (1), how many (a) community organisations, (b) businesses or (c) individuals in the electoral division of Newcastle received funding in 2001 and 2002.</para><para>(5)	What sum of Commonwealth funding did each recipient receive in 2001 and 2002.</para><para>(6)	What is the name and address of each recipient.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>15698</page.no><name role="metadata">Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Dr Nelson</name><name.id>RW5</name.id><electorate>Bradfield</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Education, Science and Training</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Yes.

for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Yes.</para><para>(2)	The issues raised in this part of the question relate to the public health effects of mobile phone use and should be addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing, as the Minister responsible for the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA). ARPANSA is the Federal Government agency charged with responsibility for protecting the health and safety of people and the environment from the harmful effects of radiation. I am advised by the Australian Communications Authority (ACA) that its role is to ensure that any emissions from radiocommunication equipment identified by qualified health authorities as being potentially harmful are properly controlled.</para><para>(3)	The Stewart Report recommended the establishment of exclusion zones to identify areas where recommended exposure limits are exceeded. The UK Government accepted the recommendation that that exclusion zones be established where necessary - in fact it stated that such zones should already exist. </para><para>The ACA has advised that it does not require exclusion zones around base stations as a matter of course. However, in addition to incorporating the ARPANSA exposure limits into the new ACA EME regulations, including the Radiocommunications (Electromagnetic Radiation - Human Exposure) Standard 2003 applicable to radiocommunication devices, the ACA also applied the ARPANSA limits as a new licence condition to apparatus licensed base stations. The new licence condition currently applies to GSM 900 base stations. The ACA intends to extend the application of the new licence condition to all other types of base stations, that is CDMA, GSM 1800 and 3G, by the end of 2003. The effect of applying the new condition is that licensees for each transmitter, associated with a base station, will be required by the ACA to ensure a member of the public is not exposed to a level of radiation above the limits recommended by ARPANSA. </para><para>(4)	The Stewart Report recommended that a national database be set up giving the following details of base stations: `name of the carrier, the grid reference, the height of the antenna above ground level, the date transmission started, the frequency range and signal characteristics of transmission, the transmitter power and the maximum power output under the Wireless Telegraphy Act. Moreover, this information should be readily accessible to the public, and held in such a form that it would be easy to identify, for example, all base stations within a defined geographical area and all belonging to a specified operator.'  </para><para>I am advised by the ACA that in Australia, the ACA maintains a Register of Radiocommunications Licences. The Register provides detailed information, primarily for interference management purposes, on every licence holder including individual licences held and certain technical data on transmitters. The licenses authorising the operation of base stations do not specify a power output limit, therefore the maximum power output of base stations is not recorded in the Register. However, to the extent that carriers comply with their obligation to supply the relevant data, all base stations and their antenna are listed in the Register. The Register is publicly accessible through the ACA website (at www.aca.gov.au), at ACA offices, and on CD-ROM available for purchase from the ACA.</para><para>(5)	The Stewart Report recommended that `an independent, random, ongoing audit of all base stations be carried out to ensure that exposure guidelines are not exceeded outside the marked exclusion zone and that the base stations comply with their agreed specifications.' </para><para>ARPANSA periodically surveys base stations for emissions as resources allow and did so last in 1997-1999. In all cases radiation emission levels were thousands of times less than recommended exposure limits.</para><para>ARPANSA has advised that it intends to conduct a survey in 2003 of radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic energy (EME) emissions around sixty mobile phone base stations at numerous locations throughout Australia. The 2003 ARPANSA survey is not a requirement of either the ARPANSA standard or ACA EME regulations. </para><para>The objectives of the 2003 survey are to:</para><para>·	measure base station RF levels at specified distances from the antenna and compare levels with the ARPANSA RF exposure limits;</para><para>·	compare actual RF levels with predicted levels; and</para><para>·	measure environmental levels of RF within 500 metres of the nominated base station's location.</para><para>The sites will be selected to ensure that representative numbers of various types of base stations are surveyed. These types of sites will include:</para><para>·	conventional free standing towers with and without co-located carriers;</para><para>·	at least 10 of the sites used in the previous ARPANSA 1997-1999 survey;</para><para>·	`low impact' sites (antenna mounted on existing structures/buildings); and</para><para>·	communications towers supporting a range of services.</para><para>ARPANSA has also advised that while overall selection of sites will be performed by ARPANSA staff, nomination of sites will come from members of the Local Government Association of Australia and the Mobile Carriers Forum (MCF). A measurement protocol based on the measurement of the control channel/pilot signal will be developed and will be similar to that used in the ARPANSA 1997-1999 survey.</para><para>Further, the ACA has advised that, while it does not measure base station emissions as a matter of course, it may do so at base stations suspected of non-compliance with the EME regulations. </para><para>Under the new ACA EME regulations, which came into effect on 1 March 2003, the ACA has advised that from 1 June 2003 it will require licensees of some radiocommunication transmitters to document their compliance with the new regulations. The ACA will be conducting an on-going random audit program of the relevant documentation to ensure licensees are complying with their obligations under the regulations.</para><para>Under the Industry Code on Deployment of Radiocommunications Infrastructure, the public can request, at any time, that a carrier provide information on radiation levels around base stations. </para><para>(6)	The Stewart Report recommended that `in relation to macrocell base stations sited within school grounds, that the beam of greatest RF intensity should not fall on any part of the school grounds or buildings without agreement from the school and parents. Similar considerations should apply to macrocell base stations sited near to school grounds.' The UK Government did not agree to this recommendation, instead stating that the exposure levels at schools should be `within [International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection] guidelines'. </para><para>In Australia, licensees for each transmitter associated with a base station, irrespective of its location, will be required by the ACA to ensure that members of the public are not exposed to a level of radiation above the limits recommended by ARPANSA. This requirement applied to GSM 900 base station transmitters under the now superseded ACA EME regulations and it will apply to all base station transmitters from the end of 2003 under the new ACA EME regulations.</para><para>The ACA has advised that it has not received any recommendations from ARPANSA in relation to the installation of base stations in or near school grounds. Accordingly, the ACA has not issued any guidelines on the matter. See also the answer to part 2 of the Question, above. </para><para>The Industry Code on Deployment of Radiocomunications Infrastructure requires carriers to have regard to `community sensitive locations' such as schools when locating base stations. See also the answer to part 3 of the Question, above.</para><para>(7)	The ACA has advised that it has not received any recommendations from ARPANSA in relation to the installation of base stations at a minimum distance from household residences. Accordingly, the ACA has not issued any guidelines on the matter.</para><para>Some local councils have planning policies to this effect (for example Sutherland Shire), however these apply only to those facilities for which the Council has planning authority, not those installed with authorisation under Commonwealth law. The Industry Code on Deployment of Radiocommunications Infrastructure requires carriers to have regard to `community sensitive locations' such as residential areas when locating base stations. See also the answer to part 3 of the Question, above. Irrespective of base station location, licensees for each transmitter associated with a base station will be required by the ACA to ensure a member of the public is not exposed to a level of radiation above the limits recommended by ARPANSA.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Transport: Passenger Movement Charge</title><page.no>15714</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1554)</subtitle><id.no>1554</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>15714</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 3 March 2003:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	With respect to the additional $8 per passenger increase in the Passenger Movement Charge that came into effect on 1 July 2001 to fund increased passenger processing costs as part of Australia's response to the threat of the introduction of foot and mouth disease, what is the total additional revenue raised by the charge in (a) 2001-2002 and (b) 2002-2003 to date.</para><para>(2)	What is the total additional revenue estimated to be raised by the charge in (a) 2002-2003, (b) 2003-2004, (c) 2004-2005 and (d) 2005-2006.</para><para>(3)	What is the total sum of Passenger Movement Charge collected at each airport and port in (a) 2001-2002 and (b) 2002-2003 to date.</para><para>(4)	What is the total sum of Passenger Movement Charge estimated to be collected at each airport and port in (a) 2002-2003, (b) 2003-2004, (c) 2004-2005 and (d) 2005-2006.</para><para>(5)	What sum has been spent by the Government on new quarantine screening equipment at each airport and port since 1 July 2001.</para><para>(6)	How much additional money has the Government spent on other quarantine processing costs at each airport and port since 1 July 2001 and what services, measures or expenses comprise that additional expenditure at each airport and port. </para><para>(7)	How much additional money is estimated to be spent on new quarantine screening equipment and other processing costs, respectively, at each airport and port in (a) 2002-2003, (b) 2003-2004, (c) 2004-2005 and (d) 2005-2006.</para><para>(8)	Which programs are administering costs associated with increased passenger processing costs as part of Australia's response to the threat of the introduction of foot and mouth disease and what sum has been spent, and is estimated to be spent, from each program in each year it has operated, or is budgeted to operate, and which Department is responsible for the administration of each program.</para><para>(9)	Are there any outstanding claims by any organisation or individual for expenditure on equipment or measures as part of Australia's response to the threat of foot and mouth disease; if so, (a) who are the claimants, (b) what is the claim for and (c) will each be paid; if so, when.</para><para>(10)	How many passengers departing Australia were exempted from paying the Passenger Movement Charge and what is the legal basis and number of passengers for each category of exempted passengers.</para><para>(11)	Will the $8 foot and mouth response component of the Passenger Movement Charge be removed, increased or reduced commensurate with the movement in costs associated with Australia's response to the threat of the introduction of foot and mouth disease; if so, when; if not, why not.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>15715</page.no><name role="metadata">Truss, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Truss</name><name.id>GT4</name.id><electorate>Wide Bay</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	to (4) The answers to these questions do not fall within the responsibilities of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry portfolio.
