There is no more serious decision for any government than to commit its forces to military conflict abroad. Under our system, this decision lies with the executive of government: the cabinet. Nevertheless, it is appropriate that the parliament, at the first opportunity, have the chance to debate this motion. It is essential that the reason for that decision be made plain to the representatives of the people and that they have a full opportunity to debate them and to have their views recorded.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In 1991, the world judged that the Iraqi regime was a dangerous aggressor. In the interests of world peace and regional security, the community of nations required Iraq to surrender its offensive arsenal, its chemical and biological weapons, and abandon its nuclear weapons program. Iraq agreed to comply. We have waited 12 years for it to give action to that commitment. On 8 November 2002, the United Nations Security Council passed resolution 1441âthe 17th Security Council resolution on Iraq regarding the threat it poses to international peace and security. This resolution, which was adopted unanimously, gave Iraq a final opportunity to demonstrate immediate compliance with its disarmament obligations. Over the last four months, we have seen no evidence to suggest that Saddam Hussein is willing to comply with resolution 1441. He has offered up minor concessions but he has not demonstrated that he is willing to declare or destroy Iraq's prohibited weapons programs. The government believes very strongly that Iraq's continued defiance of the community of nations presents a challenge which must be addressed.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>R36</name.id><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe member for Grayndler!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name></talker><para>âIt is inherently dangerous to allow a country such as Iraq to retain weapons of mass destruction, particularly in the light of its past aggressive behaviour. If the world community fails to disarm Iraq, we fear that other rogue states will be encouraged to believe that they too can have these most deadly of weapons and that the world will do nothing to stop them. As the possession of weapons of mass destruction spreads, so the danger of such weapons coming into the hands of terrorist groups will multiply. That is the ultimate nightmare which the world must take decisive and effective steps to prevent. Possession of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons by terrorists would constitute a direct, undeniable and lethal threat to Australia and its people.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government's principal objective is the disarmament of Iraq; however, should military action be required to achieve this, it is axiomatic that such action will result in the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime. Early this morning, President Bush telephoned me and formally requested Australia's support and participation in a coalition of nations who are prepared to enforce the Security Council's resolutions by all necessary means.

Nobody wants a military conflict. The world has tried other means for years but, so far, to no avail. We cannot walk away from the threat that Iraq's continued possession of weapons of mass destruction constitutes to its region and to the wider world.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the final analysis, the absolute conviction of the government is that disarming Iraq is necessary for the long-term security of the world and is therefore manifestly in the national interest of Australia. The events of the last four months, Iraq's history and 12 years of defiance have convinced the government that the only way to deal with this challenge is by force. Sadly, the government is not surprised that it should have come to this. Force has been the only language that Saddam Hussein's regime has ever understood.</para><para>For 12 years, Saddam Hussein has forced his nation to endure stringent economic sanctions and pariah status rather than give up his weapons of mass destruction. The presence of weapons inspectors has hindered and irritated him but has never stopped his weapons programs. Even during the first four years of weapons inspections, when the inspectors perceived they were making real progress, Iraq continued to develop and successfully conceal biological weapons. Luckily, a series of defectors blew the whistle on some of Iraq's prohibited weapons programs, forcing the Iraqi regime to reveal one of the most sophisticated and expansive offensive biological programs in the world; but we cannot expect always to be so lucky. Inspectors were ordered out of Iraq before they could finish dismantling it. The available intelligence indicates that, since the departure of inspectors in 1998, Saddam has continued to work on his chemical and biological capabilities and has maintained his nuclear aspirations.</para><para>Even under the threat of force he has only engaged reluctantly in token, piecemeal destruction of weapons and continues to deny the existence of weapons programs. Even with over 200,000 coalition troops massed at his borders he quibbles about how interviews are to be conducted with his scientists and how many of the reconnaissance aircraft supporting the inspectors can fly at any one time. After 12 years, he does not believe that the international community has the will to act. In that he has made a terrible error of judgment.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84G</name.id><name role="metadata">Wilkie, Kim, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe member for Swan!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name></talker><para>âFor 12 years the international community has been trying to get him to relinquish his prohibited weapons programs, as required by the cease-fire which ended the Gulf War, and Australia has been an active participant in this process.

No doubt he looks to a time when the world will be distracted by other events and he can use his arsenal to bully and coerce his neighbours and to dominate the Middle East. Iraq's continued defiance represents a threat to the delicate balance which supports nonproliferation. It is no idle speculation that other countries in the region, perceiving this threat, might decide that their own security requires that they develop a significant chemical, biological or even possibly nuclear arsenal to deter attack from Iraq. Moreover, other rogue states would be tempted to ignore the international conventions on arms control, which Australia and others have so painstakingly built up over the last 30 years, and would feel that they could get away with developing similar weapons programs. This is proliferation. We know the lessons of history: the more nations that have these weapons, the more likely they are to be used. That is why we fear proliferation, and we are very concerned about the potential for the proliferation of these weapons in our own region.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That these weapons may become commonplace in arsenals of sovereign states is frightening enough, but it would be a nightmare for the international community if they were to find their way into the hands of terrorists. And we have every reason to be concerned about the expansion and increasing sophistication of international terrorist networks. We know as a matter of fact that terrorist networks such as al-Qaeda want to obtain weapons of mass destruction. They are actively seeking them. They desire them because of their potency. With such weapons at their disposal, terrorists could target entire cities or regions. Their victims would number not in the hundreds or the thousands but potentially even more.</para><para>Twelve years ago the community of nations determined that Iraq could not be permitted to develop and possess weapons of mass destruction. Today's security environment reinforces that judgment. Our alliance with the United States is unapologetically a factor in the decision that we have taken. The crucial, long-term value of the United States alliance should always be a factor in any major national security decision taken by Australia.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83N</name.id><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe member for Shortland is warned!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name></talker><para>âAmerica has given strong leadership to the world on the issue of Iraq. The Security Council would not have been re-energised, the United Nations would not have been re-energised, had it not been for the action of the United States in returning the issue to the United Nations in September of last year. We have supported the American position on this issue because we share their concerns and we share their worries about the future if Iraq is left unattended to.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Alliances are two-way processes and, where we are in agreement, we should not leave it to the United States to do all of the heavy lifting just because they are the world's superpower. To do so would undermine one of the most important relationships we have. In an increasingly globalised and borderless world, the relationship between Australia and the United States will become more rather than less important as the years go by.</para><para>Armed conflict, as we all know, is a terrible thing. Our ultimate responsibility is, of course, for the security of the Australian people, but I am very conscious of the dangers that military action will pose for Iraq's civilian population. But, when you put human suffering into the balance on this issue, there is a very powerful case that human suffering in Iraq will, in fact, be greater if Saddam Hussein remains in power in that country. Perhaps it is enough to note that, in 1991, the Security Council thought it necessary to pass resolution 688, which demands that the Iraqi regime cease its repression of its own people. In April last year, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights adopted a resolution condemning:</para><quote><para>... the systematic, widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law by the Government of Iraq, resulting in an all-pervasive repression and oppression sustained by broad-based discrimination and widespread terror.</para></quote><para>The regime's hallmarks are summary and arbitrary executions, the use of rape as a political tool, enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrest and detention, widespread and systematic torture and decrees prescribing cruel and inhuman punishment as the penalty for offences. These points demonstrate that the short-term future for many, if not most, Iraqi civilians is neither secure nor peaceful, regardless of whether Iraq is subject to military action or not.</para><para>The Australian government is deeply disappointed that the Security Council has been unable to maintain a unity of purpose on the issue of Iraq. The strong position taken last year, clearly articulated in resolution 1441, was that Iraq was being given one final chance to disarmâone final chance to show its immediate willingness to meet the terms of the cease-fire agreed in April 1991. The goal of 1441 was immediate and complete disarmament, not simply the return of weapons inspectorsâthat was merely an issue of process. A further resolution by the Security Council demonstrating that it was galvanised to take action might haveâjust might haveâpersuaded Saddam Hussein to take the steps necessary to achieve a peaceful solution to this conflict.</para><para>The position articulated by those opposed to action is fundamentally flawed. They recognise that the threat of military action has been the only way to elicit a positive response from Iraq. Does anybody imagine that the weapons inspectors would have returned to Iraq had it not been for the American military build-up? Kofi Annan does not believe so. Hans Blix does not believe so. Even Dominique de Villepin, the French foreign minister, acknowledges that reality, as does his President. So the position articulated by those who have been so critical of the Americans and others is fundamentally flawed.</para><para>They recognise that the threat of military action has been the only way to elicit a positive response from Iraq; yet they squander the leveraging power of a military force by clearly demonstrating they are never prepared to actually use it. This strategy not only is illogical but also ignores the practical reality: it is not possible to keep our forces in the gulf, on alert, indefinitely. And everyone knows that, if the forces were brought home, the weapons inspectors would quickly be expelled from Iraq.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMR</name.id><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe member for Ballarat is a persistent interjector!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name></talker><para>âThe government does not accept that the only thing required to achieve complete and comprehensive disarmament is more time.

We wanted the inspectors to do their job. But we have never accepted that they should have had to play the role of detective. They had neither the skills nor the powers to fulfil this role effectively. Their presence inhibited Saddam's weapons programs, but the presence of inspectors alone could never have delivered total and complete disarmament in the face of Iraqi defiance and duplicity. A peaceful path to disarmament could have been achieved only if the Iraqi regime had been truly committed to disarming and had worked in active cooperation with the inspection teams. Iraq had to demonstrate it wanted to disarm. It was always a question of attitude and not a question of time.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We reject totally the argument put by France and by some other countries that the presence of inspectors will lead, over the passage of time, to disarmament. We cannot and will not ignore the experience of the last 12 years. We believe that the time has come to disarm Iraq, by force if necessary. We are participating in the US-led coalition to achieve this objective.</para><para>It is important to understand that the decision taken by the government is in accordance with the legal authority for military action found in previous resolutions of the Security Council. We supported, and would have preferred, a further Security Council resolution specifying the need for such action. We did so to maximise the diplomatic, moral and political pressure on Iraq, not because we considered a new resolution to be necessary for such action to be legitimate.</para><para>Our legal advice, provided by the head of the Office of International Law in the Attorney-General's Department and the senior legal adviser to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is unequivocal. The existing United Nations Security Council resolutions already provide for the use of force to disarm Iraq and restore international peace and security to the area. This legal advice is consistent with that provided to the British government by its Attorney-General.</para><para>Security Council resolution 678, adopted in 1990, authorised the use of all necessary means not only to implement resolution 660, which demanded Iraq withdraw from Kuwait, but also to implement all subsequent relevant resolutions and to restore international peace and security in the area. Resolution 687, which provided the cease-fire terms for Iraq in April 1991, affirmed resolution 678. Security Council resolution 1441 confirms that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations, a point on which there is unanimous agreement, including by even the Leader of the Opposition.</para><para>Iraq's past and continuing breaches of the cease-fire obligations negate the basis for the formal cease-fire. Iraq has by its conduct demonstrated that it did not and does not accept the terms of the cease-fire. Consequently, we have received legal advice that `the cease-fire is not effective and the authorisation for the use of force in Security Council resolution 678 is reactivated'. It follows, so I am advised, that referring to the use of such force against Iraq as `unilateral' is wrong. Any informed analysis of the Security Council resolutions leads to this conclusion.</para><para>I note that the former Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under the Keating government, Mr Michael Costello, has reached the same conclusion. The use of military force, according to Mr Michael Costello, is already authorised by the United Nations. This advice is not new. Our deployment of forces to the gulf in 1998, strongly supported by the then Leader of the Opposition, in support of Operation Desert Fox was undertaken on the same basis. The Clinton administration clearly understood and argued, as the Bush administration does now, that existing Security Council resolutions clearly allow for the use of military force.</para><para>I table the legal advice provided by the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; the summary legal advice provided to the British government by its Attorney-General, Lord Goldsmith; and the transcript of an interview with Mr Michael Costello, former Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under the Keating government.</para><para>Australia and the other members of the coalition are therefore still acting under the authority of the United Nations Security Council resolutions. We continue to regard the United Nations as the most important framework the world has to achieve a secure and peaceful world and our commitment to the UN is perhaps personified by the 1,200 ADF personnel who are currently serving in the blue beret all around the world.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe member for Wills is warned!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name></talker><para>âThe government remains extremely disappointed that the Security Council has been unable to demonstrate the necessary resolve to confront Iraq's continued defiance of the United Nations.

This reassurance has been given to, and accepted by, President Megawati of Indonesia, the leader of the world's largest Islamic country. I remind all Australians, regardless of their views on the conflict in Iraq, that our Islamic community, especially those people who have family or cultural ties to the Middle East, will especially need our compassion and our support over coming weeks and all Australians should ensure that this is offered.</para><para>As I have said before, and in particular in my address on 4 February, it is crucial for the stability of the region to address the seemingly intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel has no stauncher ally than Australia in the pursuit of its right to exist and the right to secure internationally recognised borders. Australia also strongly supports the establishment of a secure and independent state for the people of Palestine. Australia again urges Prime Minister Sharon and Chairman Arafat to embrace the road map to peace developed by the United States in close cooperation with Russia, the European Union and the United Nations. The Australian government is committed to do everything in its power to encourage and support the Israeli and Palestinian governments to negotiate a resolution to this bloody conflict, which has cost too many innocent lives and cast a shadow across the entire region.</para><para>The engagement of our defence forces will be limited to the period of the conflict and to those elements already deployedâthat is, the transport ship HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline>, which departed from Sydney on 23 January with approximately 350 personnel embarked, including Army detachments providing air defence and amphibious cargo transport craft; the Special Forces Task Group, including a Special Air Services squadron from Perth and special forces combat support elements, including specialist troops to deal with the threat of weapons of mass destruction drawn from the newly established Incident Response Regiment; CH47 troop lift helicopters and a quick reaction force drawn from the Sydney based 4RAR commando unit; a squadron of 14 FA18 Hornet fighter aircraft, three C130 Hercules transport aircraft, as well as an air forward command element responsible for coordinating air operations with coalition partners, and two P3 patrol aircraft currently in the gulf supporting the war on terror; a Navy clearance diving team capable of locating, rendering safe and disposing of mines; and the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Anzac </inline>and HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Darwin, </inline>which were already in the Middle East policing UN sanctions on Iraq.</para><para>Although, as part of the coalition, Australian forces will be under the operational control of the Coalition Commander, they will remain under Australian national command at all times. Australian commanders are bound by Australian rules of engagement and separate Australian targeting directives. The government has been mindful to ensure that the ADF retains the capability to continue to service our current commitments, including our contribution to the UN force in East Timor, and to respond to any short notice contingencies that may arise. </para><para>The deployment, although modest in terms of the size of the total coalition force, is a sizeable commitment for Australia. The 2,000 ADF personnel and maritime, land and air assets currently deployed to the Middle East are not a token contribution. Every one of our service men and women is precious to their families, their loved ones and their nation. I want to say to the men and women of our defence forces who are deployed with the coalition forces that I have the greatest confidence in your abilities and your judgment. You may be part of the Australian deployment or deployed while on exchange duties with our friends and allies. Your nation admires your courage and salutes your commitment to duty. You belong to the most professional armed forces in the world, and all of us are proud of your reputation. Your government and your military commanders have spared no effort and no expense to try to prepare you for the terrible reality of active service.</para><para>I am under no illusionâyour mission is a difficult one and inevitably involves great danger. All agree that the Iraqi regime is one of the most repressive and cruel in the world. It is in open defiance of the United Nations Security Council. No-one wants Saddam Hussein to keep and expand his arsenal of prohibited weapons. We believe passionately that your efforts are vital to ensure the long-term security of Australia and our world. The cause is just. The action is legitimate. We all pray that you and your coalition partners will make quick progress and that soon you will be home, safe and sound, reunited with those whom you love.</para><para>I know that our defence personnel could not function without the support and the understanding provided by their loved ones, their families and their friends, and it will be, inevitably, a difficult time for those at home. Sometimes it can be more stressful for those who wait than for those who are in the thick of action. I ask that all Australiansâregardless of whether they support our participation in the coalitionâshow their support for those who have been ordered to undertake this mission, give special thought to their loved ones and do their best to support and look after them. You have a right to protest, to dissent and to register your concern, but direct those protests to the government, to me, not to those who are overseas on our behalf.</para><para>This decision has been taken by the government in the belief that it is in the long-term interests of this country. It has been taken against a background of a world environment changed forever by the events of 11 September. The world now faces new and previously unknown menaces. Old notions of aggression and responses to aggression do not necessarily fit our new circumstances. Yet one thing remains constantâthe responsibility of governments to protect their citizens against possible future attacks, wherever they may come from. It is in that spirit, against that background and in that context that the government has taken the decision it has, and I commend the motion to the House.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84S</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

The Prime Minister had his moment of truth, and what did we see? We saw capitulation and subservience to a phone call from the United States President. This is a black day for Australia and it is a black day for international cooperation. Today diplomacy was ditched and Australia agreed to the ditching of it. Today we committed to a war which is not necessary. But the people I really feel concern for today are our troops and their families. The reason I feel most strongly for them is that this Prime Minister has put them to war when he did not have to.</para></talk.start><para>Whilst I will vehemently oppose what the Prime Minister has committed us to and will continue to argue against him, I will always support our troopsâso will we all on this side of the parliament. I made this point when I addressed the troops on the decks of the <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline> back on 23 January. I had the courage to look them in the eye and tell them the truth. I had the courage to say to them that, whilst I did not support the government's actions to predeploy them, I did support them. I said to them that day: `I support you in your efforts.' I signalled to the families that, while there may be debates raging in this country as to whether or not it is appropriate for troops to be there, that argument should be directed to the government of the day and not to our great men and women who are prepared to give of themselves to serve this country.</para><para>I say that for this very important reason: our men and women in the fighting forces do not have a choice in this matter. They have to accept the decisions the government of the day makes for themâthe decision that predeployed them and now the decision that commits them to war. Those men and women have no choice; but the government of the day did have a choice and it made the wrong call. It has again made the wrong call and it should reverse that call. Our argument is with the government of the day; it is not and never will be with our troops. We do have to learn the lessons of Vietnam. We do have to understand that these men and women are giving of their livesâprepared to lay them on the line to serve this country, in the belief that the government has made that judgment in their interests and based on all the evidence.</para><para>Sadly, today none of that evidence is any more forthcoming. The Prime Minister has still not made his case in terms of the deployment of our troops. The reason the Labor Party will oppose the motion before the House is that the decision to go to war is wrong. It is not in our national interest, and there is an alternative. Labor does support the disarmament of Iraqâbut it says that that must happen through the United Nations, not through unilateralism. We agree on the objective but not the means. The action proposed by this government is disproportionate to the threat. That is our charge. The Prime Minister has not placed evidence before this parliament or before the people of Australia that justifies that action.</para><para>Let us have a look at the circumstances in which this decision has been taken. It happened because of a phone call from the President of the United States today. For the first time in the history of this country Australia has joined as an aggressor in warânot because of any decision it has been prepared to take on its own or through the Security Council but because the United States asked it to. It committed to war a long time ago. Its membership of the coalition of the willing ensured that. All that was required was the phone call from the US President, and that came yesterday and todayâa phone call from Air Force One on the way back from the Azores; a phone call after a meeting committed the coalition of the willing. Three countries met to commit the coalition of the willing, and that committed Australia inextricably to the war the Prime Minister announced today.</para><para>Let us just contemplate for a moment that meeting in the Azores. The circumstances were that three countries met: the United States, the UK and Spain. The meeting was chaired by Portugal, but those countries were the three sponsors of a resolution that has subsequently been withdrawn from the United Nations. One of those countries, Spain, was prepared to commit our troops to war but not commit its own. They are the circumstancesâthe tragic circumstancesâin which we as a nation find ourselves and in which this government has placed us.</para><para>When the Prime Minister received that call from the President of the United States, did he argue for an alternative? Did he argue to go back to the United Nations Security Council? Did he do anything to try to convince the US President to go down another course? No. He said yes. That is what he said. When the US President rang and said, `We want you to join,' the Prime Minister said yes. The words the Australian people really wanted to hear today from this Prime Minister are as follows. We and the Australian people wanted to hear a Prime Minister reaffirming the faith of his government in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and his desire for Australians to live in peace with all peoples and all governments. They wanted to hear him repeat the words that said that we:</para><quote><para> undertake  to settle any international disputes in which they may be involvedâ</para></quote><para>and Iraq is one of thoseâ</para><quote><para>by peaceful means  and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMV</name.id><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hunt</name></talker><para>âWe wanted to hear you.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe member for Flinders!

Three countries walked awayâthe US, the UK and Spain. Australia was not even there in the process where they made the decision to walk away. The Prime Minister was told of them walking away in a phone call with the US President as he was returning homeâhe did not even ring him from the location of the meeting. Yet, in all of those circumstances, he agreed. Despite his conviction that we needed a second resolution, despite the ANZUS treaty saying that we should seek to resolve through peaceful means, despite him saying time and time again to the Australian people that he wanted to have this matter resolved through the UN, he walked away. Do you know why this trio walked away? Because the United Nations would not support their position.</para></talk.start></continue><para>These are the circumstances where the Prime Minister could not get a moral majority, so he has joined an immoral minority. These are the circumstances that he has placed this nation in. It is immoral because they could not win the argument in the United Nationsâthey could not achieve the resolution by peaceful means. They could not achieve what the ANZUS treaty says they should achieve by trying to convince, argue and demonstrate the importance of resolutions through the United Nations, so they walked away. They have effectively torn up that commitment in terms of the treaty.</para><para>This decision is wrong because we should never support military action outside of that supported by the United Nations, and also because the Prime Minister has failed to make the case as to why war is the only option. At his Press Club address last week and in the parliament today he has established no link between Iraq and al-Qaeda, no link between Iraq and the events of September 11, and no link between the Iraqi regime and the Bali bombings. He has made assertions of that but he has demonstrated no evidence and no facts that justify it, nor has he produced one skerrick of evidence to demonstrate that Iraq poses a real and immediate threat to our security. These are the tests about which a Prime Minister committing to war has to satisfy not just himself but the Australian peopleâand he has not done it. He has failed to explain. Not once in his speech today did he establish the link between al-Qaeda and Iraq; not once in his speech today did he demonstrate where the threat of real and immediate danger to Australia was. That is the obligation he is required to demonstrate if he is to invoke the use of force. That is what he has to proveâand he has not done it.</para><para>He wants to rely on the legal authority and he tables today, for the first time, legal advice from his departments. I might say that the weight of legal opinion is heavily against that advice. We are in the process of obtaining our own legal advice and will make it available at the appropriate time. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">Government members interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name></talker><para>âThey may laugh and joke about it, but they have been asserting the legality of this for so long now and all they have been able to produce is legal advice from the Solicitor-General and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I will wait for the advice to come. I just make this point: I do not believe the argument is whether this is legal or not legal; it is just that it is wrong. It is wrong to go to war in these circumstances. It has not been justified on any of the evidence that has come before us. Let me go to resolution 1441, because the Prime Minister seeks to justify the action that he has taken today on the basis that 1441 gives him that authority.

You carry a resolution in the Security Council and you do not have to follow it, according the foreign minister. I say this to you, foreign minister: the Labor Party will follow that process even if the Tories will not. Resolution 1441, on whose authority this is based, was a unanimous decision of the Security Councilâa unanimous decision against all of the advice that we were getting that it was impossible to reach such a decisionâthat Saddam Hussein must be disarmed. The Labor Party have consistently agreed with the view that Saddam Hussein has to be disarmed, but we say that he has to be disarmed through the processes of the UN, and so does resolution 1441. But we have heard the foreign minister blow their cover. He is really saying that 1441 does not matter. He is saying that you do not have to follow 1441 by way of intervention. He is making it up as he goes along because he knows that they are on shaky ground. Resolution 1441 was unanimous. It says that Saddam Hussein has to be disarmed; it says send the weapons inspectors back in to do it and have the weapons inspectors report progress. That is what paragraphs 11, 12 and 13 require. They do not give the go-ahead for military action outside the authority of the UNâthey do not. So the Prime Minister's basis for invoking resolution 1441 is flawed.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The second reason why we oppose the Prime Minister's proposal today to support this war is that it is not in Australia's interests that we go down this path. The Australian Labor Party do support the US alliance. We have supported it for over 50 years. We were there at its inception and we will continue to support it in the future. But there is a fundamental difference between supporting the US alliance and being subservient to it. The Australian Labor Party's position is very simple: we support the strength of the alliance but we say that we can have an independent foreign policy in which we engage with our neighbours in the region and in which we use the strength of our alliance to help secure peace, security and disarmament in the region. That is the message I went to China with last year. It is the message I relayed here in a speech before I went: support for the US alliance but preparedness to carve out an independent foreign policy.</para><para>We have been shamed today by a Prime Minister who said yes when a US President rang him, who was not prepared to argue the alternative case and who never has been. He has never been prepared in this debate to address the position of article 1, which says that matters of international conflict and relations should be dealt with through the United Nations. Not once have you heard the Prime Minister respond on that point. He cloaks himself in the US alliance but does not even address the detail of it and, most importantly, he has made Australia subservient to that alliance by this decision today. He has flown in the face of what that alliance does. That is not in Australia's interests. It is never in Australia's interests to have its foreign policy determined by another country. Australia should determine its own foreign policy. It should have regard to the alliances and to the international organisations but it should always determine its own foreign policy. I say this to you: under the Labor Party in government we will determine the foreign policy of this country. We will not have it determined for us by the United States.</para><para>The second reason why this is not in our national interest is this: as a middle power it is in Australia's interests that there be a commitment to abide by the international rule of law and to support international organisations. It must be so. Australia has always benefited most from those circumstances. It has never been in our interests to go it alone. It has always been the strength of our standing and our support in the region that we have responded positively to calls from international bodies. Look at our involvement in Timor under the UN banner. Look at our involvement in the war against terrorism, again under the UN banner. Look at the last time we went to war in Iraq when, because Iraq had invaded Kuwait, we again went in under the UN banner.</para><para>If it was right and appropriate to do it then, why are we walking away from it now? Why, in circumstances in which you cannot get the international community, do you simply walk away? But that is what the government has done, and in the process it has weakened the authority of the United Nations. The very organisation it feigns support for it weakens by this decision to walk away from the UN process and join the coalition of the willing. What sort of a signal does it send to rogue states? If we allow countries to act unilaterally, even if you believe it is in a good cause, we set the precedent for those who want to act unilaterally for the wrong causeâand that is most graphically demonstrated in the context of North Korea at the moment.</para><para>We hear the Prime Minister talk about these threats, none of which he has proven that Saddam Hussein has made against Australia, yet we know of the threats that have been made and the firings and the nuclear capacity intentions of North Korea and he is silent. He says, `This has just happened recently.' That is not true. The circumstances of North Korea and the position we find ourselves in today go back to 1994, and yet this government continues to tolerate those circumstances but complains that 12 years is too long in the case of Iraq. That is hypocrisy, that is double standards and that is using the UN to suit your argument and abusing it when it also suits. That is not in Australia's interests and it will never be the way in which a Labor Party conducts the foreign policy on behalf of this nation.</para><para>The third reason why it is not in our national interests is that it will damage relations in the region. It will damage relations with our neighbours and with our other friends. Why is it that we feel as though we have got to oblige and agree with only our US friends? We have an obligation in this region to cultivate and build relationships, to achieve peace and security in this region, to fight the war on terror collectively. But these actions by the government in going in unilaterally will damage those relationships with our friends and our neighbours. </para><para>The action that the government has taken today in committing us to war will make us less secure in the region, not more secure. In fact, it will make us a target. This war that this government has declared and been involved in today will spawn more terrorism and spawn more terrorists. I note that the US has already raised, as a consequence of its actions today, the terror alert in the United States. I have heard nothing from the government as to what it is saying about the heightened risk to security in this country. This is a question that in the Prime Minister's absence we asked of the Acting Prime Minister, and he failed to respond. This is a question that has constantly been asked of the Prime Minister; and regrettably yesterday, in the Prime Minister's press conference, when the media asked the Prime Minister what new decisions had been taken about Australians overseas, he did not know. He said to refer it to the foreign affairs minister. That is outrageous. This is a Prime Minister so quick to commit to war that he does not even know what the consequences are for Australians in the region or what advice to offer them as to what they should be doing in coming home. He was incapable of answering it yesterday.</para><para>I have said that the war is wrong and the Labor Party will not be part of it. I have said that the war is a threat to our national interests in the region. The final point I would make is that the war is unnecessary because there is an alternative. As late as yesterday, Iraq was continuing to destroy and dismantle the al-Samoud missiles. It was a further continuation of the substantial progress that had been reported by Dr Blix. Yesterday, Dr Blix outlined the remaining disarmament tasks. We have heard no mention by the Prime Minister of those reports by Dr Blix. Dr Blix said that the task can be completed in months. I ask this question, and I pose it seriously: I understand the point about the 12 years; but, if we can achieve the disarmament in the next couple of months, why shouldn't we take the next couple of months? In the context of the 12 years, why shouldn't we take the next couple of months? There is no logical explanation by you, Prime Minister, as to why you have not been prepared to go down that path.</para><para>The President of the United States said the other day that this was the moment of truth. I pose the question: why is now the moment of truth? Why don't we face up to the facts? Why don't we acknowledge that progress has been made? Why don't we acknowledge that the UN Security Council was capable of achieving a unanimous decision; a UN Security Council which, if it is allowed to complete its task, I do not believe would not be prepared to back the snubbing of its decision with a further resolution. If I had been Prime Minister I would have insisted on the UN Security Council proceeding to finalise this matter. I would not have predeployed the troops and I certainly would not have committed them today. What we have got from the Prime Minister is a commitment to deploy our troops based on no evidence, ignoring the reports of Dr Blix and based solely on a phone callâa phone call from Air Force One on the way back from the Azores. That is the commitment that the Prime Minister has made on behalf of this country.</para><para>The Labor Party opposes this motion that is before the House.

He has ignored his obligation under the ANZUS alliance to seek the peaceful path. Instead of choosing peace as the option, he has chosen war. War should only be the last resort. It should never be the first option, and you stand condemned, Prime Minister, for making it our optionâan unnecessary option.</para><para>Labor opposes your commitment to war.

For 12 very long years Iraq has evaded its obligation to disclose and destroy its weapons of mass destruction. For 12 years while that happened the international community passed resolutions and hoped vainly that sanctions and diplomacy would encourage Iraq to disarm peacefully. It has not happened.</para></talk.start><para>To my dying days I will wonder whether those efforts might have succeeded if the United Nations had stood up to its name and shown unanimity and resolve. Instead, Saddam Husseinâa master tactician if ever there was oneâhas been able to divide the global community in his efforts to retain his weapons of mass destruction. For too long too many people have forgotten the chief lesson of the 20th century, which is that you have to take resolute action against dictators and tyrants if you are to avoid more costly action further down the road.</para><para>In this sense it seems to me that you can no longer avoid reality. The world has all it needs in terms of warnings. You could not ask for more warnings. We have here a tyrant who has combined in unique and terrible ways the open support of terrorism. Let us not forget that this is a man who publicly gloated after 11 September. Therefore, is he not a man who would be willing to provide weapons of mass destruction to those who might look for more powerful weapons to inflict damage on the West? Is he not just such a man? When we are confronted with terrorists and people who gloat over the efficacy of their actions and who would plainly not stop at car bombs or aeroplanes, is this not a man who we should be well aware now would be willing to use or provide far nastier weapons? He has shown a great willingness to invade neighbouring countries and a deep commitment to horrific weapons, the weapons of mass destruction, which he is happy to use at the same time as he engages in genocide, murder and torture at home.</para><para>Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are a grave threat to its neighbours, to the world and to Australia's national interest. Despite years of weapons inspections, Iraq has failed to account for a long list of very nasty weapons. If the international community fails to act, it will send a very clear message that rogue states can develop weapons of mass destruction with impunity. In simple terms, very dangerous weapons in the hands of very dangerous men cannot be ignored. They cannot forever be accommodated whilst those tyrants mock our lack of resolve.</para><para>As the Prime Minister and others have said, we must ensure that terrorist groups cannot get their hands on chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. There is clearly the potential for Iraq to provide weapons of mass destruction to terrorists in the future, given its support for terrorists to this point in time. As well, the spread of weapons of mass destruction will only create more opportunities for terrorists to gain access to these most terrible weapons.</para><para>In my view, the government's decision to take action in Australia's national interest is certainly legal and it is morally right. It is the appropriate choice for us to make at this difficult juncture. In fact, we all loathe the thought of warâand the more destructive the war, the more dangerous the war, the more we should dread it. United Nations Security Council resolutions 678, 687 and 1441 provide clear authority for the use of force against Iraq for the purposes of disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. But it is also the right decision. Saddam Hussein has an appalling record; he threatens us all, as has been referred to.</para><para>We hear the claim that the weapons inspection process is working. I wish it were. But I believe that that is a delusion. Iraq has had 12 years to eradicate its weapons of mass destruction. Over those 12 years, the leader of that country has made a mockery of international law: he laughs while we divide. The small amount of progress over the last few months has only occurred as a result of the coalition forces assembling in the Middle East. It has not occurred as a result of a conscious and strategic decision to disarm on the part of the Iraqi regime. And the record of the last 12 years tells you quite clearly that there will never be a willingness to disarm.</para><para>I think it is worth noting on the way throughâI have to say this, to single out a couple of countriesâthat in fact it is not French and German armies sitting around the gulf at the same time as they claim that containment is somehow working. It is not their armies; it is not their troops; it is not their personnel. Some of their leaders, I think, leave themselves open to the charge that somehow other countriesâthe UK, the US, Australiaâshould do all the heavy lifting while they play to popular sentiment. That is very easy to do but it is not wise, not statesmanlike. It is not with an eye to the future security of your people that you do those things. I just want to say that I do not think it has ever been the Australian way to stand back and allow others to do all the work needed to secure a safe place for Iraq's peopleâhuman rights do matterâa safe place for Iraq's neighbours and safety for our own people in the future.</para><para>Others have questioned the motives of the United States in dealing with this matter. I have to say to you that I do not believe there is a hidden agenda. The world has changed since 11 September 2001. Iraq's weapons are a clear threat to the US and they are a clear threat to global safety. The idea that this is about oil has been raised many times; I hear it a little less now. But I do want to say again that America's concerns are patently real, as are ours, and its motivation in seeking a more secure and prosperous world should not be so lightly dismissed. Again, history is always a valuable guide as to the sort of role that countries play internationally for better or for worse. Before I touch on that a little more, I just want to say that I would be keen, along with the Prime Minister and others in this place, to emphasise that this is not an attack on Muslims or on the Islamic faith. Saddam Hussein is the leader of a regime that would describe itself, I believe, as socialist, not Islamic. It is violently repressive; it is cruel beyond belief, including to its own Shiite majority. But this is not an attack on Islam.</para><para>Having made the point that the government and other members of the international coalition are committed to supporting the Iraqi people, I do want to say this: let us look at history. I think history is a very valuable guide. It ought to be more recognised as a pointer to whom you can trust and work with in the world and to whom the world can trust with their leadership and with future actions. In particular, I refer to the European critics of the Americans at the moment, some of them engaging in some pretty cheap anti-Americanism. I do not find everything attractive about America and Americans; I should say that. As a farmer representing farmers, I sometimes have some pretty strong disagreements with them on trade matters, for example. I do not find everything about that culture attractive. But they are enormously powerful. The Labor Party has acknowledged the importance of the alliance. Let me just say, with the greatest of respect, that I do think certain European countries ought to be mindful of what has been done for themânot just by us, might I say, but by the Americans in the past.</para><para>France is free and prosperous today because others have been prepared to make enormous sacrifices for the freedom of the Frenchâand I do not think that ought to be lost. I think, frankly, there are some leaders who are trashing that a little too lightly at the moment. Also, I have always been struck by what Truman did in 1947 and 1948. It is easy to remember that, after the horrors of the Second World War, Europe was in a serious state of disintegration. It was spiralling downwards out of control, as much as anything else because of trade protectionism, with barriers going up everywhere and economies falling into ruinâa bit like Iraq's, as a matter of interest. I understand that, before Saddam Hussein came to power, in US dollars, in today's money, GDP per Iraqi was around $9,000; now it is $1,000. That is a recipe for poverty and deprivation if ever I have heard of one. Truman and the Americans made the extraordinary investment through the Marshall Plan of, in those days, the unheard of figure of $US13Â½ billion. That has built peace and prosperity and self-determination in those nations, and they ought to use that wisely now. I have to say that because I feel it very deeply indeed.</para><para>The disarmament of Iraq will also, I think, contribute greatly to the resolution of that other great festering sore in the Middle East: the Israel-Palestine question. That is important. As a strong supporter of Israel and its right to exist securely and safely, I do acknowledgeâand I think all of us wouldâthat that is a matter that needs to be resolved fairly and squarely in the interests of long-term good relationships in that part of the world and more broadly.</para><para>I ask the government's critics to remember in the days to come that the decision to take military action, if the ultimatum fails, is a decision by the government. As the Prime Minister has said, we have taken that decision. Our service men and women in the Middle East have not taken that decision. They seek only to do their job, and we should salute them for it. I know that our prayersâfrom all sides, to be fairâgo with them. We must never allow our service personnel to be forgotten, as occurred after the Vietnam War. It was not a happy chapter in some ways in our national life: those young Australians who went off at the behest of the government of the day, believing that they were doing their duty by their country, and who were then secreted back under cover of darkness in a way that contrasted very sharply with the hero's welcome that servicemen returning, for example, from the First and Second World Wars received. So we do salute what our serving men and women are doing.</para><para>In conclusion, and in support of this motion, I point out that over the last 12 years Saddam Hussein has chosen to retain his weapons of mass destruction. All the warning signs we need are there. To offer this man comfort by dividing and by failing to show the necessary resolution in the clear face of danger is, in my view, to do a great disservice to future generations of people everywhere, not least of all young Australians. He now has 48 hours, or the world's great democracies will have no choice other than to disarm him by force.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>12521</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAustralians have never been ones to shirk a fight, but of course that is when the cause is just and right. The battlefields of Europe, Africa, Asia, the Pacific and the Middle East all attest to that. We do not walk away from friends in need. We do not give in to bullies. We do not leave it to others to fix our problems for us. We are a nation that takes its international obligations seriously. But war must always be a last resort, and any war, including this war, must always be in the interests of our national security. That has to be the test of whether or not we go to war. The Prime Minister's reasons to go to war with Iraq seem to change by the hour. Today he said that it is to do with disarmament. But last week it was for humanitarian reasons. The week before, he even invoked the Bali tragedy. It is appalling that the Prime Minister is sending our fellow Australians to war when the case for their mission continues to change.</para></talk.start><para>Evidence of any threat to our national security has not been provided by this Prime Minister. So, from the Labor Party's point of view, the only command that this Prime Minister should be issuing today is to recall all 2,000 of our troops already deployed for the war in Iraq. Today Labor says no to war in Iraq. This is not a position that my colleagues and I have taken lightly. We do understand the enormity of our decision. Rarely in our history, if ever, has Australia entered into a war without bipartisan support. We all know that any conflict has terrible consequences for all of those directly involved. That is why all of my Labor colleagues and I have thought carefully and very deeply in coming to our decision to oppose Australia's involvement in a military attack against Iraq without United Nations sanction.</para><para>We have considered in detail the ramifications of our position, particularly what it means for the disarmament of Iraq and for the impact that it may have on our relations with our significant allies, the United States and Britain. We have also had to think carefully about the motivations for and aims of going to war against Iraq and whether conflict is the best way of achieving them. We have decided that war is not the answer. Bombing is not the answer. We want a peaceful disarmament of Iraq, not war. War on Iraq without United Nations backing is wrong. It is wrong because the best way to disarm Iraq is peacefully through the United Nations. It is wrong because the best way to resolve international conflict is through the Security Council of the United Nations. It is wrong because the case that Iraq poses a real and immediate threat to the security of Australia or our allies has not been proved by this Prime Minister. In what situation do we decide as a nation to go to war? It is when our national security is threatened. This Prime Minister has not made the case for war. He has not demonstrated any immediate threat to the security of Australia or to our allies.</para><para>In April last year, we set two tests for whether or not Australia should go to war against Iraq without the backing of the United Nations. The first of these benchmarks was the provision of evidence clearly linking Iraq and al-Qaeda and evidence of Iraq providing weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organisations. The second benchmark that Labor set was the provision of evidence showing a significant expansion of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capability to the extent that it would pose a real and immediate threat to the security of Australia and its allies. These were the tests that we set the Prime Minister if he was to justify military action against Iraq. In almost 12 months, this Prime Minister has failed to come up with one scrap of evidence that links Iraq with al-Qaeda and, in almost four months of searching in Iraq, United Nations weapons inspectors have yet to uncover a hidden stash of biological or chemical weapons or a large-scale program to rearm Iraq with weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>It may be the case that Iraq has such a program. It may have a stockpile of biological and chemical weapons. But nothing so far from this Prime Minister or from the President of the United States demonstrates that this is the case. If the Prime Minister knows something that we do not, he should come clean both with the parliament and, more importantly, with the Australian people and tell us what he knows. Not only has the Prime Minister failed to prove his case, the government has failed the test of proving national interest before taking this country to war. As a result of this decision by this government, Australians are far more likely to be targets for terrorists than we were 12 months ago. As one of just three nations to commit troops to the coalition of the willing, the Howard government has heightened the terrorist threat to Australia.</para><para>We all know that we live in a region marked by political instability and violence. The horrific Bali bombings in which so many innocent people from across the worldâincluding many young Australiansâwere killed and injured have of course driven home to all of us just how vulnerable we can be here in Australia to terrorist attack. Now, as a result of this government's decision, Australia is one of the most exposed Western nations in the world. Australia's involvement in the war on terror in Afghanistan and in peacekeeping activities in East Timorâboth strongly supported by Laborâhas antagonised some of the more extreme elements of Islam. But the swift and successful response to the Bali bombings, particularly the close cooperation between the Australian Federal Police and the Indonesian police and security forces, shows what can be achieved by strengthening ties and links between Australia and other nations in the region.</para><para>The policies being pursued by the Howard government on Iraq and regional security have served only to heighten the threat to Australian security. The global threat of terrorism requires not the sort of response we have seen, with three nations deciding to go to war against Iraq, but an international response. The best protection we can have from such attacks is through collective securityânations working together closely and cooperatively in security, policing and intelligence work to make sure that these terrorist acts never happen again. That is why we in the Labor Party support the Security Council of the United Nations as the best way to disarm Iraq. For a middle-order power such as Australia, the United Nations presents the best way to protect and pursue our national interests. It helps restrain the actions of larger countriesâthose who think that it is okay to unilaterally strike out against othersâand it also gives us a degree of influence over international affairs that we could never have on our own.</para><para>Over the last 12 years, we have seen that the United Nations weapons inspectors are able to do their job. In the United Nations processes to disarm Iraq following the Gulf War, we have seen a degree of success. By early 1994, the International Atomic Energy Agency had completely removed all weapons-useable nuclear material from Iraq. Weapons inspectors have also been able to destroy or account for all but two of Iraq's 819 proscribed-range missiles, all mobile launchers for proscribed Al Hussein class missiles, 56 fixed missile launch sites, and 155 chemical and biological warheads in an arsenal of 210 warheads. In its most recent phaseâthe resumption of inspections in November last yearâthe weapons inspection program has continued to achieve some success, and Hans Blix and his team have continued to hold out the prospect of further progress if only they had the opportunity. The point is that the weapons inspectors have been able to get on with their job. They have been able to achieve some success and, given more time, they would have been able to achieve greater success.</para><para>I say to the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, the Treasurer, who is at the table: why rush to war when there are peaceful means to achieve our goal? The disarmament of Iraq is our goal, but why not continue to pursue that goal by peaceful means rather than rush to war? The case to rush to war has not been made by this Prime Minister and it has not been made by the President of the United States. We know that our troops will always do their duty, but we on this side of the House argue that our Prime Minister has failed in his duty to them. He has failed to unite our nation behind this conflict, because he has not made the case for war against Iraq.</para><para>I am aware, as are many of my colleagues, how deeply hurt many veterans of the Vietnam War were when they returned home to a nation deeply divided over that conflict. I know many Vietnam veterans in my own electorate and I can see, at a very personal level, the deep impact that that experience has had on their lives. None of us wants that to happen again. That is why we on this side of the parliament make it very clear that, although we do not support the government's decision to take Australia to war, we do support the Australian troops that have been sent by this government into this unjust and morally wrong conflict. They have been asked by the government of the day to do their duty, and I am sure they will do it to the best of their considerable ability. Now that war is upon us, we can all only hope that the conflict will be short and will end with as few casualties as possible on all sides. We all send, to our Australian troops currently stationed in the gulf, our hope for their safe and speedy return.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition made it very clear that opposing this war does not mean that we are a bad ally of the United States. We have fought alongside each other in wars across the world, and Labor is committed to a strong and enduring relationship with the United States. But in a mature alliance such as ours, we do not have to provide such support uncritically. It is the duty of any Australian government to assess each call to action on its merits, with our national interests paramount. Those merits have not been put. Instead, what we had clearly portrayed on the television this morning was our Prime Minister picking up the phone and getting his marching orders from the United States President. Having failed to convince Australians that a war against Iraq is right, the Prime Minister has decided to completely ignore the Australian people. The Australian people have shown in the past that they are ready to act when there is a real threat posed to our national security and to world peace. But they quite rightly expect their political leaders to provide a convincing case to support action. That is what the Australian people expectâa convincing case to support the action. After all, the Australian people are the ones who will be making the sacrifices that any conflict requires.</para><para>The Prime Minister should also be listening to people like Louay Alzaher, an Iraqi dissident now living in Brisbane, who has no love of Saddam Hussein. Saddam is, he says, a monster, but bombing his homeland will only make things worse for Iraqis. Prime Minister, bombing Iraq is not the answer and dividing the country is not the answer.

In all of this discussion one would have been forgiven for thinking that Iraq was a normative state, that it engages in normative rules or that it conducts itself amongst the nations of the world along patterns which are considered normative or civilised. But this whole debate starts because Iraq is not one of those countries, and you cannot come to this debate overlooking the nature of the regime which has been put in place by Saddam Hussein. It would not be a question of concern if this were not a rogue state.</para></talk.start><para>I want to remind the House about the nature of the regime and the country that we are debating, as has been reported on a number of occasions by UN human rights investigators. Mr Max van der Stoel, the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the Situation of Human Rights in Iraq, has repeatedly warned of the violations and the barbarity of this regime and the person who stands behind it. He has repeatedly warned of the horrors that are taking place in Iraq as we speak. He has reported it over and over again.

It engages in torture, branding, administering electric shocks, beatings, eye gouging, rape. In 2000, an Iraqi decree was passed which said that slandering the president carried the penalty of removing the offender's tongue. In July 2000, pursuant to these laws, authorities reportedly amputated the tongue of a person who criticised the Iraqi president. The amputation was performed in front of a large crowd. In 1994, Iraq introduced extreme punishment for 30 criminal offences, including theft and desertion. The punishments consist of the amputation of the right hand for the first offence and of the left foot for the second offence. In 1994 and 1995, soldiers had portions of their ears cut off for deserting. The government branded an X on the forehead of these soldiers so that Iraqi citizens would not think they were wounded or were war heroes. Doctors who refused to perform these operations were threatened with reprisals. </para><para>This is a brutal, murderous regime which not only possesses chemical and biological weapons but uses them on its own people. This is a regime which, during the so-called Anfal campaign against the Kurds, killed an estimated 100,000 people. The Iraqi military attacked Kurdish towns with chemical weapons. In the town of Halabja alone they killed 5,000 Kurds and injured a further 10,000. Chemical weapons were used on more than 40 villages. This is a rogue state; this is not a normative government. It specialises in brutality and murder. It owns chemical and biological weapons. It uses them on its own people. It deports ethnic minorities and it amputates the tongues of those people that oppose the military dictator.</para><para>So we come to this rogue state which defies the norms of the international community.

Going back to resolution 678 on 29 November 1990, the Security Council authorised the use of `all necessary means' to uphold the resolution demanding that Iraq get out of Kuwait. `All necessary means' meant military action.

Iraq, by its conduct subsequent to the adoption of 687, has demonstrated it did not and does not accept the terms of the cease-fire. Consequently, the cease-fire is non-effective and the authorisation of the use of force in 678 is reactivated.</para></quote><para>So we stand in the position that we did back in 1990 when `all necessary means' covered military action, when the then Labor government accepted that it did and when the then Labor government committed Australian troops under that authorisationâan authorisation which now stands on foot and is as valid now as it was then. If it authorised that military action then, it authorises it todayâthe cease-fire has been rendered ineffective. That is the legal basis on which this action is being undertakenâthe legal basis that has been laid down and authorised by the Security Council and refreshed as recently as resolution 1441, which actually found a material breach.</para><para>So what then are the objections to this conduct which I believe, and which the government's legal advice believes, is authorised by the UN Security Council? The first is that we have not left enough time for inspectorsâthat, if we allowed the inspectors more time, somehow these weapons would disappear. This has been going on since 1991. I suggest to the House that, if Saddam Husseinâthe brutal dictator of Baghdadâhad any intention of disarming himself, he would have done so before 2003.</para><para>The only thing that got this back on track was resolution 1441 and the pre-deployment of forces. He had no intention whatsoever of complying. We know that from the history between 1991 and 2002. What got this back on track was resolution 1441 exercising and reactivating that mandate and the pre-deployment of forces. If Saddam Hussein wanted to disarm and render the cease-fire effective, he would be following the path that was taken by South Africa, Kazakhstan or the Ukraine. And he was warned. Resolution 1441 of November 1992 described a last chance. It said `a final opportunity to comply'. If there had been any doubt that there had been some laches, acquiescence or anything like that over the period from 1991, 1441 said `a final opportunity to comply'.</para><para>You could put your faith in the inspectors that, after 1991 and all of the resolutions sinceâthe 17 or the 18 and No. 1441âand the non-cooperation, he now stands poised for a change in his attitude. But those who deal with brutal dictators and murderous regimes know that they do not respond to the rational argument or the niceties or complexities of diplomacy. Essentially, these are regimes which rely on weapons of mass destruction to hold them in power. If the international community is determined to disarm Saddam then all necessary means most probably will have to be invoked.</para><para>The second argument that is put is that somehow a new authorisation is required from the UN. As I have already argued, there is authorisation. How new does the authorisation have to be, as new as the last chance in November of 2002? No new authorisation is required because Saddam Hussein is on notice, has been on notice and was given a final notice in November.</para><para>Because of the negotiations that have been transpiring in the Security Council over recent weeks, the point I have made previously I make again: I do not believe that Australia can afford to fetter its foreign policy, as was stated by the Leader of the Opposition, by promulgating a doctrine that it will never engage in military conduct without authorisation of the UN. You can put forward that rule if you like. But that rule would not have authorised the allies in Kosovo. Kosovo is an interesting case that never gets mentioned in these debates. There was no UN authorisation of the activity in Kosovo. That happened to be in defence of Muslims, incidentally.</para><para>There is an obvious reason. Nation states will reserve to themselves, I believe, the right to determine their own policy and not contract it out in a way which will be subject to the vagaries of a P5 veto. That is the reality. If you put forward the proposition that you will not act in your foreign policy without a UN mandate, you are effectively saying to any one of the P5 powers that they have the right to veto your policy at a particular pointânot all of them; any single one of them. It is effectively saying the French could veto Australia's foreign policy. Suppose Australia wanted to take a strong stand against some area of French interest. Would we hand over to the French the right to veto that? I do not believe so.</para><para>The third reason that is put is that this will lead to some new American unilateralism. For the reasons I have already argued, I do not believe that to be the case, firstly, because there is UN approval; secondly, because in relation to this matter the issues which are at stake I believe authorise and justify intervention; and, thirdly, because I believe the risk of terrorism and the possibility that rogue states will link with terror internationally means that countries, including Australia, have the right to defend themselves against possibilities that we would not want to wait to see occur before we took action to secure our citizens.</para><para>It is argued by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that this will make us a target for terrorism. We are a target for terrorism. Bali showed that. Bali was not a consequence of Australia's position in relation to Iraq; it was a consequence of the action we took in relation to East Timor. Mr bin Laden has made that clear. He has made clear that he regards Australia as a legitimate terrorist target because of East Timor, not because of Iraq.</para><para>It is important that we as a government make clear our resolve to disarm brutal dictators prepared to use and hoard weapons of mass destructionâand use them against their own peopleâin the interests of the citizens of Iraq. I make this final point: this is a military action determined to protect citizens from weapons of mass destruction. This is not targeting citizens; this is targeting a regime that targets citizens. I believe that the citizens of Iraq have their best chance to live in peace without summary and arbitrary execution and torture if those weapons are taken out of the hands of the brutal dictator and the international community accomplishes that task. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>12527</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis is a war that is not in our national interest. It will weaken our national security; it will not strengthen our national security. It will make us less secure, not more secure. We have just had some crocodile tears from the Treasurer about the brutality of the Iraqi regime. Those facts have been known for a decade. The Treasurer has been missing in action again. Mr Nowhere Man has suddenly discovered there is a problem in Iraq. The problem with Iraq has been there for a long period of time. When the victims of that regime fled to this country were they welcomed by you two years ago, Treasurer? Of course they were not. They were not welcome then. It suits your political case to argue that now, to get over the embarrassment of this outrageous decision that your government has taken over the last few months.</para></talk.start><para>It is not in this country's national interest and it is not in the interest of the security of our citizens. This is a decision which makes each and every one of our citizens less secure, not more secure. Our security rests with our ability to withstand terrorism in this region; the decision that this government has taken means that terrorism in this region is going to be much more likely. For all of these reasons, the Prime Minister's decision to commit Australian troops to war is simply wrongâwrong for the country and wrong for people not only of this country but around the world.</para><para>Many Australians are concerned about security in the wake of September 11 and the Bali bombings. This government has not been able to demonstrate any evidence of a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaedaâno link at all. The Prime Minister promised to give a link in his Press Club address; he has also promised on many occasions in this House to give a link. But no link has ever been made. That is why those opposite are so embarrassed. They simply cannot see, as the Labor Party can see, that sending troops to Iraq does not reduce the threat of terrorism in this region. It simply does not do that. It is time we faced the fact that we are simply not a superpower. We have finite resources, which should be deployed where they can achieve the greatest degree of security for Australians. But John Howard is blind to all of these essential facts, just as his backbench is blind to these facts.</para><para>One thing you can say about the Prime Minister is that he has the courage of his prejudices. He does not have the courage of his convictions; he has the courage of his prejudices. What are those prejudices? You can see them in this rancid decision today. The first prejudice is his disdain for this region. You have seen it through the whole period of the Howard government. They have not engaged in the Asian region at all. You saw it in his comments about how Australia should be the deputy sheriff in Asia. You saw it in his comments about how he would have a pre-emptive doctrine in this region. That is his first prejudice.</para><para>His second prejudice is that he hates the United Nations. He has continually denigrated that organisation. It has been a feature of this government's decision making across a range of domestic and international policies. That is his second prejudice. </para><para>His third prejudice, and the one that is most fatal for the quality of democracy in this country, is that he always covers up his mistakes. That has horrendous consequences for the quality of democracy in this country and people's lack of faith in their elected representatives. Look at the mistake he made over the children overboard affair, his refusal to come clean before this parliament and the consequences that that has had for this country, not only at home but in the region. Look at how he was outed when he recently went to Washington, and the US President had to confirm that Australia was a member of the coalition of the willing. Was he embarrassed? No; because, by his standards of deception, this was a regular occurrence.</para><para>This Prime Minister has three prejudices: disdain for the region, denigration of the United Nations and covering up his mistakes. If that is not depressing enough, they are now shared by the whole of his cabinet and his backbench. That is why this government is in such political trouble out there and why it is so out of touch with the Australian peopleâso out of touch with what is happening in the lives of average Australians.</para><para>When I was reading my <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> on Saturday, my eye was drawn to a superb letter in the First Byte column. Each and every one of the backbenchers over there ought to be very embarrassed because this letter writer has characterised them very accurately. The letter goes like this:</para><quote><para>Baa baa backbench have you any spine? No sir, no sir, we're all supine. Dubya is our master, 'cause Johnnie thinks the same, meanwhile our sovereignty is going down the drain.</para></quote><para>That sums up the supine nature of the Liberal Party and its backbench and their failure to stand up for decent principles in this parliament, selling out the people of Australia and trying to cover up the mistakes that this Prime Minister has made and his acute embarrassment. </para><para>I would think that there was a degree of anti-Americanism in the words of that letter writer. I do not want my words to be misunderstood: I am a strong supporter of the American alliance and the American people. The problem we have here is a very simple one. It is not the American people who are the problem; it is the American President and American policy that is the problem. There is a whole pro-American world out there; it is just looking and waiting for an American President and an American government that can be admiredâone that will bring forward a decent international policy based on respect for international law, based on respect for collective security arrangements, based on an approach to disarmament that works across the board and based on an attack on weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>We had the crocodile tears from the Treasurer before about the nasty nature of the regime. It is an absolutely repugnant regime. It is one that should be disarmed as quickly as possible. The only problem is that this government has sat back for six years and has done absolutely nothing, meanwhile taking a dreadful attitude to those people who have fled the regime. That hypocrisy of the Prime Minister was summed up in another part of Saturday's <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>with a cartoon showing Mr Howard saying to such people, `Now, when you get back to Iraq, just try and keep a civil tongue in your head,' while handing them a cheque for $2,000. Nothing exposes the hypocrisy of the Liberal Party and this Prime Minister on these issues better than that drawing and that letter.</para><para>The truth is that we have gone through this charade, through the lies and through the deception because the Prime Minister made a commitment to the coalition of the willing many months ago. This whole debate has been about his refusal to come clean with the Australian people. He is locked into George Bush's battle plan for regime change in Iraq, and it has nothing to do with disarming that country. He has become a hostage to George Bush's timetable. That is what has happened and that is why he is so embarrassed. He is putting United States military interests before our own domestic security needs. He is letting an elected government of another country run our domestic policy and our foreign policy. So much for border securityâit has gone down the tube. It has gone down the drain under John Howard. That is a remarkable change in attitude to border security.</para><para>The true cost of our participation in the war in Iraq will be measured not by the billions of dollars that are spent on the military but by the cost that will come from sidelining the UNâa tremendous cost in the long term, and one which our children will have to live with. The sidelining of the UN is the first cost. The second one is a fracturing of the Western alliance and what that will mean for security of not only this region but also the world in the years to come.</para><para>The third oneâand the one that is the most sadâis the way this Prime Minister has been determined to divide the Australian people. He has set out once again to divide the Australian people. There is one thing that can be said about this Prime Minister who has the courage of his prejudice: division is something he is an expert at. In taking this decision today, for the reasons he has taken it, he has profoundly divided this nationâprecisely at a time when we face security threats in our own region and when people domestically crave security. They crave security in health policy and they crave security in family policy. We are now having a divisive debate that we did not need to have. We are having it because the Prime Minister, for his own political reasons, has locked himself into a decision which is not in the long-term interests of this country. That is why I say that the Prime Minister of this country is a great dealer in deception. He may well deserve an Oscar for his efforts, but in the process he has sacrificed the trust of the Australian people.</para><para>He has been promising and promising to give us some evidence that shows a clear link between the regime in Iraq and the events of 11 September and Bali. But it has never materialised. I see the foreign minister over there; perhaps we will get some sort of definitive statement from him about that link. On this most important day in our history, when the Prime Minister has committed our troops to war, perhaps someone on that side of the House will have the decency to make the link. If they do not, once again they will stand exposed for their failures.</para><para>The truth is that there are thousands of Australian lives at risk, and the stakes are simply too high for the type of political game that is being played by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the foreign minister. The truth is that the Prime Minister is not prepared to admit that we have been committed to war for a very long time. Now we are expected to believe that he is absolutely committed to doing something about human rights in Iraqâsomething he has ignored for such a very long time. Of course, that is the problem: the Australian people can see through that double standard. They can see through a fraudulent argument. They can see the lack of a case that this government has yet to put to this parliament.</para><para>Part of the Prime Minister's attempts to denigrate the UN is that he would like people to believe that we cannot let one or two particular nations in the UN determine our foreign policy. What is the alternative to that? The UN might not be perfect, but it is the only international system we have. I think there is a fair body of evidence that would indicate that, first, in terms of disarming Iraq there has been some success and, second, it is the only system we have and there has to be some form of rule of law in the international system.</para><para>Let us go to resolution 1441. There has been some success in disarming Iraq. There has been progress, and there is still the prospect of more progress. So you ask yourself: why have we not waited another couple of weeks or another month? We have not waited simply because George Bush, through his deployment of troops to the region, was never going to wait. This is all about pre-emption. So now we find ourselves signed up to a position where, if the United States wants to go in anywhere in the world for any reason at any time, we just thumb our nose at the UN. It is a dreadful precedent. That smirk on your face, Foreign Minister, says it all.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Crean</name></talker><para>âThe deputy over there?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name></talker><para>âThe deputy sheriff or Deputy Dawg?</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Crean</name></talker><para>âDeputy Dawg.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name></talker><para>âThis is the foreign minister of this country.

The truth is that, in taking the position we haveâin thumbing our nose at the United Nations and in signing up to the coalition of the willingâwe have diverted resources and energy away from our region and our backyard. That is what we have done.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The truth is, as people like Hugh White have said frequently, that there is a need to shift our security focus to deal with terrorism in our region. If this government cannot make a link between Iraq and September 11 or Bali, what are we doing there? Why are we No. 3 in the coalition of the willing? Why have we made our biggest commitment of troops and military equipment since Vietnam? What justifies such a commitment? It is time we faced the fact that we are not a superpower. It is time we faced the fact that we have important work in this region. The government's dilemma was best summed up by former Prime Minister Hawke the other night on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline>. I would like to quote what he had to say:</para><quote><para>If the objective of disarmament is being met by other means, such as rigorous inspections, it is immoral to go to war. It is also stupid. Osama bin Laden must have been praying for the US to attack Iraq, particularly without UN sanctions. It will serve the interests of terrorism as it will crystallise action against the superpower and its allies.</para></quote><para>That sums it up. This is a government that has put the interests of another country ahead of our interests. This is a government that, by its decision to commit to this campaign, has made this country far less secure. What is absolutely amazing is that there has not been one voice of dissent raised by any of those supine backbenchers over there about the actions of their Prime Minister. They are quite happy to go along with these decisions. When they go back to their constituencies in a week or two, I hope they distribute those pamphlets that are now coming out from Liberal Party central casting and going out around the country with people crying crocodile tears because of the brutality of the regime in Iraq. I hope they distribute all those. We want to have this debate on the ground in your areas. The public know the deception that you have been engaged in. They know it well. You have not provided any evidence to justify this war. You have actually been out there fearmongering. That is what you have been doing. You have been fearmongering to justify your warmongering.</para><para>The Prime Minister's speech to the Press Club last week invoked the image of Pearl Harbor. It was truly pathetic. The one thing about Pearl Harbor in the history of this nation is this: it united a nation. The one thing that this Prime Minister is doing is dividing a nation. If he wants to invoke the image of Pearl Harbor, he had better change his ways, because the time of Pearl Harbour was a time when Australians came togetherâwe did things together. The things that we did together were the things that made us strong. That was a time when Australians looked after their mates. It was not a time when governments played the sorts of divisive cards that this government is playingâwhether it is the war in Iraq, whether it is refugees or whether it is the government's attack on the unemployed or any of the other groups in the community against which it seeks to focus resentment in an attempt to avoid political responsibility for some of the outrageous policies that it has put together over the years.</para><para>The truth is that, coming from this decision today, we have sidelined the UN, which is not in the long-term interests of this country. As a small- to medium-sized power it is in our interest that the UN works. What the government has done is sideline it. More importantly, it has divided the Australian people in an immoral way. They expect better from their representatives, they expect better from a Prime Minister and they certainly expect a lot better from a backbench. I would like to see one of the Liberals or one of the Nationals from the other side of the House actually stand up on principle, stand up and criticise the Prime Minister, stand up and expose that fool of a foreign minister and stand up and have the courage of their convictionsâunlike the courage of the prejudices that the Prime Minister has. This is a government which has forfeited, through this decision today, the right to any respect. It has sidelined the United Nations, sidelined international law, divided the region, weakened the country and made all Australians less secureâshame!</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>12531</page.no><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name><name.id>4G4</name.id><electorate>Mayo</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs the member for Eden-Monaro says, it is a pity we did not get even one minute on Tony Blair, whose name has yet to be uttered by the Labor Party in this debate, interestinglyâ</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Sidebottom</name></talker><para>âGo on then, fawn over him!</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>âThe member for Braddon.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Sidebottom</name></talker><para>âTell us you love him.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

The British Labour Party has the advantage that it has a true and a strong leaderâsomething that you in the Australian Labor Party very much regret. This is not just an issue about Iraq; it is about the future. It is about whether the international community's will, as expressed through the Security Council, amounts to anything more than a few words. It is about whether the world has any choice other than to live in the constant fear of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons left in the hands of vicious dictators. It is about whether Australia will continue to play its role as a country committed to non-proliferation, to the rule of law and to the preservation of global security.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Over more than a decade of close involvement in this difficult issue, Australia has sought nothing more and nothing less than to ensure that Iraq complies with its obligations as set out by the United Nations Security Council in 17 resolutions. This government will not stand back at this crucial time and wait for a frightening new era in which terrorism and weapons of mass destruction combine to threaten us. We will ensure instead that Australia plays an active role in shaping a secure future.</para><para>This is not an easy choice and Australia's is not an easy role, but the cost of inaction is to leave our future too much at risk. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait more than a decade ago in an unprovoked and bloody attack on his neighbour, Australian forces were there to liberate Kuwait and force Iraq back within its borders. When the United Nations sent inspection teams into Iraq after the Gulf War to try to ensure Saddam Hussein disarmed in accordance with his obligations, Australians were there. When Iraq resisted and expelled the inspectors in 1998 and military action again loomed, Australian troops again were deployedâwith bipartisan support.</para><para>Again, in recent months we provided our strong support to the United Nations Security Council process and to the weapons inspectors, and we forward deployed our troops to maintain pressure on Saddam Hussein to comply with his obligations under Security Council resolution 1441. When, as now seems inevitable, military force must be used to rid Iraq of its terrifying weapons, Australians will be thereâas they have been over the past 12 years to seek to disarm Iraq.</para><para>The disarmament of Iraq is unfinished businessâthe unfinished business of the 1991 Gulf War. The diplomatic effort to ensure that Saddam Hussein disarms peacefully is now over. We have arrived at this day because Iraq has continued to defy the international community in its pursuit of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. As the House is all too aware, Iraq has deceived, frustrated and ignored the will of the international community for over 12 years. This game of diplomatic cat and mouse is now over. All avenues for a peaceful resolution have been tried and all of them have failed. Iraq must now be forced to comply with its obligations. Such action is consistent with international law. Let there be no mistake: an 18th Security Council resolution was not necessary to provide a legal basis for action to enforce the previous 17 resolutions. Our legal advice is unequivocal: the existing Security Council resolutions provide for the use of force to disarm Iraq and restore international peace and security to the area.</para><para>To understand the legal basis for military action one must understand the chronology of the resolutions. First, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990, the council adopted resolution 660 demanding Iraq's withdrawal immediately. Iraq refused to comply, and that led to resolution 678 of 29 November 1990, authorising the use of all necessary means to force Iraq to leave Kuwait and to restore international peace and security in the area. Iraq's refusal to leave Kuwait precipitated military action, and following Iraq's defeat the council adopted resolution 687, which provided the cease-fire terms for Iraq. A critical condition of resolution 687 was that Iraq comply with its obligations to abandon its weapons of mass destruction. Resolution 687 also reaffirmed the authority of resolution 678 and referred to the threat to peace and security in the area posed by weapons of mass destruction. Iraq's past and continuing breaches of its cease-fire obligations demonstrated that it did not and does not accept the terms of the cease-fire. This was Iraq's choice, and it has turned its back on a peaceful outcome.</para><para>I know that many of those opposite agree that the legal authority exists. On 2 March 1998, when the opposition supported the deployment of Australian forces to the gulf, in what subsequently became known as Operation Desert Fox, the then opposition spokesman for foreign affairs, the member for Kingsford-Smith, said that Iraq was in clear breach of the terms and conditions of the 1991 cease-fire. Since 1998 nothing has changed. Saddam's cheat-and-retreat tactics have remained the same and the legal basis for action has remained the same. Security Council resolution 1441 confirms that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations. Importantly, it acknowledges that Iraq's failure to comply with the inspections regime established under resolution 687 poses a threat to international peace and security and it recalls the authorisation given in resolution 678 to use all necessary means to restore international peace and security in the area.</para><para>It is clear that Iraq has failed to comply with its obligations in resolution 1441. And remember the words: immediateânot after many monthsâunconditional and active compliance with the United Nations weapons inspectors. So on this basisâIraq's continuing breach of the inspections regimeâthe government's legal advice concludes that the cease-fire is not effective and the authorisation for the use of force in Security Council resolution 678 is reactivated. This is a view shared by the British Attorney-General, Peter Goldsmith, who made this very point yesterday. Those opposite would be interested to hear that this is a conclusion also reached by the former Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the one-time chief of staff to the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable members interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name></talker><para>âHe lost his preselection to you, did he? It is a matter of regret that members of the Security Council failed to build on the momentum it established when it unanimously passed resolution 1441âa forthright, firm and final demand for compliance. A united Security Council would have given Saddam Hussein no comfortâno sense that his timeworn game of cheat and retreat could be allowed to continue indefinitely. The vast majority of nations share the fundamental position that Iraq must be disarmed of weapons of mass destruction, and no country has argued that Iraq has complied with its obligations to disarm. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The inability to secure further Security Council action was a direct result of the stated intentions of a permanent member to exercise its veto against the British, American and Spanish resolution, no matter what the circumstances. This denied the Security Council any further role in the disarming of Iraq, but it did not deny and it could not deny the clear and immediate threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction to global security, and it cannot deny responsible members of the international community the legal capacity to act together to protect international peace and security and to enforce existing Security Council resolutions.</para><para>It is critical to understand that Iraq's weapons pose a grave threat to international peace and security and to Australia's national interests. This threat is not one we can afford to ignore any longer. Over the past two decades Saddam Hussein has been allowed to develop, retain and hide weapons which the international community says he must destroy, and he has been successful in doing so. As a result, the world faces a threat which is terrible to contemplate: weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a ruthless dictator with a proven record of using such weapons against not just his neighbours but his own people. No other country has this record of use. Saddam Hussein poses a unique threat. This threat is amplified and made all the more frightening when considered alongside the determination of terrorists to get their hands on weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein does have proven links to terrorism. The combination of his weapons of mass destruction and the determination of terrorists to acquire them is for this government an unacceptable threatâit may not be for everybody but it certainly is for this government. </para><para>Locating, securing and disposing of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities must and will be a major objective for the coalition. We must achieve the disarmament of Iraq. The focus will be on weapons and delivery systems, biological and chemical agents, weapons and dual-use infrastructure, and Iraq's technical and scientific expertise. Having embarked on this path, we must ensure that Iraq is free of these weapons. In doing so we will be removing a threat that has destabilised the region for over 20 years. </para><para>Successive Australian governments, as I have pointed out, have worked long and hard to contain the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Iraq's pursuit of these weapons has been a key concern to us for over 20 years. With all of these efforts over all of these years, we have to accept that the policy of containment has not worked in the case of Iraq. Without enforcement, the international structures of non-proliferation which we have worked so hard to build up and maintain become toothless. Australia will take its place in a coalition to disarm Iraq through military force because we firmly believe we must not resile from our longstanding commitment to rid Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. We should continue to meet our responsibility to enforce disarmament and non-proliferation norms, to enforce Security Council resolutions designed to secure international peace and security and to protect Australians from a new and potentially devastating threat.</para><para>Easing that military pressure now without completing the task of disarming Iraq would be a disastrous failure for global security. Put simply, it would allow Saddam to keep his weapons of mass destruction and it would encourage others to follow his example. We cannot, however, keep the military forces there indefinitely in an attempt at containment. Not only would that prove too costly for those prepared to contribute but the pressure presently on Iraq would dissipate. The strategy of containment simply has not worked and now poses an unacceptable risk in a post September 11 world.</para><para>In contemplating this course of action, the government has been very conscious of the wellbeing of the Iraqi people. Every effort will be made to win the war quickly and to minimise civilian casualties. The current humanitarian situation, ensuring that the Iraqi people are provided with essential needs, is central to the government's planning. In the immediate aftermath of military action, the United Nations, the United States, the United Kingdom and others stand ready to provide humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people. Initially, we have provided the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross with $10 million, which will help to provide the people of Iraq with urgent assistance, including food, water and sanitation as well as health care. We will provide significant additional assistance. Helping the Iraqi people reconstruct a country from decades of corrosive and brutal dictatorial rule, distorted priorities, neglect and mismanagement will be a formidable task. Australia will help the UN and other key international agencies assist in meeting Iraq's recovery and long-term reconstruction needs. Our contribution will help Iraq gain stability and prosperity for the future.</para><para>I have today decided to expel all Iraqi staff from the Iraqi embassy in Canberra. The five staff have been given five days to leave Australia. This is a prudent step in a situation where Australia is engaged in military action against Iraq. It is a sensible step to protect Australia's security and our national interest. This does not constitute a break in diplomatic relations. When hostilities have concluded, we expect a new Iraqi government to resume representation in Australia. </para><para>As a consequence of today's decision forcibly to disarm Iraq, we will see the end of Saddam Hussein's dictatorship. This is of enormous significance to the Iraqi people. Let me make it clear: we will liberate Iraq; we will not occupy Iraq. We want to ensure the Iraqi people control Iraqi oil and that it is used for their benefit. We want to begin the process of economic and political reconstruction, working to put Iraq back onto the path to prosperity. We want to hand back control of Iraq as quickly as possible to the Iraqi people. The United States has said that it will stay as long as is necessary in Iraq but not one day more. Australia shares that objective.</para><para>Australia has pursued the issue of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction with the strongest of convictions that to do so is in our national interest. We have neither shirked the issues nor watered down our principles. Our actions are on the record. These objectives are shared by a number of countries, including our long-term friends and partners in this campaignâthe United States and the United Kingdom. We make no apology for our strong alliance relationship with the United States. The ANZUS alliance is the bedrock of our security. American leadership and military power contribute to a stable security environment in the region. At a time of global uncertainty and major threats to regional stability, in particular on the Korean peninsula, it has never been more important to stand together against the common threats involving the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. </para><para>It is wrong to say that our region does not share Australia's concerns about the gravity of the threat posed by Iraq. In North Asia, Japan and the Republic of Korea clearly and publicly support our position on military action against Iraq. For its part, China has urged Iraq to comply with Security Council resolutions. In South-East Asia, Singapore has been similarly supportive while the Philippines and Thailand have maintained sound and cooperative defence relationships with the United States. East Timor's foreign minister, Jose Ramos Horta, has spoken out strongly on the need to disarm Iraq, by force if necessary. So it is wrong to say that Australia is also one of very few countries prepared to assist in the forceful disarmament of Iraq.</para><para>I am delighted to see the Spanish Ambassador in the gallery. I think Spain has done an extraordinarily able and courageous job on the Security Council and I congratulate the Prime Minister of Spain, the foreign minister and the government of Spain, who have shown real courage. It has not always been popular in the Spanish population, but the government has shown real commitment and real courage.</para><para>There are many good countries that are prepared, sometimes in the teeth of public opposition, to stand up for what is right and for what is important because in the end, even if it is not altogether popular, we will provide a framework for a much more stable and secure world. If we keep shirking our responsibilities, if we keep playing the populist card to try to avoid making difficult decisions, we will of course pass on to future generations of Australians and to future generations of people of the world a weaker international system, a less stable international system and a less secure international system.</para><para>Finally, we will support the brave Australians who play a professional role in what seems to be inevitableâa regrettable but necessary military action. I want to express the government's full support and admiration for the Australian soldiers, sailors and air men and women who serve as part of the international coalition which is committed to disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction and to restoring peace and security. Their work is dangerous but they stand proudly alongside our firm friends and our allies. They will ensure that the will of the Security Council is enforced. As Australians, they will defend our freedom, our values and our security.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>12535</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOf all the questions being asked today by the parliament and the people of Australia in this great debate on Iraq, the most simple is perhaps the most profound. That question is: why? Why war? And why is Australia in this war? If, on the day that the Prime Minister of Australia takes the nation to war, the people of Australia are still asking themselves that question `Why?', is it any wonder that we are now a nation divided?</para></talk.start><para>The tragedy is that we need not have been divided, because the history of this place is that we have always striven to maintain a bipartisan national security policy. But there comes a time when bipartisanship is no longer possible. That time has come. It has come because this government has walked away from the consensus that has governed the national security policy of this country for a quarter of a century following the withdrawal of our troops from Vietnam. Under that consensus, Australia maintained the centrality of its alliance with the United States, the centrality of its adherence to the UN collective security system, and the centrality of our strategic engagement in our region. These have been the three pillars of Australian national security policy for the last quarter-century. They are the three pillars of Australian Labor Party national security policy. But, under this government, two of the three pillars have collapsed: our policy of strategic engagement in the region and now, with this unilateral policy on Iraq by the Howard government, our policy of adhering to the collective security system of the United Nations. It is for these reasons that our bipartisan consensus on national security policy has collapsed: because you on that side of the House have abandoned itâand have abandoned it comprehensively.</para><para>I come to this debate as a longstanding and passionate supporter of the US alliance, an alliance formed by Labor in 1941, an alliance that has delivered great benefit to this nation, to the region and to the world, and an alliance that continues to deliver great benefit. I sayâand many would disagreeâthat America has been an overwhelming force for good in the world. There was the stabilisation of Europe after the war, the stabilisation of East Asia in the post-1975 period and the world's dependency on an open American market to drive the world's prosperity. America has not been a perfect superpower. We remember Vietnam, we remember Chile and we also now remember Kyoto. But measured against great powers and superpowers in the history of humanity, America has been among the most benign in its use of its great power. That is why today it causes me great pain as a longstanding friend of America to fundamentally part company with this administration's policy on Iraq and the policy of global military pre-emption on which it is based.</para><para>I understand the stated reason for the fundamental change in US global policy. It is a response to the horror that we all saw on 11 September. But I submit that this war against Iraq is the wrong response to September 11. This analysis is not unique to the ALP. It is shared by many men and women of goodwillâRepublican and Democratâacross America. It is a conclusion that is not the product of mindless anti-Americanism; it is the product of an analysis that concludes that the UN collective security system is worth preserving, that America must be careful not to compound the threat of international terrorism by the very action that it proposes to remove that threat, and that the invasion of Iraq is not of itself a pathway for the democratisation of the Middle East. For the Australian Labor Party, the US alliance does not mandate Australian compliance. The ALP is responsible to the people, the parliament and the nation for the national security of Australia. If that means parting company with our American ally on this current great question on Iraq, then part company we must.</para><para>Let us go to the Prime Minister's arguments on why we are going to war. He advances four of them. First, we must unilaterally attack Iraq to prevent another terrorist attack as in Bali. Second, we must unilaterally attack Iraq to prevent Iraq giving weapons of mass destruction to terrorists. Third, we must unilaterally attack Iraq to prevent other rogue states giving weapons of mass destruction to terrorists. Fourthâthe great humanitarian afterthoughtâwe must unilaterally attack Iraq because of this government's unique, deep and longstanding concerns over human rights in Iraq.</para><para>Let us go to each of these arguments in turn. The first is that we must unilaterally attack Iraq to prevent another terrorist attack as in Bali. I simply ask this question of those opposite: will an attack on Iraq stop al-Qaeda? Will an attack on Iraq stop Jemaah Islamiah? Will it stop Laskar Jihad? Will it stop any of the terrorist organisations that represent a real and present danger to our security in our own region, our own neighbourhood, our own backyard or even internationally? I submit no, because Iraq has not been behind the terrorist activities of S11 or those in Bali. In fact, by reverse logic you can argue that the very impact of this attack that is now planned on Iraq will add to the recruiting ground for radical Islamist organisations across South-East Asia, thereby compounding the security threat which this country now faces and indeed compounding the security threat faced by others around the world.</para><para>I say this: as this government embarks upon a unilateral military attack on Iraq, what is this government doing about the source of funding for terrorist organisations like al-Qaeda? What has this government said to the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia? What has the government said about the host of charitable foundations run out of Saudi Arabia which, it has been established, provided funding to al-Qaeda and its network around the world? We are about to launch a military attack on Iraq, and your government remains silent on the source of funding for terrorism in Saudi.</para><para>The second argument advanced by the Prime Minister to unilaterally attack Iraq is to prevent Iraq providing weapons of mass destruction to terrorists. Again, let us pose the question that the Prime Minister did not bother to answer in either his prepared speech to the National Press Club the other day or his remarks to this parliament today: `Do I hear any of those opposite claim that in the 20 years or so that Iraq has possessed weapons of mass destruction they have evidence of Iraq providing those weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organisations?' I am waiting.

Are they being given also to Laskar Jihad? </para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us go to the next question. As the honourable member for Lindsay absents herself from the chamber, let us go to the CIA, that well-known sub-branch of the Australian Labor Party. What does the CIA have to say? Through its director, George Tenet, the CIA said in a letter to the Foreign Intelligence Committee of the US Senate on 6 October 2002 that, at present, the likelihood of Iraq providing weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organisations and engaging its weapons of mass destruction itself was remote. When asked further under what circumstances it would be more likely or even probable that Iraqi WMD would be provided to terrorist organisations or be used by Iraq itself, what did George Tenet, the director of the CIA, have to say? He said that under the circumstances of a US-led attack on Iraq, Saddam Hussein may conclude that in the endgameâwhich now may be very near indeedâhe may be tempted to use his weapons of mass destruction in a single last defiant act.</para><para>In all the months that the Prime Minister of Australia has been engaged in this debate, conscious of the existence of this letter from George Tenet in his briefing folder every time he comes into this parliament, has he on any single occasion answered that fundamental, logical challenge against the argument that he advanced? He has not. The reason he has not is that he has no answer for it. He has no answer for this fundamental, logical assault from the Central Intelligence Agency of his principal ally. Furthermore, he suffers the profound embarrassment of Mr Wilkie, a senior intelligence officer of his own intelligence agency, the Office of National Assessments, not only recently resigning but also as part of his resignation statement saying that what he fears is that, in the event of a US-led invasion on Iraq, the dictator himself, Saddam Hussein, may not only use his WMDs but also use them on his own people.</para><para>We have had no response to either of these fundamental, logical assaults on the core element of the Prime Minister's argument for engaging in a unilateral military attack on Iraq. On this day of all days, when we have a formal debate in the parliament, and a formal presentation from the Prime Minister and the foreign minister, are any of these challenges and charges met directly with any form of argument? No. They are swept again under the great carpet of history in the hope that no-one will resurrect these arguments in the future.</para><para>What is the Prime Minister's third killer argument? His argument is that a unilateral military attack on Iraq will prevent other rogue states from providing weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organisations. I simply pose this question again to those opposite: once the unilateral attack on Iraq occurs, what will happen? As a consequence of that will North Korea, Iran, Syria, Libya, the Sudan and Cuba all, forever and a day, refuse to provide under any circumstances weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organisations? Beyond the rogue states, there are 27 countries around the world that possess chemical weapons, 19 with biological weapons, nine with nuclear weapons and a large number with long range rockets. What of those states as well?</para><para>The core flaw and, I think, most alarming and unreported element of this entire aspect of the Prime Minister's argument is contained in a paragraph buried away in the Defence Update 2003, recently released by the Australian government. It says:</para><quote><para>... the Australian Government may need to consider future requests to support coalition military operations to prevent the proliferation of WMD, including to rogue states or terrorists, where peaceful efforts have failed.</para></quote><para>What does that mean? What it means is that beyond Iraq we face the possibility that the Prime Minister will not stop there. Beyond the military attack on Iraq, are we also going to see Australian unilateral military participation in a military attack on Iran, Syria, Libya or the Sudan? Where does this whole doctrine of pre-emption stop? We have no answer from those opposite or from the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, who is at the table. Does it stop with Iraq? Is that the end of the road? Or are there other rogue states waiting to come? The fundamental logic remains: does this action against Iraq prevent so-called rogue states from providing weapons of mass destruction to others, or does it prevent the further proliferation of WMD to rogue states? The logic has yet to be answered.</para><para>The fourth and final argument advanced by the Prime Minister is the humanitarian argument. It says that Australia must engage in a unilateral military attack on Iraq because regime change is necessary and because the human rights abuses under this regime are so appalling. Let us face facts: Saddam Hussein, as we on this side of the chamber have said from the beginning of this debate, is a brutal dictator. He is not unique in this world as a brutal dictator. If you are arguing the doctrine of international humanitarian intervention, I submit to those opposite one very elementary proposition: you have to be consistent about it. Where were you in 1988 when Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons against the Kurds? Did I hear a call from those opposite saying, `We must militarily invade Iraq now because this appalling crime has been committed against Iraq's own people'? I do not recall so. In 1991, even after the Gulf War when Saddam Hussein turned on his own people a second time, did I hear a call from those opposite that we must invade Iraq afresh at that time in order to prevent an attack on the civilian population of Iraq? I heard nothing.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83T</name.id><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name></talker><para>âI say to the minister at the table: when are you going to propose the military invasion of Zimbabwe? You on the opposite side have said that the regime of Robert Mugabe is a massive oppressor of human rights, is responsible for mass political killings and is responsible for all forms of political oppression. Your Prime Minister is chairman of the Commonwealth and chairman of the Zimbabwe troika. Do we hear any consistency in this argument which says, `We shall invade this country because of its human rights abuses,' but, strangely, finds it inconvenient to marshal anything approaching a coalition of the willing to invade Zimbabwe to bring about regime change? The simple argument here is that, if you are going to embark upon the argument of international humanitarian intervention, consistency is its first prerequisiteâand I know you find consistency an awfully difficult proposition to master.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The four arguments that the government and the Prime Minister have advanced in this entire debate are found to be lacking in any elementary logical support. Our argument on the question of Iraq boils down to this: for Labor, a unilateral attack on Iraq with Australian participation is wrong. It is not in Australia's national security interests and there is a better way available to the international community to disarm Iraq. It is wrong because, as we have said from the beginningâas has the bulk of the worldâa second UN Security Council resolution is necessary in order to bring about a proper foundation for any collective military action against Iraq.</para><para>On the question of our national security I simply ask the House: is the security of Australia and Australians in South-East Asia enhanced as a consequence of our unilateral military attack on Iraq? Will we have more friends or fewer friends in South-East Asia as a consequence of this action? Will we have more enemies or fewer enemies in South-East Asia as a consequence of this action? Will Australia be more secure or less secure as a consequence of this unilateral military attack on Iraq? I submit that, after seven years of this government, Australia is infinitely less secure than it was when the predecessor government, the Keating government, left office. Today I simply note for the record that the Prime Minister, keen to refer in embracing terms to President Megawati in his remarks to the parliament today, neglected to refer to the fact that, in a dispatch from Jakarta today, Indonesia declared its opposition to Australia's commitment of troops to any military action in Iraq, saying that the move was against diplomatic attempts at disarmament.</para><para>As far as our security is concerned, this is not just about our relations with our neighbouring governments; it goes to the core question of terrorism. The reason why Australia has become a terrorist target in South-East Asia is not all to do with Iraq. It is to do with our operation in East Timor, which we on this side of the House proudly supported. It is also to do with our action in Afghanistan, which this side of the House proudly supported. But this action against Iraq further compounds the level of Islamic terrorist profiling of Australian targets. Our simple argument to those opposite is that, as a consequence of an Australian unilateral military attack on Iraq, Australia will become more of a terrorist target than it otherwise needs to be. These are the arguments we put forward in this debate. A final one, which relates to the remaining disarmament task for Iraq, is that there is a better, alternative way based on containing Iraq or, further, taking proper and approved action through the UN Security Council under article 42 of the United Nations Charter. That has not occurred.</para><para>What of postwar Iraq? What have we heard from the government on the humanitarian cost of the war? What have we heard from the government on the cost of reconstruction? What have we heard from the government on future governance arrangements for Iraq? On the humanitarian effort, let me tell you what we have heard: 10 million bucks. We have budgeted $900 million for the war and $10 million for the peace. The moral asymmetry of that proposition is obscene. On the reconstruction challenge for Iraq we have heard zero from the government. On postwar governance arrangements for Iraq we have heard zero from the government. Does the government oppose the establishment of a US military governorship or protectorate in Iraq after the event? I hear nothing but silence from the government on this question of policy. I do not hear any policy from the government.</para><para>Our overall great casualty in this entire debate on Iraq, however, is truth. This government of children overboard fame still has not learned to tell the truth to the Australian people. You have not been truthful with us in this debate for the last 12 months. You did not tell us that you were members of the coalition of the willing when you were and, right up to today, you still refuse to tell us what the terrorist impact of this entire policy of yours on Iraq will be. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>12539</page.no><name role="metadata">Vaile, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr VAILE</name><name.id>SU5</name.id><electorate>Lyne</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Trade</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFour months after the adoption of resolution 1441, Iraq has still not fully and effectively disarmed. In fact no-one, including UN weapons inspectors, has been able to describe Iraq's cooperation as immediate, unconditional or active. Security Council resolution 1441 did not ask that Iraq offer limited cooperation. The international community, through 1441, demanded Iraq's unconditional disarmament, verified by weapons inspectors. That is why I endorse and support the government's decision to commit Australian Defence Force elements in the Middle East region to the international coalition of military forces preparing to enforce Iraq's compliance with its international obligations with a view to restoring international peace and security in the Middle East.</para></talk.start><para>There is a legal and moral case for disarming Iraq, and doing so is in the Australian national interest. The legal authority to use force against Iraq to disarm it of weapons of mass destruction derives from Security Council resolutions 678, 687 and 1441, all passed under chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. In resolution 678 the Security Council authorised UN member states to use all necessary means to liberate Kuwait and restore international peace and security to the area. Remember, that was passed after the unilateral invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. That was the first resolution. Then resolution 687 imposed a conditional cease-fire on Iraq following the liberation of Kuwait, based on Iraqi compliance with obligations to disarm its weapons of mass destructionâa conditional cease-fire that is no longer in existence. Resolution 687 reaffirms the authority of resolution 678 and refers to the threat to peace and security in the area posed by weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>In resolution 1441, the Security Council recalls resolution 678 as a relevant resolution to Iraqi weapons of mass destruction disarmament. It recalls further that the cease-fire in resolution 687 was conditional upon Iraqi compliance with Iraq's obligation to disarm, and decides that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of this obligation. This whole issue goes back over nearly 12 years. It was established and passed in resolution 678, authorising United Nations member states to use all necessary means to liberate Kuwait and restore international peace and security. That still exists. It was passed in resolution 687 that there be a conditional cease-fire and the condition be that Iraq disarm itself of weapons of mass destruction. It has not done that. It is in breach of its moral and legal obligations under those resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.</para><para>In resolution 1441, the Security Council gave Iraq one final opportunity to comply, deciding at the same time that any Iraqi false statements, omissions in its declarations or other than full cooperation with weapons inspectors would be a further material breach of its obligation. Iraq has forfeited this final opportunity through its false statements, omissions and lack of full cooperation with inspectors. Saddam now faces a 48-hour ultimatum to avoid war. Peace is still a possibility but there is only one person who can act, and that is Saddam Hussein. We should never forget that the person right through this process who has always had the ability to ensure that peace prevails has been Saddam Husseinâand he has failed on every single occasion.</para><para>Our government's decision to commit Australian Defence Force elements in the region to the international coalition of military force preparing to enforce Iraq's compliance with its international obligations does not just rest on legal considerations. There is a very strong moral case for taking action involving military force if necessary to disarm Iraq. There will never be international peace and security while Saddam has chemical and biological weapons. Saddam has used chemical weapons against his neighbours and his own people before, and there is no reason to suggest that he will not use them again. If there is a convergence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, or the existence of those weapons of mass destructionâweapons known to be in Saddam's possessionâwith terrorist organisations, who would absolutely not have a second thought about using those weapons against the Western world, the civilised world, the democratic countries of the Western world, the consequences would be catastrophic. If the international community does not stand firm on disarming Iraq, there is every reason to believe that other rogue states will aspire to accumulate chemical and biological weapons. These three reasons make a very compelling moral case.</para><para>Our government has and will make decisions based on Australia's national interests. Australia has a major interest and stake in this issue, not least because it is the responsibility of any Australian government to act to protect the security and safety of all Australians whether they are living at home or abroad. Iraq's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction represents a threat to the Middle East, a region of immense strategic and commercial significance, including to Australia. Instability in the Middle East is a major source of international terrorism. Iraq is a known supporter of international terrorism and needs to be held accountable for its sponsorship of such groups. Australia also wants to avoid proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the Asia-Pacific region. It is worth asking how North Korea will behave if it sees Iraq being let off the hook by the international community.</para><para>There is no more serious decision a cabinet minister and a cabinet can make than one involving committing Australian men and women to a possible military conflict. Australia's Defence Force personnelâthe young men and women who protect our nationâare respected worldwide for their courage, bravery and professionalism. They will act if necessary at the direction of the democratically elected government of Australia. That is their duty. Any opposition to the decision that the government has taken to commit our troops to the international coalition preparing to enforce Iraq's compliance with its international obligations should be directed at the government and not at our brave troops. It has been the coalition government's decision to commit to the international coalition and we are prepared to defend this decision. We sincerely hope that our military forces will have the full support of the Australian people if military conflict does in fact become a reality.</para><para>We should never forget that evil only prevails when good men do nothing. Our government will not be accused of doing nothing; history has shown the consequences are too great if you do nothing. There is a very powerful legal and moral case for the effective disarmament of Iraq. If it comes to military action the cause will be just, both morally and legally, and Australia will have acted in its national interest.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>12540</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Fraser</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. The decision by the United States to take military action against Iraq without the support of the international community marks a significant and disturbing turning point in world history. By supporting and joining America's action, the Howard government has made Australia complicit in the mistake entailed in that decision. My criticism of the road this government has taken to war is not based simply on its failure to follow the proper processes of international law. The processes of international law and of the United Nations are important not in themselves but because of what they say of our views about how to settle international disputes. What is particularly disturbing is that in failing to win international support for this war the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia have turned their backs on critically important principles of international relations.</para></talk.start><para>We all agree that Saddam Hussein is a dangerous tyrant and a menace to his own people. We all agree that his failure to cooperate fully with the United Nations' efforts to ensure he has dismantled and removed completely his weapons of mass destruction represents a serious breach of international law. And we all recognise that the attacks on New York on 11 September 2001 and in Bali on 12 October 2002 mark a serious escalation of the dangers of terrorism. But in joining this coalition of the willing, the Australian government has supported a course of action which stretches beyond breaking point the accepted norms of international relations. The proponents of this approach have sought to redefine the accepted rules for military intervention against another country. That is why Labor has placed so much stress on the importance of winning United Nations support for military action against Iraq.</para><para>There is and will continue to be heated argument about whether the action of the American, British and Australian governments is illegal in the absence of UN sanction. But in the context of the Bush doctrine, which seeks to discard the accepted norms of international behaviour, it is undoubtedly immoral. I do not agree with the latest decision by British Prime Minister Tony Blair to act outside the United Nations, but at least Mr Blair made an effort to push some sort of independent agenda. He led vigorous efforts to try and encourage those forces within the United States that wished to act within the United Nations systemâeven if, ultimately, he has been unsuccessful. The Australian government is without even that much too small element of independent thought and analysis. The most likely explanation is that our Prime Minister, Mr Howard, believes Australia's best interests are served by sycophantically following the American lead no matter what and no matter where. He has tried to cloak his stance in respectability by arguing that he too would prefer a solution that is endorsed by the United Nations. But it is very clear that the Prime Minister's history of contempt for the United Nations totally undermines that argument.</para><para>I believe that the Prime Minister committed Australia to this war last April and has been committed to war ever since. AAP reported on 9 April last year, during the Prime Minister's visit to London, that heâalong with Canadian Prime Minister Chretien and New Zealand Prime Minister Clarkâheld a 30-minute meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair. I believe that in that meeting Mr Howard sent a message through Mr Blair to US President George Bush that Australia would support military action against Iraq. Now, just short of a year later, our Prime Minister is delivering on that promise.</para><para>But this decision was not one made by the Prime Minister alone. It is a decision for which every member of the government bears responsibility, not least the Treasurer and leadership pretender, the member for Higgins. Let no-one forget in the months and years ahead that the Treasurer has been at the heart of the decision to commit Australia's troops to this war. Do not let him ever try to rewrite the history. If and when he assumes his party's leadership, it will be important to remember that the member for Higgins was at all relevant times a member of the cabinet's National Security Committee, and therefore was placed right at the heart of this decision. And we should not forget his role in the scandalous accusations last year that critics of the American approach to Iraq were appeasers or supporters of Saddam Hussein.</para><para>We are at a turning point in the history of international relations, where nations must make choices about how we resolve international disputes. The environment has changed fundamentally since the end of the Cold War, which left one dominant superpower in a position of unchallenged military dominance. This is a debate not just about Iraq but about whether that superpower has the right to proceed unilaterally. Most of America's friends are urging it not to do soâincluding some of its traditionally closest friends, such as the government of Canada. But not our Prime Minister. Australia has played a fawning and embarrassing role of deputy sheriff. Our Prime Minister has been a completely uncritical supporter of the American approach.</para><para>The attitudes of the Australian people to this war give an important insight into the dangerous course this government has taken and into the flaws in its argument. Traditionally, Australians have supported their government when troops have been committed to military conflict. Even the Vietnam War, which ultimately became so controversial, had the support of the majority of Australians when our troops were first deployed. It was only in the face of overwhelming evidence of the lack of justification and of the horrendous consequences of that war that public opinion turned against the Vietnam War.</para><para>This is not to say our decision on this war should be dictated by public opinion. If a decision is right it should be supported. If it is wrong it should be opposed. But the weight of opinion against the war is significant because it shows that the people have seen through the government's flimsy arguments. The government's failure to win support for this commitment to warâunlike all the other commitments in our historyâhas not arisen because the Australian people have changed their fundamental character. The failure to win the public's support has occurred because the government has uniquely failed to justify its commitment to war.</para><para>Labor's argument against this war rests on three foundations: this war is wrong; this war is not in Australia's national interest; and there are better ways of disarming Iraq. We have been arguing for 11 months that there should be no military action in Iraq outside the authority of the United Nations. This war is wrong because it is undertaken outside the explicit authority of the UN. But, more importantly, it is wrong because the government has failed to make the case as to why it is the only possible way of disarming Iraq. War should only ever be undertaken when every other alternative has been exhausted. That is clearly not the case with this war.</para><para>This war is not only wrong; it is against Australia's national interest. Our national interest lies in building a world where countries abide by the rule of law and in which the UN Security Council bears primary responsibility for international peace and security. Our national interest lies in promoting security in our region. Far from making us more secure, this war will make Australia less secure from terrorism in our region. Our final argument is that there are better ways of disarming Iraq. That means giving diplomacy and weapons inspectors every opportunity to succeed.</para><para>No member in this House represents more military personnel than I do. Therefore I am very sensitive to the need to support our troops and their families. The troops committed to this war are discharging their obligations in our democracy. They are carrying out the instructions of the elected government. My argument is not with them. They have my confidence and my support. The logic of the analysis of the facts leads not to criticism of the troops but to condemnation of the government for committing us to war. This government has committed us to a war that is wrong, to a war that is not in our national interest, to a war that is avoidableâbecause other ways of disarming Iraq have not been exhausted. This government has committed us to a war that will divide the nation.</para><para>It has been argued that there is something anti-American about opposition to the decision by President Bush. Let me quote in conclusion an American opinion. From today's editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">New York Times</inline>âI do not have time to read it allâlet me read a critical paragraph:</para><quote><para>This war crowns a period of terrible diplomatic failure, Washington's worst in at least a generation. The Bush administration now presides over unprecedented American military might. What it risks squandering is not America's power, but an essential part of its glory.</para></quote><para>That editorial is a damning indictment of the American position, and it is a damning indictment of the Australian government's decision tacitly, quietly and uncritically to commit us to war in support of a decision of our allyâa decision which in this instance, notwithstanding that the United States is our friend, is a wrong decision which we should not be supporting.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>12543</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI take the opportunity in this very important debate to say first that nobody wants war, but there are times in which you have to deal with situations which require a forceful response. I looked at a speech I made on 21 January 1991. That was a time at which the opposition of the day supported a decision of a government in office to commit Australian troops in the Middle East. Looking at what I said then, the words appear percipient. I was talking about events in the Middle East where there had been an assumed power vacuum, where Saddam Hussein of Iraq had moved to take a pan-Arab leadership role and brutally occupied his neighbouring country Kuwait. I said then that this development had singularly altered the strategic landscape of the Middle East. I went on to speak of that invasion as demonstrating that:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... international lawlessness remains a feature of international relations. Underlying his actions was a belief that the rest of the world and its international agencies were impotent to act in the face of such naked aggression.</para></quote><para>Sunday marked the 15th anniversary of the Iraqi chemical weapons attack on the community at Halabja; according to Amnesty, 5,000 Iraqi Kurds were killed. In 1987-88, at the Anfal campaign, it is said that some 100,000 Iraqi Kurds may have been killed. Saddam Hussein's regime has cost the lives of over one million Iraqis, if you include the Iran-Iraq war. There are over 200,000 Iraqis living in refugee camps in Iran alone, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and hundreds of thousands of others have been scattered throughout the rest of the world. UNHCR says there is something like half a million Iraqi refugees globally.</para><para>I find it very difficult to reconcile these terrible statistics with a view that we should do next to nothing. We have gone for some 12 yearsâI spoke on these things in 1991âusing sanctions; we have used all the mechanisms which we thought might produce a disarmament, which might contain a leader who has used chemical weapons and other forms of horrific warfare not only on his own people but also on his neighbours. There is a human cost for war and it is great; but the human cost of not going to war can also be great, if not greater.</para><para>For the Iraqi people, weapons of mass destruction are not about just ticking boxes off on a UN list; they are really about the very practical tools of repression that are used by Saddam Hussein to enforce his willâand that has happened on a number of occasions. The international resolutions that have been passed, some 17 of them, demanding that he disarm cannot be put aside any longer. The record of this man is very clear. Amnesty International has documented gross human rights violations on a massive scale. These violations have included the detention of tens of thousands of suspected opponents and their relatives; widespread torture and ill-treatment, often resulting in deaths in custody; disappearance or extrajudicial execution of hundreds of thousands of people, including whole communities, for political reasons; the widespread use of the death penalty for numerous political and criminal offences after unfair trials; and the sanctioning of mass killings and torture as a matter of policy. I think few can comprehend that.</para><para>But Australia has responded as best it can, along with the international community, to that repression. I want to make it very clear because sometimes people have questioned what Australia has been doing. Through the period of 1991 to 1996, Australia resettled of the order of 9,129 Iraqis. That was under a former Labor government, and I commend it for that. But between 1996 and 2000 the number of Iraqis who have been resettled in Australia is 9,559. Add the further 3,691 resettled under the refugee humanitarian program between 2000 and 2003 and the total in the seven-year term that we have been in office comes to some 13,000 Iraqis who have been resettled in Australia as refugees.</para><para>Because we have taken a view in relation to border protection and some Iraqis have been amongst those people who have come, there seems to have developed a view amongst some that we should accept them unquestioningly. Our view was that people should come through the front door and not through the window, and we do not apologise for that. But we have not turned anybody away who required protection. The acceptance of our international obligations demands that; we have not turned anybody away who required protection. Since 1999, 4,156 visas for protection have been granted. We are talking about 97 per cent of the people who have arrived in Australia unlawfully by boat being granted a protection visa.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name></talker><para>âFrom Iraq.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>âFrom Iraq. Ninety-seven per cent were successful in obtaining a protection visa. Among those who failedâand I think the figure was about 86âwe have seen some returns. But let me say that it is not as some people assert. I have seen published in newspapers and have heard in debates here the assertion that we have returned Iraqis to Iraq. Not one Iraqi has been returned to Iraq by way of government action. Thirty-nine people have returned voluntarily to third countriesâSyria, Jordan, Iran and Yemen. I do not know whether they, having gone there, have gone back to Iraq. I cannot say. What I can say is that we have not returned one person to Iraq. That has been the action of a government that has been concerned and anxious about the displacement of people. It is a government that remains committed.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One of the points that is made in this motion that I am strongly supporting today is about how we are going to manage the peace. In the speech that I gave in 1991, I was full of hope that we would see a situation where there would be a significant change and where people could go home and rebuild their lives. I do not think it is a good thing that people should be spread around all four corners of the world, losing their culture, lives, families and connections because they are denied the opportunity to start rebuilding their lives in their own country. I make that point very clearly and, as I said, I made that point some 11 years ago when I spoke on this matter. The government has made it very clear that, in relation to this matter, having already funded international organisations to plan for what might well be a scenario where some people are temporarily displaced, we will be able to play a role not only in dealing with that displacement, which I hope will be short, but also in rebuilding the country in a new and peaceful environment.</para><para>I concludeâlooking at my colleague the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairsâby saying that Friday, 21 March is Harmony Day. I want to make the point at this time. We know this is a difficult issue. We would have liked a measure of agreement from the opposition, as they had from us in difficult circumstances like this. That is not to be. But I hope they take an approach which will enable this community to move on, understanding that there are different views, understanding that we live in a democracy in which there are certain shared values and principles, and understanding that we are going to be an inclusive society in which people have respect for one another. I noticed at the weekend that there were many Iraqi people in Australia making known by demonstration that they wanted to see political change in Iraq and they wanted us to play a role in relation to that. I hope there will be a tolerant understanding that they hold a legitimate view and that they can campaign for it. Our fight is not with the Iraqi people. Our fight is not with the Islamic faith. Our fight is with a murderous dictator and a regime that denies the most basic human rights to its own people. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>12544</page.no><name role="metadata">Brereton, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRERETON</name><name.id>5T4</name.id><electorate>Kingsford-Smith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Howard government's decision to commit Australian troops to war in Iraq is a dark moment in our nation's history. The last time Australian diplomacy was so isolated and morally bankrupt was when Robert Menzies supported the unilateral Anglo-French attack on Egypt during the Suez crisis of 1956. Of course, Menzies only committed Australian diplomacy in support of Anthony Eden's ill-conceived plan to seize back control of the Suez Canal. Menzies would not commit Australian military and naval forces to the attack. Now, nearly half a century later, John Howard, that unabashed admirer of Menzies, has gone much, much further. He has committed the men and women of our armed forces to warâa war of aggression.</para></talk.start><para>That is what we are dealing with todayâa war of aggression. It is a war that the Prime Minister has declared in clear breach of the United Nations Charter and international law. Under international law, the use of force is prohibited, subject to two limited exceptions. The first exception is that the United Nations Security Council can authorise the use of force in order to maintain international peace and security. But, in respect of the imminent attack upon Iraq, no such authorisation has been made. The US and the UK have conspicuously failed to secure support for their war resolution. They have not received support from the other three permanent members or from a majority of the states represented on the Security Council. For good measure, the overwhelming majority of the 191 UN member states have condemned the US's bellicose approach.</para><para>The second circumstance in which military force may be employed is by way of individual or collective self-defence. States do not need to await an armed attack. Evidence of such a threat is sufficient. However, the threat must be so plainly imminent that there is no time to avert it by means other than the use of force in self-defence. The US, the UK and our own government have utterly failed to demonstrate the existence of an imminent and overwhelming threat. There is no evidence that Iraq possesses nuclear weapons and, to date, there is only circumstantial evidence as to Iraq's continued possession of biological and chemical weapons capabilities. Until they began their forced evacuation today, the weapons inspectors had found no hidden weapons of mass destruction. There is no reason to believe that further inspections would not have secured the verified elimination of Iraq's WMD capability. Nor has evidence been presented indicating that Iraq has given or plans to give weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organisations. No smoking gun has been found linking Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda.</para><para>The US argues that past Security Council resolutions authorise military action against Iraq. Our Prime Minister makes this claim as well, but this argument cannot be sustained when one examines the Security Council resolutions adopted since the Gulf War cease-fire. The key resolution, resolution 1441 of 8 November 2002, contains no automatic trigger for the use of force against Iraq. The procedure described in this resolution is that, in the event of a material breach of Iraq's disarmament obligations being reported to the Security Council, the council will convene immediately to consider the situation. The Security Council has met and has not agreed on military action.</para><para>Resolution 1441 does recall previous Security Council warnings of serious consequences in the event of non-compliance, but this does not authorise overwhelming force against Iraq. It certainly does not authorise invasion and regime change, but that is what the United States has now embarked upon. We are about to see the forcible overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime, odious as it is, and its replacement with a new pro-American set of rulers in Baghdad. What an extraordinary undertaking. This is something far beyond the military actions of 1991 and 1998. This is something far beyond the scope of any Security Council resolutions. What we are witnessing is an exercise of imperial domination. It is an exercise that will change the regime that controls Iraq's oil wealth, and it is an exercise that will put in place a regime supportive of US military presence in the Middle East.</para><para>We do not know what the humanitarian cost of this war will be; it may be terrible indeed for the people of Iraq. Certainly the international community is ill prepared to deal with the potential humanitarian consequences. These may include hundreds of thousandsâif not millionsâof refugees and the breakdown of Iraq's food distribution, medical and other basic services. This war has the potential to become an enormous human tragedy.</para><para>It is an absolute disgrace that our Prime Minister has committed Australia's armed forces to join in the attack. All along, John Howard has helped to give the US and the UK diplomatic coverâthe so-called coalition of the willing. Without that cover, their plans would never have advanced to where we find ourselves today. Our Prime Minister bears a special responsibility for the potential tragedy ahead. His commitment of Australian forces to aggression may well be the last major decision of his prime ministership. He has maintained his course in belligerent defiance of the overwhelming majority of Australians, who do not support military action in the absence of the explicit endorsement of the United Nations.</para><para>Australians do not support breaking international law and they do not support aggression. We will have to see how events unfold, but by the end of this year John Howard may no longer occupy his high office. Today, however, we are confronted with a Prime Minister who has committed our nation to a war of aggression. He claims that his actions may be consistent with past constitutional practice, but today's circumstances clearly demonstrate the inadequacy of those practices for the commitment of Australia's armed forces to war. The Australian Constitution provides for the federal government to maintain our armed forces for the defence of the Commonwealth. In the modern world, this includes involvement in UN peacekeeping and acts of collective self-defence, but it should not include acts of aggression against other countries. A century ago, constitutional authorities Quick and Garran observed that the Commonwealth's defence power is subject to limitation. They stated that the Commonwealth `could not enter upon naval and military enterprises solely with a view to foreign conquest and aggression; its power is to be used for the defence of the Commonwealth'.</para><para>We must never again see what confronts us today: a Prime Minister who, without the support of the Australian people and without the support of both houses of this parliament, has committed our armed forces to military aggression. It is my considered view that there should be a legislative requirement for the prior approval of both houses of parliament before Australia's defence forces are committed to armed conflict overseas. Such a requirement for parliamentary approval should not inhibit the ability of our defence forces to take action in self-defence, but it would provide a real check on the ability of the executive government to commit our troops to aggression in defiance of the wishes of the Australian people. While this would represent a significant change to our constitutional practice, it is something we must consider.</para><para>Today our Prime Minister does our nation a great disservice. Australia's national interest, our own national security, is best protected and advanced by upholding international law. The UN and the rule of law, however imperfect, remain fundamental pillars of international order, and you cannot uphold international law by breaking international law. The Prime Minister stands condemned today. He should wear his responsibility for this undertaking as a stain of shame for the rest of his days.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>12546</page.no><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILLIAMS</name><name.id>7V5</name.id><electorate>Tangney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise in support of the motion put by the Prime Minister to the House. Advice on the use of force against another nation is one of the most serious issues that a lawyer could deal with. Thankfully, it is not a matter that arises often; but, when it does arise, it is a task that must be approached with objectivity and a careful application of the law.</para></talk.start><para>The Prime Minister has tabled joint advice given by the senior international lawyers in the Attorney-General's Department and in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. That advice meets the criteria I just mentioned and it is advice with which I agree. It is advice that is consistent with the advice tendered to the United Kingdom government and, I understand, to the government of the United States. That said, it is advice to the Australian government independent of that given to other countries and stands on the careful and considered assessment of international law by our own legal advisers.</para><para>The advice to the government is that existing United Nations Security Council resolutions provide authority for the use of force against Iraq for the purposes of disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction and restoring international peace and security in the area. The reasons set out in the government's legal advice are clear and uncomplicated.</para><para>It is well known that article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter requires members of the United Nations to refrain from the use of force in their international relations. That requirement is subject to equally well known exceptions. One of the major exceptions is authority for the use of force that may be given by the Security Council acting under chapter VII of the charter. Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the Security Council, acting pursuant to chapter VII, adopted resolution 678. That resolution authorised member states cooperating with the government of Kuwait `to use all necessary means to uphold and implement resolution 660 and all subsequent resolutions and to restore international peace and security to the area'. `All necessary means' includes the use of force.</para><para>Armed action followed, forcing Iraq from Kuwait. The Security Council then adopted resolution 687 in 1991, referred to as the `cease-fire resolution'. This resolution affirmed previous resolutions, including resolution 678, which authorises the use of force. Amongst other matters, resolution 687 required Iraq to destroy, under international supervision, all of its chemical and biological weapons and its ballistic missiles with a range of greater than 150 kilometres. That destruction was to take place under international supervision, including by a special commission. The council declared that a cease-fire would be based on acceptance by Iraq of the provisions of resolution 687, including the obligations on Iraq contained in that resolution.</para><para>In answering a question in this House recently, I referred to the numerous occasions on which the Security Council had found Iraq in flagrant violation of many of the obligations under resolution 687 that formed the basis of the cease-fire. It is worth recalling the Security Council's own language on that matter. In 1997, in Security Council Resolution 1115, the Security Council stated that it:</para><quote><para>Condemns the repeated refusal of the Iraqi authorities to allow access to sites designated by the Special Commission, which constitutes a clear and flagrant violation of the provisions of Security Council resolutions 687 ...</para></quote><para>In resolution 1194 in 1998, the Security Council stated that it:</para><quote><para>Condemns the decision by Iraq of 5 August 1998 to suspend co-operation with the Special Commission and the IAEA, which constitutes a totally unacceptable contravention of its obligations under resolution 687 ... </para></quote><para>On 2 November 2002, the Security Council unanimously adopted its 17th resolution on the matterâthat is, resolution 1441. This resolution recalled resolution 678, which provides the authority for the use of force. It also recalled that the cease-fire in resolution 687 was based on acceptance by Iraq of the obligations contained in that resolution. Resolution 1441 recorded that Iraq `has been and remains in material breach' of its obligations under relevant resolutions, including resolution 687 of 1991. Resolution 1441 gave Iraq a final opportunity to comply and noted that a failure by Iraq to comply `shall constitute a further material breach'. The Security Council noted that it had repeatedly warned Iraq that it would face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations of its obligations.</para><para>Iraq has blatantly failed to comply with resolution 1441. Iraq has consistently refused to take the numerous opportunities offered to it to comply and Iraq has again refused to take this final opportunity offered to it. It continues to be in material breach. As the advice to the government concludes:</para><quote><para>In our view, Iraq's past and continuing material breaches of SCR 687 have negated the basis for the `formal cease-fire'. Iraq, by its conduct subsequent to the adoption of SCR 687 has demonstrated that it did not and does not `accept' the terms of SCR 687. Consequently, the cease-fire is not effective and the authorisation for the use of force in SCR 678 is reactivated.</para></quote><para>The government has complete confidence in the advice it has received. Furthermore, it is advice that is consistent with that available to the United Kingdom. Only yesterday, the United Kingdom Attorney-General, Lord Goldsmith QC, was asked a question in the House of Lords about the legal basis for the use of force against Iraq. In the course of answering that question, the UK Attorney-General stated:</para><quote><para>Authority to use force against Iraq exists from the combined effect of resolutions 678, 687 and 1441. All of these resolutions were adopted under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter which allows the use of force for the express purpose of restoring international peace and security.</para></quote><para>US Secretary of State Colin Powell, speaking yesterday, stated:</para><quote><para>We believe, and I think you have heard also an opinion from British legal authorities within the last 24 hours, that there is sufficient authority in 1441, 678 and 687, earlier resolutions for whatever military action might be required.</para></quote><para>Obviously, this is not something that the opposition wishes to hear. Undoubtedly, it will refer to published statements and letters from certain international lawyers to the press indicating their view that there is no authority for the use of force. Some of these statements have been political in nature and have used exaggeration and selective quoting of the law to achieve conclusions that are both wrong and offensive.</para><para>There are letters and articles by international lawyers that are consistent with the advice given to the government. For example, Emeritus Professor Don Greig, the author of a well-known text on international law and a visiting fellow at the Australian National University, in yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> referred to the option available to resume hostilities if the conditions upon which the cease-fire was based were not complied with. In the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> today a group of international lawyers concluded that any US led invasion of Iraq already has UN backing.</para><para>To conclude, as some have, that the authorisation for the use of force in resolution 678 has expired is not consistent with established international law principles, and it would reward Iraq's flagrant and continuous conduct in violating international law. Iraq should not be rewarded for 14 years of non-compliance. The authority in resolution 678 to use force for the purpose of restoring international peace and security holds as good today as it did in 1990.</para><para>Iraq must be disarmed. It must not be allowed to continue to violate international law by possessing weapons of mass destruction. I mentioned to the House only weeks ago the frightful prospect of terrorists getting their hands on weapons of mass destruction. In this respect, it is worth recalling the concerns of the Security Council in 1991 as reflected in paragraph 32 of resolution 687. The Security Council required:</para><quote><para>... Iraq to inform the Council that it will not commit or support any act of international terrorism or allow any organization directed towards commission of such acts to operate within its territory and to condemn unequivocally and renounce all acts, methods and practices of terrorism.</para></quote><para>The humanitarian aspects of this matter cannot be ignored. We must not forget the frightful acts Iraq has inflicted on its own people, including torture and the use of chemical weapons. The use of force is a last resort, andâlet us be clearâIraq has been given ample opportunity to prevent it. It will be Iraq, by its own action or inaction, that will bring about the use of force.</para><para>Nevertheless, this parliament can be assured that, in using force, the Australian Defence Force will fight according to Australian rules of engagement and will operate in accordance with Australian targeting policies. The Australian Defence Force is scrupulous in ensuring compliance with the laws of armed conflict, including the Geneva conventions and additional protocol 1 to those conventions. The law of armed conflict forms a fundamental underpinning of both the rules of engagement and other ADF orders relating to the use of force. As the Prime Minister stated this morning, in a number of significant respects, Australian targeting policies are tighter than those of the United States. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>12548</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI support the amendment that has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition. Eighteen months ago the world was united in horror at the events of 11 September in the United States. Right across the globe, among governments and among peoples, there was an outpouring of support for the United States, which subsequently manifested itself in practical measures to deal with terrorism. We saw a remobilisation of the Western alliance. For the first time, ANZUS and NATO declared an attack on one of their members and demanded that all members cohere to support the United States in this particular instance against the threat which had occurred to them.</para></talk.start><para>All those members of the Western alliance defined the issues of international terrorism as a common security interest. The United States was joined by old enemies in the process. For me, the symbol of that was when I and others in the parliament visited Bishkek in Kyrgyzstanâan old part of the Soviet Unionâand saw there, 150 kilometres from the Chinese border, a base in which there were Australian, French and American forces operating under an American commander. We saw the Chinese government acquiesce in what, in other circumstances at other times, would have been regarded as encirclement, and the Russian government support the diplomacy of the United States to get that base put in place. And the United Nations itself was activated in a comprehensive approach to the issues of terrorism, urging all countries to adopt measures specific to dealing with terrorism within their borders, dealing with international financing of terrorism and dealing with the international movement of terrorists.</para><para>I suppose it reached a peakâthis comity of nations' support; a comity shared by their peoplesâin resolution 1441, passed by the UN in November last year. I think it is true to say that, while the United States saw that, in part at least, in the context of the campaign against terror, most other nations saw it as a different problem. They saw it as a problem of the continuing delinquency of Saddam Hussein and they were prepared to be supportive of the United States, whether or not they agreed with all the American conclusions, because the disarmament of Saddam Hussein was right.</para><para>All that now lies in shattered ruins. We have the American alliance with Europe disintegrating; we have the support that had been raised among ex-enemy states of the United States, Russia and China, disintegrating; we have the popular support that was there globally for the United States and the war on terror disintegratingâas manifest by those demonstrationsâand we have the CIA and the FBI warning against a heightened risk of terrorism. Whatever may be the long-term consequences for terrorists of this action, two things emerge with absolute clarity. The first is that the terrorist threat is now immediately augmented by these actions and the second is that the potential is there to create a further base within the Islamic world for those who feel a sense of injustice taken a degree further to the point where they may themselves as individuals commit to acts of terror.</para><para>This is a disaster. Let us not walk away from it: what we are witnessing here is a diplomatic disaster of the first order. We need to have an analysis as to why we have got to this point and we need to understand the implications of it, because the implications are very serious indeed. The only person who is joyful todayâand I hope he is joyful in the context of running from safe house to safe house with people in hot pursuit of himâis Osama bin Laden. Osama has no interest, of course, in the survival of Saddam's regime. He hates Saddamâregards him as an infidel. But Osama has a heck of an interest in building up a sense of injustice about all this to enhance his recruitment base. The point about getting UN approval and having the patience to get UN approval for all of this is that at least it mitigated the capacity of people like bin Laden to portray this as something which it is not: as an attack on the Islamic populations of the world. When the United Nations says, `No, it is not; it is about disarmament of Saddam Hussein,' it mitigates the propaganda. That is the whole point.</para><para>Let me make it clear: it is not in our interests for the United States to lose this war; nor is it in our interests to see this war prolonged or violent. The US are our ally, and we always wish them well. It is not in our interests to see the American commitment to global activity damaged as a result of the experience that they have in this conflict or, as is more likely, by the experience they will endure when they are the administrators of Iraq after this war is over. Our hearts are with the allied soldiers and the Australian troops. May the Lord hold them in his hands until this is over and bring them home safely. That is where our hearts lie, and our hearts lie too with the Iraqi civilians who will be killed over the next few days in whatever numbers they will be killed. But our heads lead us to conclude that this is a profound mistake.</para><para>The origins of this error lie in divided counsel in the United States. I have always had profound respect for US administrations. I have collaborated with them and, indeed, organised Australian military commitments to particular objectives of the United States at a time when it was not necessarily internationally popular to do so. Ironically, one of them related to Iraq in the context of the end of the Iran-Iraq war. But this administration is an administration of divided counsel. We are where we are now because two parallel strategies have suddenly taken a turn inwards and intersected. One is pursued by Powell, which is classic American conservative internationalism, responsive to the system developed by the United States after World War II and agreed by all. It is a system based around the United Nations, international law, alliances and American relationships with other countries to do the things it needs to do.</para><para>On the other side there is a new doctrine of conservative unilateralism which despises all of that, which says, `There is an opportunity here to test a new doctrine on pre-emption, an opportunity to test the proposition that, if we hammer this particular nation hard enough, one or two Islamic nations in the area that may have an inclination to harbour terrorists will respond to it.' Most of those Islamic nations have been responding to the terrorist threat quite nicely over the last 18 months. I do not know how you are going to measure their response being greater than that out of this conflict.</para><para>We had those two doctrines. And that pre-emption doctrine requires a bit of consideration too because that pre-emption doctrine is essentially this: if you see a development in another nation which could conceivably or arguably be a threat to us in the future, you have a right to act against it. You do not have to agree with the Pope when he says that this is a licence to commit mass murder to see that there is a substantial problem with this and lessons may be learned by others, and if I have time for it I will get to them.</para><para>The point is that the troop build-up occurred in accordance with the second of those two doctrines. That came to dominate the timetable for the first. In the end, the pace at which the troops were built up and the failure to get other allied nations to intersect with that build-up at different points of time meant that you could not get at the end of the day a process in place which demonstrated to the satisfaction of the rest of the world that everything had been done that could have been done reasonably to disarm Iraq and that the only alternative now was armed action. I for one happen to believe that sooner or later we would have arrived at that conclusion.</para><para>But it is in Australia's national interest that, when that conclusion is reached, a substantial majority of the United Nations concludes so as well in order that we be protected as a nation against the capacity of those who wish us ill and who wish the United States ill to exploit that commitment for their own nefarious purposes. We have left ourselves, and the United States has left itself, extraordinarily vulnerable.</para><para>Many will learn from this doctrine of pre-emption. India will learn from it in relation to Pakistan; China may learn from it in relation to Taiwan; North Korea may learn from it in relation to South Korea; and, God forbid, in certain circumstances one might even see Indonesia learning from it in relation to Papua New Guinea if they confront a substantial OPM threat at some point in time. Many will learn and the United States will not be able to unteach them. These are developments not in Australian interests. These are developments we should have resisted and been alert to politically when they came on the scene as possible consequences of our actions.</para><para>We in the Labor Party support the troops in the fieldâalways do. We in the Labor Party believe they should not be there. We in the Labor Party look to domestic harmony, not conflict, in this situation. I agree with what the Prime Minister had to say about the Muslim population. I would add to that the Jewish population; one of the ironies of the last few years is that, while our focus has been on the Muslim population, acts of anti-Semitism have dramatically increased, including the fire bombings of synagogues and schools. Our concerns are with them; our concerns are with the troops. But this is a profound mistake, a profound mistake we should not have blundered into. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>12551</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis is obviously the debate that none of us want. We would all much prefer to be debating better schools, better hospitals, better roads, lower taxes, and freer and fairer systems for our citizens. Instead, we are debating a perilous war or a phoney peace. The responsibility for this grim debateâthe fault, if you likeâdoes not lie with the government of Australia. It lies squarely with the government of Iraq, a government which has poisoned its own people, invaded its neighbours, sponsored terrorism, sought weapons of mass destructionâincluding nuclear weaponsâand repeatedly flouted United Nations resolutions. It is a government which thinks nothing of gouging out the eyes of children to get their parents to talk; it thinks nothing of ripping out the tongues of dissidents. It is led by a man who has personally executed dozens of Iraq's leading citizens in his desire for absolute power. It is an evil and vicious regime led by the world's most evil dictator at this time.</para></talk.start><para>We would be foolish not to admit that the risks of going to war in Iraq are frightening. We cannot rule out heavy casualties among allied troops, particularly if Saddam Hussein uses his weapons of mass destruction, particularly poison gas. Almost certainly there will be significant civilian casualties. This will not worry Saddam Hussein but it should and will worry us. </para><para>Obviously, the invasion of Iraq, although justified at international law, will be used by agitators to claim that the West is in some way anti-Muslim. We are not. Nevertheless, it will be said. Then there is the enormous cost of reconstruction if Iraq is to be helped, like Germany and Japan were helped at the end of World War II, to walk independently down the paths of freedom and justice, which is what we all hope. Then there is the increased risk of terrorist attack here in Australia, although it is important to point out that we have long been on the terrorist radar screen and Osama bin Laden himself has referred to our East Timor campaign as a justification for jihad against us.</para><para>I can fully understand why so many Australians have real misgivings about this. There is no harder thing for a pacific democracy to do than to commit its armed forces to war. The consequences of going to war are dire. But I put it to the House that the consequences of leaving Iraq in possession of weapons of mass destruction are worse. This is not a pre-emptive war in Iraq; this is a further development in the war on terrorism which started on 11 September 2001.</para><para>We need to contemplate whether anyone seriously suggests that the sort of people who would fly civilian airliners into civilian office towers would not place an atomic bomb in New York, London, Sydney or Melbourne if they could. That is the risk that the world faces. The level of acceptable risk is different depending on whether the downside is a Semtex bomb in a railway carriage or an atomic bomb in a major city. For that reason, dangers which we might once have decided to live with can no longer be tolerated by responsible governments. Many people, as I said, are understandably dwelling on the numbers likely to die in any invasion of Iraq. I ask those people, with respect, to contemplate the far greater numbers that are likely to die if Saddam Hussein is left undisturbed in place and with his weapons of mass destruction intact.</para><para>We need to face up to the truth that the allied army now assembled on the borders of Iraq cannot be left forever in situ. It will either be used or, in the ordinary course of events, be withdrawn. We need to be aware of the consequences of a withdrawal of that allied army. The first consequence is that we can be quite confident that the United States will retreat into an isolationist fortress, with terrible consequences for the rest of the world. Why would the United States take risks again on behalf of other countries that they would regard for all sorts of understandable reasons as hypocrites? That is the first consequence. The second consequence is that the United Nations will be rendered worse than the League of Nations. If the Anglo-American army is withdrawn, does anyone think for a second that the French, for instance, will put a quarter of a million men onto the borders of Iraq to back United Nations resolutions with a credible threat of force? </para><para>The third and most dire consequence of withdrawal of the forces currently in Kuwait and elsewhere is that Saddam Hussein will be left as the master of the Middle East, because he will have successfully stared down the world's greatest military powers. The immediate result of that will be a new slaughter of the Kurds, who will no longer be protected by the British and American no-fly zone. The fourth consequence will be an immediate resumption of Iraq's nuclear weapons program, assisted no doubt by that other rogue state, North Korea. The final consequence of a withdrawal would be the prospect of nuclear war in the Middle East. </para><para>This is truly a doomsday scenario. This is a scenario for the descent of the world into a new dark age. I am very pleased to say that this is now far less likely because of the decision taken by the American, British and Australian governments. Twenty-six countries in a coalition of the willing are prepared to enforce United Nations resolutions to give such world order as we have a chance to hold. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable members interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EZ5</name.id><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name></talker><para>âMr Deputy Speaker, I can hear a whole lot of out-of-order chatter from members opposite, which really ought to be restrained.

It is not in our national interest, and nor is it in our national security or defence interest. The case for war has not been made outâand, as a consequence, I oppose the war. But at least today the Prime Minister had the courtesy of telling the Australian people and the Australian parliament publicly what he committed himself privately to some time agoâthat is, what he committed privately to President Bush in July of last year. He has been carrying out a charade ever since.</para></talk.start><para>That charade was at its highest when we saw the predeployment of Australian troops to the gulf. That charade ended today; he finally came clean on what he has been committed to for some period of time. But with the ending of the charade comes his betrayal of trust and confidence so far as the Australian people are concerned. It is a betrayal of trust and confidence in the most solemn of decisions that a Prime Minister or a government can makeâthat of committing troops to a military action. The committal of troops today is not in our national interest, it is not in our national security interest and it is not in the long-term interest of our national defence. To disarm Iraq is in our national interest and it would enhance international peace and securityâbut not this way. There is a sensible way in which that can be done, but it is not this way.</para><para>There are, in my view, five fundamental reasons why the decision made by the government today to commit us to war and commit Australian troops to military action is wrong and should be opposed. Firstly, it is a clear fundamental obligation of a government and of public policy that the use of military force should be a last resortâan absolute last resort. It is clear that many member states of the United Nations believe that diplomatic and inspection activity has not been exhausted. That was clearly the majority view of the Security Council; otherwise we would have seen the co-sponsored resolution continuing to be pursued. So it is clearly the case that other avenues could have been exhausted prior to the resort to military force or action.</para><para>Secondly, it is a fundamental principle these days that, if military force or sanction is to be used, it should be under chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. It should be authorised by the United Nations and effected as such in accordance with chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. To proceed down the road the government has now committed Australia, its people and its troops to is to diminish rather than enhance the United Nations. As Australia is a medium-sized country, it is important to our international long-term security and to our interests that the United Nations is viable and effective and is enhanced, not diminished, by such decisions. The existence of the United Nations as a viable international institution is one of the pillars of our national security.</para><para>The third fundamental reason why this decision is wrong is that it undermines our alliance with the United States. It undermines our alliance with the United States because that alliance has been robust. It needs to be a robust alliance where we put our national interests first and articulate them publicly and privately. The great mistake the Prime Minister has made is that his view of the alliance is as a craven one, not a robust one. We have an obligation to pursue our national interest and to put that view, privately and publicly, to our ally. It was in our national interests for the Prime Minister and the government to put the view to the United States that it was in their interests and our interests for this matter to be pursued exhaustively through the United Nations. Of course, when we first suggested that that was the appropriate route, the government described us as appeasers.</para><para>The fourth fundamental reason why this decision is wrong is that the third pillar of our long-term national security and defence arrangementsâthe first two being the United Nations and our alliance with the United Statesâthat of our region and our regional neighbours, has been completely neglected. The decision of the government, particularly so far as predeployment and our commitment of troops now are concerned, will see us become a potentially greater target for international terrorism in our region, rather than a lesser target. It will diminish our national security rather than enhance it when we are seen as being one of the `three amigos'âpart of the Anglo-US Atlantic alliance rather than running the case in our region and our neighbourhood that this matter ought to have been pursued to a final conclusion through the United Nations.</para><para>Finally, the fifth fundamental reason is the emerging notion of pre-emptionâthat unilateralism or pre-emptive strike is a first resort rather than something which is a very high-jump bar so far as international law and international dispute resolution are concerned. It is all well and good for members opposite to talk about unilateralism and pre-emption in a good cause, but it sets a very bad example for a bad cause. The next time a nation state seeks to take pre-emptive action in what others opposite might regard as a bad cause, they will have helped to establish a fundamentally bad precedent so far as international conflict resolution is concerned.</para><para>So what is the alternative approach? What is the sensible approach? The sensible approach was for nation statesâthe United States, the United Kingdom and Australiaâto exhaust this matter through the United Nations and, if and when diplomatic resolutions and inspection resolutions failed, to then pursue the matter through chapter VII. If the Security Council authorised enforcement action through chapter VII of the Charter, Australia could have sensibly made an independent decision to make a proportionate contribution to such enforcement action. That case we should have been arguing throughout our own region. That is a sensible approach for us to take, relying upon the three fundamental pillars of our national security and defence arrangements: the United Nations, our alliance with the United States and our arrangements within our region.</para><para>That approach is reflected in the amendment the Leader of the Opposition has moved: that Iraq should be disarmed; that in the absence of United Nations authority there is no basis for military action; that no commitment of Australian troops should be made outside that authority; and that, in any event, given the decision of the government to commit troops, those troops have our full support. We want their safe return. They have our full support. We hope that no-one in our nation makes the mistake Australia has made in the past: blaming troops for a government decision.</para><para>It is important that Iraq be disarmed. It is a shocking regime. More importantly, so far as international law and the United Nations are concerned, it is in breach of United Nations resolutions and it ought to have been brought to account through the United Nations. That is the fundamental mistake that is being made here. The Prime Minister made something of his legal basis for the decision, arguing that the weight of legal opinion and advice to the government was that, without more, enforcement action was authorised under chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. As a somewhat lapsed student of international law, I think this will be a very interesting case study for international lawyers to delve into this year and for the next 20 and there will be differing views this year and for the next 20 years.</para><para>There is an important point to make, because it makes the fundamental point that, whether this is legal or illegal, it is not the sensible or the right thing to do. When you look at the last paragraph of resolution 1441, you see that it says that the Security Council remains `seized' of the issue. The Security Council wanted to continue to have a role in this matter. Why was the co-sponsored resolution pulled? In the end the co-sponsored resolution was pulled because it was clear that the Security Council would have defeated that resolution. That would have been a telling blow so far as the view of international lawyers on the authority of member nation states to take enforcement action was concerned. </para><para>The last thing the US or the UK wanted was a defeated resolution. What does that tell you? That at least tells you that the members of the Security Council had not exhausted all the mechanisms available to them prior to the use of military forceâprior to the consideration of enforcement action through chapter VII of the Charter. So this is a wrong decision. It commits Australian troops in a wrong manner. It is not in our long-term national interests, it is not in our long-term national security interests, and it undermines the three pillars of our national security: the United Nations, a robust alliance with the United States and sensible arrangements in our region. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>12554</page.no><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name><name.id>SD4</name.id><electorate>Mitchell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe main complaint here in the chamber seems to be that we should not be going into conflict now but should be waiting for yet another resolution of the United Nations.

Your leader said it today: `We will never go against anything the United Nations does not want us to do.' We are controlled by non-aligned countries in the United Nations. There is potential to be vetoed by France. Let us look at what the French interests may be in Iraq. The French were the first in there to start negotiating on the use of the oil reserves immediately after the Iraqi war. The first negotiations about oil that have been recorded were in May 1992 when Hussein Kamel, Saddam's son-in-law and then minister for industry and oil, and the adviser of Monsieur Jacques Chirac started negotiations. The bodies were not cold, and the French were in there negotiating for their cut of oil. The Iraqis preferred to deal with the Elf company because of its high political connections. It seems that the views expressed by Saddam Hussein to a Lebanese journalist in 1975, when he said that his dealings with France were `the first concrete step towards the production of the Arab atomic weapon', have in fact been sustained by the attitude of the French on this issue. One country will control the Australian Labor Party's policy in these matters.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I conclude by quoting an email from an Australian officer on the front line, one of the last emails from the gulf, which was read today on 3AW.

The Prime Minister has divided Australia and made Australia a less secure place for all Australians. He has done this without the sanction of the United Nations or the international community and without the support of the Australian people, and he has done it without the support of the opposition. Labor are opposed to war. This is not a blind, simplistic political statement. As we know, nearly all people are opposed to war. Our opposition to war is based on a set of values and a belief in a process that has not yet been completed. Whether we like it or not, there are times and circumstances when war is the only path left that can achieve peace, but this path and time is not upon us in relation to Iraq. War is not the only option and it should not be the first option; it should be the last option after all else fails.</para></talk.start><para>Today we have witnessed an unprecedented action by the Prime Minister on a decision that commits our country and our troops to war. It is unprecedented because there is no UN Security Council resolution that authorises such action. There is no majority of the permanent five veto members; in fact, probably only two of the five are in favour. There is no majority of the elected 10 members of the Security Council. There is no majority of the 191 members of the United Nations itself; in fact, there are probably something like 180 against. There is no moral majority either, in any sense.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Government members stand up here and say that there are all of these things and that they have a majority. A majority of what? A majority of themselvesâthat is what they have, barely. But of course today's government decision and the phone call from the US President were not unexpected. They were not a surprise. We have all known since July last year that the PM has committed troops and committed Australia to a war in Iraq. We have known since July last year that, the moment the PM got the call for war, the troops would already have been put in place, rehearsed and committed.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The early predeployment of troops and modification of military hardware to be compliant with US war machinery was no accidentâunlike the accident of forgetting to tell the troops that they needed to get vaccinations against anthrax until after they had left shore and were already en route to Iraq. So why the farce; why the long charade on whether the Prime Minister would make the final decision to say yes, to authorise our troops to participate in the war? The answer is simple: it is pure politics. The facade that Australia and the Prime Minister were still in control of our foreign policy needed to be maintained right to the endâto the phone callâbut the answer to any question on this issue was predetermined, just like the commitment of troops. Today's decision by the Prime Minister to finally come clean to the Australian people and our troops, about what they already knew in their hearts, and announce a commitment to war was just the finishing act.</para><para>The answers the Prime Minister should give to all Australiansârather than his attempted justification of war without the United Nationsâare about why our troops were ordered to the Middle East so early in the process. Why did John Howard, Peter Costello and, in particular, the government's ubiquitously silent backbench mislead the Australian people despite clear opposition from the Australian people themselves, the international community and the United Nations? Labor have made it very clear time and time again that we fully support our troops and their families but we do not support the decision of this government to commit our troops. We do not support the decision of this government, on the basis that it is not in the best interests of Australia. This war is not in our national interest in any sense. It is not in the best international interest for global security, nor is it in our best interest to have Australian foreign policy determined by another nation.</para><para>Labor is committed, however, to UN sanctioned action that would allow for the disarmament of Iraq. Labor and I also believe very strongly in the US alliance, which has worked very well for over 50 years and formed the basis of our national security. But believing in and supporting the US alliance do not mean that we have to be subservient to it or the US. We must always act in our best interests based upon our own foreign policy and the best interests of our region. Friends can and do disagree. We have a responsibility where we do not agree to let our international partners benefit from our views and our position.</para><para>Labor also believes very strongly in the UN process. The UN is not a perfect vehicle; it is just the only vehicle and the only process that we have available, and it should be supported. It should be the basis upon which a decision is made by us to determine what should happen in Iraq. But unfortunately this is not the case. As the government now would have it, you are with the United Nations when it suits you but you are not with the United Nations when it does not. Clearly for the government at this stage, if it does not suit them to be with the UN, they will come up with any argument possible to say that war is justified regardless of what the UN does.</para><para>The history of Saddam Hussein and his barbaric regime is well documented. It is a matter of fact that atrocities, genocide, murder and torture have been inflicted on his neighbours and also on his own people. On this matter there is no debate and there is no argument. It is a point to note in this debate that the government will spend nearly all of its time talking about those atrocities because it has nothing else it can talk about. It cannot talk about the rationale for actually committing our troops to war except to say that Saddam is a really bad bloke. But we already all know that.</para><para>Where there is a significant difference, though, is where the international community, the UN and the Australian people are in the process that should take place to ensure what actually does happen. We simply cannot ignore world opinion on this matter. The international community is not supportive of war at this time because there are still other options available to it. The case put forward so often by this government is that if we do not deal swiftly with Iraq then we will be sending the wrong signal to countries like North Korea. If that is the case, we also need to look at the signal that this government is sending to North Korea by actually going to war. What signal does that send? We know what signal that has sent because the North Koreans have already restarted their nuclear program, they have become much more aggressive in the acceleration of their weapons programs and they have actually stated that if troops move close to their borders they will retaliate immediately using the doctrine of pre-emptive strike. So when the government says, `What message do we send?' I say to them, `Yes, exactly: what message are you sending to other states such as North Korea?'</para><para>As I said, North Korea has already reacted to the potential of war on Iraq. Given its place on the list of the `axis of evil', it would assume that it was next, after Iraq. In response, as I said, North Korea has already started to rearm itself in face of a potential war against it. This is the reaction and the message that has been sent out by this government and by others. It also sends a clear signal to other rogue states that pre-emptive action is now the new doctrine; it is okay to do this because other countries are doing it. This sets a very dangerous precedent and one that, in the future, could prove very problematic to the United Nations and the people who support those processes.</para><para>The pre-emptive doctrine so eagerly enshrined by the Prime Minister last year in his remarks that Australia reserved the right to strike at our neighbours in the event that the government believed there may be a terrorist attack based in a nearby nation, even if it was not supporting it, created a very dangerous precedent for our region. It did not increase the security or safety of any Australians. Rather, it has made the world a much less safe place; it has made Australia a much less safe place; and it has made people fear what may come out of this war in Iraq. If the same foreign affairs principle and military doctrine were applied by other countries such as India and Pakistan, Indonesia and West Papua, China and Taiwan, North Korea and Japanâjust to name a fewâyou could quickly see the global security problems that would exist.</para><para>The PM today formalised the commitment of Australian troops that were already deployed and precommitted to war in Iraq. What should have happened instead is the PM standing up for Australia and deciding Australia's role based on its membership of the United Nations instead of denigrating it. Instead, the motion put before this House is all about justification and legal points. You know you are on a loser when the only thing you can come up with is a bit of legal advice. I can get you legal advice that says the complete opposite, and the government knows that all too well. In the summit at the Azores, the group of three that made the decision to go to war were the US, the UK and Spain. Strangely enough, Australia was not part of that decision-making process, yet Spain, which committed no troops, made a decision to send our troops.</para><para>Labor is today arguing against the motion of the Prime Minister for war with a carefully considered alternate position. Labor has moved:</para><para>That all words after âThatâ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>âThis House:</para><para>(1)	insists that Iraq must disarm under the authority of the United Nations;</para><para>(2)	believes that in the absence of an agreed UN Security Council resolution authorising military action against Iraq, there is no basis for military action to disarm Iraq, including action involving the Australian Defence Force;</para><para>(3)	insists that there should be no commitment of Australian troops to a war in Iraq outside the authority of the United Nations;</para><para>(4)	concludes that Australian involvement in a war in Iraq without UN authorisation is not in Australia's national interests or in the interests of maintaining international peace and security; and</para><para>(5)	expresses its confidence in our servicemen and women and our full support for them and their familiesâ.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>12559</page.no><name role="metadata">Thompson, Cameron, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CAMERON THOMPSON</name><name.id>84C</name.id><electorate>Blair</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to use my time tonight in this debate to talk about the way in which France has had an impact on this issue. The steps that it has taken have helped to significantly undermine the United Nations and, in particular, to trash the processes that we have seen grinding away in the United Nations Security Council to try to find a sensible outcome to the problem of Iraq. We are talking about a psychotic dictator; we are not talking about some kind of a remote argument on an esoteric subject that might otherwise be the sort of thing that they would be discussing in France. We are talking about the future of Iraq and its people.</para></talk.start><para>Australians know all too well some of the outcomes of previous French initiatives in relation to foreign affairs. We have witnessed Mururoa Atoll, we have witnessed the bombing of the <inline font-style="italic">Rainbow Warrior</inline> and we have also seen France selling nuclear power plants to Iraq. Those sorts of things should rightly instil in Australians a view that France will do practically anything, will sell practically anything and will go practically anywhere, to advance French initiatives. It is ironic that today we saw the Greens lining up with Jacques Chirac, who authorised the <inline font-style="italic">Rainbow Warrior</inline> incident. They are lining up behind him in support of no action against this sadistic dictator in Iraq. They are lining up with him on those grounds, yet he bombed the <inline font-style="italic">Rainbow Warrior</inline> and he sold nuclear power plants to this lunatic, Saddam Hussein. French imperialism lives today and the French are determined to pursue it no matter what the grounds or what the occasion.</para><para>In this exercise they have set out to promote French interests. The article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>today by Sophie Masson put it nicely. She wrote:</para><quote><para>The French Government stance is primarily driven by Realpolitik and a desire to reclaim an important place for France in world power plays, to position itself as an alternative to the US in terms of a perceived struggle for an empire of influence.</para></quote><para>That is it. I think the FrenchâJacques Chirac and the others in power in Franceâsee their influence in the world diminishing rapidly, particularly as the impact of the French language declines. On this occasion they saw an opportunity to relive the good old days of French imperialism and they took it. So, regardless of the rights or wrongs of the circumstances, France on this occasion has set out to flex its imperialist muscleâand it has done it. It has done it in a way that does not advance the UN, the UN Security Council or the other players in this terrible conundrum over Iraq. It certainly does not assist the people of Iraq.</para><para>I would like to look at the vote that was due to be taken and the numbers as they were stacked up in the Security Council in relation to supporting the proposed resolution that was being sponsored by Spain, the UK and the US. I am indebted to the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline>, where I found, in their Saturday edition, who was for, who was against and who was undecided. On the for side they had four countries listed; on the against side there were five countries, including France. Undecided were Chile, Cameroon, Angola, Pakistan, Mexico and Guinea. Members should note that two of those undecided countries are ex French colonies. In order to get a total of nineâin other words, to pass that motionâyou would need five out of six of those undecided countries. So you would be asking these former French colonies to go against their ongoing links with France. It underlines just how determined, pointed and completely outside the realm of promoting an even outcome on behalf of the world the French were. They recognised an opportunity when their numbers held sway and they exploited it. They did not use the opportunity to try and solve the problem of what to do about Saddam Hussein; they exploited that opportunity to flex their muscle, as they have done in the past.</para><para>I have seen diplomatic language used in the discussion with France. For example, Jack Straw, in his address to the UN Security Council on 7 March 2003, was very understated when he used that famous line and said:</para><quote><para>Dominique, that is a false choice.</para></quote><para>The false choice he was talking about was the choice between disarmament by peace and disarmament by war. I think that, with the background of the French manoeuvring that was going on at the time, he was remarkably level-headed.</para><para>The French went ahead and crunched their numbers. They exploited their position to show the French dominance in the way that it used to exist. That is what they were more concerned aboutânot the outcome of the UN Security Council. There are certainly more issues to be discussed in this debate than the nice words of Sophie Masson. For example, in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> on Monday, 24 February 2003, Michael Baume, the former Liberal MP, went through some of the examples of French interest in Iraq. He concluded that the common perception that there was some kind of US grab for oil was a travesty when you look at what the French are undertaking. He said that it was the exact opposite. He said:</para><quote><para>It is the exact opposite of the reality that oil and massive self-interest are driving French and Russian attempts to protect Saddam Hussein from a US-led war. For them, peace spells payola, no matter what the human cost.</para></quote><para>He went on:</para><quote><para>When Chirac was prime minister, the France-Iraq entente built up a political and commercial head of steam, notably with the French building Iraq's nuclear reactor (later destroyed by the Israelis).

We have witnessed today confirmation of the deceit of the Prime Minister and his government over the issue of the commitment of Australian defence forces to Iraq. We have witnessed also the abrogation of any pretence that Australian national interests are being best represented by our own independent foreign policyâbecause there is no independent foreign policy, as the Prime Minister lies supine at the feet of President Bush. We have witnessed the dangerous endorsement of this new Bush-initiated policy of military pre-emption. We have witnessed the abandonment of the international framework that has been at the heart of Australian foreign policy since World War II. Despite the government's protestations and its laying of legal opinions on the table here this afternoon, it knows, as we all know, that there will be varying opinions and many will be contrary to its own. Those opinions will argue that the government's position is contrary to international lawâthat it is contrary to international law for one country to attack another.</para></talk.start><para>This coalition of the United States, Great Britain and Australia is acting against the will of the world community. Let there be no doubt about it: whatever justification the government might argue in terms of its legal position, this coalition is acting against the will of the world community.

I just want to go quickly to a couple of those views. The first comes from an article published in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of March 15-16, written by Deborah Snow. I will quote only four paragraphs:</para><quote><para>Never has such a line-up of expert military opinion opposed such an action even before it's begun. Opponents of the war who spoke to the <inline font-style="italic">Herald </inline>this week included former Chief of Defence Force General Peter Gration, two former air chiefs, Air Marshal Jake Newham and Air Marshal Ray Funnell, former navy chief Admiral Mike Hudson, former vice-chief of the Defence Force Admiral Ian Knox, and General Alan Stretton, a veteran of Korea, Malaya and Vietnam.</para><para>Overseas, former military luminaries against the Bush strategy include General âStormin'â Norman Schwarzkopf, who led the 1991 Gulf War, General Sir Michael Rose, former UN commander in Bosnia, and former British army chief General Sir Roger Wheeler.</para><para>Their combined reasons are manyâlack of proven links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, absence of immediate threat, concerns about the massive pressure put on the UN, the arm-twisting of small countries on the Security Council, concern about the precedent set by a pre-emptive strike under such conditions, and civilian casualties and worries about the aftermath.</para><para>Admiral Knox warns: âThere'll be 100,000 or more terrorists sign up to Osama bin Ladenâgenerations of hate directed towards the US and its partners in this undertaking.â Air Marshal Funnell called the policy âstrategic stupidity on a monumental scaleâ.</para></quote><para>I want to go to the question of what is in our national interest and, in particular, what is in our regional interest. Who knows what damage will be done by this action of the Australian government? Who knows the long-term implications this will have for international law and global security? One thing is certain: we risk the danger of being demonised in the eyes of those countries in our immediate region. On 18 February, the former Indonesian foreign minister, Ali Alatas, was quoted by IslamOnline as saying:</para><quote><para>The looming US-led war on Iraq will create a fertile ground for extremism in the Islamic and Arab world in an unprecedented way.</para></quote><para>Dr Alatas went on:</para><quote><para>Indonesia would be replete with radical anti-American movements if the US went for war.</para></quote><para>IslamOnline continued:</para><quote><para>He warned that the war on Iraq will change the majority of Indonesian Muslims from moderate, tolerant people into `radical movements which would break their silence by a loud outcry'. </para></quote><para>Two weeks earlier, the current foreign minister of Indonesia, Hassan Wirajuda, told <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> much the same thing. He made it clear that Australia's unthinking obeisance to the American President had very direct implications for our position and reputation in the region. I will not quote what he said, but this much is self-evident: a former Indonesian foreign minister, a current Indonesian foreign minister and today, I understand, the Indonesian ambassador have warned the Australian community that, despite whatever protestations might come from the Prime Minister about the actions of today, there will be elements in the Islamic community elsewhere in our region who will see this as an excuse to become terrorists and take up some form of arms against moderates within their own communities and, indeed, export terror elsewhere in the world. This makes us a softer target. It is certainly not in our national interests for us to continue to play lap-dog to the United States. We must have an independent foreign policy that recognises our own priorities and our own needs, particularly within our own region.</para><para>The fears are not confined to Indonesia. David Steinberg, the head of Asian Studies at Georgetown University, wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">International Herald Tribune</inline> on Thursday:</para><quote><para>A tidal wave of anti-American anger in Southeast Asia seems likely as the United States pushes on with plans to invade Iraq.</para><para>...				...				...</para><para>Such resentment is likely to explode into violence despite Asian government efforts to control outrage.</para></quote><para>Dr Steinberg went on to deliver a grave warning that is particularly pertinent to Australia. He said:</para><quote><para>Southeast Asian cooperation in the campaign against terrorism will be undermined as governments find it increasingly difficult to stand against public opinion.</para></quote><para>That is what is happening in our region. The war on terrorism may prove to be one of the casualties of today's announcement because it has been hijacked by the United States, Great Britain and Australia to justify a completely unrelated attack on Iraq. The deceit will come back to hurt us.</para><para>I want to address the issue of the Australian Defence Force. What is most shameful about today's decision is that this government is even willing to deceive the very Defence Force personnel it has sent to Iraq to risk their lives. When the PM farewelled troops on the <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline>, he told them that they were going to join the international interception force, knowing full well and all the time that they were being predeployed as part of commitments already made by the government, certainly as far back as July last year, for a war on Iraq. The Prime Minister is even prepared to lie to those people who will risk their lives as a result of this decision.</para><para>On 8 February, I went to the farewell of the 75 Squadron based at Katherine's Tindal air base to show those personnel that they had the support of the Labor Party and the general community. I went there because I wanted the personnel and their families to knowâand I want them to know nowâthat, despite the divergent views that we might have in this parliament and in the general community about their deployment, about the policy decisions taken by this government and about the commitments made here today, the support they took with them as members of our Defence Force is beyond debate. Yet what did the Minister for Defence, who was there at the time, use that opportunity to talk about? He talked about the war on terror. He deliberately obfuscated about the reasons for their deployment, just as the government has done with the Australian public over the last six or seven months.</para><para>The men and women of our defence forces deserve much better. The fact that Defence Force personnel are not free agents and must act at the behest of the government of the day is a major institutional strength of our democracy. The importance of their role and the sacrifices they make demand our respect. It is this respect that drives us to ensure that they are not being sent off to war under false pretences. We in the Labor Party are absolutely committed to those personnel currently deployed in the Middle East in this war which has now been announced against Iraq. We disagree absolutely with the policy decisions of the government, but we want the defence personnel to know that they and their families have our absolute support, and we wish them well. As the member for Brand said in his contribution this afternoon, we would like to make sure that the good Lord ensures that they come back quickly and safely.</para><para>I think enough has been said today to convince most of the doubters who were concerned about the Labor Party's position that we are in fact correct and that we stand for the national interest. What the government has done today is deliberate on and announce a policy which is against the national interest and against the interests of the world community. It will not resolve the issues that members of the government argue it will resolve. It will not assist the war against terrorism. If anything, it might assist in ensuring that terrorism is expanded. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>12563</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Dr David, MP</name><name role="display">Dr KEMP</name><name.id>BT4</name.id><electorate>Goldstein</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government's decision to be part of the coalition for enforcing the United Nations resolutions on the disarmament of Iraq is one that I am proud to support. It is a decision which is fully in accordance with international law and upholds the United Nations, which has called on Saddam Hussein to disarm and warned him repeatedly of the consequences of not doing so. Those who care for the United Nations and believe that it needs to be effective should support this decision. The very basis of the peace agreement in 1991 was Iraq's undertaking to disarm and destroy its weapons of mass destruction. Its failure to do so over 12 years has been damaging to the credibility of the United Nations, which has now passed many resolutions which have been ignored by Iraq. Laws not enforced are treated with contempt. Most recently, in resolution 1441, the Security Council unanimously called on Iraq to disarm or face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations of its obligations. Manifestly, these violations have continued. It was never contemplated that the United Nations inspectors would need to engage in a hunt for the weapons of mass destruction. Iraq's obligation was to produce and destroy them. It plainly has not done so.</para></talk.start><para>The first obligation of this government is to protect the Australian people and secure their safety. This is what this decision is about. On 11 September 2001, the world realised for the first time that international terrorism has both the will and the capacity to cause the death of thousands of people at a single blow. A new evil entered the worldâan evil opposed to the values of human dignity and respect for each individual person that are the foundations of our Western democratic institutions; an evil determined to assault our civilisation at its heart. In Bali, this evil force moved closer to home. In this context, the existence of rogue states developing horrific weapons of mass destruction assumed a new, even more threatening dimension, raising the prospect that such weapons might fall into the hands of terrorists or be given to terrorists as part of some satanic pact to destroy whole populations of innocent people. A terrorist armed with a weapon of mass destruction could create a day of horror in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth or another Australian city such as has never been seen before and such as Australians have never contemplated in the past.</para><para>There are, we know, those who would argue that there is no evidence that such a thing could happenâthat the terrorists of al-Qaeda and the rogue state of Saddam Hussein's Iraq are completely separate and distinct and have no connection, and therefore the present action is not connected with the war on terrorism. This flies in the face of all that Iraq is known to have done.

Government-owned Iraqi television showed an Iraqi tribal chieftain reciting a poem he had written in celebration of the events of 11 September.</para></quote><para>To wait until a rogue state and international terrorism seal a partnership in a death pact is to put the Australian people at unacceptable and intolerable risk. It is time now to enforce the 1991 peace agreement and the resolutions of the United Nations up to and including resolution 1441. In addition to the United States, Great Britain and Australia, who have pre-positioned forces in an attempt to force a peaceful disarmament, many nations of the Middle East and Europe have provided bases and supportâsometimes at considerable risk to themselves. The humanitarian and moral justification of the actions of the international coalition are very clear. This morning's <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> reported the remarks of a young man who went to Baghdad as a human shield. He has now left Iraq, as many others in a similar situation have done, reporting that the Iraqi officials were `continually trying to manipulate where we could be'. On the way out of Iraq, he said, `I asked the driver what he really thought about a war. He said he didn't want war, but they wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein and it was an opportunity for that to happen. In retrospect, I think we were being naive. We went into a country that was being run by a dictator.'</para><para>The actions that the allies are taking are not directed at Islam; many Islamic states are working with the United States, Britain and Australia to see the United Nations resolutions enforced. Nor is this action against the Iraqi people. Saddam Hussein's tyranny has been maintained against the Iraqi people by terror. Journalists are forced to interview Iraqi citizens with agents of Saddam present. Over a million people have died as a result of the actions of Saddam. He has used weapons of mass destruction against his own people. He has destroyed the environment of the Marsh Arabs. Many refugees from the regime have come to Australia, and many of them cannot understand the arguments of those Australians who oppose any action being taken. The action that is now being contemplated holds out the prospect that the war Saddam wages against the Iraqi people will come to an end. All this must be weighed in the balance. The worst thing for the Iraqi people would be to continue to suffer one of the worst tyrannies this world has seen.</para><para>It is important that everything possible is done to avoid civilian casualties. Our troops are men and women of courage and humanity, many with families and children of their own. Australians can take comfort from the fact that, if our land, sea and air forces are called into combat, it will be under very strict rules of engagement and targeting rules that require the tightest possible focus on military targets alone.</para><para>The Labor Party is divided. Its weak leader wants nothing done. The Labor leader has capitulated to the extreme left of the party. The Labor Party has offered no practical solution to the threats that an alliance of a rogue state and international terrorism would bring. Its claim that, after 12 years, there is still a hope of a peaceful solution is incredible. Its belief that the Iraqi people do not even now deserve our support is unconscionable. The states now marshalling to implement the resolutions of the United Nations are all great democracies. They are led by governments seized of their responsibilities to keep their own peoples safe from terrorism. I am proud that at this time we have a quality of leadership in these countries to take the very difficult decisions that will protect millions of innocent citizens from ever having to experience the traumas that the evil of international terrorism may wish to visit upon them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>12564</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbons, Steve, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GIBBONS</name><name.id>83X</name.id><electorate>Bendigo</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support the amendment moved by my colleague the Leader of the Opposition. In doing so, I want to place on the public record my and my party's total opposition to today's decision by the Prime Minister to commit our Defence Force personnel already in the Middle East region to the invasion of Iraq. Labor opposes Australia's involvement in this war because it is not in our national interest and because it does not have UN support. Labor's position has not changed in almost 12 months. We oppose the government's decision because it is wrong and because the UN has failed to sanction this attack. We on this side of the House are part of another massive and worldwide coalition of the willing; that is, a coalition that is willing to stand up to President Bush and Prime Ministers Blair and Howard and say, `We don't accept your reasons for going to war with Iraq.'</para></talk.start><para>In recent debates in this place there has been a lot said regarding the future of the alliance between the United States and Australia. Labor is committed to the alliance. We see it as a partnership between the people of both nations, who have common interests and common goals. It is an equal partnershipâa partnership that should not be dominated by one nation over the other. As with any successful partnership, disagreement on certain issues need not and should not adversely affect that partnership. We are America's equal partners in the alliance. Labor's disagreement is with the current United States President and his regime, not with the American people. This Prime Minister has signed this nation up to President Bush's coalition of the willing but he was not included at yesterday's meeting in the Azores. That meeting determined the commitment to war, and now he has received his latest instructions from the President of the United States, committing Australia to a war we should not have.</para><para>If anyone had any doubts that our Prime Minister is subservient to President Bush, the events of these past few days should dispel them forever. This morning, a television report from inside the US military command centre in Qatar showed the map of the world that was to have been used as a backdrop for media briefings. This map did not include Australia. We have 2,000 personnel located in the region, we are one of only two countries besides the United States to deploy troops, and the people in the American command centre cannot even produce an accurate map of the world that includes Australia. Is it any wonder that most Australians oppose any involvement in this war? I understand that the map will be replaced with one that does include Australia before the backdrop is used for any media briefings.</para><para>There is no doubt that after the horrendous and tragic events in Bali on 12 October an ever-increasing number of Australians now demand that our defence forces concentrate their efforts on the war against terrorism at home and in our own region. The Prime Minister has acknowledged that North Korea represents a greater threat to Australia's security and now he would have us believe that the most appropriate way to deal with North Korea is to help America flatten Baghdad. I cannot see the logic in this, and nor can most Australians.</para><para>No-one would disagree that the Middle East would be a far better and safer region if Saddam Hussein were not the head of the government of Iraq. Hussein is a brutally oppressive military dictator who stays in control through military power and instilling fear. Nobody doubts that if the Iraqis had free elections he would be finished. However, neither the Howard government nor the Bush administration has produced any evidence that convinces the world that Saddam Hussein is a threat to world peace. Nor have they produced any evidence to date linking his regime with al-Qaeda. There is evidence that he was once in possession of weapons of mass destruction. We know that because a former United States administration provided him with those weapons.</para><para>John Howard has left the majority of Australians for dead in his obsession to go all the way with the USA. In fact, John Howard is just a hitchhiker on the US road to war. He has hitchhiked his way to the very front of the pack on George Bush's highway to war. The Howard and Bush governments would have us believe that this strike against Iraq will assist in the campaign against global terrorism. It will not. Indeed, this attack on Iraq must only increase the likelihood of further terrorist acts. It will inflame hatreds that have existed for many years. The US military have tried to assure their people that the strike against Iraq will be all over in a few short weeks. The casualties will be many and the ramifications of such a strike are likely to be with us for decades. With the gigantic firepower that they have, they are likely to win the war, but winning the peace will be something else. Hundreds of millions of Muslims around the world already see any attack on Iraq as an attack on Islam itself.</para><para>Labor's opposition to today's decision to deploy troops is directed squarely at those responsible for itâthis Prime Minister and this governmentâand not at the Defence Force personnel involved. They are simply doing their job as directed by the government of the day. Whilst Australian troops are deployed in the Middle East, Labor will ensure that their every need and the needs of their families are fully provided for. Under the Liberal-National coalition government, Australia finds itself one of only two nations that have volunteered troops to George Bush's so-called coalition of the willing. Today John Howard has positioned Australia at the very front rank of George Bush's self-appointed global enforcers. Amazingly, we now have also the absurdity of Treasurer Costello blaming France for the defeat of the US's efforts to coerce the Security Council into legitimising its war on Iraq. Mr Costello says that he will not have France deciding Australia's foreign policy. But he will have the United States doing so. He is trying to use a little Francophobia to justify an excess of Yankeephilia.</para><para>Recent documentaries screened on the ABC and SBS have thrown the spotlight on the belligerent zealots behind the scenes who exercise immense power over President Bush. Both programs referred to them as neoconservatives or `neocons'. It became evident that, shortly after the horrendous attack on the World Trade Center towers on 11 September, there were those in the Bush administration who argued for an immediate and all-out attack on Iraq. The principal advocate in this group was the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz. He apparently argued that the real source of all the trouble and terrorism was probably Saddam Hussein. It appears that the terrorist attacks of 11 September just created an opportunity to strike.</para><para>The ABC reporter went on to state that, 18 months later, American forces are poised in Kuwait to pour northward over the border into Iraq. Their invasion of Iraq will signal victory for a tiny, unelected network of veteran Washington operators who for 12 long years have had Saddam Hussein at the top of their agenda and who, according to the report, for three decades have been calling for the untrammelled use of American military power in the service of American ideals. If these reports are accurate, they provide even more evidence to suggest that George Bush's motivation for war with Iraq is based on belligerence and paranoia rather than any solid evidence that Iraq has clear links with al-Qaeda or represents a threat to the US or its allies. In reality, the root of the US war on Iraq is the superpower cockiness of the US, which has mushroomed under George W. Bushâits unilateral delusion that it has the right to reshape the world to suit its own interests and its monstrous doctrine that it has the right of pre-emptive attack on any country that it considers challenges its global dominance. Former US President Jimmy Carter said this of US policies in the latest <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Age</inline>:</para><quote><para>Increasingly unilateral and domineering policies have brought international trust in our country to its lowest level in living memory.</para></quote><para>I would now like to quote from an email I have receivedâone of many hundreds, no doubt, that all honourable members would have received in relation to this particular issue.

It is time to end the real threat presented by Saddam Hussein's willingness to use chemical and biological weapons. We know he has these weapons. The opposition know he has these weapons and have repeatedly said so. He has these weapons and he has shown a propensity to use them. Having used them once, he will use them again. This is the man, as the Deputy Prime Minister pointed out, who was pleased at the twin towers event. Clearly, if this is the sort of man Saddam is then we can expect him to use those weapons againâmaybe not in New York; perhaps in Sydney, Jakarta or somewhere else.</para></talk.start><para>It is not only because of what we have to fear from Saddam Hussein that we argue for his removal. If we do not act now, as the opposition would have us do, we would be sending a message to all other dictators who hold their countries together by fear and threats that they are free to build up these weapons of mass destruction. And if they do, what would be the consequences? There would be a proliferation of these weaponsâthese weapons of mass destruction and biological and chemical weapons that the opposition admit Saddam Hussein has. If these weapons are allowed in Iraq, what credibility would we have in saying to any other dictator, `You cannot build up these weapons'? We would have none. We would increase proliferation.</para><para>When there are more weapons, what is to stop the terrorists getting hold of themâterrorists who have shown what they can do? Indeed, we have evidence of their seeking to get weapons of mass destruction. The more countries that have these weapons, the more likely it is that terrorists will get them. They can get them either by using their own sympathisers within the country that has these weapons to acquire them or by purchasing them. It is a matter of fact that dictatorships that use, create and store these weapons are in need of cash. They have not hesitated to use them in the past and they will not hesitate to use them in the future.</para><para>If the world does nothing now, we will send the signal to other nations that they are free to build up these weapons. We can no longer wait for the UN to pass a further resolution. Indeed, we do not need that further resolution. Resolutions 678, 687 and 1441 make it entirely clearâas was indicated today in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> by the leading jurists in the world on this issueâthat it is a legal act. So the opposition's argument that this is an illegal act simply does not hold water. The opposition will find people to say it is illegal, but the weight of international law and argument is against them. Former Labor foreign minister, Gareth Evans, said in the other place in March 1998:</para><quote><para>The UN can be paralysed by its own rules and procedures, especially the veto exercisable by permanent Security Council members.</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Snowdon</name></talker><para>âHe said it in here.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CU4</name.id><name role="metadata">Gallus, Christine, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GALLUS</name></talker><para>âThe member at the table has indicated that it was in fact said in this chamber in 1998, not in the other place. Indeed, it was said hereâbut how the opposition move away from their previous words. Who do the opposition support in this? In taking the actions that they have and in saying the things that they have said, the opposition are supporting the veto of FranceâFrance, the country that has enormous economic interests in Iraq and an extremely high interest in keeping Saddam Hussein in power. With the personal relationship it has with Hussein it has managed to establish economic ties. If the opposition have any doubt about those economic ties, they might look at the position of Renault, Peugeot, Alcatel and TotalFinaElf, which all have massive economic interests supported by Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Should Hussein fall, who will stand up for the French in Iraq? Not those millions of people who have suffered under Saddam.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Remember, we not just talking about somebody who has collected weapons of mass destruction; we are talking about a dictator who has killed over a million of his own people. I have heardâless often nowâthe opposition say, `We cannot do this because, in taking this action against Hussein, we are acting against the people in Iraq.' How can we be acting against the people in Iraq when what we are doing is seeking to remove the `Butcher of Baghdad'âa man who has killed over a million of his own people; a man who has gassed innocent women and children. In the paper today there is an article describing what it was like in those Kurdish villages. The report said that there was no explosion; there was just this cloud of gas coming in and suddenly animals staggered and died and then women and children fell to their knees and died. Anybody who read that could not help but be moved and say, `This is not against the Iraqi people. Whatever action is taken against Hussein is for the liberation of the Iraqi people.'</para><para>Mr Crean said today that it was a sad day for Australia. I think it is a sad day for the opposition. The opposition has ignored traditional alliances; it has, as I said, supported the stand of a country like France; and it has abnegated its own statements made in 1998 about the necessity of disarming Saddam Hussein, about the necessity of taking action and about the difficulty sometimes of taking action under UN resolutions. It has, therefore, abnegated everything that it stood for before.</para><para>More than that, what it has done in taking this stand is that it has impacted on our 2,000 men and women in the gulf, Australia's defence forces. This is something that has never been done before at the beginning of a conflict. Australians' lives are at risk in the gulf. They are representing Australia and they know they do not have the support of the opposition in the action they are taking. Yes, Mr Crean has said, `This is nothing against the men and women in the gulf. We support them.' But how can you support them if you say to them, `You are there illegally. You are there wrongly'? How does that make their job any easier? It makes it almost impossible.</para><para>In conclusion, I want to quote Mofak Sorani, the Chair of the Australian Kurdish Community Association, who asked last Thursday:</para><quote><para>Well, if I don't support the war, what's the alternative but to change the Iraqi regime and bring peace to the country?</para></quote><para>I ask the opposition: if we do not support this military action in Iraq, what is the alternative?

It is a sad day when this country faces a situation such as thisâwhere we have seen a commitment made to war on the basis of a phone call from the US President. It is a sad day because it says something about the way this Prime Minister operates and it is a sad day with respect to the consideration that we have for international institutions. For those reasons, I condemn the decision made by the government.</para></talk.start><para>But when we look at what we are facing today there are a number of points to be made in the brief time that is available to us. I will pick up on some of the issues raised by the previous speaker, the member for Hindmarsh. On the point about Labor's attitude to the defence forces, the opposition leader and countless members of the opposition repeatedly and continually have said very clearly that they support the actions of our troops. We support our troops because we trust them. We believe they have a very important job and they do that job well. A very important part of the job of the defence forces is to follow orders, and they have been given a series of orders which they are going to carry out. We support them in what they do.</para><para>I pick up on the words of the RSL National President. I quote from a news story featuring him: `RSL National President Major-General Peter Phillips said veterans would have preferred Australian involvement in war to have United Nations backing.' On from that, he said, `There is a lot of concern around. What I'm hearing is for goodness sake tell the Australian people to get behind the troops.' I agree. The Australian people should get behind the troops. We should not see a situation like that which occurred to a degree in Vietnam around the actions of our troops. Our complaint is not with the actions of the troops; our complaint is with the actions of this Prime Minister and this government. Our complaint is about what this government is doing and what this government has done with respect to the circumstances we face nowâour country going to war in a very foreign place, where we are acting at the behest of the US President.</para><para>With respect to the situation we are now facing because of the actions of this administrationâand I have said this before in this placeâI am a very strong supporter of the US alliance. I believe that over the years that alliance has delivered real defence and other benefits to our country and to the Australian community. I believe that that alliance is a very important basis for us moving forward as a country into this century. However, that does not mean that for one minute I agree with every decision taken by every US administration as we go down the years.</para><para>I think we have to also recognise that, when we talk about US administrations, there is a very great difference between various administrations, and we ought to be conscious of that when we look at this. I am reminded of a quote from Clarence Darrow, the American lawyer, who once said:</para><quote><para>When I was boy I was told that anyone could become President. I'm beginning to believe it.</para></quote><para>I am beginning to believe it, too, when we look at this administration and how it has behaved. I think it is clear from so much of what has been said in the United States by the Democrats and others that we would not be facing this situation today if there were a different President. I think that is all the more reason for us to consider very seriously what we do in these circumstances.</para><para>The facts of the matter are that, although the final phone call came today, this is a decision which was effectively taken quite some time ago. We have been dealingâand I have referred to this before in this Houseâwith a `nudge-nudge, wink-wink' situation where there was a clear understanding about what our country would do in response to the circumstances we face today. The fact that the call came through this morning to finalise that was only a symbolic ending of a process in which it was very clear what this Prime Minister had done in terms of committing Australian forces. That is why we had a predeployment; that is why we have a situation where the circumstances today do not require any major adjustment to what we have doneâbecause we have effectively already done it.</para><para>On the question of where we go from here and why we are in this situation, there has been much said across the chamber about the fact that Saddam Hussein and his regime are despicable. I agree wholeheartedly. He is a disgusting dictator. He is the `Butcher of Baghdad'. He is someone who should not be in charge of a nation. But I also make the point that he is not alone in international affairs as being someone of that ilk. The fact is that a number of nations in this world are led by people who are despicable and whose record on human rights and other issues is appalling. But we are taking action today on this issueâabout this man at this time. The question we then have to ask is: why now?</para><para>So much of what has been said about why Saddam Hussein should not be there and about what is wrong with the Iraqi regime is in fact absolutely true. But the issue that has not been addressed properly is: why now? Why did the President of the United States issue an ultimatum today? Why was there not more time allowed for weapons inspectors? The argument goes: `For 12 years we have seen Saddam Hussein and his regime defy the international community.' We have heard much talk about the 17-plus resolutions that have been moved over the years with respect to these issues and that we have in fact had this 12-year period of absolute defiance. </para><para>My point is: what would really happen in the next six weeks or two or three months that would lead to an increase in the clear and present danger that allegedly would be faced by the wider community internationally as a result of allowing the weapons inspectors to go that much further down the track? The fact of the matter is that there is time for that to occur and it will not cause a great increase in the level of danger. The alternative to that is what we are facing now: a war where the only question mark is over how many are going to die. I agree with the comments that we have to do something about Saddam Hussein, but there is still time to follow a process that allows the United Nations and the weapons inspectors to do their job. If that should fail in a month or two, we could still be here to face the unpalatable alternative that is before us. But that is not what has happened.</para><para>If you go through the comments made in particular by President Bush and to an extent by Prime Minister Blair, you will see that this endgame was determined quite some time ago. It is an endgame that has led us inexorably to today and to the circumstances that face us on this occasion. The result is that an awful lot of people are almost certainly going to die. Since we now face a situation where there is no real alternative, I hope that it is a quick war and that the casualties are limited to the greatest extent possible. War will happen, and we will have to deal with its aftermath. </para><para>The fact that we are there as part of this coalition of the willing of three countries, that we are part of that very small grouping, has very important implications for Australia's future. Anyone who argues that this does not make us a greater target for terrorism internationally is in fantasyland. The fact is that it most clearly does. The question is: what gain will result to us because of that? I cannot see any. Frankly, I have not heard anyone today raise arguments which suggest for one minute that we would actually see some sort of gain for us as a country.</para><para>There are processes that can still be gone through, but this government has sought to defy them. When I listen to ministers and members on the other side talk about how horrific Saddam Hussein has been for so many years, I ask myself two questions. If this regime is so horribleâand I believe it isâand if it is recognised by this government that that is the case, why have so many Iraqi refugees who have come to Australia to escape this despicable regime been rejected? Why have so many people been in the situation whereâand we know it is bad nowâwhen they were desperately trying to escape that regime, they were not allowed to come to Australia? Let us be very clear about this: we would not be going into Iraq if the Americans and the British were not. If we as a country had been appalled by Saddam Hussein and if we had not been confident that UN processes had been working through these issues, why didn't we take action earlier? The answer is that we are only taking action because the US President has demanded it, and we have acquiesced. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>12570</page.no><name role="metadata">Kelly, Jackie, MP</name><name role="display">Miss JACKIE KELLY</name><name.id>GK6</name.id><electorate>Lindsay</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âTo be for peace is an easy decision to make. You do not have to do anything. You just say: `Status quo: we won't do anything.' Simon Crean has taken that stance. He states it on the grounds that only with a UN resolution shall we move forward. He has put his entire faith in the United Nations as the ultimate policeman for the world. On the other hand, we have Prime Minister John Howard. He is not in politics to retire to a $1.2 million mansion in Woollahra. He is not in politics to make easy, poll-driven decisions. He led tax reform with the GST; he led waterfront reform; and he took major rein of government spending at the time of the Lindsay by-election when, believe me, that was not popular to do at all. He has not always done the popular thing, and yet Simon Crean would call him poll-driven and now he says that he is not poll-driven. </para></talk.start><para>At the end of the day John Howard is a public servant. He aspires to serve the public in the best way that he knows how, and he has done a great job to date. He took on the situation in East Timor with great diplomacy and diligence, and yet with a clear regard to the human rights of those in East Timor. Again, in Afghanistan, he stepped up to the plate to make sure that Australia carried its fair share of the work required to restore peace to that region. </para><para>To say war is a horrible thing is to state the obvious. If you went out and took a poll today, I bet that pretty much everyone would say, `No, we do not like war.' No-one is going to sit there and say they like war. It shows the courage of this Prime Minister that he is prepared to weigh in when the situation calls for Australia to do its fair share as a world policeman.</para><para>Let us have a look at the United Nations as the world policeman. The United Nations had Iraq as the chair of the UN Conference on Disarmament and Libya as the chair of the UN human rights commission. I recently was in the UN in New York for the conference on the status of women. I was absolutely horrified that this organisation, which is supposed to be the international leader in public policy debate, still allows smoking throughout the building. I absolutely reeked of smoke. The No. 1 public health hazard in any developed country is smoking. The cost to our health system is tremendous. Yet the majority of those who vote at the UN have got so many other health issues to deal with they are not even close to dealing with smoking as a public policy. They voted to allow full rein for smoking throughout the UN building.</para><para>That tells you where the development of the UN is at. We were discussing our $50 million investment in curbing domestic violence in Australia, and more than 50 per cent of the remaining 192 members were dealing with things like female circumcision and honour crimesâwhere if you do not want to marry the man of your father's choice your father will kill you or, if he does not, your brother will kill you. They are dealing with culturally endemic and condoned violence against females, they are dealing with the AIDS epidemic and they are dealing with widows who are disallowed from owning property. That is the content of the issues at the United Nations. For the Leader of the Opposition to say, `Only if the United Nations passes a resolution will we commit Australian troops,' is to deny Australia's right to self-determination and respect for our way of life. It may seem excessive, over the top, greedy and avaricious to those in the Third World who are living on $US2 a day, but it actually recognises that we have a standard and that we can be role models for where the rest of the world can be.</para><para>We are looking at France and Germany who, for domestic agendas, will oppose any resolution. There is no point in putting any further resolution because France and Germany will oppose it. There is no point going further with the UN process because, so long as Schroeder and Chirac are the leaders of those two nations, there is going to be opposition. They have clearly indicated that, so it is not going to go away. Yet, if you look at those countries that do support action in Iraq, you are looking at not only Australia and Britain but also Canada, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Poland, Denmark, the Czech Republic and Hungary, just to name a few. Where is it written that the United Nations, an organisation that allows smoking in its environs, is so far up on public policy that it has the maturity in this day and age to be a world policeman? We are not there yet. We are just not anywhere near that. Sure, the United Nations is a good process to go through, but it still has a long way to go before it has the maturity to be dealing with the issues that confront Western democracies, the values we hold dear and the human rights we take for granted.</para><para>Therefore, the Leader of the Opposition's solution of `do nothing until the UN gives us some sort of sanction to do it' is an option to do nothing. So we should ignore September 11. The United States ignored the truck in the basement of the World Trade Centre, the attacks on US embassies in East Africa and on the USS <inline font-style="italic">Cole</inline>, and the threat grew and grew. We saw 3,000 lives lost on September 11. There were 90 Australians in that number. We have seen similar denials of actions that looked escalatory throughout history. History is replete with examples of nations doing nothing. The most recent is still very vivid for me: the situation in Kosovo, where CNN was beaming, live, human rights violations the equivalent of genocide. I really thought, from my history lessons, that we had been through that in World War II and that it would never happen againâcertainly not in my lifetime. From way over here in Australia you were looking at genocide in our lifetime in the other half of the world, and you were saying, `Why isn't anyone doing something? Why isn't someone over there? Who is going to stop this?' Did the UN stop it? No; it was left to America, leading NATO forces, to go in, eventually seeing the end of Slobodan Milosevic's regime.</para><para>You cannot stand by. It is a difficult decision, but you cannot stand by. You cannot see Australian soldiers, sailors, airmen and airwomen being committed to action where there is a likelihood of casualties, and think that those decisions are not taken deeply. I have spent 6Â½ years in the military. I still have some very dear friends and close contacts in the military. I know that they seek the total support of those at home. I know that those friends of mine were appalled at the Leader of the Opposition's description and speech to troops that were leaving to join the interdictory forces in the gulf. It was an appalling speech by anybody's standards. Certainly, if members had not feared court-martial, I know a number of them would have turned their backs on the Leader of the Opposition for espousing the types of views he did and showing a total lack of support for Australia's actions.</para><para>People do not serve in the military for their own aggrandisement; they serve for the nation. The last thing they need to hear is that the nation does not agree with them. I think the Leader of the Opposition can certainly lift his gameâdo not go addressing any more troops that are leaving, because I pretty much know the reaction you would get. I feel that General Cosgrove should look leniently on any defence personnel who turn their backs on the Leader of the Opposition in the future. I think no disciplinary action should be taken in those circumstances, because his absolute disregard for the feelings of those in our defence forces was appalling. He is a terrible military leader. Thank goodness he is in opposition and not in government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>12572</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will disregard that fatuous contribution from the non-smoking parliamentary secretary. Despite the legal advice the Prime Minister uses to support his position, scores of international lawyers in Australia and Britain, as well as the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, say an attack on Iraq without specific UN endorsement is illegitimate under international law.</para></talk.start><para>Today I spoke with one of this country's pre-eminent legal experts, Professor George Williams. Professor Williams, among many legal experts around this country and the world, absolutely rejects the argument that this war is legally justified. As he points out, the United Nations Charter sets up a prohibition on the use of force in the absence of a specific Security Council resolution. A specific authorisation is needed in each and every case. He says the intention of the earlier UN resolutions from 12 years ago were only ever intended to apply at that time. More to the point, the cease-fire resolution 687 contains only one paragraph that authorises the ongoing use of force and does so only in relation to guaranteeing the Kuwaiti border. Further, this guarantee can only be upheld by the UN Security Council and not by individual states. Nor does resolution 1441 give any legal justification, despite the pathetic attempts by a panel of international lawyers in today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>. That group says:</para><quote><para>... even if Resolution 1441 were not read to authorise military actionâ</para></quote><para>and it does notâ</para><quote><para>... the use of force against Hussein's regime at this time would be legally justified on the basis of the United Nations Charter and the right of individual and collective self-defence, realistically interpreted.</para></quote><para>As Professor Williams has so correctly pointed out, nowhere does the United Nations Charter cover pre-emptive invasion of a country in the absence of a specific authorisation by the UN Security Council. There was no basis for unilateral action in 1991, and there is no basis now. Our international obligation now, it seems, is to wait around for the President of the United States to give us the order to break international law and to compound, rather than lessen, the threat of international terrorism. The meagre coalition of the willing could not even get a so-called `moral majority' from the 15-member Security Council, irrespective of any French vote. Despite the threats and bribes of the past two weeks, the US could not get an immoral majority together.</para><para>There is no mandate, George, but what would you know or care of a mandate with the kind of vote your brother Jeb rigged for you in Florida? Is this the kind of democracy George W. wants to impose on the Middle East? His electoral legitimacy is almost as laughable as Saddam's 98 per cent support. Today we saw on television our Prime Minister walk down the corridor from his office to the lectern, mimicking US presidential style, to announce his fateful decision to risk our defence forces in this pre-emptive strike that would rain a hailstorm of missiles on Iraq and its people in the next week or so in order to remove one tyrant and his cohorts.</para><para>There is serious division in the ranks of our armed forces and our security officials. Indeed, one officer has written to me saying how important it is that I have tried to force a vote on this issueâthat until today's strong statement from the Leader of the Opposition, the position of both sides had been hypocritical. This man says: `If we speak out we are lost. Instead, you speak for us.' `Us'âthere are many more than one in our services and security forces who think like the courageous Andrew Wilkie.</para><para>The PM said, `Final diplomatic attempts to secure the 18th resolution against Iraq have come to an end.' No, they have notâand they had not. The diplomatic way was taken by France, Russia and those other members of the Security Council who refused to sign up. Canada is the latest major nation to reject this pre-emptive strike. What had come to an end was the patience of George W. Bush, the man who reportedly cannot tell the difference between Shiite and Sunni Muslims, let alone the sects within. God help the processes this man will try to impose on the Middle Eastâprocesses the American President will colour with the prejudices he brings from his own fundamentalist Christian value system. By illegally trying to impose this Western set of values on the Middle East through regime change we are getting this country involved in a tragedy that will continue well beyond Saddam Hussein.</para><para>The UN Security Council's inner five has no Islamic representation. That two of those countries, France and Russia, chose to veto the Bush plan is to their credit. That Bush, the UK and Australia have decided to spurn the UN marks us as the three extreme Western nations prepared to do whatever it takes to implant a Western model on a Middle Eastern country. It will fuel the cause of terrorism, particularly in our neighbouring region, which this Prime Minister is only too happy to fly over on his way to Britain or the US.</para><para>General Michael Rose, military commander of UN forces in Kosovo, said last night that the strategy is confused: we are embarking on a war against weapons of mass destruction that will only encourage their use. North Korea has cranked up its nuclear capability in the face of an expected US attempt at regime change after Iraq. Iran has nuclear capability and is reportedly cranking up its weapons program too.</para><para>General Rose says Iraq is a lower order world issue. Solving the Middle Eastern Palestinian crisis is a first order issue and the US cannot be the honest broker in that conflict. It will take an independent process involving smaller nations like Norway, which brokered the Sri Lankan peace. It could have included Australia, but we have now blown any credit in the Muslim world. General Rose believes the Indo-Pakistani confrontation is the second most critical issueâand let us remember that the nuclear-armed Pakistani military regime is an ally in this war on terror yet has been a sponsor of North Korea's nuclear program.</para><para>Last week I spent well over an hour talking with a Kurdish man who fled Iraq having served in the Iraqi army during the first Gulf War. Many Kurds will be sent to the front line in this war too. Despite being obliged to fight, despite living in fear of the Republican Guard and despite witnessing the attacks by Saddam Hussein on his own people, this Kurdish refugee says that this war is wrong, whatever the need to rid the world of Saddam Hussein. He sees a wider US agenda that involves the need to abandon ties with a discredited Saudi regime, the need to secure oil stocks for the American petrol addiction, the need to secure Israeli interests as opposed to Palestinian interests and the wider plan of reconfiguring the political face of the Middle East by naively imposing a US style democracy. He has no confidence that the rights of the Kurds will be addressed in the face of stronger interests such as Turkey.</para><para>Looking at the specific points in the Prime Minister's motion, while anyone would condemn Saddam Hussein's refusal to abide by UN resolutions, he was, and is now, embarking on a significant reduction in his weapons capacity. Nowhere in this motion is there any mention of the Hans Blix inspection program, which was achieving results and which the UN wanted continued. Not only are we supporting this pre-emptive strike but also this act of illegal war pre-empts the very UN inspection process that until yesterday was well under way. What was Bush afraid ofâanother, more positive report?</para><para>Point 3 of the motion `abhors Iraq's continued support for international terrorism'âsomething that is not proved. Certainly no links have been established to al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. I vehemently oppose any endorsement of the government's decision to, as point 5 details, deploy ADF personnel to this war, and I support the opposition amendment and the call for the immediate return of our armed forces from this illegal action. In extending `support and sympathy to the innocent people of Iraq' in point 7, this Prime Minister exposes his greatest hypocrisy. Where was the sympathy and support for the Iraqi asylum seekers who fled Saddam's regime and tried to reach our shores in leaky, sinking and in some cases sabotaged boats? They were the so-called illegals, remember? Now the government are truly the illegals.</para><para>I cannot, and will not, support this motion and I demand that it not be allowed to peter out without a vote when the last speaker has finished. That vote should have been taken before any cabinet decision. This government has been too gutless to allow it. At least Tony Blair and George W. Bush have taken decisions in the full knowledge of the sentiments of their houses of representatives. But not this governmentânot this Prime Minister, who has been prepared to share his plans with the US President but not to allow the Australian public, through its representatives, to have a vote on this most crucial of issues: the first time we as a nation have defied international conventions and laws and declared war in the absence of a clear act of aggression. I reject the motion but commend the amendment to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>12574</page.no><name role="metadata">Truss, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TRUSS</name><name.id>GT4</name.id><electorate>Wide Bay</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere can be no more difficult decision for a government or a parliament to make than the decision to participate in war. There is nothing glamorous about war. In the 21st century we are assured that the images of war are brought into our living rooms in a way that we have never experienced before. War has become very personal, even though we are thousands of kilometres from the front line. War destroys not just enemies, cities and countries but also lives, families and the hopes, ambitions and plans of a generation. Australians are a peace-loving people but we cannot tolerate injustice or oppression. We will not stand by and allow oppression and regimes of horror to go unchecked around the world.</para></talk.start><para>Twelve years ago Saddam Hussein, the imperialist aggressor, invaded Kuwait. He ignored the diplomatic initiatives; he scorned the olive branch offered by the world community. He ignored the 12 mandatory United Nations resolutions. He ignored all the warnings and the threats. The world responded and drove Saddam out of Kuwait, but it stopped short and instead pursued a peace deal with him. Twelve years on, nothing has changed. He continues to ignore the diplomatic initiatives, the olive branches, now 18 United Nations resolutions, all the warnings and the threats. Saddam has remained an obstructionist in the face of global efforts to disarm him. For the last 12 years the Security Council has repeatedly called on Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass destruction and verify this destruction by cooperating with the United Nations weapons inspectors. For almost 12 years Iraq has repeatedly frustrated and obstructed this task. Saddam has failed to meet the terms of the peace agreement. He has failed to honour the commitments he made at that time.</para><para>Now the world has an unfinished task. We need to ensure that the resolutions carried such a long time ago have real effect and that peace and security can be restored to the region. The United Nations weapons inspection agency was thrown out of Iraq in 1998. Inspectors were unable to account for a significant number of items related to weapons of mass destruction. More worryingly, from 1998 to late 2002 there was no United Nations monitoring or inspection in Iraq. There is strong evidence that Iraq used this opportunity to continue its efforts to develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and their means of delivery. Saddam Hussein has had 12 years to hide from the world his weapons of mass destruction. There is simply no denying this fact. Just take the words of one Iraqi scientist intimately involved in Saddam's weapons of mass destruction program. This scientist said:</para><quote><para>The CIA had no idea how far we'd gotten with the bomb. They didn't seem to know who I was. They had no idea that our scientists were still working on bomb design and explosive lenses in new, hidden locations around Baghdad. It sounded to me as if they'd been lulled by Saddam's phony documents, or blinded by his concealment schemes ... It blew my mind.</para></quote><para>Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction poses a threat to its neighbours and to the region. We have an important stake in the stability of the Middle East, not least because much of the world's trade passes through the region. Australia also shares a regional concern in the Asia-Pacific to avoid the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Letting Iraq off the hook would not only signal to other countries that evasion of international disarmament obligations can succeed but also lead Iraq to continue its programs and develop a greater degree of belligerency towards the nations that surround it and the people of the world.</para><para>Therefore, a clear message must be sent to Saddam and other rogue states. Yet another United Nations resolution will not deliver that message. There have already been plenty; there have already been many that have been ignored. I prefer that there be no war, but clearly we have unfinished business which needs to be completed. We must finish what was started in 1991 and free the Iraqi people and the world from the danger presented by Saddam and his evil agenda. We cannot be held to ransom. I do not want blood for oil, or wheat or free trade or for anything else. I take no issue with the Iraqi people and our relationship with them. Australia has had a longstanding and very cordial relationship with Iraq. It has been a particularly important market for Australian farmers and we see that relationship as growing and expanding in the future. We want it to continue for the benefit of both Australia and the people of Iraq, but it needs to be able to be carried out in safety and security and in the knowledge that normal standards of decency and behaviour can be assured.</para><para>At the end of the day Saddam must be called to account and the Iraqi people must be saved from the humanitarian disaster being inflicted upon them by this tyrant. It is now in Saddam's hands to save his country from warâeven at this late hour he should heed the ultimatum and deliver peace. If not, we must go back and complete the task that was begun in 1991. There was one attempt at a peace deal, there was one agreement made with Saddam. He has not honoured that agreement. He has ignored United Nations entreaties, he has ignored the will of the world and there is no prospect that his views are likely to change with yet another United Nations resolution.</para><para>As a nation, our commitment and our tenacity in times of war and our courage on the battlefield are renowned throughout the world. Our nation was built on this spirit, the spirit of the Aussie digger defending the principles of freedom and democracy and the Australian way of life. In doing so Australian service men and women have secured our peace by making sacrifices on foreign soil. It is not by any means the first time we have needed to be in Iraq. So these men and women of our armed forces are entitled to the unequivocal support of the nation. They have answered the call of their country in exactly the same way as their forefathers did in their thousands as Anzacs in World Wars I and II, in Vietnam, Korea and the earlier Gulf War. They should again carry the support of the Australian people and I know they will do us proud. Like all Australians, I pray for the safe and secure return of this Australian contingent. The task that they face is hazardous and government would not be seeking their commitment in this regard if we did not firmly believe that the cause was just and honourable. The other ways of resolving this dispute, the other more tasteful waysâthe proposals for peace, the resolutions of international bodiesâhave all failed to deliver the intended result.</para><para>Sometimes we have to fight for peace; we have to work for it and sometimes that can be very difficult. Once peace is achieved then we must build on it. We must free the world of Saddams, of the terrorists, of those who seek hatred and of those who are not prepared to guarantee an enduring peace for this generation and for the world. I wish the Australian soldiers well in this task. I pray that they will be returned soon, safe and secure to our country. They know they are acting in an honourable cause, defending the will of the people of the world to ensure that we can live in a safe and secure environment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>12576</page.no><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr QUICK</name><name.id>AV5</name.id><electorate>Franklin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>â`Are you going to say something new in this debate?' one of my colleagues asked me tonight. `Yes,' I replied.

They left to fight for King and country. They rushed to join, as it would all be over by Christmas. My father, as an 18-year-old, was in that rushâbetter to earn one and sixpence a day as a soldier than one and sixpence a week as a butcher's apprentice. He survived Gallipoli and the horror of Fromelles where, on 19 July 1916, 5,335 Australian casualties resulted from a futile attempt to breach the German trenches. He returned home at the age of 19 an invalid who, for all his life, had to fight for his due entitlements from the DVA. Service men and women from all our wars are sent off with promises of support upon their return; promises made and reiterated here in this House today. The reality is that for many of them these promises are hollow and frustrating to gain upon their return to our shores. This is an indictment on our country and our parliament.</para><para>For me, today is a day of shameâa day which has seen our Prime Minister accede to the wishes of the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and agree to wage war against Iraq. Australia is about to become the military aggressor for the first time in our 215-year history. Why? Why do we have to race to join the coalition of the willingâI call it `the coalition of the killing'âthree Anglo-Saxon nations out of the 200-plus nations in the United Nations? As Simon Crean said today, the 190-plus nations against this pre-emptive, unilateral war against Iraq form the moral majority. Australia, the United Kingdom and the USA are the immoral minority. History will long note the integrity of those who stand against this immoral war. Why are we so impatient with Iraq, when it is close to 30 years since the UN called on Israel to quit the occupied territories and allow the Palestinians to pursue their own destiny? Thirty years! </para><para>I trust the Australian people, their mood and their thoughts on this war. I trust especially those in my electorate when it comes to this issue before us in the House this day. I have polled a huge number of my constituents on six questions involving the war against Iraq and they have responded in amazing numbers. Of the respondents, 82.8 per cent said no to Australia's involvement in a unilateral pre-emptive war against Iraq, and 91.4 per cent said that Australia would be less safe as a result of our involvement in the coalition of the killing. </para><para>I have an Iraqi helmet on my desk.

This will be a 21st century warâ3,000 bombs in the first 48-hour blitzkrieg on Iraq. Computer generated images of what will happen in the war have been flooding our TV screens over the past few weeks.

No-one relishes the prospect of war. No-one wants the issue to be resolved through conflict. Conflict should always be the last resort, for use onlywhen diplomacy fails. In the 1930s the free world shirked its responsibility to make hard decisions and the end result was a raging dictator who unleashed unforeseen pain on Europe. We cannot allow history to repeat itself at the expense of many thousands of lives. Diplomacy has failed in Iraq and the current crisis hardly comes as a surprise. Saddam Hussein and his regime have spent more than a decade pushing their deadly agenda. They have seemingly plotted almost to take the world towards this very moment.</para></talk.start><para>For decades the Iraqi leader has promoted pure evilâlike in 1988, when he exterminated about 5,000 Kurds and used weapons of mass destruction on his own people. This is a sick means of satisfying his ego in obtaining a place on the international stage at any price. Some argue that the Iraqi regime should be given just one more chance; some argue that they have already had their second chance. The reality is that they have in fact had 17 chancesâ17 UN resolutions, 17 opportunities for Iraq to disarm. They have arrogantly ignored more than 12 years of international attempts to peacefully disarm. Saddam Hussein and his regime are more than a passing sore on Western peace. They have disfigured the global face of freedom with a systematic campaign of deceit and deception; they have constantly undermined the work of the UN inspectors; they have dodged all diplomatic attempts to find a solution; and they have ducked all demands under resolution 1441.</para><para>It is never easy to accept responsibility, but there is a responsibility on this House and on the government of Australia to deal with the factsâand the facts are these. It is quite clear that the intentions of the Iraqi regime have long been openly displayed; they are there for all to see. The motives are backed by a deadly arsenal which has been amassed in terms of chemical and biological weapons, which the Iraqi government then uses to threaten its neighbours. By defying the United Nations Security Council, Iraq has worked hard to undermine global security.</para><para>If we want to get a clearer picture of just how global security has been undermined, then we should look to independent sources. One of those independent sources can be found in Dr Hans Blix, who was appointed by the United Nations, and by reading his message in terms of his assessment of the threat as he saw it in January. Dr Hans Blix came to the conclusion that Saddam Hussein and his Iraqi government had made no attempt to even understand what disarmament was required of them. We know that Iraq has at least 360 tonnes of chemical warfare agent. We know that it has the capacity to produce some 25,500 litres of anthrax spores. We know that there remain some 6,500 chemical bombs unaccounted for. This is an arsenal that is feared not only by Iraq's neighbours and some of its own people but by the whole worldâand with good reason. The regime in Iraq has shown in the past that it does not hesitate even to bomb its own people. In its time it has wiped out some 2,000 Iraqi villages. Such a regime has allegiance to no-one apart from itself. It is therefore a threat to everyone who values security and safety. The Iraq regime will only grow to be a greater global threat if it is allowed to see yet another ultimatum go unchecked and unanswered. If we do not act now, we will be forced into a conflict at a later point in time, and that time will probably be of Iraq's choosingâfor in the end it was Iraq which determined that we would reach the position we are in now.</para><para>The Iraqi regime has had the opportunity to choose disarmament on 17 occasions and it has passed up that opportunity 17 times. Today it has been given the opportunity one more time for its leader and his sons to leave the country and free Iraq from their tyranny and save the Iraqi people from imminent war. On every occasion the Iraqi government and Saddam Hussein have chosen to risk military conflict. In contrast, we in Australia have chosen to protect freedom, to guard our way of life and to ensure that Australia remains as long as possible a terrorist-free country.</para><para>It is appropriate at this time and on this day that none of us forget for a minute those who stand guard for all of us. The men and women of our Defence Force deserve our unwavering support. It is something that we will always remember, as we doâand I have found coincidentally and quite inadvertently that I am wearing the badge of the ANZACs tonight. I can guarantee that as a minister of the Crown, as a member of government and as a representative of the people of the Darling Downs I will do everything in my power to ensure that these peopleâthese brave Australian men and womenâare remembered in time to come for the acts which they are about to undertake to protect what you and I know as Australia. It is worth noting that this morning there was a letter from an Australian military officer, who wrote:</para><quote><para>The common belief that we are simply jumping blindly into bed with George Bush must be replaced with the understanding that peace is not America's gift to the world. It's God's gift to humanity.</para></quote><para>And humanity includes the people of Iraq. I have enormous sympathy for their plight and I fear for their future under Saddam Hussein. They sufferâand hundreds of thousands have diedâunder a regime that has no compassion, even for its own people. The Iraqi people deserve a better future, free from the yoke of tyranny. They deserve a leadership that has respect for its people. There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein will also be bought in terms of supplying terrorist organisations with weapons of mass destruction. How else would you explain a man who has already taken the extraordinary step of rewarding families of suicide bombers who have targeted and killed the innocent of Israel? </para><para>Finally, I support this motion with the deep and sincere belief that now is the time, in the name of world peace, to take the military action that is required to disarm Iraq. To wait any longer only increases the riskâboth the risk to world peace and the risk to those Australian service personnel, and in fact all the service personnel involved in the military operation, who will take part in what is an inevitable military conflict. The Iraqi regime has no morality, no sense of justice and no more time. Now is the moment to strike a blow for humanityâto strike it for life as we know and love it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>12578</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to oppose the primary motion and speak in favour of the amendment.

Yes, instinctively they and we are outraged at this oppressive regime that has oppressed and impoverished the Iraqi people, but to what extent in the cause of humanity do you bomb and obliterate civilians, as will inevitably occur, in a country where more than 50 per cent of the population is less than 15 years old? More than 50 per cent of Iraqis are children. To what extent do you advance a cause of humanity by bombing humanity?</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Brough</name></talker><para>âWhy is that the case?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>JK6</name.id><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name></talker><para>âWhy is that the case? Because of the birth rates and so forth and the fact that many parents were killed, if I might say so, during the last conflict. The Australian public instinctively recognises that something is happening here, and what is happening is that we are moving firmly away from the role of the United Nations Security Council. Why is that important? One only has to look at the Charter of the United Nations. That charter includes the aim:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>... to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankindâ</para></quote><para>that is, World War I and World War II. The UN has an overriding aim of ensuring that armed force will not be used, save in the common interest, and the charter of the Security Council confirms that armed force is the last recourse.</para><para>The Prime Minister has focused on legal advice, as indeed has the Attorney-General. Quite frankly, we say that the war cannot be justified for moral reasons, irrespective of questions of legality. Australians are going to be guided by what they believe is a sense of right and wrong, not on the basis of technicalities. I recognise that, but it is important in my role as shadow Attorney-General to respond to the arguments that have been advanced and to indicate that the weight of international legal opinion is firmly against the Prime Minister. I would also like to state that indicating our opinion, and certainly my opinion, that military action is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and unlawful does not meanâand it is important to distinguish thisâthat we believe the legality of the military action per se is equivalent to the legal position of the Australian personnel. It is not. It is important to be crystal clear about this: the unlawfulness of military action does not render Australian service personnel liable for a breach of international law. The opposition fully supports our service personnel. Our argument is with the government and the Prime Minister.</para><para>The Prime Minister claims that a long series of resolutions, referred to in paragraph 4 of the motion, authorises military action against Iraq. Interestingly, the government has not relied exclusively on the resolution most recently debatedâresolution 1441. That resolution, appropriately, in the strongest possible terms, calls on Iraq to disarm and is supported in that object very strongly by the opposition. But what the Prime Minister and his advice have not referred to is the context of the debate itself. As a result of that, I would suggest that the advice that has been provided to the government is fundamentally flawed. I take you directly to the text of resolution 1441. It has been referred to in some detail. Clearly, paragraph 14 states that the Security Council:</para><quote><para>Decides to remain seized of the matter.</para></quote><para>That is a crucial provision, because in the debate that occurred to have that resolution passedâand it was passed unanimouslyâthe United States and the United Kingdom gave undertakings. The United States stated:</para><quote><para>As we have said on numerous occasions to Council members, this resolution contains no âhidden triggersâ and no âautomaticityâ with respect to the use of force.</para></quote><para>The United Kingdom stated:</para><quote><para>We heard loud and clear during the negotiations the concern about âautomaticityâ and âhidden triggersââthe concern that on a decision so crucial we should not rush into military action; that on a decision so crucial any Iraqi violations should be discussed by the Council. Let me be equally clear in response, as a co-sponsor with the United States of the text we have just adopted. There is no âautomaticityâ in this resolution.</para></quote><para>That is, there is no automatic engagement in war. France welcomed that. They said that the fact that all ambiguity on this point and all elements of automaticity had disappeared from the resolution was crucial. Mexico stated:</para><quote><para>... this resolution also constitutes progress, as it eliminates the concept of automaticity in the use of force ...</para></quote><para>Ireland used similar language, and Russia stated, `As a result of intensive negotiations, the resolution just adopted contains no provisions for the automatic use of force.' Bulgaria, Syria, Colombia, Cameroon, Mauritius and China all stated the same thing: that a crucial factor in their supporting resolution 1441 was that it did not contain automatic authorisation of force. All members of the UN Security Council said, `You bring it back to us. We will decide what to do.'</para><para>It is completely disingenuous for the government to now say that, while that was taking place and these undertakings were being given by the United States and the United Kingdom, they had their fingers crossed behind their backs. They are saying, `Yes, but we never said we were going to rely on resolutions 12 years old. We were going to go back to 1991 to resolutions 678 and 687'âas the Prime Minister advocates in paragraph 4. That was not done. There was a clear undertaking to the United Nations Security Council, and I would submit that that undertaking has been breached.</para><para>Let us look at resolution 678. Obviously there is not time to go through it in great detail, but that resolution was in respect of removing the Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Clearly, force was authorised by the United Nations Security Council to expel the Iraqi forces, but the terms clearly indicated that it was for the purpose of restoring international peace and security in the area. Resolution 686 states:</para><quote><para>... that in order to secure the rapid establishment of a definitive end to the hostilities, the Security Council remains actively seized of the matter.</para></quote><para>Resolution 687 further states, in paragraph 34:</para><quote><para>Decides to remain seized of the matter and to take such further steps as may be required for the implementation of the present resolution and to secure peace and security in the area.</para></quote><para>This was clearly the United Nations Security Council saying, `It is a cease-fire that has been offered to the United Nations Security Council. We will decide further action. It is not a cease-fire offered to individual states. We will keep control of this.'</para><para>The same thing followsâinterestingly, it has not been referred to in paragraph 4 of the Prime Minister's motionâin resolution 1141. Force was used in 1998 as a result of the inspections crisis. The member states objected and opposed the arguments of the United States and the United Kingdom that they were authorised to use force because of the earlier resolutions. Clearly, the member states said, `As a matter of international law, it is the United Nations Security Council that determines when force is used.' The government has ignored these other resolutions. The government has ignored the clear and explicit undertakings offered by the United Nations Security Council in resolution 1441 and has been disingenuous in the advice that it has proposed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>12580</page.no><name role="metadata">Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr SOUTHCOTT</name><name.id>TK6</name.id><electorate>Boothby</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOver 200 years ago, Edmund Burke is supposed to have said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.</para></quote><para>This quote also appears in the frontispiece of Richard Butler's account of his work as head of UNSCOM, which is titled <inline font-style="italic">Saddam Defiant</inline>. The first sentence of that book reads:</para><quote><para>The greatest threat to life on earth is weapons of mass destructionânuclear, chemical, biological.</para></quote><para>In this debate there are some incontrovertible facts. These are things that members of the public may not hear from opposition members, but they are proven and known. Firstly, Iraq does have biological and chemical weapons and ballistic missiles; secondly, Iraq has used them against its neighbours and its own people; thirdly, Iraq accepted disarmament as a condition of the Gulf War cease-fire; fourthly, Iraq is in breach of the UN Security Council resolution; fifthly, Iraq has known links with terrorism, including the Abu Nidal group and the group which bombed the <inline font-style="italic">Achille Lauro</inline> in 1985. Iraq also financially supports the families of Palestinian suicide bombers. Lastly, these biological and chemical weapons could easily end up in the hands of terrorists. In 1998, when we were discussing the same situation, the member for Brand made that point.</para><para>With France prepared to veto any disarmament of Iraq, the choice now for the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia is to go home or to take part in the disarmament of Iraq. This episode cannot be seen in isolation. It is just the latest act in a 12-year epic. Remember the 1998 build-up and the Australian deployment of an SAS squadron, which was supported by the opposition leader and his foreign affairs and defence spokesperson. At that timeâFebruary or March 1998âKofi Annan averted military action and secured Iraq's agreement to comply with UN Security Council resolutions. Six months later, UNSCOM was kicked out of Baghdad.</para><para>The latest episode has been going on since September 2002, and the last six months have been a bit like Groundhog Day. You would have to be a real optimist to believe that Saddam Hussein is ever going to comply with a UN Security Council resolution, and you would have to be a real optimist to believe that France, Russia and China are not going to undermine any containment regime.</para><para>As far as legal authority for military action in Iraq is concerned, Professor Anthony Aust, the former Deputy Legal Adviser of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in the UK and the current Deputy Director of the British Institute of International and Comparative Law, made the point in an article on the BBC web site that, under the United Nations Charter, the use of force is allowed only at the request of another state, in self-defence, in extreme humanitarian disaster or if authorised by the UN Security Council. He pointed out that UN Security Council resolution 678 allowed authorised member states in 1991 to use all means necessary to force Iraq to leave Kuwait and to restore international peace and security in the area. UN Security Council resolution 687, which was a condition of the cease-fire which Iraq accepted, required Iraq to unconditionally accept the destruction, removal or rendering harmless of all chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles with a range of greater than 150 kilometres. UN Security Council resolution 1441 also mentioned 678 and 687 in the preamble. The British Attorney-General and the Australian Solicitor-General have provided similar advice.</para><para>We often hear that the international community is against this. That is wrong: there are over 20 countries that are supporting this through the provision of either military forces or bases. There are many Arab nations which are providing bases and there is support for the actions of the United States and other countries from Japan, Spain, Portugal and several eastern European countries.</para><para>With regard to the link to terrorism, we have often heard, `Prove to a high evidentiary standard that there is a link between Iraq and al-Qaedaâthat is your job.' The South Australian state member for Waite and the former commander of the SAS antiterrorist group, Martin Hamilton-Smith, has made these pointsâand I think they are worth repeating in this debateâthat Iraqi intelligence operatives were trained by the KGB and are masters at the art of deniable operations. You will never know to a court-of-law standard that weapons are missing, stolen et cetera. But the more they proliferate, the more likely it is terrorists will get them and use them.</para><para>This highlights the hypocrisy of France. France is one of the few nations to have committed an act of terrorism in the South Pacific. They want more evidence, yet it was the French secret service that bombed the <inline font-style="italic">Rainbow Warrior </inline>in Auckland Harbour and issued official denials that they were involved. The French were responsible for a terrorist act themselves. I want to talk a little bit more about France. Reading Richard Butler's book brought home to me that this is part of an ongoing struggle by France to frustrate the Gulf War cease-fire and UN Security Council resolution 687. In his book he says:</para><quote><para>During 1997-1998 Iraq's stance and interests were increasingly supported by Russia, France and China even though it was defying the law they had made in the Security Council and for which, as permanent members, they had a particular responsibility.</para></quote><para>He goes on to say later in the book that:</para><quote><para>France... like Russia has identified potentially great economic benefits in its relationship with Iraq.</para></quote><para>On the issue of war crimes, during the 1990-91 occupation of Kuwait the Iraqi military were issued with chemical weapons. I was pleased to see the United States President again reaffirm that any orders which are followed to release chemical or biological weapons will be prosecuted as a war crime. Let us hope that Iraq does not use these inhumane weapons and let us be encouraged that any perpetrators of war crimes will be punished. I was disgusted at the reported comments of Professor Hilary Charlesworth in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> last month. She apparently believes that:</para><quote><para>... Australians involved in any war in Iraq âincluding politiciansâcould find themselves complicit in the committing of war crimes, and so liable to prosecution in the ICC ...</para></quote><para>Since when has the committing of war crimes been consistent with Australian rules of engagement and Australian military law? Since when did the ADF commit war crimes? Similarly, 43 self-styled experts on international law and human rights wrote an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald </inline>on 26 February 2003, saying: </para><quote><para> ... there are strong arguments that attacking Iraq may involve committing both war crimes and crimes against humanity.</para></quote><para>I find it perverse that these 43 experts are talking about Australian prosecutions for taking part in the disarmament of Iraq, without focusing on the clear evil of the possession and use of biological and chemical weapons. There are some people who seem to get more excited about seeing Australians, British and Americans hauled before an international court than they do about disarming Saddam Hussein. Others seem to see a moral equivalent between free democracies like America, Britain and Australia and a totalitarian dictatorship like Iraq.</para><para>On the stance of the Labor Party, the Leader of the Opposition's approach gives priority to process over outcome. Listening to his speech, he seeks refuge in clauses, paragraphs and sections of UN Security Council resolutions to avoid making a decision. He is hiding behind the UN Security Council. The Leader of the Opposition is happy for France to veto our foreign policy, but we do not have any power to veto theirs. This has been going on for a dozen years now.</para><para>Going back to 1998, which I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, the member for Kingsford-Smith then said this:</para><quote><para>Iraq's refusal to allow UNSCOM immediate and unrestricted access constitutes ... a clear breach of the terms and conditions of the 1991 cease-fireâterms which had been explicitly accepted by Iraq. Faced with such a breach, the United States and the United Kingdom were clearly entitled to look back to the underlying resolutionâthat is, resolution 678, which authorised the use of all necessary means to liberate Kuwait and `to restore international peace and security in the area'. Resolution 678 is still in force.</para></quote><para>What has changed? This is exactly the point that Professor Aust and Michael Costello, the former chief of staff to the former Leader of the Opposition, have made. It is also the legal advice to the Australian government. You will find the same if you look at some of the comments from former chiefs of staff of Labor leaders. Richard Butler in his book <inline font-style="italic">Saddam Defiant</inline> says this of Saddam Hussein:</para><quote><para>... his stance on weapons of mass destruction and the failure of the community of nations to deal with him means that he holds a lit match, and with each passing day he brings it closer to the fuse. If we do not stop him before the fuse ignites, then the results will be truly cataclysmic. Perhaps only then, in brief moments before the end, will we realise how great was our failure.</para></quote><para>Michael Costello has argued that there is sufficient authority in UN Security Council resolution 687. He argues that Iraq will not disarm and he shows how containment has been undermined by many countries, including France, Russia and China. I say this to France, to the Labor Party and to the 43 lawyers who argue that a pre-emptive strike may be a war crime: get out of the way and let the United States, Britain and Australia disarm Iraq.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>12582</page.no><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROUGH</name><name.id>2K6</name.id><electorate>Longman</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI was not intending to speak at this time, but we are waiting for someone from the opposition to attend the chamber. I would like to address my comments to the argument not of whether or not there is legality here but of what is to occur should America, Britain and Australia pull their troops out of the Middle East. Put aside for one moment the question of whether or not those troops are going to have to be used in armed conflict. I think it is now beyond any reasonable doubt that, without those troops in the Middle East, there would have been no weapons inspectors in Iraq, no destruction of missiles and no discovery of warheads with a capacity to deliver chemical weapons. That simply would not have happened. Yet we find France pontificating to the international community that more time should be given and that pressure should continue to be delivered by America, the United Kingdom and Australia.</para></talk.start><para>So it is a case of all care and no responsibility. Yes, we agree that there should be no weapons of mass destruction; yes, this issue should be dealt withâbut the question was how to do it. Who was going to pick up the tab? Who was going to take the moral responsibility and the financial responsibility for having those troops deployed thereâtroops that are bringing pressure to bear on the Iraqi regime? If it were not for the collective stand of the US, the UK and Australia, by having troops in place, bringing that pressure to bear on Iraq, I am absolutely confident that Saddam Hussein would continue into his 13th and 14th years. And it is not just the time lag that should be of concern to people; it is what is being done in that time. One thing is for certain: Saddam has not used his time to idly sit by and not continue to try to develop weapons that can wreak destruction upon Australians, French, Germans, Indonesians, Americans or people of any other nation in the world.</para><para>The world has fundamentally changed since September 11. Whilst the world has known terrorism attacks for many years, I do not believe there has ever been a terrorist attack, such as the hijacking of aircraft, without there being a cause and effectâin other words, we hijack an aircraft and we have a demand on the other hand. The indiscriminate killing by someone who wishes to put their order upon others in the world in such a manner not only is deplorable but also, because of its very nature, cannot be contained. There is no rhyme nor reason to it, but the cause and the effect can be so much greater. Instead of a bomb being strapped to someone's chest, taking out those who are immediately around them, it could be a chemical or, worse still, a biological agent which can kill today and tomorrow and decimate tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people. This is not fanciful; these things can occur. I am absolutely positive that, given extra time, Saddam Hussein would continue to use that time and the money that he gains from so-called `oil for food programs' not for the benefit of the Iraqi people but against those people within his own country who would stand up and oppose him and against the countries that surround him and to give succour to those who would use his means to bring to bear their own goals.</para><para>These are very grave times. When I last spoke in the House on this issue, I pointed to the fact that no war is ever fought like the last, and I gave the example of World War I. Many British generals tried to use the experience from World War I when going forward. It was the Germans of course who used blitzkrieg and a whole new set of criteria. Whether it is commando type tactics or whatever happens to be employed, you can be assured that there is always a new and devastating element to warfare. I believe that is what you are seeing with terrorism. It is a war that knows no borders. It knows no boundaries, whether they be economic, social, demographic, religious or geographic. It means that, wherever terrorists want to strike, if we allow them the means, they will deliver. They have the people who have the passion to do that.</para><para>The US, the UK and we on this side of the House are saying, `Enough is enough.' Iraq has had 12 years to complyâ12 years to say, `I put my hands up. I will fully, completely and immediately disarm. I will not play games.' That is all that is being asked. Why is France so adamant that Iraq should be given another month? Of course, climatic conditions which would be of substantial assistance to defenders are just around the corner. Is it that France is in fact stalling to put off the decision so that it becomes impossible for the decision to actually be made; therefore abdicating its responsibility? What is the motivation of Russia? Much has been said of the money that is owed and the connections between Iraq and Russia. Surely this is a time when we put aside our individual national concerns or interests for the common good. The common good here is to ensure that the world understands that the proliferation of weapons that kill in such an indiscriminate and mass fashion must be done away with wherever possible.</para><para>It does not mean that we do not address other rogue states. It does not mean that other states that are in breach of UN resolutions should not be dealt with. But here is an issue of immediacy. Here is an issue that has been brought to a head because pressure has been brought to bear on Iraq. And now we are being asked to walk away. It would be like giving Saddam the opportunity to say, `We've called your bluff. We've worked out that you, the international community, aren't going to go the whole nine yards; you're going to walk away and I, Saddam Hussein, can continue on my merry way.' That is not something that I can support, in the interests of my children, the people I am elected to represent or the future of anybody in this world. To know that we cannot live with some security that these people are not going to provide their weapons to othersâothers who have the desire to wreak havocâis not something I can support.</para><para>There were Australians in the World Trade Centre. There were Australians in Bali. How many more people have to be killed inside and outside Iraq before we finally make the stand that we should as a nation and as a world? This government stands ready to make the tough decisions. No, they are not popular decisions. Going to war would never be popularâand never should be. But what will the consequences be if we do nothing and then further terrorist attacks occur or these weapons of mass destruction are used next year or in five years time because of our inaction and our gutlessness today as a world community? I do not intend to be condemned as one who stood by in those circumstances.</para><para>I support the Prime Minister and the cabinet in taking the decision today. I sincerely hope that Saddam Hussein does at this eleventh hour take flight and go to a safe haven. There are many other despots, unfortunately, who have not had their just deserts served out to them. In the interest of saving the lives of individuals who have no direct connection with this regime, that would be the best outcome of all. I fully, 100 per cent, support the motion before the House, and I ask all members of the House to do the same.</para><para>Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>12584</page.no><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GRIERSON</name><name.id>00AMP</name.id><electorate>Newcastle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI cannot support the Prime Minister's motion to commit Australia to a war in Iraq. Similarly, I cannot support the military juggernaut, the coalition of the willing, that our nation is now a part ofâa coalition enforcing their military will on the world. This motion supports a decision taken by three nations alone. In their collective impatience they have committed us to war without unanimity among the international community, without seeking UN Security Council endorsement and without allowing peaceful processes to be exhausted before committing to military action. Trigger-happy George Bush could not wait any more and he made that phone call from Air Force One to John Winston Howard. Now we prepare to send young Australians to war, not as part of a UN Security Council decision but as part of some cosy menage a trois concocted in the fantasies of men of the past.</para></talk.start><para>Sadly, the Prime Minister's motion amounts to a death sentence: a death sentence for peace, a death sentence for Australia's international reputation, a death sentence for the hope of the UN to balance global ambition, a death sentence to our regional relationships and a death sentence for potentially hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians. In spite of the sense of doom, everyone on this side of the House is united in their hope that this motion will not amount to a death sentence for any of our Australian defence personnel deployed so early to be part of the war in Iraq. They have our full support and admiration. Our anger and bitter disappointment is saved for the Prime Minister and the members of his government.</para><para>That so many schoolchildren watched from the gallery today as the Prime Minister put this motion is a salient reminder that we owe our future generations so much more. The emotional outbursts from people in the gallery remind us too that no decision divides a nation more than the decision to go to war. I encourage the antiwar collectives and all community and religious organisations to assist the Australian people to peacefully but vocally express their anger and disappointment.</para><para>Already the Australian public are asking us to stop this war, the war John Howard has had to have. But if this motion is passed, the processes will be out of our hands. We have tried, and so have many Australians, but John Howard is not listening. In Newcastleâmy electorateâ20,000 voices were raised in peaceful protest last month and I personally lodged with the Prime Minister 1,000 postcards, as well as in this House a citizens petition of over 2,000 signatures, opposing war. The fair-minded and harmonious community of Newcastle have been well supported by religious leaders, our city council and our trades hall council in their quest for peace, and I applaud them all.</para><para>In Newcastle and the Hunter we believe in strong partnerships and a fair go. We have never shirked our duty or run away from conflict. But we know what is right and we know the circumstances of this motion committing our nation to war are wrong. We know we should not be a part of it, and I anticipate that Newcastle will again protest on our foreshore this Sunday, demanding a swift peace instead of a wrongful war.</para><para>John Howard remains out of touch and now Australia is out of time, unless members of the coalition have the courage to cross the floor and support UN completion of the pursuit of peaceful disarmament. I doubt that will occur. After all, the Prime Minister has no doubt told them too that he knows what is best for the Australian peopleâone man with delusions of grandeur, one man who has failed to provide any evidence that war is the only way to disarm Iraq. John Howard rules his caucus with an iron fist, the iron fist he now intends to bring down on Iraq, a fist gloved in the Stars and Stripes and the British Lion. Shame on him and his coalition of the timid.</para><para>What justification does the government offer for this terrible decision? A major reason put forward has been the evil of terrorism. Sadly, we knowâsome more intimately and painfully than othersâthat evil entered the Australian consciousness, and blood was spilt on the wattle with the deaths of so many of our people in Bali. The last legacy we would want to endure from that terrible tragedy would be the spread of terrorism in all its insidious forms. But I fear today's motion commits us to that path and makes the Australian people a target for extremists and terrorists, both at home and wherever they may be around the world.</para><para>The government has failed to provide evidence of any links between al-Qaeda and the Iraqi regime. But this decision by the coalition amounts to nothing more but an early victory for evil and for terrorism. A new alliance has been created, an alliance of terrorists and extremists, and now we are in their sights and their scopes.</para><para>I remind the House that Labor bailed out the coalition when they could not formulate convincing antiterrorist legislation. In the war against terrorism, this government still cannot find a reasonable way forward for ASIO, in spite of the willingness of the Labor opposition to provide cooperation and advice on these matters. There is plenty of time in the war against terrorism apparently, but no time left in the war against Iraq. Such hypocrisy is lamentable.</para><para>Another reason, if we believe the Prime Minister, is the urgent need to render humanitarian support for the Iraqi people. I would like to acknowledge here the Newcastle refugee story project, which shares real stories of refugees in our community so that we can know their struggle more clearly. Some of those that I have read have been from Iraqi people. Saddam Hussein is no doubt an evil man who rules by fear and should be removed from power.</para><para>The Australian people remember the fear election orchestrated by the Prime Minister when the same suffering Iraqi people were turned back on the seas from our shores because this government did not think they had sufficient cause to try to gain entry to Australia as a safe haven from the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein. Such hypocrisy! If we allow the UN Security Council to run its full race in the quest for peaceful disarmament, suffering will, sadly, undeniably continue for a while longer in Iraq. Sad as it is to prolong that suffering, it will be sadder still to be part of the even greater humanitarian disaster for the Iraqi people that war will create.</para><para>The Prime Minister suggests that only war will achieve disarmament and halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction. But we know that warmongering by the coalition of the willing has had the opposite effect. North Korea has resumed its nuclear armament program and Japan publicly contemplates acquiring defensive nuclear weapons. John Howard and George Bush talk of escalating the Star Wars missile shield programâall in the name of disarmament and peace. I do not think the Australian people are going to believe that one, Prime Minister.</para><para>What does justify Australia being part of unilateral action? The real advancement of global peace perhaps? I do not think that will be the outcome of this war either. It is more likely that, if it is good enough for the coalition of the willing to act alone without direct UN Security Council support, this precedent will be sufficient justification for North Korea, Pakistan, India or any nation with territorial or resource ambitions to strike against its neighbours. The government also claimed today that this proposed action is just an extension of the power granted under numerous UN resolutions to act on any material breach by Iraq in the eradication of weapons. While some backroom bureaucrats and legal eagles may argue over that point for some time, the Australian people and the Labor Party know that this war is wrong. This war is unjustified. This war does not have the support of the international community. Under those circumstances, we should not participate and we should not commit our troops.</para><para>There is definitely an alternative, as the motion put forward by the Leader of the Opposition proposes. Hans Blix and the weapons inspection team have outlined the tasks remaining, and Blix says he thinks those tasks can be achieved in a matter of months. His reports confirm that Iraq has been cooperating and that substantial progress has been made. But this government is not willing to give peace every chance. When their alliance could not get support for their new motion, they decided to commit to war anyway. Apparently, if you cannot win by the rules, throw away the rule bookâa terrible precedent in global relations.</para><para>The script for world conflict was in place and this American war epic will be showing at a war theatre near you. Regrettably, Australia will have a starring role, with our troops deployed front row, centre. It seems that Australians will have to watch the human suffering on every TV network, hear the human pain on every radio station and feel the human shame in every lounge room around this country. It did not have to be this way, Prime Minister, but fools rush in where angels fear to tread, and Australia remains firmly at the front of the war queue. It is hoped that any war in Iraq will be quick, that peace can be attained, that a temporary administration can occur and that reconstruction can be generously assisted. More importantly, we hope our troops will return without injury, free from the emotional and traumatic legacy of war. Fortunately, our troops will be under Australian command, and their renowned discipline, resourcefulness and bravery will support them. But I hold little hope for swift reconstruction when we look at Afghanistan, East Timor and our Pacific nationsâagain, hypocrisy.</para><para>In concluding, I register my support for the Labor motion put forward by Opposition Leader Simon Crean. I also pay a special tribute to RAAF Williamtown, to the Royal Australian Navy personnel whom I shared time with last year and, indeed, to all the men and women of the ADF. I repeat something from a previous speech: you go to this conflict with our hope for your safety, our support for your courage and our appreciation of your commitment. No matter what, you will be welcomed back into arms of gratitude and understandingâbut better that you do not go at all.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>12586</page.no><name role="metadata">Panopoulos, Sophie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PANOPOULOS</name><name.id>00AMU</name.id><electorate>Indi</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support the Prime Minister's motion. The Labor leader spent 34 minutes lecturing the parliament about the great virtue that was to be had in America, Great Britain and Australia being bound to the deliberations of the UN. The truth is that the opposition leader knows that on this issue the UN is moribund and utterly incapable of playing any serious part in ridding the world of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. He knows that Saddam Hussein harbours, protects and fosters international terrorists. The opposition leader also knows that Saddam Hussein will have no hesitation in providing his weapons to international terrorists who in turn will have no hesitation in using them at any opportunity against members of the Western world, including the people of Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The Labor leader's problem is that his agenda is run by the lunatic left in his party who are opposed to war, whatever the justification, whatever the cause, whatever the need and whatever the consequence of not doing so. He is absolutely delighted that the French wrecked any prospect of the UN imposing consequences upon Iraq for refusing to comply with the 17 resolutions thus far carried, demanding that Saddam disarm. Had the UN supported removing Iraq's weapons by force, the opposition leader would have been confronted with a caucus refusing to support his stated position. He knows he could never get a UN-sanctioned war through his caucus. He would have suffered another humiliating defeat. Little wonder he cheered when President Bush said he was going to war without further procrastination by the UN Security Council. Every effort has been made to have the UN involved in the process by which Iraq's weapons of mass destruction were to be removed. However, there was neither the will nor the willingness by certain members of the UN Security Council to embark upon a serious path of disarming Saddam Hussein.</para><para>The French said it all when they declared that they would veto any resolution which called for force to be used to impose the will of the world on the bloody and butcherous Saddam Hussein. That was the moment the UN lost its relevance, its respect and its place in the world order of international institutions. Let it be remembered that for 12Â½ years the UN has been moving resolutions calling for Iraq to remove its weapons, without the slightest indication of success. The truth is that the UN was never serious about enforcing its resolutions. It knew it and Saddam Hussein knew it. UN resolutions without resolve did nothing more than devalue their strength, belittle the process and embolden Saddam.</para><para>It is now obvious that the only reason France and her fellow travellers supported resolution 1441 was that they wanted to ensnare the US in a process in which there was never to be an outcome and from which it would be difficult to escape. It was blindingly obvious that the US was contemplating taking military action to force Iraqi compliance with previous resolutions; in fear that the UN would be bypassed, the coalition of the unwilling deceived Secretary of State Colin Powell into entering into the UN process. It was little more than a trail of deception and deceit. The consequence of the UN's impotence has been the contemptuous snubbing of its deliberations by Iraq, which has continued to manufacture and develop its weapons of mass destructionâall this safe in the knowledge that the UN would not enforce its resolutions.</para><para>Debate on events of the past week in the UN would be incomplete without addressing France's behaviour. France's obstruction of attempts by the US and the UK to impose further pressure on Iraq at the UN Security Council has nothing to do with honourable opposition to the disarming of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction by force and everything to do with France's domestic and international self-interests. France's appalling obstruction, bullying and hectoring is all the worse because of its original support of resolution 1441. France clearly understood at the time it supported the resolution that the wording of the resolution intended that, in the event Iraq failed to comply by fully disarming, force was to be applied to achieve its objective. Having taken the UN route in good faith, America found itself ensnared in a Security Council riven with vested interests in which America's legitimate fear of attack by international terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction provided by Iraq plays no part.</para><para>The truth is that France still bludges on the US, which contributes 85 per cent of the NATO budget. Not only was America left to undertake the vast majority of missions during the Bosnian campaign but also France interfered with its targets. Recently, France voted against providing protection for Turkey, a NATO member, in the event that Turkey is attacked by Iraq. Is it any wonder that America now views the NATO alliance cynically? Chirac cannot accept that France is no longer a major international player. Its market regulated economy has atrophied, and its expenditure on defence is a paltry 14.4 per cent of that outlaid by America. As observed by one writer, the days of Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer deciding issues of state for the entire European Community are long gone.</para><para>Chirac's arrogant outburst against the eastern European countries, newly liberated from oppressive rule, who offered support to America is symptomatic of Chirac's view of France's position in the European order. He informed Bulgaria, Romania, Estonia and Albania that in speaking out they had missed a great opportunity to shut up and that they were jeopardising their prospects of joining the European Union. France's newfound regard for the UN is in vivid contrast to its contemptuous disdain for international forums when protecting its own interests while dealing with its former colonies and client states. France presently has 2,500 troops in the Ivory Coast, sent without UN approval, giving support to the pro-French government presently under siege from rebels. In the past France has sent troops to protect its interests in the Central African Republic and Rwanda. In the latter case, France's troops were assigned to protect the French-armed Hutu regime, which had butchered a million Tutsis. In the past weeks France has insisted on inviting to Paris and lavishly entertaining the corrupt and murderous President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, against whom the Commonwealth and the EU have imposed sanctions. </para><para>When France felt its nuclear testing in the South Pacific was being jeopardised by protestors, it sent military personnel to violate New Zealand's sovereignty so as to murder the protesters and blow up their ship. Upon its officers being arrested, France incarcerated them on a tropical island for a short time, then returned them home with promotions.</para><para>France, of course, does not restrict itself to acting only in its political interests. It has further considerations to protect when hijacking the Security Council. Beside the fact that seven million Muslims now live in France, it has financial interests to consider in Iraq. France controls 22.5 per cent of Iraq's imports and in 2001 became its largest European trading partner. Under the oil-for-food program, roughly 60 French companies do an estimated $1.5 billion in trade with Baghdad annually. France's largest oil company, TotalFinaElf, has negotiated a deal to develop the Majnoon field in western Iraq and a deal for further exploration in the Nahr Umar field. From 1981 to 2001, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, France was responsible for over 13 per cent of Iraq's arms imports. Saddam Hussein is not the first Middle Eastern despot that France has entertained. Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini was a guest of France, from where he waged war against the Shah of Iran.</para><para>But I turn back to the Labor Party. The Labor leader, in a desperate attempt to cobble together a coherent argument in favour of allowing Saddam Hussein to continue to maintain and develop weapons capable of killing millions of people, alleges that there is no known link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. I say, with respect, that that is the most absurd and fatuous proposition to come from his arsenal of nonsense. The irrefutable and incontrovertible facts are that Saddam Hussein is a terrorist; he encourages international terrorism; he harbours, trains and funds terrorists; he possesses weapons of mass destruction; and he despises members of the Western world with consuming hatred.</para><para>Bin Laden is a radical Muslim terrorist; he trains terrorists; he funds terrorists; he has a psychotic hatred of the Western world; and he has attempted to obtain weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear devices. His operatives have attempted to secure crop-spraying aircraft in America for the purpose of spraying Americans with chemical weapons. Three thousand innocent Americans were vaporised by Muslim fanatic terrorists. Eighty-eight innocent Australians were murdered by Muslim fanatic terrorists. A schoolchild could join the dotsâa task apparently beyond the wit of the Labor leader. Saddam Hussein will have no hesitation in providing his weapons of mass destruction to any international terrorist, and the consequences will be the killing of untold thousands of innocent people.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83L</name.id><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe member for Lalor has been offered a good deal of leniency by the chair.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMU</name.id><name role="metadata">Panopoulos, Sophie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PANOPOULOS</name></talker><para>âHad the terrorists who flew aircraft into the New York World Trade Centre had weapons of mass destruction, they would have used them.

The Labor Party continues to insist on not a UN resolution but a French resolution. In doing so, they knowingly insist on an impossibility, given the intransigence of the French government. In taking that stance, the opposition leader joins France as a willing dupe of the Iraqi regime. My prayers are with our troops in the gulf.

Let me give the Main Committee a list of parliamentary names and electorates: the member for Warringah, the member for Gwydir, the member for Paterson, the member for Macquarie, the member for Mitchell, the member for Parramatta, the member for Makin, the member for Mallee, the member for Wannon, the member for Fadden, the member for Dawson, the member for Lindsay, the member for Robertson, the member for Gippsland, the member for Hinkler, the member for Indi, the member for Sturt, the member for Canning, the member for Hume, the member for Barker, the member for Fisher, the member for Dobell, the member for Lyne and the member for Hughes. Now I move to the other place: Senator Alston, Senator Calvert, Senator Eggleston, Senator Lightfoot, Senator McGauran, Senator Barnett, Senator Boswell, Senator Chapman, Senator Coonan, Senator Ellison, Senator Heffernan, Senator Sandy Macdonald, Senator Minchin and Senator Santoro. These are the 38 government members and senators who opposed the stem cell research bill just last year but who now support a war in Iraq.</para></talk.start><para>On stem cells, the 38 claimed to be driven by the sanctity of lifeâa belief that embryo cells, too small to be seen, and which will never develop into a human life, need to be preserved at any cost. Yet, on Iraq, where tens of thousands of innocent civilians, babies, children and women will most certainly be slaughtered by the US war machine, these same 38 members of parliament have no concern for the sanctity of life. These are real lives, not single cells, frozen forever in research laboratories. These are real human livesâbabies resting in their cots, children playing in the streets and women caring for their families.</para><para>I believe we could stand here and watch this chamber for a century or more and we would not see a worse act of hypocrisy. I honestly do not know how these people sleep at night, given the impassioned speeches they gave on stem cell research, the frantic campaigning, the high emotion of defining these cells as human lives and then arguing for the sanctity of life. Yet, on Iraq, we see fawning compliance and silence from the government backbench as the 38 government members and senators I listed passively sit and watch the Prime Minister lead Australia down the path of folly, hell-bent on war in Iraq, which will have shocking consequences for tens of thousands of human lives. This is the double standard of the little Tories in this place. Sanctity has been replaced by hypocrisy. How do they live with such a shocking double standard! Not for them the sort of principle displayed by the members for Franklin and Lowe, who are passionate defenders of the sanctity of life on stem cells and passionate defenders of the sanctity of life in Iraq.</para><para>I do not mind the disagreements in this placeâin fact, I always enjoy the contest of ideas and the clearing house across the parliament; it is a robust part of a healthy democracyâbut not for a moment can I stomach the double standards of the 38 members that I have listed. Not for a moment can I comprehend their hypocrisy on Iraq. This is the arrogance of power. This is what happens to people who argue from a position of convenience and not of conviction. They pick and choose their principles to suit the issue of the day. One moment, on stem cells, it is the sanctity of life; the next moment, on Iraq, it is the destruction of life. They never apply to the issue a consistent set of values and beliefs. They are the cafeteria conservatives of Australian politics.</para><para>From the backbench to the cabinet room, the arrogance of power has seeped through the Howard government. Just look at the Prime Minister himself. His first instincts are always authoritarian and arrogant. Given a choice between backing the powerful in our society and backing the people, he always goes with the powerful; he never backs the people. Take the arrogant way in which the Prime Minister has committed our country to war in Iraq. There has been no public consultation, no respect for public protest and no openness and transparency with the Australian people, just a mad rush to say `yes' to the United States.</para><para>Two weeks ago, the government produced an updated defence strategy, and we have appropriations in this bill that act on defence strategies of the government. This was another little echo out of Washington. In a post-Cold War world, the government sees just one super powerâwhat it calls the primacy of the United Statesâand it will march with them irrespective of Australia's national interest, irrespective of Australian need, even in a march of folly. This was the basis of the strategic review, a remarkably simplistic document that even goes as far as endorsing the `son of Star Wars'âthat is, American missile defence. Incredibly, this is not to protect Australian cities and territories; rather, it recognises that, under this government, wherever the US Army goes across the globe, the ADF will automatically follow. This is not a white paper; it is a tissue paper to cover the government's radical shift in defence policy. The old DOA was defence of Australia. Under the Howard government, the new DOA is defence of America. The Howard government has turned Australia's national security upside down. It has handed over our sovereignty and our foreign policy making to the United States and left our country exposed to the adventurism of the Bush administration. This is a government that backs the powerful; it does not back the Australian people.</para><para>The Prime Minister's record on democratic reform is just as bad. His record on foreign policy is appalling. But let us look at his record on democratic reform. There has been no independent Speaker of the House of Representatives, no reform of the parliament and its committee system, no community cabinet meetings, no experiments with Internet democracy or deliberative democracy and no republic, let alone a democratically electedâthat is, directly electedâAustralian president. Under this government, power is concentrated in the hands of the few, not the many. Indeed, this is the new dividing line in Australian public life. It is not a question of left versus right but a struggle between the insiders and the outsiders, a struggle between the powerful and the people. I argueâI passionately believeâthat too much power in our society is concentrated in the hands of insiders. This is the downside of globalisation. While it opens up new opportunities for the exchange of economics and information, it also allows the old establishment to entrench its power across the globe. This is why Labor is anti-establishment and fights for the people, not the powerful. We are willing to take on the economic establishment in this countryâthe companies that believe not in competition but in the worst excesses of cowboy capitalism: the insider deals, the preferment, the restrictive trade practices, the corporate greed and the irresponsibility. Labor's policy aims to empower the outsiders to build an economy that ensures competition by all and assets for all. </para><para>This is the purpose of our economic ownership agendaâto develop a stakeholder society in which all Australians have opportunities to save and accumulate assets across the life cycle, with nest egg accounts, lifelong learning accounts, family accounts, matched savings accounts and, of course, superannuation for the retirement years. We aim to disperse economic power and ownership into the hands of the many, not just the few. We can no longer tolerate a society in which the top 20 per cent own 65 per cent of the nation's wealth while the bottom 20 per cent of Australians own absolutely nothing at all. So, too, we should not tolerate Australia's social establishmentâthe insiders' club that looks after its own with preferment and special deals, the toffee-nosed snobs who pass extraordinary wealth and social status from one generation to the next. We need a society based on equal opportunity, affordable services and education for all. We need these things for the vast suburbs and regions of the nation, not just for the gentrified elite.</para><para>I am also opposed to the political establishmentâthose who want to concentrate power in their own hands instead of decentralising our democracy and empowering the outsiders, those who feel left out of the decision making process. The media establishment, of course, is a big part of the problemâthe self-serving commentariat that claims the right for the suburbs but who, in practice, never live west of Annandale or Yarraville. This is why the right wing elites in Australia are so out of touch with public opinion.</para><para>Just look at the disgraceful coverage of the Iraqi issue by the Murdoch press. Under the ownership and control of an American citizen, they have acted against Australia's best interests; they have acted against the interests of our country. I noticed recently an analysis by Roy Greenslade in the <inline font-style="italic">Guardian</inline> newspaper on 17 February. He pointed out that there are 175 Murdoch newspaper titles around the world and thatâsurprise, surpriseâ175 of them have backed the war in Iraq. One hundred per cent have shamefully backed unilateral American policy with regard to Iraq. Greenslade writes:</para><quote><para>How lucky can Murdoch get! He hires 175 editors and, by remarkable coincidence, they all seem to love the nation which their boss has chosen as his own.</para></quote><para>The truth is that we need more diversity, more choice and more accountability in the Australian media. We need to transfer power from the insiders to the Australian people. We need to democratise Australia's media laws. Shamefully, the Howard government is moving in the opposite direction. </para><para>We also need to break down the power of the legal establishment, with its system of preferment, exorbitant fees and featherbedding. In this place, the legal elites are represented by the Liberal Party. I find this to be an extraordinary figure: there are 44 corporate lawyers in the Liberal caucus; 20 in the Senate and 24 in the House. Of the 25 Liberal members of the Howard ministry, 17 are corporate lawyers. That is nearly 70 per cent. No wonder people like yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, cannot get a look-in with the Howard ministry. It is colonised by corporate lawyers. Forget about 50-50 or 60-40; the Liberals operate under a 70-30 rule.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>OT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Charles, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Charles</name></talker><para>âHow many union members on your side?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name></talker><para>âI hear the member for La Trobe interject.

In fact, the best way to get Liberal preselection is to own a wig. Just like the British Tories, they love to dress up; it is the best way of getting Liberal Party preselection. The Prime Minister has surrounded himself with 43 fellow lawyers. Quite honestly, not even Rodney Adler needs that many. Not even Rodney Adler needs 43 fellow lawyers around him. This is not a liberal party; it is the lawyers party of Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I have mentioned the economic establishment, the social establishment, the political establishment, the media elites and the legal establishment. My final target in this speech is the foreign policy establishment: those who believe in the imperial right of the United States to control and police the world, with our Prime Minister tagging along as deputy sheriff. This government believes in the primacy of the United States. I believe in a tripolar international environment: the United States as a superpower, sure; but also China as an emerging superpower and the European Union as a supranational power. This government believes in concentrating global power in the hands of just one country; I believe in dispersing power across the globe, recognising three major powers and not just one.</para><para>This is one of the reasons why I oppose the war on Iraq. I believe this war is based on a dangerous doctrine: the Bush doctrine of pre-emption. Sixty years ago, mankind developed the capacity to destroy itself, most notably through nuclear weapons of mass destruction. Since then, the world has managed to survive, mainly through policies of deterrence and containment. In the post-war years, this was known as the Truman Doctrine. The United Nations also played an important role. It may not be perfect, but it is still the best system we have for fostering international goodwill and cooperation. To ignore and then belittle the will of the United Nations at this crucial time represents an appalling shift in Australian foreign policy. Even worse, and without any real debate, the Howard government has embraced the Bush doctrine of pre-emption. This doctrine overturned 60 years of successful US foreign policyâ60 years of deterrence and containment. It gives the US a mandate to launch pre-emptive strikes on other nations that it deems to be evil. Bush has abandoned President Clinton's emphasis on multilateralism and gone down the dangerous path of unilateralism. Make no mistake: a world based on threats of military action, a world based on pre-emptive strikes, is a world about to do itself terrible harm.</para><para>The folly of this approach can be seen on the Korean peninsula. At the Sydney Olympics 2Â½ years ago, the North Korean and South Korean teams marched together. This was seen as a wonderful sign for the future. It gave the world hope for political and economic cooperation resolving an international trouble spot. Eighteen months ago, the North Korean leadership was in China studying the benefits of economic openness and liberalisation. Again, it seemed that the North Korean problem would solve itself. Like other communist regimes under the weight of economic failure, it was going to reform from within. Then, 14 months ago, President Bushâseemingly from nowhereâincluded North Korea in his axis of evil speech and threatened military pre-emption.</para><para>Not surprisingly, North Korea is now racing to defend itself, weaponising its nuclear power. In response, Japan has said that it, too, needs nuclear weapons. This is the problem with pre-emption: it creates an international environment based on suspicion and escalation. In our country, bizarrely, the Prime Minister has said that we now need a nuclear missile shield to defend ourselves against North Korea. This is the madness of pre-emption and escalation. None of it has anything to do with the war against terrorânot the development of Japanese nuclear capacity nor creation of an Australian missile shield. Osama bin Laden, quite frankly, must be laughing himself silly at the folly of American and Australian foreign policy.</para><para>We cannot run the world according to threats and first-strike thinkingânot a world in which 26 nations have chemical weapons and 20 have biological weapons, not a world in which India and Pakistan both have nuclear weapons, and not a world plagued by the non-stop violence of the Middle East. History tells us that deterrence and containment are the only answers, along with the age-old hope of cooperation between nations. This is where I fundamentally disagree with President Bush's policy. In outlining his new doctrine in September last year, he said:</para><quote><para>In the new world we have entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.</para></quote><para>I believe that, in this new world as well as in the old world, the only path to safety is international cooperation; multilateralism, not unilateralism; containment, not pre-emption; and peace, not an unnecessary war in Iraq. Along with most Australians, I do not want a world in which one country has all the power. I do not want a world based on axis of evil rhetoric and the constant threat of pre-emption. There is a better way: it is called the United Nations. This means respecting the findings of Hans Blix. This means respecting international opinionâin this case, the position of France, Germany, Russia and China. It means sharing power across the globe instead of allowing one nation to appoint itself as the global policeman. </para><para>There was a time, of course, when George W. Bush seemed to believe in these ideals himself. During the 2000 presidential campaign, he said that he wanted the United States to take a lower profile in international affairs and to beâI use his wordsâ`a more humble power'. His radical shift in policy has, in fact, humiliated his nation. He has provoked anti-American sentiment internationally; he has divided the Western alliance and badly damaged NATO. I ask this simple question: who was the last world leader to unite France, Germany, Russia and China? This is an unprecedented coalition: from the right wing Gaullists in France, to the Social Democrats in Germany, to Putin's Russia, to the Communist Party of China, international opinion is united all rightâit is united against the United States. Around the globe, people do not want a world in which one country has all the power. They want power sharing and cooperation. This should be the basis of Australia's foreign policy. The Howard government believes in a unipolar world in which the primacy of the United States is beyond challenge. I believe in a multipolar world, recognising not just American power but also China as an emerging superpower plus the importance of the European Union.</para><para>Australia is one of the few countries in the world well placed to have strong relations with all three. In the Labor Party, this is not just an opportunity for the future; it is part of our political legacy. Just as Curtin established the US relationship, just as Calwell established the European Migration Program and just as Whitlam established relations with the People's Republic of China, the next Labor government will have to realign and rebalance Australia's foreign policy. Nothing is more important than getting these relationships right. The great irony of the government's strategy is that it actually weakens our relationship with the United States. Like any alliance, ANZUS works best when it is based on an equal partnership, when both partners bring something important to the table. Under the Howard government, Australia brings nothing but subservience. This is hurting the strength and viability of the relationship. In practice, we matter to the Americans when we matter in Asia. </para><para>What are we going to bring to the table? We matter to the United States when we matter in Asia. The alliance is strongest when Australian diplomacy is able to influence outcomes in our part of the world. This is when the United States has reason to rely on us. This is when the United States has reason to treat Australia as an equal partner. Under this government, of course, our influence in Asia is minor. Our neighbours shake their heads in disbelief when they see Australia echoing the American line and when they see our Prime Minister calling himselfâvirtually belittling himselfâa deputy sheriff. These Asian nations fought long and hard against colonialism. They are proud nations with little respect for countries that act like client states. They have independent foreign policies of their own and they expect the same from Australia.</para><para>Mr Howard thinks the ultimate guarantor of Australia's security is the US alliance. This is nonsense. The ultimate guarantor of Australia's security is the soundness of our foreign policy and the strength of our armed forces. We need an alliance with the United States, yes. But we also live in a new world with new threats and new doctrines. The Howard government has not handled these challenges well. The next Labor government will need to repair the damage, to rebalance the relationship between our two countries. I support the American alliance but it must be an alliance between equals, a genuine partnership rather than the deputy sheriff role we have today. I conclude by saying that whether it is the economic establishment, the political establishment, the social establishment, the legal establishment, the media elites or the foreign policy establishment, this is a government that concentrates power in the hands of the few rather than disbursing power and opportunity into the hands of many Australians. We need a change of government. The debate and decisions today contribute to that public mood. This government must go, particularly on the issue of Iraq. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>12597</page.no><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name><name.id>HK6</name.id><electorate>Herbert</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Deputy Speaker, I propose to be rather wide ranging in this cognate debate on <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline> this afternoon, and I thank you for the opportunity to address the Main Committee. It has been a sombre day in Canberra today and I think we all understand why. It has been a particularly sombre day for me. With so many Defence Force personnel in Townsville and Thuringowa, the possibility of war is something that I have deeply reflected on. Our community has about 120 personnel currently forward deployed in the gulf, and I think about them and their families back home. I would particularly like to say this to families of members of the Defence Force: there are some families who are not receiving any contact information from personnel in the gulf. They say to me, `The Americans and the Brits are allowing contact between servicemen in the gulf and home, but our soldiers are not being allowed to contact home.' That is true and it is untrue. The explanation for that is simply that those who are in the gulf are classified as `special forces'; for example, the members of 5 Aviation Regiment from Townsville are part of that group. They are on a very sensitive deployment and for security reasons they are unable to contact home so that there is no information about their location and their potential further operations in the gulf. That is regretted, but I am sure that families will understand that at this time it is better that we maintain proper security arrangements.</para></talk.start><para>I would now like to turn to the matter of ATSIC. Some members in this parliament have a lot to do with ATSIC and have large ATSI communitiesâ8,000 of the people that I represent are Indigenous Australians. Other members do not have a lot of ATSI people in their electorates and do not ever see the issues associated with ATSIC. I think that Christopher Pyne's address in Melbourne in the last week has probably been regarded by many in the Aboriginal community as being spot on. Christopher was saying that the relevance of ATSIC was in question, that what the organisation was not delivering was a scandal and that ATSIC should be replaced. I first heard that from, I think, the Hon. Wilson Tuckey, who suggested that ATSIC should be broken up and that regional councils much closer to where the demand for services was should be involved in distributing the funds to run those services. In my own patch, in the electorate of Herbert, I have Palm Island. I have been going to Palm Island since I was elected. In the seven years that I have been in the federal parliament, the federal government has probably put $100 million into Palm Island but you are hard-pressed to go there today and see where any of the money has gone. I am talking about $100 million. Yes, you can see a dam, a second water supply for Palm Island, but you cannot see much else.</para><para>All you can see is a community that is dysfunctional. It is dysfunctional not only in terms of how the number of different groups do not get on together but also in terms of community services, health services, education services, roads and sewerage. It is a disgrace. The peak body charged with delivering services on the ground and getting better outcomes for Indigenous Australians is simply failing Indigenous Australians; that is the scandal. Yet you see the much publicised goings on down here in Canberra, you see the terrible waste of taxpayers' money and you see a government which is trying to be at arm's length, trying to empower Indigenous people to make decisions for themselves and trying to be remote from that. But it is not working. I feel very deeply that Christopher Pyne hit the nail on the head: the government needs to move to solve that problem, to put every last dollar into the benefit of Aboriginal people on the ground, at the coalface, in terms of health, education, domestic violence, drugs and the whole range of things that I see when I go to Palm Island.</para><para>I would now like to turn to the issue of nurses and nurse education. I know there has been somewhat of a public debate about how best to educate and produce registered nurses. What I have been finding in feedback is that young men and women are going into the nursing profession but they do not last. They do not stay there; they move on. The thing seems to be that they do not get enough practical experience and do not understand what nursing is about before they finish their university degree. I have had some hospitals come to me in absolute frustration that they are continually battling to get nurses and cannot get nurses to stay in the profession. They are operators at the coalface.</para><para>Their solution is to maintain the university degree aspect of nursing trainingâthey do not dispute that at allâbut to increase the practical component. They want to see an increased practical training component that will benefit not only the nurses themselves but also the hospitals in our community and, particularly, at the end of the day, the patients. What needs to happen is something like a six-month internship in a hospital before a trainee nurse goes into formal education in a university and then, every year, six months of training on a rotating basis. This might mean that, for example, the university will have to schedule its courses on a rolling basis. You might not have the traditional going in in March and finishing in November; you might actually be operating over the Christmas break, for example. There are some possibilities there.</para><para>The benefit for nurses is, apart from the practical training, that they can be paid while they are working on the job. The hospitals have no difficulty at all with providing the funding to pay nurses' wages, and that is how it should be. No-one expects them to work for nothing. So the nurses would benefit and the hospitals would benefit. I think there needs to be a debate in this country. I am aware of some trials that are going on in Sydney that adopt this particular model. So far, so good; it is working very well. I would ask my community to consider supporting that kind of processâwhere nurses benefit, hospitals benefit and, ultimately, patients benefit.</para><para>Turning to the arts in Townsville, I note that the country's pre-eminent regional dance group, Dance North, has its headquarters in Townsville. The company is currently headed by Henry Laska, and I want to congratulate Henry because he has pulled off something that we have wanted to pull off for a long time. I have to say that he had a bit of backing from a member of the government who represents the electorate of Herbert. I was pleased to do that because Henry's long experience in the arts as a manager and financially stands him in good stead for his appointment to the board of Playing Australia. That is an appointment that has not gone unnoticed in Townsville. It has also not gone unnoticed in the arts community right across the country that finally we have a regional representative on the board of Playing Australia who knows what he is talking about. It is a big feather in the cap for Henry Laska. It is a big feather in the cap for Dance North, for Townsville and for regional Australia that Henry has been appointed to the board. I know that he will do well. I wish him well. He will represent regional Australia fiercely, as it should be represented.</para><para>I would now like to turn to a visit that the federal Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, paid to Townsville last Tuesday. It was a very successful visit for a number of reasons. Dr Nelson is responsible for schools, higher education, science and training. Each of those particular facets of his portfolio received attention while he was in Townsville. I was particularly pleased to see Brendan visit the Australian Institute of Marine Science and James Cook University. Anyone in the marine science field anywhere in the world will tell you that AIMS and JCU are the standout institutions. From anywhere in the world, if you want to go to the best centre of excellence in marine science, you go to Townsvilleâeither to the Australian Institute of Marine Science or to James Cook University. Professor Stephen Hall, the CEO of AIMS, is a first-class scientist and manager. Professor Michael Kingsford, Professor of Marine Biology and Aquaculture at James Cook University, is a first-class leader of his team. Dr Nelson told us that he was recently at a meeting of Fulbright scholars who had come to Australia from the US. One of them said, `I am going to James Cook University,' and Brendan said, `Why are you going to James Cook University?' The scholar said, `If you want to go to the best place for marine science in the world, you go to James Cook University.' Once again regional Australia has a course that leads the world, and we will continue to do that.</para><para>I am also pleased that Dr Nelson spoke with Gerry Smith, the manager of TADEC, which coordinates the Jobs Pathway Program for the city. Gerry raised an interesting issue with Dr Nelsonâother members may have come across the same issueâwhich is that Jobs Pathway providers are only funded on an annual basis. This causes some uncertainty among staff because they do not know whether they are going to get funded for the next year. Gerry spoke to the minister, and it is a great country that we live in where somebody 2,000 kilometres from Canberra can have the opportunity of buttonholing a minister and saying, `Minister, when you are down in Canberra, this is what you need to do.' Gerry told him, `You need to give us more certainty; you need to perhaps extend the funding cycle to make it a two-year funding cycle.' To his very great credit, Brendan is a minister who listens and takes action. I know that he came back to Canberra and instructed his department to have a look at the possibility of doing this. If we can achieve that, providers like TADEC right across the country will benefit from the fact that we were able to buttonhole the minister and make a sensible suggestion and have that suggestion taken up.</para><para>The Australian Broadcasting Corporation is getting much more customer focused these days. Under the leadership of Russell Balding, the ABC's focus is certainly more strategic. Russell is a very impressive leader, in my view. He knows where he is taking the corporation, and he is taking it in a very positive direction. He proposed in the current triennial funding that NewsRadio be extended to a number of areas across the country. I see that it could go to Grafton and Kempsey, as well as to Townsville. I would like to see NewsRadio come to Townsville, although it is on the Net if people really need to listen to it. My interest is in Russell's focus on the rollout of regional television news. The debate about the commercial stations removing their news services from aggregated areas has raged over the last year and a half, and it is refreshing to see that the ABC is proposing to bring back local news services to regional areas. That is a mighty step forward, and it has my absolute support. I entered the television industry in North Queensland before some people in this room were bornâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83K</name.id><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Roxon</name></talker><para>âThat is for sure!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name></talker><para>âI am probably referring to just the people on the other side; I am certainly not referring to Mr Charles! At that time, the ABC had local news services and a local current affairs show, all run out of Townsville. With the effluxion of time, these things disappeared, and the viewing audienceâthe customers, if you likeâwere disadvantaged by that. It is great to see the ABC proposing to bring back to North Queensland a local news serviceâlike the one they now have in Canberraâand to run it out of Townsville, right up to Cairns. Why shouldn't we have a local news service? Townsville is Australia's largest tropical city. It now has a population of 150,000. The proposed news service, when it extends up the coast, would service a population of about half a million people. The ABC is asking the government for additional base funding, which I strongly support. On average, about $2Â½ million is required each year, which would be a great investment to put choice back into the delivery of news in local, regional viewing areas. Choice is important.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The ABC has to be mindful of its responsibility to broadcast fair and unbiased news services. It has been under some pressure in that regard, and I think the ABC is realising that it needs to get its credibility back. I must add that the current staff of ABC News in Townsville, who primarily run the radio news services, are as professional as you can get. They ask the hard questions and they do not put bias into their reporting. You can be sure that, if you hear it on the ABC in North Queensland, it must be so. It is great to be able to say that, and I pay a very great tribute to ABC staff.</para><para>Finally, I would like to finish my speech with the matter of the Douglas arterial road in Townsville. For about 40 years the community have been asking for this road to be built. The road will put another bridge across the Ross River and it will cut seven kilometres off a journey from the Upper Ross to the university, the hospital or the Lavarack army base. A huge amount of work was done to bring the state government to the table and to get a funding agreement that would be satisfactory to the federal government and the state government so that this project could be built. I was pleased to announce last week that finally, after 40 years, we were able to declare that a request for tenders would be made this week. The Upper Ross community in Townsville will be delighted to see that this project has got the green light. It has not been with the help of the local Labor members, who felt that this should be fully funded by the federal government even though it is a state government road. Good try! We were not going to be in that, but we have now committed $37.4 million for a new road in our city. When it is built, it will be a lasting monument to the tenacity of the federal government to get the project up and running.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>12600</page.no><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name><name.id>83K</name.id><electorate>Gellibrand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to speak in the cognate debate on <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>. The particular concerns that I want to raise relate to the expenditure and resources in the child-care and children's services area. In particular, I want to focus on a number of reviews that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is undertaking. I mention the resources issue and the fact that the minister is undertaking these reviews right up front because, just in the last few days, in the course of the New South Wales elections, we have heard some pretty terrible reports in the media about some of the activities that the minister's staff allegedly have been involved in. Quite apart from whether or not these activities are lawfulâand there are questions that have been asked that no doubt will be answered in due course to ascertain whether or not they are appropriateâI have a great concern about the issue of the allocation of public resources of Canberra based staff who are employed as portfolio staff. They have a large range of issues, a number of which I am going to go through in detail today, that should be perplexing them or should be being worked out or worked on by them in trying to find an answer for the children and young people of Australia, who expect that the minister and his office will use all of their public resources and energy to take forward issues in the portfolio area.</para></talk.start><para>I wanted to put that on the record because I think that it has been a step forward to have, for the first time, a minister for children but, if you want to be a champion for children, you do have to make sure that you are also going to champion that the government spend the appropriate amount of money on the programs that will assist them, particularly in the most severely stretched areas, such as the child-care budget. I am concerned that the minister has not taken to this with quite the enthusiasm that we would hope that a new ministry in this particular area would signal.</para><para>Labor have recently put out a discussion paper called `Growing up: investing in the early years', which has highlighted the importance of our children's early education and care and the need to adequately invest in thisâfor the benefit of both the child and their family and the broader community. We have put forward a lot of detailed proposals in that discussion paper. We have had some fantastic responses already and are looking forward to a much longer debate about the content of that paper. The government then, a month later, put out its own early years document, talking about the need to develop a national early childhood strategy, and we support the approach that has been taken by the government in announcing its desire to develop such a strategy. We think it is very important to have a debate about the framework to make sure that the community does understand the need to invest in these early years. Obviously, the issue of appropriate resources that need to be put into any action that would flow from such a strategy will be dealt with further down the track. It is interesting that the document does not mention child care or healthâthe two main areas where the Commonwealth government has the greatest responsibility in these early yearsâin very much detail at all. Certainly, the background material in the paper does focus a lot more on health than on child care. We welcome the debate that is going to be had about this strategy, we support the fact that the government is doing it and we will participate in the discussions with the rest of the community about what is appropriate to include in such a strategy.</para><para>What I want to focus on in particular is the broadband review of the child-care sector that is being undertaken by the current minister. It is very relevant to the appropriations bills, because it deals specifically with a single item in the child-care budget that has a fixed expenditure linked to it. A major part of the child-care budget is the child-care benefit, which is allocated to parents depending on their income and the number of hours their children use child care. It is essentially a demand driven entitlement. As long as parents can find places in child-care servicesâand in some cases there is difficultyâthey are able to claim child-care benefit for them. In the long day care area in particular, the numbers are not limited and the government's budget goes up and down depending on the number of families that have children in child care at any time. But the broadband review, and the expenditure item that relates to it, covers everything in the child-care budget other than child-care benefit. It is only $180 million this year, and it is the only area where there is any allocated funding for quality issues, for inclusion issues and often for accessibility issues.</para><para>I am going to take a little bit of time to go through the sorts of things that are covered by this broadband expenditure item, because it is currently being reviewed by the government. This bucket of money is supposed to ensure that quality child care is provided in federally funded programs and that it is accessible. Among other things, this small amount of money is supposed to cover the operational subsidy for family day care. Family day carers are those carers who work in their own homes and have up to fiveâand sometimes sevenâchildren, depending on their ages, to care for. The operational subsidy goes to whoever coordinates 40 or 50 and sometimes up to 100 carers, assists them in making sure that their house is appropriate for the care of children and provides training materials, support and information when they need it. It also covers the Disadvantaged Area Subsidy, which is provided to some services in rural and remote areas and is not allowed to be spent in urban areas, even if they are equally, if not more, disadvantaged in some instances.</para><para>The National Childcare Accreditation Council and the quality accreditation process that it runs is also funded through this $180 million broadband program. The supplementary services, known as SUPS, in long day care and family day care provide support and training resource materials, particularly to help services integrate disabled children and to assess whether or not extra assistance is required. The Special Needs Subsidy Scheme, about which there has been much controversy recently because the government froze expenditure in this area a year ago, provides extra funding for child-care centres to employ an extra staff member for a severely disabled child to help them to participate in normal child care. I am going to come back to that later, because there are now nearly 1,000 children on a national waiting list who cannot get any child care because of the government's decision to freeze that expenditure.</para><para>This broadband $180 million is also to coverâand I am only about halfway through the list, so you will see that there are a lot of things to be covered by a pretty small expenditure itemâthe in-service training program, which has already been cut in Queensland even though the review is currently under way. It is also to cover resource and advisory agencies, and I know some of my colleagues on my side of the House are very concerned because there is not even one in Western Australia. The mobile child-care services, which have in the past couple of years been reviewed and had their funding threatened, have been told that they will be re-reviewed as part of this broadband review process. The Multifunction Aboriginal Children's Services, often known as MACS, support specific programs for Aboriginal children, often in remote areas, and a more integrated service where child-care and health facilities might be provided together. Also covered is Aboriginal playgroups. There is a private provider incentive, which is limited to private providers of long day care. They are provided with an advance on their child-care benefit so that they can use that money for capital works and then recoup it later. It is not provided for any community child carers. There is a very small range of other program initiatives.</para><para>The government announced that it wants to review this expenditure item and has explicitly stated that the basis for this review is that no extra money will be provided. From our perspective, we are very concerned that you cannot really have a proper review if you are going to say, `No matter what feedback we get, no matter what people tell us, no matter how much demand there is, we're not going to spend any extra money but we'll let you reallocate some of the money within that pool, even though a number of these projects are already under pressure and are finding it very difficult, with the current constraints, to meet their objectives.' So we have a real concern that the review process has been set up in a way which ensures that the different programs and those involved with the different programs will fight each other. Then we will get into the ridiculous position of saying, `Do disabled children need more support than a mother of triplets, who might need special in-home care, or do they need more support than a remote Aboriginal community?' A real review would look at whether all three of those categories, or families, might need extra assistance. We are very concerned that the sector might end up being asked to make some judgment on how that money can be spent, when really it is a decision for government. A proper review would take account of what the community is saying and maybe make a decision that more money might need to be spent in this area.</para><para>The government has employed a consultant to run the broadband review project, and on its web site the consultant tries to explain what the review is going to be about. However, anyone who reads it will find that what you really learn is what the review is not about, because there is not very much about what it is going to be about. The redevelopment project, as it is being called on the consultant's web site, is not about the child-care benefit. It states that the goal of the child-care program remains as isâthat is, that there should be accessible, affordable, quality child care. It says that there may be a need to talk about the different aspects of how the broadband expenditure can deliver this to people but that the overall outcome itself will not change. We do not have an argument with that aim: we believe that it is fundamental that accessibility, affordability and quality should be at the centre of a child-care program. However, the consultant's web site goes on to tell us that the process under which child-care providers are accredited will not be a focus of this review and that there is no agenda for changing the accreditation process. But funding for the accreditation process is found within this pool of money, and it is the major way the Commonwealth seeks to control the quality of the child-care programs it funds, so it is a bit perplexing that it is not going to be part of the review.</para><para>The next item we find is that the review is not going to be about assessment of any individual need. They believe that some work has already been done on the particular needs for child care and that the process of assessing whether or not need is being met is `never complete'. They feel that the redevelopment project is about trying to ensure that the program arrangements are effectively oriented to meeting needsâeven though assessment cannot be made of individual needs that might not be met. You can see that there is some confusing language in this. It seems to us that we are not talking about a serious review when we have so many things that are being excluded. In particular, I want to raise here the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme, which I have mentioned already. It is the one where there are now 847âand we think the number is still grossly underestimatedâchildren with individual disabilities whose needs are not being taken into account. They are not able to access the program because of the freeze that the government has put into place. The review says that it will not look at their individual situations and the fact that they do not have access to child-care services. I strongly believe that, if we are serious about saying the child-care program is about accessibility, affordability and quality, any serious review of this broadband money, including the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme, must take account of the individual circumstances of the large number of families and children who are not able to get the services that they should.</para><para>The last point on the web site takes the cake. It says that the project is not about a fight over resources. It will be a great relief to all those who currently do not have sufficient resources to be able to meet their needs that, even though this review will not provide extra money, it is not going to be about a fight over resources! I think the consultants might be kidding themselves, because a lot of people feel very passionately about the services they are trying to provide. They are telling the governmentâand will tell the consultants too, I am sureâthat they currently cannot do it on the budget that they have.</para><para>It seems to me that there is no way that accessibility, affordability and quality are what the government is really talking about if it is not going to look at the child-care benefit, which has a major impact on affordability; if it is not going to talk about need, which is obviously a major issue in terms of access; and if it is not going to talk about accreditation, which is a major driver in quality. We are very concerned about where this is going. We think that, if you are going to spend money on consultants, you should make sure that they are going to have a proper job to do. The government should be prepared to hear from those consultants what it is that the community and families are saying they would like in this area. As part of this review, there are some basic questions that I think the minister, as the person responsible for running the Commonwealth child-care program, needs to answer. If the review is not about assessing the needs of children in child care, if it is not about the reallocation of resources, if it is not about the quality accreditation process, if it is not about child-care benefit and if it is determined not to change the goals of the program, what is the purpose of this review? </para><para>If the minister is seriously considering abolishing the operational subsidy to family day care schemes, for example, which are already stretched and running very long waiting lists in many parts of the countryâup to thousands when you look at the figures nationallyâwhy does he not just come out and say so? If he said he was thinking about taking away the operational subsidy for family day care schemes, at least then we could have a focused debate on what it is that the operational subsidy supports in family day care schemes. We could talk with family day carers, parents, other community providers and those interested in the community about what benefits are or are not being provided by family day care schemes. Instead, we just get told that it is not about any of this. We do not necessarily have a debate on an area which we hear the government is considering taking resources away from. </para><para>Again, we do not believe that the government has really been up-front about what its long-term intentions are with respect to the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme. Twelve months ago, the government froze the funding for this scheme, and there are large numbers of children who are on the waiting list. We have parents ringing us every week absolutely distraught that they have not only the extra pressures from being a parent of a child with often a severe disability but extra expenses associated with that. They cannot return to work, often when jobs are available for them, because they cannot find child care. They are really stuck in what can become the downward spiral of having high costs, a stressful situation and little support from the government when it is needed. For many of these families, even just having some respite is desperately important for them in the way they live their lives. </para><para>What is the government's intention? Are they just going to say: `As soon as there are 4,000 children across the country on this scheme, no-one else can be on it. We do not care what your circumstances are'? Are they going to look at it being demand driven in some way or are the tests going to be harder before you can qualify? That would surprise me, because the tests are already very stringent and some children with pretty high demands and special needs do not qualify under the current system. We are just arguing to retain what is there. We do not know from the government what their real intentions are. We would like to be able to argue properly about these issues and have a debate about what the needs are rather than be stuck in this fake review process where we are really not sure whether the government are intending to do anything.</para><para>In the time remaining, I also want to focus on one particular group: the Indigenous children in our cities and country towns, particularly in remote areas. This group of children are participating at a much lower rate in children's services than other Australian children. They also have disadvantages evident in many worrying health statistics and other indicators which show that providing some extra support for multifunction services might make quite a big difference. In the minister's recently released <inline font-style="italic">Early childhood</inline> document that I referred to earlier, there are a lot of statistics about how Indigenous Australian children are faring in the 21st centuryâand they are pretty frightening statistics. I do not have time to go through them in detail, but I would just like to highlight a couple that show that much smaller numbers of Indigenous children are using child-care services compared with other children. For example, five per cent of Indigenous primary school aged children use outside school hours care compared to 23 per cent of the rest of the children in the community, and there are similar figures if we pick out different types of programs along the way.</para><para>The government should be really worried about these figures. Yet in its broadband review, which includes funding for specific Indigenous servicesâthe multifunction Aboriginal servicesâwe find that we have the same number of services that we had in 1987. We also find the same expenditure that we had in 1987; there has been no growth despite the growth in demand for those services. This is another one of the programs that is under pressure and that needs to be expanded. All that is going to happen is that it is going to be reviewed and they are going to be told that there is no extra money for them. I am very concerned about this review. I am concerned that we have another budget process coming up and there has been no indication from the government that there will be any extra money allocated to these programs. The programs are the key to dealing with at least two of the three major things that the government says it wants its child-care program to have: accessibility, affordability and quality. At least accessibility and quality are being compromised by the government's failure to seriously address the shortages in this program area. We fear that a broadband review is going to do nothing to ease those problems.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>12605</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>. Any talk about budgets obviously must include the various programs that this government has brought forward in relation to country Australia. I speak in particular of the Regional Solutions Program, a program that has helped to break down the cultural divide between major cities and my electorate of Parkes. Parkes is the largest electorate in New South Wales. It covers almost exactly one-third of New South Wales and takes in some of the most isolated towns and communities in the state, such as Wilcannia, White Cliffs, Tibooburra, Menindee and Tilpa. The people in these towns and communities have an enormous and generous community spirit and a fantastic ability to pull together to get the job done. In situations where they really need to, they come together and act accordingly. But sometimes they do need our help, and that is where the Regional Solutions Program steps in.</para></talk.start><para>The Regional Solutions Program bridges the tyranny of distance and it helps communities in my electorate to build their economic base and strengthen their social structure. The program identifies shortfalls and provides a financial framework for the community to fill those shortfalls. The Regional Solutions Program is not a luxury; in the electorate of Parkes it is an absolute necessity. It is an investment that we as a government must continue to make to ensure the survival and growth of our regional towns. I have been fortunate enough to see first-hand how regional solutions are working in many towns in my electorate. Over the past 10 years banks have closed their doors across country Australia at an alarming rate. Suddenly banks found that it was in their economic interest to close when they realised how much money they could save by cutting out face-to-face banking and by providing Internet and telephone banking services. Those services are great for the technically minded and for those who are up to date with modern communications, especially if they are in business. But for ordinary people with cash to deal with, for those who hate a recorded message or for those who are not up to speed with the dot com age, it has been a major blow. That is where the Rural Transaction Centres Program has stepped in. The federal government has committed up to $70 million from the sale of 10 per cent of Telstra to put services back and to introduce new services into smaller rural towns. The Rural Transaction Centres Program provides funds to help small communities establish their own RTCs to provide access to services. Each RTC is as individual and innovative as that town wants to make it. The types of services can vary enormously but they include financial, postal, phone, fax and Internet services; Medicare Easyclaim; Centrelink; facilities for visiting professionals; printing and secretarial services; tourism information; involvement in employment schemes; insurance and taxation information; and federal, state and local government services.</para><para>In my electorate alone rural transaction centres have been approved and set up in Peak Hill, Hillston and Tottenham, and recently one was approved in Lake Cargelligo. The government will provide assistance for the preparation of business plans for the towns of Wilcannia, Menindee, Ivanhoe and White Cliffs. This will enable identification of the services required by the communities and assess the feasibility of establishing a rural transaction centre in each of those towns. The government has given almost $400,000. With the inclusion of Lake Cargelligo in the last few weeks, that will be almost $600,000 to towns in my electorate to get rural transaction centres up and running.</para><para>The Regional Solutions Program is part of the federal government's significant effort to work with individual communities in regional Australia to tackle their most pressing needs; needs of people who have the will but not always the finances or the organisation to make things happen. In some towns this means pouring resources into finding solutions to stimulate the growth, development and potential that is already there. We gave $9,180 to the community of Tullamore last year to help them prepare a community development plan. The people of the town were sick and tired of watching services decline in the area so they got together and formed Tullamore Inc. The funding we gave them is helping them to prepare a social and economic development plan and a blueprint for development in the region. That is an example of where a simple allocation of $10,000 enabled a town of around 250 people to have the impetus to actually get up and develop a future for themselves. It does not always require huge funds to make country towns realise the potential that lies within them.</para><para>The people of Forbes felt they needed to provide a key facility for youth in the community. In this case, we gave them $218,000 to help them turn their local gym into a youth and community centre. The centre will provide assistance to increase youth and community development socially, economically, emotionally and physically. The Weddin Shire Council in Grenfell identified the need for an economic and community development officer. We were able to provide them with $110,000 and that will help them coordinate all economic development and a strategic plan. We provided the Bland Shire Council with $55,000 to establish a visitor information centre. The Cobar Mobile Children's Service was given $20,000 to allow them to more fully service both the Cobar township and the surrounding remote areas with a variety of children's services. It does not always require huge bucks to help communities. The mobile children's service works right around Australia, but for the more remote regions it provides the only lifeline that young children in those regions have to normal social interaction with others of their own age. More recently we gave Peak Hill $55,000 so that they can keep a doctor in their town. The community raised enough money to purchase a residence in the town to house a doctor's surgery, but they lacked the funds to undertake renovations to convert it into a surgery. That is where Regional Solutions stepped in. We gave the Broken Hill Community Inc. $206,000 to develop the neighbourhood centre for the community to incorporate functions of the traditional community. From personal experience, I know that Broken Hill have developed a myriad of communications and community issues that are run out of that centre.</para><para>I was deeply disappointed to hear that Senator John Cherry was critical of regional initiatives such as the Regional Solutions Program. His feeling was, as he claimed, that the Regional Solutions Program was being concentrated in wealthy areas and National Party electorates. I am not sure how far Mr Cherry has travelled, but my electorate is certainly far from wealthy. If he looked at the map he would realise the vast expanse of electorates, such as Gwydir and Parkes, and the genuine needs of people in places like Wilcannia, Wanaaring, Hillston and Tilpa. I think if he looked a bit harder then he would also realise that the five or six biggest electorates in Australia, including Lingiari, which is held by the Labor Party, are the ones which have got the most money. I have to say, at the same time, that anytime I am accused of rorting things on behalf of my electorate, what it proves to me is that I am doing my job and somebody else is not doing theirs. I cannot sing the praises of regional solution funding enough, nor can I paint a true picture of what it means to my electorate.</para><para>The examples I have given you only skim the surface. Aside from Regional Solutions, there are many other government programs working for rural Australia. Networking the Nation is working for rural Australia and helping to provide technology programs. The Regional Assistance Program is helping to create innovative job generation programs throughout Australia. Anybody who thinks that Networking the Nation has not done an incredible amount for rural Australia has never set foot out thereâof course it has. It has not only stabilised mobile phones right around Australia but created a phone system along highways and other ways that certainly never existed prior to this government coming to office. There are also the innovative job regeneration projects throughout Australia, and rural GP initiatives are bringing doctors to the bush and boosting health services. Finally, we are finding that we have got 25 per cent of country students entering medical schools instead of the eight per cent that were entering 10 years ago.</para><para>Regional Solutions and some of these other initiatives will come to an end next year. I hope the government will renew its commitment to those vital programs and reinstate our commitment to country Australia. Given an electorate such as mine, I have seen first-hand the difference regional issues are making to the communities they support. They give hope to struggling townsâand they are not all struggling. These towns simply need some help to look at some initiatives, to employ some people and to look at the possibilities that exist within them. They create a positive environment in which they can move forward, andâcertainly in my experienceâthat is what they have done. This is a government that has made an enormous commitment to regional Australia and has backed it up with serious money. It is a holistic approach to regional development, and really you cannot take any other. If we look at country New South Wales and Australia from the point of view of working together, doing everything together and trying to get a state government that will actually commit with us instead of trying to con funds out of us then we will certainly go a lot further forward a lot faster. Regional communities need our help. They deserve it; they are the backbone of Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>12608</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am pleased to be able to speak in this cognate debate on <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline> about the case for greater engagement with China. I have recently led a major delegation to China. One of the things that is extraordinary in visiting both Shanghai and Beijing is that no Australian figure looms larger in relations between China and Australia than Gough Whitlam. As we discovered in our visit, due to the visit of Gough Whitlam more than 30 years agoâwhen he led the Western world in establishing formal diplomatic ties with ChinaâGough Whitlam's name is still invoked at meetings. Every meeting we went to began with talk of the commitment of Whitlam. It gave the relationship with Australia an enormous amount of depth.</para></talk.start><para>One thing that Gough reminded me of before we left for the visit to China was that he had his birthday in Shanghai when he visited there in 1971 as opposition leader. The then Premier Chou En-Lai sent him a birthday cake to Shanghai to mark the occasion. As it happened, we had as part of our delegation the current member for Werriwa, Mark Latham. He also had his birthday while we were in China. Our Chinese hosts did present him with a very nice cake, but Mark is not quite there yetâit did not come from former Premier Zhu Rongji or current Premier Wen. Mark has a little way to go before he gets his cake from the Premier. Nevertheless, the thing that struck us most of all in this very significant visit to China was the massive transformation that has been under way in that country since Gough Whitlam's visit back in 1971.</para><para>The scale and the breakneck pace of development literally defies description. In Shanghai, four-deck expressways soar over the city streets. A MagLev train is being developed to take passengers back and forth to the airport. In Beijing, the roads, office towers, apartment blocks and stadiums seem to be sprouting up everywhere. It is estimated that up to 120 million peopleâabout six times the population of Australiaâhave moved from rural to urban areas in search of work.</para><para>In the 1980s, China set itself some very ambitious growth targets. By the year 2000, it wanted to have a gross domestic product of $US1 trillion, a target that it met. Now China aims to achieve a GDP of $US4 trillion by 2020. It is a staggering goal, one that is very hard to get your mind around, even for a country of 1.3 billion people. The determination of the Chinese government to achieve this goal should not be underestimated by any one of us. In pursuing this goal, the Chinese government is also aware of the enormous economic, social, political and environmental challenges that it faces in sustaining growth above seven per cent. But as my colleagues and I learned on our visit, China is also keenly aware of the need for international peace and stability if it is to achieve the level of economic growth that it wants. By any measure, China is already one of the most powerful and influential nations in our region and is emerging as a nation of truly global importance. It is already Australia's second largest merchandise export market after Japan; ahead of the United States if Hong Kong is included, as it should be. Last year, total trade between our two nations reached $19 billion.</para><para>China is also central to the maintenance of peace and security in our region. These issues could not be more significant than they are todayâthe day that the Australian government has committed us to war in Iraq. This issue of security and peace in our region is a very important part of why we went to China. Strong and cooperative relations between our two countries are vital to our national interests. Our leader, Simon Crean, certainly recognised this when, in his first international visit as opposition leader, he went to China for talks with Premier Zhu Rongji. He wanted to establish direct and personal links between Labor and the Chinese government in order to protect and promote the interests of Australia, in particular our jobs and our national security. Our trip just a few weeks ago certainly built on that successful trip of Simon Crean's and established direct dialogue with the new generation of Chinese leadership that has now emerged following the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Our delegation had high-level access to senior government officials and academics. We were very impressed with the frank and extensive discussions across a wide range of issues which, not surprisingly, covered regional and global security, human rights, China's move into the World Trade Organisation, developments in regional trade, opportunities to expand economic links between our two nations and employment and education.</para><para>From a distanceâfrom here in AustraliaâChina's economic growth seems inexorable and just plain remorseless, but the view from the Chinese leadership is of a far more complex and fragile process. They do feel an enormous responsibility for the future of 1.3 billion people. That is why their primary concern is for international peace and stability. They want peace because they know the future of the Chinese people depends on continued economic growth. Without peace, growth would be jeopardised, causing enormous economic, social and political problems for their country. That is why in relation to Iraq, the issue we are debating in our parliament today, China wants a peaceful resolution. They, like the Australian Labor Party, support disarming Saddam Hussein of his weapons of mass destruction and they believe, also like the Australian Labor Party, that the United Nations weapons inspectors should be given the time that they need to do their work properly.</para><para>During our visit concerns were also raised that, if a war were launched against Iraq, North Korea would be the next target. The Chinese government is, of course, acutely sensitive to threats to peace and stability within Asia. It wants North Korea to be a peaceful, stable, non-nuclear neighbour but it also understands the nature of North Korea's concerns for its own security. China is putting in a lot of effort behind the scenes to make sure that there is a peaceful resolution to the nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula. There remains in China a level of anxiety about Taiwan. It is a source of major security concern for the Chinese government and they continue to seek resolution of this issue through expanding economic ties and other exchanges.</para><para>The challenges and threats China faces to economic growth are not only external. They are well aware of the massive stresses and strains being placed on China's environment and infrastructure, as well as its social and government structures, by rapid economic development. The new leadership is concerned to address disparities between the booming eastern seaboard and provinces to the west and north and disparities between urban Chinese and the many hundreds of millions living in rural areas. The Chinese government sees continued economic development as crucial to sharing the benefits of growth, creating more jobs and boosting the standard of living, yet it is well aware of the high environmental and infrastructure costs that unrestrained growth could exact. The enormous demand on natural resources, the degradation of air and water quality and the wear and tear on infrastructure are all issues that the Chinese government understands must be addressed as part of its push for sustained economic development.</para><para>Australia can be a partner with China in meeting these challenges and helping its drive for economic growth. Though, to date, the bulk of our exports to China have been the raw materials that help to drive Chinese industryâiron ore, fuel and natural fibresâwe all know that Australia is much more than a quarry and we have much to offer the Chinese in our services and expertise. There are certainly many significant opportunities for Australian businesses in these areas. Many are already engaged in China, and we saw one example: the Macquarie Bank has been heavily involved in financing the construction of apartment complexes in Shanghai, and a very impressive development it is.</para><para>Australia also has much expertise in the areas of banking, finance, social welfare, regional development and the law that could be of use to China. The institutional and legal reform now being contemplated by the Chinese government is a monumental task. Australia can offer China our experience in the development and maintenance of a highly evolved legal system marked by the separation of powers between those who develop laws and those who enforce them. It is a system that serves to protect the rights of individuals in relation to the state. It is a system that is fundamental to the organisation of our own society. It is also central to the effective growth and operation of a market economy everywhere. A federal Labor government would certainly join in active dialogue on these issues with China and provide assistance to the Chinese government in helping to entrench the credible rule of law, including training and technical advice.</para><para>Discussions during our visit also included the very sensitive issue of human rights. Of course Labor's position on these issues is very well known both here in Australia and in China. For instance, we have consistently urged the Chinese government to give international human rights organisations, humanitarian groups and independent journalists access to Tibet. We certainly believe that by establishing and continuing a dialogue on human rights we can not only raise individual human rights cases but also contribute to the developing and strengthening of legal frameworks that protect and promote human rights in our region and beyond.</para><para>An area of great potential for Australia is in the export of education services. There is little doubt about the thirst of young Chinese for education and their commitment to learning. During my visit, I had the good fortune to visit Ren Min University, where I addressed a class of about 200 students, all in their early 20s. Of course, I spoke in English. Not surprisingly, perhaps in China, it was pretty incredible that the complex questions that were fired back at me by the students were also in faultless English. They asked me questions about the implications of globalisation and what Australia's reaction would be if North Korea launched an attack. These complex issues were canvassed in an extraordinary display of bilingual and intellectual capacity. It certainly shows the challenge for Australia's education system in developing the language skills of our young people. </para><para>This was not a capacity confined to Ren Min University. During my trip, we also visited the high school of the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. It is a vocational school of means much more modest than Ren Min. Its thousands of students are drawn from a wide variety of backgrounds but, once again, the openness and the enthusiasm of these people was very impressive. They were learning English and Japanese, and their outlook was decidedly international.</para><para>Of course, many Australian institutions are already exporting education services to China. In my own electorate, La Trobe University already does significant business in China. The Australian National University is developing joint higher degree programs in economics and public policy with some of China's top universities. There also exist opportunities for major Australian companies to enter into partnership arrangements with Chinese universities to train the technicians, managers, lawyers, accountants and other professionals that the country desperately needs. Our vocational education and training institutions could also do much to help China meet the massive demand that exists for skilled workers. The growth in services exports to China has been hampered by barriers, such as restrictions on the entry of foreigners into many service industries. That is why China's entry into the World Trade Organisation is of such significance. It will bring China directly into negotiations aimed at liberalising global trade in services so that Australians and others can participate in the growth and strengthening of the Chinese services sector.</para><para>A key point of the most recent visit was the chance to exchange ideas about the trading environment and economic development. On our side of politics, we strongly support the liberalisation of international trade and we have consistently backed China's entry into the World Trade Organisation. We are committed to improving relations between our two countries to make sure a more positive climate exists for Australian business. There is no question that government has a key role to play in smoothing the path for business, particularly when dealing with a highly regulated economy such as China's. This includes establishing and nurturing close personal relationships between national leaders, as well as fostering closer business ties and encouraging cultural and personal links, particularly through education. </para><para>Concerns have been raised about the impact the actions of the Howard government have had on Australia's economic and security relations with China and our region. It is the case that, under this government, there has been an increasing alignment of Australia with the United States at the expense of other interests, including those in our region. The Prime Minister's deputy sheriff act in the region in 1999 and his government's continuing pursuit of a free trade agreement with the United States have certainly fuelled perceptions of a progressive disengagement from Asia. This Howard government has been seen to have dragged in the welcome mat and put up the `too busy' sign to many of our Asian neighbours. Little wonder then that China is pushing ahead with negotiations on regional trade agreements that include members of ASEAN and ASEAN plus 3, but not Australia.</para><para>Labor believes Asia is integral to Australia's future security and prosperity. The region currently takes 55 per cent of our merchandise exports and is rapidly emerging as a major market for our services. We cannot afford to be locked out of negotiations involving some of our nearest neighbours and most important trading partners. That is why Labor is so committed to building and strengthening ties with China and the region. The China of today is a land of incredible challenges and amazing promise. Australia can and should be part of its future.</para><para>On behalf of the Labor Party, I want to extend to the Chinese government and the people of China our sympathies and concern over the terrible toll inflicted by the shocking earthquake that took place when we were there. I would also like to thank our Chinese hosts in Shanghai and Beijing for their hospitality and the senior Chinese government officials and academics who gave freely of their time and their thoughts in our discussions. Finally, I also want to say a particular thank you to Senator Peter Cook, who organised this delegation and made sure that it all worked, and to Professor Peter Drysdale, from the Australia-Japan Research Centre at the Australian National University, for his invaluable advice and support. I say again: we cannot afford to be locked out of negotiations involving some of our nearest neighbours. We must be involved in building and strengthening ties with China and the region. That is why we went to China. I would say to the government: do not drop the bundle, do not pull in the welcome mat. We need to be an active participant and an active trading partner in this region for our country's future and for our country's security.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>12612</page.no><name role="metadata">Sawford, Rod, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SAWFORD</name><name.id>3J4</name.id><electorate>Port Adelaide</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>. The week I wrote this speech recognised the seventh anniversary of the Howard-Costello government. That event ought to be marked by noting their greatest achievement: being the highest taxing government in the history of Australia. In fact, they recorded that achievement for seven years in a row without exception. That is some record. Australians have had only one tax cut in seven years. That came with the GST. We still have the GST, but the tax cut has long gone. The government have had a pretty soft ride, courtesy of a pretty-much compliant media, an indulged financial big end of town and an inherited economic dynamic, which was made more effective by the Reserve Bank Governor, Ian Macfarlane, who reduced interest rates when his predecessor, Bernie Fraser, failed.</para></talk.start><para>Nevertheless, when analysis is applied to the achievements of this government, it is a very narrow list. Three things stand out from those seven years: the response to the Port Arthur tragedy, which showed a stark contrast to six or seven years before when our Minister for Justice, Duncan Kerr, tried to get national gun laws through; the response to East Timor; and the nation building task of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway. They were all very positive and very clear. It is a pity that that discontinues with the current attitude of the government towards the situation and the disarmament of Iraq.</para><para>Mr Macfarlane is an interesting personality, and he is a stark contrast to people like Stan Wallis, Stan Howard, Ray Williams, Gary Toomey, Keith Lambert, Paul Batchelor, George Turnbull and Chris Cuffe, and the list goes on and on. The list of financial receivers of big handouts has been a veritable growth industry under this government. My grandfather had a saying that, if the CEO of a company was in the media, was a bit of a media tart, you should take your shares out of that company because you know that person is not doing their job. Mr Macfarlane, to his credit, appears to have got on with the job he was employed to do; albeit, he has been pretty generously served in the economic dynamic of falling interest rates, falling inflation and falling unemployment. You cannot do much wrong when that is happening.</para><para>However, that trinity which keeps governments in office and oppositions in apoplexy requires serious analysis. In every Australian city, suburb and region, millions of stories are not being told. They are not being told in the member for Grey's seat, nor are they being told in mine. They reflect negatively on the apparent impotence of this government when it comes to the formation of a future vision for this country. Buying a home has become harder under John Howard and Peter Costello. It now takes 8Â½ years of wages to buy an Australian home, which is an extra 27 months of wages compared to seven years ago. The proportion of Australians buying their first home compared to the total is now the second lowest on record. The average size of loans has increased by 67 per cent, while the average mortgage has risen from $104,000 in March 1996 to $170,000 in December 2002. Household debt has doubled in that period, with the average household now owing $82,000. Obviously, the synthesising of foreign debt doubling under this government from $180 billion to a figure approaching $360 billion is difficult to make meaningful at an individual family level. I note the media frenzy has not criticised the government on this issue.</para><para>Falling interest rates have benefited only a minority of Australians. Consumer debt on credit cards has sky-rocketed and blown out to record levels, at interest rates from 16 to 24 per centâthat is the real interest rate for the majority of Australian families. It is not 4.7 or 4.8 per cent; it is 16 to 24 per cent. The credit card debt of Australian families has trebled to $22 billion. In fact, Australian families are saving less and are paying record bank fees. Total bank fees have doubled since 1997. Australians can save only three cents in every dollar they earn.</para><para>Throughout the stewardship of the Howard-Costello government, there has been a massive shift of the nation's wealth to an already privileged, very small group of rich people. That is, of course, a very dangerous situation for any nation state, as has been shown throughout history over the last 2,000 years. In 410 AD, the Roman emperor Honorius was informed by his servant that King Alaric was in the north of Italy with 100,000 Visigoths, poised to invade Rome. Honorius was so confused that he thought the servant was talking about one of his prized poultry. That was his hobby; the emperor was a strange little fellow. Honorius did not appreciate that for years the emperors of Rome had increased taxation on Roman citizens for the benefit of an ever decreasing elite of very rich Romans. The emperor and his privileged group were taken aback when King Alaric and the Visigoths arrived and ordinary Romans refused to fight them; they had nothing to fight for.</para><para>Louis XIV, the King of France, was a little crazy, like Honorius with his poultry. He was not quite of the real world either; he spent far too much time with potted orange trees. They were not the only things about Louis XIV that were potty. Louis XIV and his predecessors had achieved exactly the same results as Honorius did in Rome. They transferred the wealth of the nation to fewer and fewer privileged people. As that folly marked the end of ancient empires like Greece, Egypt and Rome, it also doomed the reign of Louis XIV and his offspring. If you look at the reigns of some of the royalty in Hollandâthe Dutch, of course, were the originators of world capitalismâand the royalty in Portugal and Spain, you find similar stories. The point I make is that, notwithstanding how things change, some principles remain the same regardless of the millennium or century in which people live. The point is this: if you do not share the nation's wealth fairly among the majority of citizens, the fate of the nation will be determined as it was in the past.</para><para>Observation of city, suburban and regional Australia reveals many stories. Government would do well to listen to them for they do not reflect favourably on the status quo. We see it every day in our lives. For example, the rate of bulk-billing by GPs has decreased by 11 percentage points in the last seven years, and only 69.9 per cent of GP services are now bulk--billed. More than 10 million fewer GP visits were bulk-billed last year compared to the situation when John Howard came to office. In the seat of Port Adelaide, 87 per cent of our GPs bulk-bill, and you wonder how long they can keep going. They are under real pressure; they tell me so. Some of my constituents tell me how difficult it is to find a GP who bulk-bills. We now get people from the eastern suburbs, the wealthy suburbs, coming down to the doctors in my electorate. Some of our locals have found that they have had to keep those people out and refuse them service. You now have to book a GP, and it can take weeks to see anybody.</para><para>The average out-of-pocket cost to see a doctor who does not bulk-bill is now $12.78, which is a 55 per cent increase since the Howard government came to office in 1996. Take as an example the widespread begging by young and old on the streets of our capital cities. Is there anyone on the government side who would give credence to the idea that some of the begging could be avoided if we targeted funding to the needy and if that targeting of the needy were government policy? Let us examine the begging. I do not mean the professional begging that you see in Sydney and Melbourneâand sometimes in Adelaide, but very rarely. Look at the young mothers and the children begging on the city streets. Does anyone on the government side concede that just maybe that $3 billion subsidy for health insurance is aimed at the wrong group? Could it have been better targeted?</para><para>On the same theme, everyone in this House is aware of the billions of dollars being transferred from public to private education. By the false god of choice from the coalition has many a parent fallen. Take the example of two working parents on modest wages who, noting the bias of the government against public education, feel compelled to join the bandwagon of private education. Unfortunately for many parents, this not only results in a transfer of their funds but can result in good parenting being replaced by poor parenting or no parenting. It happens, and I have seen it happen more often than people would wish to admit.</para><para>Under this government, money buys you a degree and merit cannot guarantee you a place. In this country, merit cannot guarantee you a place in a university! The coalition has ripped out more than $5 billion from Australian universities. By 2003 there were 20,000 fewer fully funded places than in 1996. Student fees have jumped 85 per cent since 1996. Some students are now paying $100,000 for a degree. Take the single pensioner with no income other than the pension who pays, even with the rebate, up to $1,500 a yearâa sum they can ill affordâon health insurance. They do it. Many people in my electorate do it and they cannot afford it.</para><para>Under the coalition the Australian labour market has dived to an alarming rate of low-paid, low-skilled, part-time and insecure employment. In my state of South Australia 50 per cent of the labour market can be so described. Australia wide the figure is 40 per cent. There are 2.1 million Australians who are affected by underemployment and unemployment. In question time the other week the Prime Minister bragged that 1.3 million jobs had been created by the coalition in their seven years tenure. However, to my continued interjections of `How many full-time jobs?' the Prime Minister was decidedly silent. And so he should be. The quantum figure of 1.3 million jobs is misleading in the extreme, and the Prime Minister knows it. Almost all of those 1.3 million jobs are low-skilled, low-paid, part-time and insecure jobs in retail, hospitality, aged and child-care centres and call centres.</para><para>Where exactly are the full-time, high-skilled, highly paid jobs genuine Australian businesses have been screaming about for years? Where indeed is there any recognition on the government side of the significant skill shortages in the Australian labour market? And they are significant. If even for one moment you think that Australians are relaxed and comfortable, as promised by this Prime Minister, ignoring for a moment the serious international conflicts we face, then simply watch the behaviour of more and more Australians on Australian roads. Watch what happens at sporting events. Go for a walk in a deprived suburb. Listen to the anger in the voices of talkback radio participants. Talk to the people who have to deal with the victims of violence and child abuse. Read the letters to the editor pages. Ask yourself this question: are these the indicators of a relaxed, comfortable, inclusive and fair society? Go and visit an emergency admission centre at any public hospital and you will be shocked. It will illuminate things for you for all the wrong reasons. Observe, just for a moment, the abandonment of mentally ill people on the streets of our cities and suburbs. Take account of the fact that depression is now the second most prevalent disease in this country. Even a former right-wing extremist like former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett recognised that. It was too late, mind you, but he did at least recognise that and change his views. The evidence on Melbourne streets was overwhelming.</para><para>Take a look at the increasing failure to attend to transport, power and tourism infrastructure maintenance in this country. Will the former power failures in Auckland in 1998 be repeated in Australia? You bet they will. Will Australia ever get the right balance between road, rail and shipping transport? Not under this government. Take the classic example of the partisanship of the government and their intention to increase pharmaceutical charges by 30 per cent. The highest taxing government in the nation's history intends to tax the poor and the chronically ill even more than the unacceptable levels that they face today. Why do we pay benefits to take them away in taxation? The poor should not be paying taxation. It is just a ludicrous situation to take money away in the form of taxation and then try to give part of it back in terms of benefits. It is just a waste of time and a self-indulgent waste of energy. It is money that should be going to infrastructure.</para><para>The highest taxing government in Australian history has transferred, and continues to transfer, more and more of the nation's wealth to fewer and fewer of the privileged classes. That is true for health: there is a $2.5 billion health insurance rebate at the expense of public hospitals. That is true for education: we have billion-dollar subsidies for religious and ethnic private schools at the expense of public schools. It is out of control. That is true for transport. An exception of course is the Alice Springs-Darwin railway. The coalition has deliberately taken money away from health, education, training and transport and diminished potential job opportunitiesâfull-time, skilled jobs with high payâfor ordinary Australians.</para><para>The coalition has deliberately created a labour market dynamic that fails to reward the people who actually do the work in our society. Is that an extravagant statement? I do not think so. Have a look at the salaries and conditions of aged care workers and child-care workers. I thought a civilised society was one that looked after its aged and its children. What do we pay our aged care workers and child-care workers? Almost slave wage rates. What about the assembly line workers, teachers, nurses, policemen, policewomen, transport operators, retail and hospitality workers and call centre operators? They run the place; they do the workâand we pay them piddling wages. At the same time we recognise that credit card debt is mushrooming out of control as people in this country live beyond their means.</para><para>Note the increasing anger in our society: go to the schools, go to the workplace, go for a drive on the roads in any city, and look in our own homes. The state that ignores those warning signs is preparing the way for its long-term demise. Hundreds of thousands of people marching for reconciliation and against the war in Iraq are marching for more than just those two issues. Just as it happened in ancient Rome, ancient Greece, imperial France or Stalinist Russia, so it can happen in what is loosely termed Western democracies. When the real purpose of the state to advantage the majority of the citizens is ignored and when education, health and real job opportunities are limited to the privileged, the government can be seen as writing its own epitaphâbut it might also write the epitaph for our own country. </para><para>As Ross Gittins pointed out in a Monday <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> a couple of weeks ago, the government could set up a future vision for this country. I will repeat some of his major suggestions. We could set up an education and research endowment fundâthat is, take the future skill needs of this country seriously. We could break the impasse on salinity and water rights by compensating farmers in return for moving to a properly priced water regime. We could straighten out and speed up every rail freight track in the land. We could resume borrowings and start acquiring responsible debt. Of course Gittins means investing in worthwhile capital projectsânot wasting money on recurrent expenditure that disappears to privileged people around this countryâthat would deliver both short-term and long-term benefits stretching over the next 10, 20 and maybe even 60 years. It is perfectly responsible, even desirable, to finance them by borrowing. Ross Gittins sums up his article with the profound statement for all politicians:</para><quote><para>Just think of the political kudos to be had by the politician with the smarts to reinvent that principle. And the guyâ</para></quote><para>or the womanâ</para><quote><para>with the head start in pulling it off is the guyâ</para></quote><para>or the womanâ</para><quote><para>with the impeccable records of treating debt responsibly.</para></quote><para>That is the real message in his article. It is a message that ought to be listened to by government and opposition alike. It ought to be particularly listened to by state governments, who are notoriousâwhatever political persuasion they areâfor wasting money and failing to invest in a long-term future.</para><para>Has this Howard-Costello government got the political smarts to recognise and achieve a future vision? Its track record, I suggest, indicates otherwise. This message ought to be revisited by the Labor state governments throughout Australia, including my own in South Australia. Just prior to Christmas, the state Labor government in South Australia made a very welcome decision to commence the port expressway but, unlike what they said in their election promise, they failed to link it to the decision to build a road and rail bridge over the Port River to achieve what would be the best transport hub in Australia and perhaps one of the best in the world.</para><para>There are such things as responsible borrowings and good debt. It is time federal, state and local governments realised this important principle. Local government, too, do not do enough in terms of local spending on infrastructure. They ought to be spending 30 per cent of their budgets on infrastructureâas should the states and as should the federal governmentâbut they do not, and that is why we are in such a mess in this country. Australians deserve better than what they are currently getting from all forms of government, including the Howard-Costello government. But the real leadership, of course, does not come from state or local government; it comes from the federal government. What a pity it has all gone missing for the last seven years.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>12617</page.no><name role="metadata">Edwards, Graham, MP</name><name role="display">Mr EDWARDS</name><name.id>83R</name.id><electorate>Cowan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>. The Whitlam government determined in the mid-seventies that Australia should have its own gallantry award system in place. Commonsense should have dictated that conferring Australian awards equivalent to those originally recommended would have been the logical way to go. Incredibly, this issue was allowed to drag on for years. When the coalitionâto its credit, I might sayâfinally decided to bring the matter to a head, Mrs Bishop, the former Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, took the quite ludicrous step of refusing Australian gallantry awards to six diggers. At the same time, she conferred those same awards on officers. Her decision caused those six diggers to knock back her downgraded recommendations, and it led to the largest refusal of awards in Australia's history. Though the minister remained unrepentant, there was only ever one way to resolve this impasse: the six men would eventually have to receive the same gallantry awards as the officers. That is basically what happened. </para></talk.start><para>The decision to grant Australian awards close to 30 years after our involvement in Vietnam had finished was unusual in that it broke with the British practice of not allowing gallantry awards to be made past a predetermined date. In the history of imperial awards, however, there had been one notable exception to this. In 1907, King Edward VII, after being very much opposed to the idea, finally relented and allowed posthumous VCs to be awarded to six men who had been killed in campaigns in the latter half of the 19th century. Two of these awards related to actions as far back as the Indian mutiny of the 1850s. The war office was fearful that many next of kin would be encouraged to seek the upgrading of existing awardsâthe so-called shoals of applicants syndrome. The terms and conditions under which those posthumous VCs were granted ensured that no such rash rush of applicants eventuated.</para><para>What can we learn from this? First, a precedent was set when Australian gallantry awards were granted to replace imperial awards which should have been granted but were not. Second, the precedent set in 1907 and repeated in an Australian context showed that the passage of time need not necessarily inhibit the issue of awards, even in the case of the VC. Mr John Bradford of Adelaide is an authority on the administrative processes associated with posthumous awards from the turn of the 20th century onwards. He discovered a decision about the imperial POWs who were deemed to have been killed while making genuine attempts to escape. Quota constraints were not to apply to such awards, as was shown in the Stalag Luft 3 great escape, where 50 recaptured POWs were executed at the express order of Hitler. All, including five Australians, received posthumous recognition. Australian POWs who were killed in similar situations while serving in the European theatre of the war also received posthumous recognition.</para><para>However, the situation regarding our Far East POWs was not so clear-cut. It would seem that in 1946-47 Australian military authorities failed to process a great majority of recommendations for awards to Australian POWs who had suffered a similar fate. Lionel Wigmore's official history records that there were 27 prisoners of war executed for attempting to escapeâthe largest single execution occurring on 6 June 1942 at the Tavoy POW camp in Burma. Here, a group of eight POWs, all Victorians and all from the 2nd/4th Antitank Regiment, were recaptured a few days after escaping. In spite of spirited appeals on their behalf by senior officers, all were executed without trial. Forced to act as a witness to these executions, the camp's senior Australian officer, Brigadier A.L. Varley, noted, `The spirit of these eight men was wonderful. They all spoke cheerio and good luck messages to one another and never showed any sign of fearâa truly courageous end.'</para><para>Mr Bradford later located an Australian War Memorial file which listed 22 of the 27 men, including the eight from Tavoy, who were recommended for posthumous mentions in dispatches. Yet, of the 22 recommendations, only three mentions were subsequently confirmed in Commonwealth gazettes and, of these, two are listed as `live' rather than `posthumous'. John then contacted the Soldier Career Management Agency, where the service records of these men are held. They confirmed the awards were never made. John Bradford next approached Veterans' Affairs and suggested that these luckless men should have their service, devotion to duty and gallantry recognised by present day Australian awards. Furthermore, he argued that, since the administration of these awards had been entirely the responsibility of our military authorities, counterarguments based on conditions for imperial awards, end-of-war lists or quotas were largely irrelevant. </para><para>I believe the following to be a fair analogy. When the jungles to our north give up World War II dead, as they are prone to do on occasion, we proudly accord them the ceremony and honour that is their due. By doing so, we help to bring closure to the next of kin who remain. When our archives yield their secrets, should we not do the sameâparticularly when it is known that their next of kin were never informed of their loved ones being passed over for recognition? Yet today, while our government has a moral obligation and the means to bring closure to this unfinished business, sadly, it steadfastly refuses to do so.</para><para>In my time here, which is a relatively short time, I have seen moves which have had some bipartisan support to have VCs awardedâfor example, in the case of John Kirkpatrick Simpson of Gallipoli fame, and of course Teddy Sheean, who was a person championed in this House by the member for Braddon, Sid Sidebottom, who has spoken on these issues with some passion. I think it is very difficult for members of parliament to rectifyâas King Edward VII did a long time ago when he decreed that the six English soldiers should have their awards granted after some 50-plus yearsâwithout that regal authority what has really been an oversight or a miscarriage of justice.</para><para>But it seems to me that there needs to be a requirement or a capacity for us to have some mechanism to address those issues of unfairness as they come to light. I know there was a Second World War end-of-war list. I know there was a list initiated a long time after the Vietnam War had finished. Those end-of-war lists, to some degree, rectified the unfairness which occurredâand which always occursâin relation to the awarding of medals of gallantry. It seems to me that there needs to be some process through which members of parliament, if they are made aware of these situations, can refer them to some authority or some group of people which has a capacity to review these things. I am very keen to pursue thatâand indeed, in line with some of my colleagues, will pursue itâin an attempt to find some justice and to bring some closure to some of these issues. I greatly appreciate the dedication of Mr Bradford, who has put an immense amount of work into not just this issue but a number of other issues. I thank him for taking the time to make me aware. I thank him for the campaign he is currently running with various ministers and parliamentarians, who are seeking to get justice for these people despite the fact that it is so long ago.</para><para>I think it is timely that the member for Ballarat is in the chamber because I know that she has been approached by one of her constituents, a survivor of the Battle of Long Tan, who is one of many who have been very unfairly treated. A couple of days after the conclusion of that battleâand it was the biggest battle, I think, that Australian troops were involved in during our time in Vietnamâthe Vietnamese government of the day decided that they wanted to award some Vietnamese awards to some of the Australian soldiers who were involved in that battle, and to some of the Australian soldiers who showed incredible bravery. It was a very embarrassing situation for the Vietnamese authorities and for the troops involved because, just prior to the awards being granted, the then Australian ambassador stepped in on behalf of the government and prevented these very deserving awards being presented on the basis that the Vietnamese government had not sought or been granted the approval of Her Majesty the Queen of England. It was a very interesting situation: it was a war in which Australian troops were involved and in which British troops were not involved; yet, when the government of the country that we were in part serving wanted to recognise the valour of some of our diggers, it was prevented doing so by the Queen of England.</para><para>A commitment was made to those troops that approval would be sought by Australian authorities for those awards to go ahead and that they would later be granted. All of this is documented. I have seen a letter from a very high-ranking Vietnamese member of the government at the time which confirms that it was indeed the intention of the then South Vietnamese government to make those awards. The embarrassing thing, from the point of view of the Vietnamese, was that the troops were all on parade awaiting the awards. They had to dispatch a couple of runners to the local market to buy things such as Vietnamese dolls and cigar boxes, which were then brought back for presentation to the troops. This is unfinished business as far as I am concerned and it is unfinished business as far as the member for Ballarat is concerned, and we intend to pursue this issue.</para><para>As a matter of fairness and decency, I think the minister and the government of the day should accept that the intention was there, the proof is there, and these deserving Vietnam veterans should be granted the right to wear these Vietnamese decorations. They should be granted that right before Anzac Day so they can wear them when they parade with their mates this coming Anzac Day. I call on the minister to do this. I assure her that she will have the wholehearted support of our side of politics and it will be a gesture greatly appreciated by those members of D Company, 6th Battalion who would like to wear those awards. They feel very strongly about this, not because they want more ribbons on their chest but because they see it as a recognition of the sacrifices of their mates who were killed that day. They see it as a recognition of the courage of those Australian soldiers who did not survive. So it is unfinished business and I would call on the minister to address the issue. There is plenty of evidence there and there is a need to bring this matter to an end. If it is not done, I can assure the government that when we return to the Treasury benchâas we will in due course, because the political wheel turns, as it is turning nowâthose recognitions will be made. I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the member for Ballarat, a new member in this chamber, for the very wholehearted way in which she has made representation on behalf of her constituent and, in so doing, on behalf of all of those former members of the ADF who have been impacted on by this decision.</para><para>I was absolutely appalled to pick up the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline> on Sunday and read a banner headline, `Prisoners tortured'. I was further appalled when I then read on to the body of the article to find that members of the Special Air Service are being accused, via the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline> and via ABC journalist Liam Bartlett, of torturing Indonesian soldiers who were captured in East Timor. I find the article to be one which lacks credibility. I must say, for a journalist like Liam Bartlett, who has a lot of credibility and a big following in Western Australia, I am very disappointed in what I consider to be a piece of junkyard journalism. This article comes on the eve of the Australian troops being deployed to war in Iraq. It is an article and a piece of journalism which impacts on the very high standing that they have within the military nations of this world. I think it is a very unfair piece of journalism because it lacks any evidence at all. The interesting thing is that there were some matters that have been investigated by at least two authorities, one of them being the Australian Federal Police and the other the United Nations body which has responsibility for these matters. Both of those bodies found that there were no cases to answer. And there is an ongoing investigationâa very inept investigationâbeing conducted, under which a particular member of the SAS is being charged.</para><para>This person has had justice deniedâbecause justice delayed is justice deniedâfor some 2Â½ years. Not only does this article, in my view, breach what I would consider to be sub judice rules but it does not give this person, who is facing some charges and who I believe will ultimately be exonerated, a fair go. But most importantly it does not give those members of the Special Air Service who cannot speak for themselvesâsome because they are on deploymentâan opportunity to respond to this sort of stuff. I find it very unfair, and I wonder how much damage it does to the reputation of the Special Air Service and to the very fine reputation of the members of our Australian Defence Force. I wonder how much damage it might do to their wellbeing should they, in turn, ever have the unfortunate circumstance of being captured.</para><para>I call on this government to bring to a close this inept investigation carried out by incompetent people and to let the soldier who is facing these charges have his day in court. I do not know whether we can ask for anything more than that. Fairness and justice demand that this man should have his day in court, that this issue should be dealt with and that the SAS should be given the opportunity to clear their very good name. I want to reiterate my disappointment in this article by Liam Bartlett and the presentation of this article by the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline>.

Certainly I have a member in my electorate who stood on the parade ground and felt humiliated when he was handed a doll instead of the medal that he was expecting. I think the member for Cowan would acknowledge that it has been a problem that successive governments have not rectified, and I am certainly pleased to join with him in saying that, should we get into government, it will be rectified. I ask the government to look at giving some bipartisan support to dealing with this issue. Long Tan was a terrible battle, and people in our community still live with the scars of that battle today. Bill from my electorate does deserve the recognition and the medal that he expected to get as he stood on that hot parade ground and felt humiliated by his treatment on that day.</para></talk.start><para>Today, on the day when the Prime Minister has committed Australia to war, it is hard to focus on domestic issues. But, as I will have the opportunity to speak in the Houseâhopefully, tomorrowâon Iraq, I would like to try to focus today on domestic issues and, in particular, on families in my electorate of Ballarat. I want to focus on the failure of the government to recognise that families on middle to low incomes are vulnerable financially and that many of the government's own policies and decisions are making them increasingly so. While the government has been totally preoccupied about fighting a war on foreign soil, it has forgotten about the lives of ordinary families in my electorate. Under the seven years of this government, we have seen families experiencing increased taxation and families burdened with record levels of debt who increasingly live off credit cards. Under this government, we have also seen a loss of services. All of these factors mean that families in my electorate are more vulnerable to changes in interest rates, stock market prices, price rises and certainly job insecurity. The government has lost touch with the lives of ordinary wage-earning families. Never is this more evident than when it continues to turn a blind eye to the huge payouts being given to failed corporate executives while at the same time it punishes families by putting them into debt through its flawed family payments system.</para><para>The Prime Minister will tell you that things have never been better for what he likes to call the `mainstream'. He will tell you that under this government all the families on low and middle incomes are feeling relaxed and comfortable. The middle income earners of Bennelong, where the median weekly family income is almost double that of families in my electorate, may be feeling relaxed and comfortable, but I can tell you that in my electorate, where the median weekly family income is $700, people are fighting a much more fundamental battle: the battle for their family's survival.</para><para>I guess you could not expect much more of the Prime Minister, surrounded as he is by wealth and affluence. Ensconced in Kirribilli, sipping from his extensive wine collection, staff on hands and knees clipping the shag pile on the new carpet with nail scissors, glowing new curtains and carpet to the value of $65,000, watching the online $10,000 plasma TVânow returnedâeating in the Lodge from the new $16,000 Wedgwood dinner setting, swanning into the newly refurbished office in Phillip Street with its $3,500 sofa, $4,500 TV storage cabinet and $3,500 newspaper standâthat sure beats my magazine rack at homeâhow could you expect him to know? There is very little for families in my electorate to feel relaxed and comfortable about, given the financial pressure they are under.</para><para>The last seven years have been the seven highest-taxing years in Australia's history. There have been five occasions so far where income tax has been 17 per cent more than our GDP. Every one of those occasions has been under the stewardship of this government. Australians have had one tax cut in seven years but, as with all things with this government, you have got to watch what the other hand is doing. The tax cut was of course introduced alongside the biggest indirect tax we have seen, the GST. Combine this with a whole range of levies that have either been imposed directly or passed down through increased costs of consumer items: the dairy levy, the Ansett ticket tax, the Timor tax and the sugar levy. The sugar levy will have a direct impact on my electorate, with the two largest employers, Master Foods and McCains, now facing an unfair increase in one of their major inputs to productionâan increase that will of course be passed onto consumers but which also puts jobs in my electorate under pressure. I am sure I am not in the only electorate affected by this. I suspect that the member for Parramatta, with Coca-Cola in his electorate, shares my views on this unfair tax. Whilst the income tax the government introduced is well and truly long gone, we still have the GST and we still have the continued introduction of levies and surcharges that the government likes to pretend are not really taxes.</para><para>With the government having squandered the surplus in the 2001 election campaign, it seems its only solution now is to transfer the cost of what generally have been government responsibilities to individuals and families through introducing levies. Families are living under a record level of debt. Household debt has doubled; household debt in this country is over half a trillion dollars. We heard earlier this month that the household saving figures, for the first time, had gone into the negative. In Treasuryspeak, they say, `For the first time, Australian families have dissavings.' In ordinary language, families are spending more than they actually earn. Credit card debt has tripled to $22 billion under this government, with many families carrying several credit cards with over $2,000 limits on each. Mortgage repayments now take up more of the family budget than before. For many people who already own their own home, the housing market boom in Ballarat has been a real bonus, but for many young couples and low-income families trying to buy their first home the squeeze is certainly on. The average size of home loans has increased by 67 per cent, and monthly mortgage repayments chew up nearly 43 per cent of family income across Australia. In some capital cities, it has risen to as high as 54 per cent.</para><para>The government likes to hit out at the Labor Party when it talks about interest rates, but it does not like it when you point out that, given the proportion of incomes that people are now paying on their mortgages, even an interest rate of half a per cent will send many families broke. A half a per cent interest rate rise in today's circumstances would be the equivalent of a 13 to 14 per cent interest rate rise. They are not my figures; they are figures the National Australia Bank, when they visited my electorate, gave to me. The proportion of Australians buying their first home compared to the total is now dropping. For families and individuals who have paid off their mortgages, there have been benefits, but for low-income families and young couples trying to enter the housing market it is becoming increasingly difficult.</para><para>The government's flawed family payments system is also creating a debt trap for many families. Geraldine McDonald of Wendouree in my electorate contacted my office last year, having incurred a debt of almost $2,000. She had experienced redundancy under two employers during the course of the year and her husband's hours in the building industry were entirely unpredictable. She had informed Centrelink on each occasion that she thought her and her husband's income had varied but, under the government's own system, they were informed that they would now have a debt. The government's flawed family payments system is totally out of step with the earning patterns of Australian families, with families being hit with end-of-year debts if their income fluctuates, despite advising Centrelink immediately of the changes.</para><para>The government likes to talk about choice but in fact it has narrowed the choices available to many low- and middle-income families by creating the circumstances under which those families are put into increasing debt. In the context of all this, the government has been shifting the cost of services onto families and individuals. People are now paying for services that they previously did not pay for. We have seen an increase in premiums for private health insuranceâsomething the government said would decreaseâand in the cost of seeing a GP. Child-care costs are also increasing. Medicare is under pressure. The rate of bulk-billing has been decreasing in my electorate and now rests at only 57.1 per cent of GP servicesâ10 per cent lower than the national average and down from 65 per cent only two years ago. In every year since the election of the Howard government, bulk-billing rates have decreased. The average out-of-pocket cost to see a doctor who does not bulk-bill is now $12.78âup 55 per cent since the government was elected. For many families in my electorate, it is difficult to gain access to a general practitioner. General practitioners themselves are under enormous pressure as their waiting lists blow out and practices desperately try to recruit more doctors. We are about 15 short in Ballarat city itself. As a regional community, we get limited support to recruit doctors, and the pressure on my local doctors, particularly those who bulk-bill, is mounting.</para><para>The government's response to this has been that they never saw Medicare as including bulk-billing as a universal service, and they argue that it should not be seen as a universal service. On this, the government are simply wrong. Medicare is not solely about Australian health care agreements; it is also about the provision of general practice services. Most people see the Medicare levy as a contract between themselves and the government for the provision of bulk-billing. We have seen various reports about the possibility of the government means testing access to bulk-billing and, although the government say they will not do it, the reports continue to come out.</para><para>In the area of child care, it is increasingly difficult for families in my electorate both to access child care and to afford it. It is almost impossible to get accurate information on unmet demand in child care, as the government refuses to release data or advice from the state and territory planning and advisory committees. I managed to get hold of some of this from Victoria last year. This data pointed to a shortage of over 4,500 long day care child-care places in Victoriaâ60 full-time long day care places in my electorate alone.</para><para>Recently, our local newspaper, after doing a survey of all our child-care centres, estimated that there were well over 100 families on the various child-care waiting lists in the city of Ballarat alone. The figures, I would argue, are only the tip of the iceberg and not an accurate reflection of actual demand. So bad has the problem of trying to access child care in my electorate become that, prior to 7 a.m. every Monday morning, parents joint a queue outside the front of the occasional child-care centre to book occasional child-care places for the next week. To be fair, the centre also operates a phone queue in conjunction with the queue at the door. Sometimes it can take 45 minutes to reach the front of the queue either on the phone or at the door. The staff are doing the best they can but the reality is that there are just not enough child-care places for the demand. By the time they reach the end of the queue, many of the parents are told that the places and the times that they wanted are not available. Many of these parents work full time and, so that they can work, have to use occasional child care to make up one of the pieces of the patchwork of care for children in my electorate.</para><para>The government provides no assistance to regional communities such as mine to try to work through the problem. With no funding provided to assist local government in planning nor any eligibility for private provider incentive funding or disadvantaged area subsidies, we have had to resort to trying to fundraise from our local community and our local businessesâeven just to get access to data locally to try to attract a private provider into the area. The government has clearly abdicated its responsibilities for planning in child care, for collecting and developing data on unmet need and in ensuring that the quality of child care continues to improve. The government has washed its hands of any direct role in shaping children's careâcertainly in my electorate in Ballarat.</para><para>There are worrying times ahead for Australian families. Families in my electorate are extremely vulnerable to changes in circumstances. Many families no longer have a financial buffer to see them through if there are tough times. If there is a national problem, a personal problem such as serious illness or one of the kids getting sick, or a local problem such as a factory closure many of my families will not cope. After seven years of this government, families in my electorate are not relaxed and comfortable. They are increasingly under pressure.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>12624</page.no><name role="metadata">Irwin, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs IRWIN</name><name.id>83Z</name.id><electorate>Fowler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>, which represent the method of financing the government uses to adjust its expenditure following the framing of its budget. It makes adjustments for items which could not have been planned for in the budget for one reason or another. It reminds me of something I see almost every week at the local supermarket: mum takes the trolley full of groceries to the checkout and hopes that the final tally will come to less than she has in her purse; if it does notâand I see this all too oftenâshe has to offload any little treats or luxuries, and sometimes even essentials, so that she can make her expenditure fit her budget. Of course, the government does not have to do this. It does not have to suffer the embarrassment of being caught short at the checkout. The government does not have to worry about such things. It can pull a few tricks out of its hat to square the accounts. I note that the government claims it has made $167 million in savings. That, you might say, is what it took out of the supermarket trolley before it got to the checkout. But normally it does not have to worry. Unlike Oliver Twist, it can come back to the parliament, ask for more and not be refused.</para></talk.start><para>In considering these appropriation bills, we should look at the items the government has loaded into its shopping trolley since the budget last May. We should ask how they were overlooked in the first place and just how essential they really are. It is not a big list, but there are some interesting items in it. The parliamentary secretary tells us that these expenditures are essential and unavoidable. They total more than $1.45 billion, so it is not just a few minor items. The effect of the drought has led to some unexpected items, and these make up a large part of the total. So too does increased expenditure on security measures and the payouts to the victims of the Bali bombingsâall essential and unavoidable. But it is the largest item on the list which attracted my attention, not because it is lavish or wastefulâfar from itâbut because it is showing up in these appropriation bills. The item I refer to is $350 million for the rephasing from the 2001-02 budget period to 2002-03 of Australia's contribution to the 13th replenishment of the International Development Association and Australia's commitment to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiativeâthat is, $350 million in rephased expenditure.</para><para>I like that word `rephased'. It means, `We should have paid it last year but we didn't.' We are not given a reason why it was not paid. I can only assume that it was not paid because it is treated as a handout to poor countries and it is considered that they can afford to wait until we, the generous donors, are good and ready to pay them. I would like to be able to rephase some of my commitments. I am sure the electricity supplier would not mind waiting until next year for me to pay my bill; I am sure the local council would not mind if I paid the rates next year instead of now; and I am sure the bank would be happy if I rephased my mortgage repayments until next year as well. But governments can rephase. They can put off until next year what they do not pay now. Who misses out? Only those who might have got their payment earlier. In this case, the heavily indebted poor countries can just wait their turn. Their funding has been rephased.</para><para>The obvious reason for the payment being rephased is that the 13th replenishment under the International Development Association was not finalised until 1 July 2002, so the payment could not have been made in the 2001-02 budget. While we could hardly say that the government was dragging its heels with its payment, it does say something about the operation of the World Bank when it allows the process to drag along beyond what was originally expected.</para><para>I have taken a closer look at the programs funded under this item to see what might be the effect of delaying payments. The International Development Association is a member of the World Bank Group and provides the world's poorest countries with what it calls `credits'. These credits are loans at zero interest with a 10-year grace period and maturities of 35 to 40 years. As we can see from the figures in this bill, we are committing just $350 million as Australia's contribution to this replenishment of the International Development Association, as well as our contribution to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. When you look at it, that seems like a major contribution. The total for the replenishment is given as $US23 billion over three years of the cycle. Australia's contribution is roughly three per cent of the total pool of funds. When you look at the amount of $23 billion, it represents less than one-tenth of one per cent of the total of more than $US2.5 trillion owed by poor countries to the World Bank. So we should see it as a drop in the ocean in terms of its overall effect.</para><para>When we look at the record of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative so far the results are far from encouraging. The initiative was introduced in 1996, but with the requirement that to qualify for the assistance a country must have completed three years under a structural adjustment program. The initial funding started coming online in 1998. The structural adjustment program requires poor countries to follow a strict diet of economic measures prescribed by the World Bank. The program often leads to poor countries cutting spending on education, food subsidies and health care. Instead of investing in their future, poor countries are forced to pay back debts that just get bigger and bigger every day. It is not surprising that only a handful of countries have received end relief under the initiative. Countries such as Uganda received only $350 million but lost other debt relief assistance as a result. Uganda was regarded as one of the most promising countries to benefit from debt relief under the HIPC Initiative, but Uganda's experience does not hold out much hope for other countries whose debt position is even worse. Two years after reaching its completion point, Uganda has not been able to secure relief from all creditors. Uganda's debt stands at $1.6 billionâ$322 million more than expected under the HIPC Initiative. So here we have the best example even deeper in debt despite the HIPC Initiative.</para><para>Since its introduction in 1996, the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative has failed to lift the debt burden of the world's poorest countries. To give an example of the process, let us look at Ethiopia. Ethiopia is a country ravaged by years of war and drought. When Ethiopia reaches its completion point in June of this year, it will have received $1.3 billion in debt reliefâor 47 per cent of its total external debt. This is expected to reduce the ratio of debt to exports from 284 per cent to 150 per cent.</para><para>Ethiopia has the third lowest human development indicators in the world. Life expectancy there is 43 years. Despite reducing its debt of 47 per cent, the debt repayments remain high. Ethiopia is facing debt repayments of more than $100 million a year in the coming years, but its debt can only remain sustainable if it meets annual export growth of eight per cent a year. That is a hard task even for better placed economies. When you consider that its exports have grown at less than one per cent a year over the past decade, it is not hard to see that Ethiopia will not be able to sustain its debt repayments in the long term. We should not ignore the fact that Ethiopia is seeking new loans, including one for over a billion dollars to rebuild its war-ravaged economy.</para><para>It is clear that, despite programs such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, we are not likely to see a turnaround in the debt position of the world's poorest countries. At the same time, we are seeing an increase in the number of the world's population who are living in dire poverty. The debt burden of the world's poorest countries is the biggest single barrier to those countries improving the living standards of their people. It is a catch-22 situation: countries are poor because of the interest they pay on an outstanding debt, but they cannot improve their economic performance without taking on more debt. To make matters worse, poor countries must earn foreign exchange in hard currencies to pay off their debt. They need to produce commodities that have a world market, such as coffee, but the more coffee that is produced, the lower the price. So poor countries actually earn less and less hard currency to pay the interest on their loans.</para><para>While developed countries, including Australia, benefit from low commodity prices, subsistence farming is replaced by cash crops, which are subject to fluctuating markets. Drought, conflict and disease can mean that whole regions are left without money to buy food, and starvation is suffered in areas that were once self-sufficient in food production. Poor countries need to refinance loans, taking on new loans to service old ones. On top of this are the requirements of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for structural adjustment. These requirements have meant that poor countries spend less on education and health care, so they do not develop the capacity to improve their output. The ideology of the World Bank and the IMF would rival the worst excesses of Stalinist Russia and Mao's China in its impact on world populations. </para><para>However, there have been winners. Countries providing loans have been able to impose conditions where the funds can only be used for purchases from the lending nation. According to one source, over 80 per cent of foreign aid from the United States returns directly through its exports. The effect of this redistribution of the world's income was seen in the 1980s, when real wages declined by 60 per cent in Mexico, by 50 per cent in Argentina and by 70 per cent in Peru. As we have seen in country after country, they strip their resources to repay debts, but where are they now? Deeper and deeper in debt.</para><para>If we look for the causes of the problem, it is obvious that one basic economic rule has been broken. As anyone in business will tell you, it is okay to borrow as long as the money borrowed gives you a greater return than the interest paid on it, so the borrowed money should only be used on productive investments. However, countries have used borrowings for other purposes. While many of these should have been seen to be wasteful, many were taken on the advice of the World Bank. While the World Bank was happy to give that advice, or even insist that its advice be taken, when things went wrong it was the people of the indebted country that were left with the debt. The World Bank people were able to pack up their briefcases and set off to another country to wreak havoc on another unsuspecting population.</para><para>There were, of course, corrupt leaders who were able to appropriate large amounts of loan funds for themselves and send them to foreign banks. Those same funds could then be used by the banks to make further loans to poor countries. As long as a bank can make money on the transaction, there is no morality involved. Many countries have spent huge sums on arms suppliesâweapons to control their own populations and weapons purchased from rich, developed nations. When I look at this $350 million item in this bill, I see an amount that, were it to be spent here in Australia, could meet the needs of many worthy local programs. When compared to the $2.5 trillion in poor country debt, it is a drop in the ocean. That does not mean that we should stand back and say that we cannot help much so we should not help at all. </para><para>On my desk calender the other dayâand I love reading my desk calenderâwas a saying from Mother Teresa that said, `If you can't feed a hundred people, feed just one.' That is the least we should do, but I cannot help but ask if Australia should not be doing more. The problems of poor country indebtedness affect the greater part of the African continent, South America and, importantly for us, southern Asia. Our security is dependent on stability in our region, and that stability will come to depend on the economic conditions of our near neighbours. Being able to feed just one may not be good enough. This $350 million put towards the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative will make a difference to some individuals. But as far as solving the enormous problem of Third World debt, it is a matter of too little, too late.</para><para>Beyond the question of poor country debt, we should not overlook the status of the world's biggest debtor nation: the United States. We should not forget the business principle that I mentioned earlierâthat debt should be put to productive usesâand we should not forget that our debt may bring about our own difficulties at some future time. The greatest loss to poor indebted countries is their loss of control over their own destiny. Governments are forced to cut spending on health care and on education. They lose the ability to do what this bill is askingâto spend an extra $1.4 billion on some budget extras. Unless we see a way to deal with debt in both rich and poor countries, and the international monetary system that provides the backing for it, we may well find ourselves in the position of the mum I mentioned at the beginning of my speechâat the supermarket being told by the checkout operator to take out some of the luxuries like health care and education. But isn't that happening already?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>12627</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. </inline>With the budget approaching, the Minister for Finance and Administration announced that the starting point bottom line has been downgraded, although he was not specific about how far it has deteriorated. According to the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the starting point fiscal balance was a $3.4 billion surplus, the underlying cash balance was a $4.9 billion surplus and the headline cash balance was $4 billion. It is now some years since Australians have received a tax cut. According to Access Economics, bracket creep in the coming financial year, 2003-04, will produce an extra $3.5 billion of revenue. Had that $3.5 billion of bracket creep been returned to taxpayers, the starting point for this year's budget would have been a $100 million fiscal deficit, a $1.4 billion underlying cash surplus and a $500 million headline cash surplus.</para></talk.start><para>That is not a robust fiscal situation given that the economy has now been growing almost continuously since September 1991âfor more than 11 years. The causes of the deterioration in the budget starting point to which Senator Minchin referred are probably the slowing domestic economy and the cost of the war with Iraq. The government is being fairly circumspect about the cost of the war. All the Treasurer will say publicly is that it will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. I would be surprised if it were far short of $1 billion, even if the war is a short one. The first place that taxpayers are seeing this is at the petrol pump. Today they are paying, in all states except Queensland, over $1 a litre. In South Australia, $1.05 is not uncommon. This is the result of two things: the spike in world oil prices as a result of the threat of war in the Middle East and the strike affecting the Venezuelan oil industry, and the extra GST paid as petrol prices climb.</para><para>The government reaps a considerable financial benefit from petroleum resource rent tax on domestic oil production when oil prices climb. It is hard to be too precise about this since we cannot predict how much higher the world oil price will climb, but we can predict that it will climb. Labor has estimated that this financial year GST revenues will be up by about $220 million and PRRT revenues by $380 million to $410 million. Representatives of the oil majors tell me that the extra PRRT bill this year has already reached more than $200 million. At the moment we have no way of knowing how long the war will last and what will be the effect of its aftermath on oil prices. It is unlikely that the additional revenue from taxes on petrol will be sufficient to cover the cost of the war. If the war goes on for long, it is very unlikely to cover it.</para><para>The additional GST revenue is, of course, earmarked for the states, so it will reduce the amount of budget balancing assistance required this year and next financial year under the Commonwealth's agreements with the states on the GST. The total amount of budget balancing assistance that was expected to be required this financial year was $1,690 million and a further $1,061 million in 2003-04. All the additional revenue, both GST and PRRT, resulting from the oil price spike will therefore go to the Commonwealth. That is of little comfort to Australian motorists who have to pay it but it is of substantial benefit to the Treasurer as he struggles to balance his budget.</para><para>There is another factor that I expect will assist him to keep the budget in balance. During Australia's involvement in East Timor there was a fall-off in normal defence activity, particularly major training exercises, as resources were diverted to the deployment. The result was that normal defence expenditure was substantially reduced. With Australia now committed to its largest deployment since Vietnam, I would expect that to be the same this financial year and probably next financial year. While it is difficult to forecast the value of normal defence activity that will now not take place, this effect should reduce the pressure on the budget starting point and subsequent budget balance. Of more significance to the budget is how the world economy will fare over the next 12 months and how accurately Treasury can forecast it. The midyear review downgraded the growth forecast from 3Â¾ per cent to three per cent with a relatively strong bounce back to four per cent in 2003-04. In current international conditions, the question is whether that four per cent will be achieved. The other issue bearing heavily on the budget outlook is the deferral of the sale of the Commonwealth's majority interest in Telstra. The government has pretended that the falling stock price precipitated this decision because the Commonwealth would not be able to get fair value for its interest in current market conditions. I suspect that the low stock price was fortuitous in this regard and allowed the government to not have to confront the National Party on the issue, despite the effort it had gone to in running the Estens inquiry last year.</para><para>The Prime Minister, despite his protestations that he is always ready to take unpopular decisions, may also have taken into account the likely proximity of the sale timetable to possible federal election dates and decided that would create an uncomfortable conjunction of events. The deferral also provided the Treasurer with a convenient excuse to escape a rather foolish course of action that he had previously been boasting about: his plan to reduce the value of Commonwealth government securities on issue to zero to close the bond market. He had issued a discussion paper on the subject with a challenge to the bond market to justify, if it could, its continued existence. There was some debate about this in the opinion columns of some major daily newspapers and some circulation of responses to the discussion paper, but the whole thing came to a head at a seminar at ANU a few weeks ago. The discussion paper got an icy reception from academics, commentators, ex-senior bureaucrats and the financial markets.</para><para>The arguments put by most of this learned group against closing the bond market were many. The most important of these was that without a risk-free benchmark the finance markets would be less efficient and the cost of capital in Australia would be higher. Those bond market traders who were present made the quite reasonable point that the market did not just have to be maintained; it had to be kept liquid to ensure price discovery and so that participants could trade freely. Another substantial point was that however good the Treasurer thinks he isâand some of us do not think he understands what he is doing or he would not have proposed getting rid of the bond market in the first placeâhe has not brought an end to the economic cycle. A future recession or war, a very relevant point on this day of all days, could well force the Australian government to borrow money. It was widely felt that the Treasurer's primary motivation for the `get rid of the Bond market' plan was so that he could make a political point that he had paid off all previous governments' debts. There was, in fact, general criticism of the government's `all debt is bad' mantra. Some particularly distinguished seminar participants even had the temerity to suggest that public debt is a useful and equitable way of sharing the cost of long-lived public assets across the generations.</para><para>One of the principals of Access Economics, who had apparently spent 17 years in TreasuryâChessell, I think, was his nameâregaled the seminar with a fairytale about the outrageous terms on which the Howard government had sold just about every public building except Kirribilli, the Lodge and Parliament House. The story was that the good fairy at the department of finance went to the property market and offered it three wishes if it would buy the buildings. The property market asked for very long leases with guaranteed tenancies, an extremely generous price escalation clause and another three wishes. The good fairy at the department of finance granted these three wishes, the subsequent three wishes and the three wishes after that. Despite the fact that I am the person who originally told the Auditor-General that he should look at this financial disaster, I am not going to steal all of Chessell's fairytale. I just want to point out that he missed one of the wishes that the department of finance granted: a lavish refurbishment of its own building before it was sold.</para><para>The policy point of Chessell's fairytale was that the reason the good fairy at the finance department had granted all the property market's wishes was that it would get the best price for the assets and be able to pay off more government debt. What the good fairy did not seem to care about was that the taxpayer was stuck with paying the huge escalation clauses on the leases, which made the Commonwealth worse off in the long run. This is an appropriate place to make the point that the Howard government has performed a pea and thimble trick with debt reduction. It will, by the end of this financial year, have reduced net government debt by some $61.7 billion, but it has sold $55.4 billion of assets to do so.

COX</name></talker><para>âThis demonstrates that the Howard government's debt reduction program has largely been an exercise in shifting assets around on its balance sheet to make it look like it is fiscally responsible. It has been an exchange of assets for debt rather than any serious attempt to control its own expenditure. Some of the participants at the bond market seminar canvassed the options for maintaining a liquid bond market by putting any cash from the sale of Telstra or any future budget surpluses into an asset fund. The most obvious possibility mentioned was a fund to cover the Commonwealth's roughly $80 billion in unfunded superannuation liabilities, which it carries on behalf of its own current and former employees. As a superannuation fund run by trustees, the assets would be out of the reach of politicians who might dissipate them capriciously.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The seminar eventually got to the point of discussing how the Treasurer could extricate himself from his own terrible idea. Reports of the seminar must have so shocked him that he made a brief appearance on talkback radio and announced to an obviously breathless audienceâwho would not ask him any difficult technical questionsâthat, because of the deferral of the Telstra sale, closing the bond market was no longer an issue. A few days later an article appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review </inline>quoting the Treasurer saying that he would keep the bond market liquid, with no explanation of how. We look forward to some further clarification on the relevant policy issues at some time in the future. I am pleased that the Treasurer has taken this decision. I hope he has not been encouraged to do so because he is about to move the budget into deficit.</para><para>The big question about the up-coming budget is whether the Treasurer is going to bite the bullet and exercise some real financial control. We see each year an outlook for prospective surpluses that look quite healthy, but every year as we approach those surpluses we find that they have been spent. At the end of last year, on 2 December, the Prime Minister was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> saying:</para><quote><para>When you have a low level of government debt and you have a surplus, there comes a time when people might want some of the surplus returned by way of general or specific tax cuts.</para><para>I'm not making any promises in any particular areas, I'm just stating the principle that if you've got a bit left over the automatic assumption shouldn't be, `Oh whacko, we'll spend it.'</para><para>The assumption rather should be that we should find some capacity to give it back to the people who own it, and that's the taxpayer.</para></quote><para>It is going to be a very interesting budget this year. Access Economics calculations of fiscal drag or bracket creep were $2.3 billion in the financial year we are now in, $3.5 million in the financial year we are about to go into, $5 billion in 2004-05 and $6.2 billion in 2005-06. This government has only provided one set of tax cuts, and they were tax cuts that accompanied the introduction of the GST. The previous government provided tax cuts on $7 billion, more than returning to taxpayers the proceeds of bracket creep. We have a government now that is running a budget that flies very close to the fiscal wind.</para><para>The Treasurer has abandoned using the fiscal balance which was originally his preferred measure of the budget bottom line and has gone to the underlying cash balance. If you take out Access Economics estimates of bracket creep, you will find that the budget this year would be in deficit by about $200 million, that the prospective starting point before the Iraq war is taken into account would be about a $1.4 billion surplus and that the prospective deficits in the out years would be about $800 million. We are looking at a situation where the government is going to have to get disciplined if it is to preserve enough of the surplus to give anybody any kind of a meaningful tax cut. The opposition has started taking a lot of decisions on government measures in tax bills, with a mind to preserving the budget surplus so that the government can in fact continue to have the opportunity to provide tax cuts.</para><para>This budget is going to require a very disciplined approach by the Treasurerâa disciplined approach that he has not exhibited since his first budget in 1996. Every year since then, he has made policy decisions that have added to outlays. On each occasion in an election year, he has made policy decisions that, over the forward estimates period, would reduce the budget bottom line by $20 billion. In the non-election calendar years apart from 1996, there have been significant policy decisions which have had a detrimental effect on the budget bottom line. If he wants to preserve the possibility of providing tax cuts, he is going to have to get back to some serious fiscal discipline. I do not believe that he will, but we will be watching him very closely and we will be encouraging him to put some priority on making sure that there is tax relief available for ordinary taxpayers in Australia, because they certainly need it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>12631</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>. It is a broad-ranging debate, and I am going to address my remarks particularly to education and training in the electorate of McMillan. Just before I do that, I want to place on the record my admiration for Federation Health. Federation Health is a not-for-profit health insurance fund which started in the Latrobe Valley, operates primarily in the Latrobe Valley and across the Gippsland region and has expanded to provide services in private health insurance right across Victoria and Australia. It was originally formed as a working man's health insurance society and has a very proud history of helping people in difficult circumstances and of helping people to come together and cooperate to form an organisation.</para></talk.start><para>My mum and dad were both long-time members of the precursor body, the Yallourn Medical and Hospital Society, and it is a matter of public record that I am a member of Federation Health and continue that long family association with this great, local, not-for-profit insurance fund. As a member of Federation Health, I got a letter in the mail a week or so ago in relation to a scheme they had put in place to assist those people who either contributed to fighting the bushfires in East Gippsland or were affected by the fires in East Gippsland. They described the fighting of the bushfires in East Gippsland as `a great example of genuine, unselfish mateship', and it certainly was that. They put in place a bushfire assistance package for members of Federation Health who were direct victims of the bushfires or who volunteered their services to assist communities affected by these bushfires.</para><para>This is a great example of why the not-for-profit sector should be encouraged to take a bigger role in private health insurance; this is exactly the type of activity you do not see from the big private health insurance funds. They are not linked into local communities in the same way that Federation Health are and they do not have the same regard for what happens to communities when they are affected by a natural disasterâin this case bushfires. Well done to Federation Health. In particular, I want to pay tribute to Stewart Cramer, the Chief Executive of Federation Health. I have known Stewart for many years now and have a great personal regard for him as a man of integrity, as a man who conducts himself always with a great deal of dignity and as a man who is always interested in helping our local community. Well done to Federation Health. They should be proud of what they have done here. As the local member for the district in which most of the Federation Health members live, I am very proud to have such a community minded private health insurance fund in my electorate.</para><para>I will now bring my remarks around to education and training, which is an issue of critical importance in my electorate. You have some familiarity with my electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a fellow Victorian. You would know that the people of Gippsland have gone through a difficult period which has involved a lot of restructuring and a lot of reorientation of a number of our industries, which has meant that a lot of people have lost their jobs. For a lot of communities that have traditionally been able to depend on one particular area of industry for their employment, those jobs just are not there any more. We understood that the way to deal with some of these structural issues in terms of our local economy was for us to focus on education and training for our population. The people of the Gippsland region, whether they were in West Gippsland, the Latrobe Valley or South Gippsland, got behind this idea and did not just carp, whinge and talk about the old days and pretend that we could go back to those days if we just tried hard enough. People understood that we needed to focus on education and training and that this was our future.</para><para>To that end, I brought the entire shadow cabinet to Monash University's Gippsland campus in Churchill, where we met with a great proportion of the senior academic and administrative staff from that campus. It was a very positive day and there was a great exchange of ideas. We heard first-hand from the people at Monash University, Gippsland, of the importance of the work that they are doing. We were also given a lot of examples of the effect of that work that they are doing in our community. I know that Simon Crean, the Leader of the Opposition, and Jenny Macklin, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, were both very impressed by what they saw at Monash University's Gippsland campus. The reason that I brought them to the Gippsland campus of Monash UniversityâI said this at the time, and I do not mind repeating it in this placeâis that our university is not just a part of our future; it is nearly all of our future in the Gippsland region. It is not just the university courses which are on offer; it is the people who are employed in the university who can be a part of the economic and cultural renewal of the entire region.</para><para>Regions are at their best when there are new people coming in. There is no doubt about that at all. Post World War II, when we had a flood of new migrants come into the Latrobe Valley, the district changed forever. Places like Pakenham, in the western part of my electorate, are at their best right now. Pakenham is going through an economic and cultural renewal because of all of the new people coming in. All of these new people, all of these new ideas and new ways of doing things, and having to set your community up in a different way to service that, places stresses on communities, but it is always an exciting time. It is always a time of dynamism and new ideas. Our university can be a real centre for dynamism. It can be a real centre for new ideas. It can be a real centre for the new people which drive both of those things.</para><para>Because of the nature of university staff, you tend to have a lot of people who come to your region and stay there for a little while and then maybe move on. Some of your people might move to another campus and then come back. The moving around of people is an important part of regions not just taking the view that we need to keep everyone in our region but taking a bigger, more realistic view about bringing people into our region and not being afraid when people leave our region, hoping that they will come back when they are ready to and keeping the door open for people to do that.</para><para>It is with a great deal of regret that I advise the parliament of a decision made by Monash Universityânot by its Gippsland campus but by the Monash University Council, administered from the Clayton campusâto close the Gippsland School of Engineering. The Gippsland School of Engineering has a long and proud history. It has trained a lot of first-class engineers who went on to hold very senior positions, not just in Victoria but right across Australia and overseas. These people have played a key role in engineering, and it is a real tribute to the professionalism of the education they got when they were at the Gippsland School of Engineering that they were able to rise to the senior positions that they hold in engineering in Australia.</para><para>There has been a lot of debate in the Latrobe Valley community in particular, and in the Gippsland community more generally, about what the closure of the Gippsland School of Engineering means. I vigorously opposed the decision and campaigned against it. I spoke to the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, on this issue, and he also felt strongly about this issue as someone who is very familiar with the Gippsland region. In the days when he was a minister in the Keating government and subsequently in all the roles he held in opposition, leading to his becoming the Leader of the Opposition, he was always actively involved with the Gippsland community. He wrote to the Vice-Chancellor of Monash University, who at that time was Professor Peter Darvall, and made plain the federal opposition's position on this. The position is simple: we disagree with it. We do not think that it is a decision which can lead to a good outcome for Monash University or for the people of Gippsland.</para><para>Subsequently, following a public meeting and a lot of public outcry about this, Monash University Council advised us all that they were going to review the decision they had made. I wrote to the people organising the review and detailed my opposition to the proposed closure of the Gippsland School of Engineering at the Churchill campus. I pointed out in very plain terms how bitterly disappointed I was with the decision that was made and the way in which they had gone about making it. Those in the Gippsland region felt that it was a slap in our face, that we had given a lot to Monash University and that in return we were being treated with contempt by the Monash University administration.</para><para>I understand that that review panel is still doing its work. I wish to use the forum of the federal parliament to repeat the message I gave to Monash University at the public meeting about this that was organised at Monash University and, subsequently, when I appeared personally before the review panel: shutting the Gippsland School of Engineering would be a massive mistake by Monash University. Any possible small financial benefit they might get from doing it would be massively outweighed by the enormous loss of community support that would follow. A serious risk to Monash University's ongoing funding is the likely result of the university going down this path of reducing and withdrawing services from the Gippsland campus.</para><para>Let me make it plain: if Monash University thinks that I am going to support a funding model in which it gets all the money from the federal government directly at its central campus at Clayton and is then able to make, with complete autonomy, decisions which will affect the Gippsland campus detrimentally, it has another think coming. I will not support Monash University getting essentially a blank cheque from the federal government so that it can then decide what funding the Gippsland campus needs.</para><para>If Monash University proves itself not to be trusted with deciding how much funding goes to the Gippsland campus to provide a decent range of university courses to the Gippsland community, I will not support it being allowed to get that funding directly and make the decision in a centralised way. Monash University needs to understand that this is a very serious matter. What is at risk here for the university is not just the Gippsland School of Engineering, from which they are hoping to save a few thousand dollars a year by closing, but the entire way in which it administers its campuses.</para><para>I am just one voice, one person, in the opposition. But let me tell you, if Monash University closes the Gippsland School of Engineering, I will campaign and I will work as hard as I can to try and get the opposition to take another position. If Monash University proves itself not to be trusted to deliver proper university courses in partnership with, and in meeting the needs of, the local community then I will argue for another position. I will work to get a position which says that, where university campuses are linked to major universities not located in regions, we look at another model of delivering university services to people who live in regional Australia. That might mean a contracting model, where the federal government would then say, `Monash University, you have got a campus in Gippsland so we will pay you an amount of money to deliver the following range of courses to the Gippsland community.' Monash University would not then have the autonomy to decide whatever they wanted for the Gippsland campus, but the federal government might have a direct role in contracting with Monash University to provide those services. So Monash University should not be under any illusion about how big a deal this is to me and how big a deal this is to the Gippsland community.</para><para>There have been a number of very good submissions made to the review panelâin particular, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union made an excellent submission which runs to some eight or nine pages. The submission talks about the importance of engineering to Gippsland and how critical having an engineering school is to our region, to our regional economy, and the implications it has for jobs if Monash University get their way and shut the Gippsland School of Engineering. There have been a number of other excellent submissions made to that review as well and there is not enough time allotted to this debate for me to deal with all of those today.</para><para>It seems to meâand it seems to all of the Gippsland communityâthat the decision that Monash University has taken in relation to the Gippsland School of Engineering is incredibly short sighted. As a Victorian, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that the state government has just gone through the brown coal tender process. We have got a lot of brown coal in the Latrobe Valley and it has been a big part of the development of the Latrobe Valley for more than 50 years. The brown coal tender process has seen a number of companies successfully tender to be given the rights to explore mining leases in and around the Latrobe Valley, with a view to substantial large development associated with the exploitation of that coal resource. These are very big projects. One project that I could think of would be in the order of between $6 billion and $8 billion. Another projectâwhich the state and federal governments just contributed some money toâis the Latrobe magnesium project, which would run to nearly $1 billion. There are several other projects that are of that similar size and scale and would involve the employment of literally thousands of engineers in the Gippsland region. So what we need Monash University to do is not make short-sighted decisions, but to make decisions which are in the interests of not just Monash University but also of the Gippsland region.</para><para>Imagine our having a number of these projects going on in the La Trobe Valley, with a demand for full-time engineers employed at good salaries in senior positions. We could with reasonable knowledge predict that we would need to employ several hundred of these people in maybe four, five, six or seven years time. We could sit down and work in partnership with Monash University and train a lot of those people in the La Trobe Valley. What a great boon for regional education that would be. This is an important issue to our community. It is about the relationship which we in the Gippsland region have with Monash University. We want that relationship to be a positive one, but we are not going to allow ourselves to be treated shabbily by Monash University. We will not take it. We will fight it, we will resist it, and we will do everything we can to make sure that local students are able to access engineering as an option when it comes to higher education in our district. I would urge Monash University to change their mind in relation to this, and I hope that the review panel comes to see that the decision that was made was the wrong one.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>12635</page.no><name role="metadata">Corcoran, Ann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms CORCORAN</name><name.id>009CW</name.id><electorate>Isaacs</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak in the debate on <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>. Today we have been distracted by the events surrounding Iraq, and it is a little strange to speak about anything else. I will have a chance to speak about Iraq tomorrow, so tonight I will focus on matters much closer to home. I am talking about the welfare of families and individuals in Isaacs. I see us all as being under more and more pressure as the direct result of actions and inactions by this government.</para></talk.start><para>The pressure is coming from less money available to meet everyday costs and a decrease in the services that we expect from the government. This government is the highest taxing government on record. We have had one tax cut since Howard came to government, and that was when the GST was introduced. The benefit of that cut has now been more than wiped out, and we still have the GST. Real work opportunities are diminishing under this government. We hear constantly of full-time jobs being lost and replaced with part-time or casual jobs. This does nothing for the peace of mind and financial security of ordinary families in my electorate. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, about a quarter of Australians who are in work have part-time or casual jobs and over 600,000 of these people would like full-time work. As a result of this, more and more families are going into debt just to survive. Household debt has doubled over the last seven years, with the average household now owing $82,000. Credit card debt has tripled. Then we add the dreaded family tax benefit debt to the gloomy picture. The family tax benefit system is a mess and must be addressed with some urgency. The mess is because of the inadequacy of the system to recognise how real people live. The result is a continuous and increasing burden on Centrelink clients and a reduction in the benefit the system is supposed to bring. The family tax benefits system is supposed to assist low-income families. However, the current system puts many hurdles in the way. This is something that I and most of us on this side of the House have been saying for quite some time, but it is now being said by the Ombudsman. When will this government take some notice and fix the systemâor is it that they just do not care?</para><para>The first hurdle is the madness of requiring a family to accurately estimate its income a year in advance and which member will earn it. Do the architects of this rule, or those who insist on it, understand that most families cannot know with any certainty what lies ahead of them? Families do not have a crystal ball. Circumstances change: people get promoted, work overtime, change jobs, lose jobs, find jobs, partners start working when a job comes along or the kids are at school, a partner loses his or her job or the family needs more money. As soon as a family's income changes, so too does that family's entitlement to family tax benefit. This is not unreasonable, but the rules of the system insist that these changes be backdated to the beginning of the financial year, and this is where the troubles start.</para><para>We know that across Australia about one million families are not getting the correct payment. We know that 700,000 families ended up with a family tax benefit debt last year of an average of $850. At the other end of the scale, we know that about a quarter of a million families are being denied their top-up payment because for one reason or another they did not lodge their tax return on time. We have a situation where the government moves fast enough to recoup the overpayments but is not so forthcoming when it comes to paying out what it owes. We are not talking about pin money here; we are talking about families who are not high income earners. We are talking about families who need this money to provide shelter, food and education for their children and themselves.</para><para>Let me give two examples of families in my electorate who have battled this system. These examples are from files of my constituents, but these stories are retold on a daily basis in other families. Mariaânot her real nameâhad her first baby in December and worked up to her child's birth. She did not apply for the FTB in that year because she had received a salary for six months. In the following July, Maria applied for the FTB on the basis that she would not have any income in that financial year as she was not planning to go back to work. The following January, Maria was pregnant again and looking forward to her second child. Unfortunately, the family had meanwhile clocked up a debt on their credit card and that was worrying Maria. She decided to go back to work part time for a few months to get rid of the credit card debt before her baby was born. Maria found a job and immediately advised Centrelink of her change in expected income. Maria was told on the spot that she was in debt because of the retrospective of the FTB system. Maria was dismayed and upset. She was returning to work to pay off the credit card debt and was now in debt to Centrelink. When faced with this, the minister advises families to overestimate their income to avoid getting into debt with Centrelink.</para><para>Another constituent of mine, Louiseâagain, not her real nameâtook that advice. Her family had incurred a Centrelink debt in the previous year and they were concerned about this happening again. Louise and her husband advised Centrelink of a new estimate of their incomeâan estimate above their real expectations. The crunch came when Louise went to buy medicines for their son and discovered that their new income had led to the loss of the health care card. Even when this family's entitlement to the family tax benefit is adjusted at the end of the financial year, they will not recover the extra they have paid on their son's medicines.</para><para>A third family in my electorate of Isaacs discovered a variation of this problem. In July 2001, Mr B became very sick and had to stop work. Up until that point the family had been relying on his income alone and Mrs B was in receipt of FTB part B. Mr and Mrs B went to Centrelink to see what assistance they could get in their changed circumstances. Mr B was put on a disability pension and Mrs B went on to a carer's allowance. Mr and Mrs B then set about adjusting to the big changes in their lives: the deteriorating health of Mr B and the change in their financial circumstances. Some 10 months later, in May 2002, Centrelink wrote to the family stating that the payments they were receiving were based on an estimate of the family's income of $33,000 for Mr B and nil for Mrs B. Mrs B rang Centrelink immediately. She was understandably mystified about how Centrelink could get this estimate so wrong given that the family's incomeâthat is, a disability pension and a carer's allowanceâis actually paid through Centrelink.</para><para>Centrelink then advised Mrs B that because she had been paid the family tax benefit part B since July 2001, and was not entitled to it because of her carer's allowance, the family would have its income cut with the withdrawal of that payment. A few months later Mrs B received a notice stating that the family owed Centrelink over $1,600âthe overpayment of family tax benefit part B. Mr and Mrs B are now facing a third cut in their income as their payments are reduced by the repayments of that overpayment. We are talking about a family that is struggling to exist with a disability pension and a carer's allowance, with a sick father and husband needing constant medical care and who are struggling to meet all of the costs, both financial and emotional, that go with all of this. Mrs B asks how Centrelink can get this so wrong. It is a very good question. We are not getting any good answers.</para><para>My question is: how can we have a system that is so insensitive and inappropriate in how it looks after families and people in need of assistance? Not only does the system not work but it adds strains and tensions to the lives of its clients. We have a social security system that is supposed to assist those on low incomes, but it does not work. To add insult to injury, these families and others in the community are being asked to cope with a Medicare system that is creaking to a standstill. Again, all the signs are that the government just does not care about this.</para><para>Some say that the government is not only allowing this to happen but is actually interested in the demise of Medicare. The Prime Minister is now on record as saying that as far as he is concerned, Medicare should only exist to provide health services to low-income people. A universal national health insurance is the key to good health in our community. It is something most families treasure, and for good reason. The fear of diminishing access to good and affordable care is an issue that is raised with me over and over again. The present government seems to be hell bent on reducing the present system to a safety net style of health care for those on low incomes, with the rest of Australians on their own. A universal health care system means that anyone can seek medical advice and treatment when they need it without having to worry about the health of their bank account. It is the reason we pay the Medicare levyâa progressive tax. This is a far fairer way of running a health system than what will quickly become a second-rate health care system for low-income earners with the rest of the population having to find and use whatever they can afford, regardless of their health needs.</para><para>Casey Council, in my electorate, has recognised this as a primary concern for the people in Casey. The council wrote to the health minister late last year, and also to me, to make this point. The City of Casey has noted that it can take residents up to eight days to see a general practitioner and that some of the busier practices in Casey no longer take on new patients. The ratio of doctors to patients in Casey is one to 1,700, compared to a ratio of one to 600 in inner Melbourne. My constituent, Ms A, is a single mother with three children who has been sick with the flu for the last two weeks. She does not have the money to go to the doctor. She rang my office last week to beg me to do everything I can to make sure bulk-billing is maintained. Ms A tells me that there is no doctor in Carrum Downs that bulk-bills. Her old doctor used to bulk-bill but does not anymore. Ms A reports that the surgery seems to have the attitude that, if you cannot afford the $35 upfront, you can go elsewhere. Ms A tells me this surgery will not let its patients pay the gap up front and return with the Medicare cheque later. It insists that its patients pay the full fee up front and claim the refund later.</para><para>I must go on record as saying that I do not altogether blame the doctors' practices for this practice. They have got to keep their businesses solvent. The real problem rests with the lack of support for bulk-billing and the lack of a reasonable level of rebates. It is clearly very difficult, if not impossible, for many people. Ms A's experience is not an isolated case. This stresses the need for a good quality and accessible health system. </para><para>The other troubling aspect of the decline of Medicare is the falling bulk-billing rates. Bulk-billing rates across Australia have nosedived, but the fall is not constant across the country. In Isaacs, the percentage of doctors' visits that were bulk-billed has steadily declined from 85.4 per cent in the 12 months to September 2000 to 75.4 per cent in the 12 months to September 2002. If you look at the quarterly figures, the situation is even more alarming. The rate for the September 2002 quarter was just 70.2 per cent. Recent analysis of bulk-billing by the ALP has shown that the national average of around 70 per cent is actually propped up by Sydney, which has an average of around 86 per cent. The Prime Minister's seat of Bennelong has enjoyed a steady bulk-billing rate in the mid-80s since 2000, with a relatively small drop of only one per cent since March 2000. That contrasts with my electorate and its experiences. The difficulties of finding a doctor in the outer suburbs and the alarming drop in the rate of bulk-billing are hurting families and those on low incomes. The government must take steps now to address these issues. </para><para>Recent figures are showing two more trends that are alarming. The first is that the cost of seeing the local GP is increasing rapidly. The out-of-pocket expense of visiting the doctor has increased by 54 per cent in the seven years since the Howard government came to office. The second emerging trend is that the number of GP visits is actually declining, despite the fact that the population is growing. The combination of the falling number of GPs prepared to bulk-bill, the increasing out-of-pocket costs of visiting the doctor and the falling number of visits to the GP all tell me that things are very difficult and that the Medicare system is being killed off. The difficulty is that these people who are not visiting their GP are either not getting the treatment they need or opting instead to go to the local hospital's emergency department. This has flow-on effects in an already crowded hospital system, which, once again, affects those who can least afford other options.</para><para>Related to the problems in Medicare are the problems experienced by the elderly and frail in the community who need care. The funding for care provided to residents in their homes is a mess of piecemeal programs largely funded by the federal government. Whilst existing programs are piecemeal, they are also underfunded. Local governments in Isaacs tell me that they are having to turn away clients who are clearly eligible for Home and Community Care funding but are not a priority because someone else is in even more need of the service. Care for the frail aged is important, and so is taking steps to delay or even avoid the elderly needing care. Dandenong council is keen to implement a pilot program with the aim of demonstrating and measuring the improved quality of life and cost-benefits to the HACC program of health promotion initiatives for seniors. Such health promotion initiatives would include exercise, strength training, falls prevention and nutrition. As we are hearing continually, Australia's population is ageing. Steps must be taken to cope with all the implications of this, and a healthier aged population is in everyone's interests.</para><para>Having said that, the immediate needs of the frail aged must also be met. This means addressing the problems of the HACC funding and the shortage of nursing home beds. There is an absolute shortage of beds in Australia, including in Isaacs, and there is emerging evidence that the distribution of low-care and high-care beds is not matching demand. Not only do we need more bedsâand I mean more beds that actually exist, not just licences that are being held by someone who is planning or hoping to buildâwe need to address the issue of the demand for high-care beds moving faster than the demand for low-care beds.</para><para>In the time I have taken today, I have talked about several issues that are detrimental to the wellbeing of the people of Isaacs and Australia. I have talked about the mess of the family tax benefits system; I am not the only one to talk about this increasing problem. Many on this side of the House are doing the same, and I am sure the offices of those opposite are also fielding many calls every week from constituents unhappy about the system. The ombudsman has now issued a damning report which says that the system will continue to create problems for its clients. The disgrace is that none of this is actually new. These problems have been talked about ever since the system was brought in nearly three years ago. The government itself in a backhanded way recognised the problems in the lead-up to the last federal election by announcing a one-off amnesty to the tune of $1,000 per family for families in debt. The amnesty lasted only one year, and by then of course the election was over.</para><para>I have talked about the alarming disintegration of Medicare. I have talked about the fact that it is getting harder and harder to find a doctor who bulk-bills. It is getting harder to find a doctor full stop if you live in outer Melbourne. Once you find a doctor, it is getting more and more expensive to visit that doctor. This is leading to a fall in the number of visits to local doctors, and it is not due to a sudden increase in our collective health. I have talked about the dismal situation our frail aged people are in as they try to get appropriate and timely care. I have talked about the need for people to have access to steady income through reliable, good, ongoing jobs and not to be forced to rely on part time or casual work. All of these issues are vital to the wellbeing of every one of us. None of these matters is getting the attention it deserves from this government. It is high time this government took a real and caring look around and started to deal with these matters in a civilised and proper manner and did so very quickly.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>12640</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe bills currently before us, <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>, are all about the numbers and sums that together make up the budget of the Commonwealth government. However, today I want to move beyond the numbers and the arguments over surpluses and deficits to consider the human implications of this budget and, in particular, what the budget has meant for the unemployed and for those young Australians seeking to acquire employable skills. Economists sometimes forget that budgets are a means to an end, the purpose of which is to maximise living standards for all Australians. It is my strong belief that a budget must be about more than a dry, annual accountancy document that seeks to make sure the numbers on one side of the ledger are balanced by those on the other. It also must be about more than short-term attempts to bribe the electorate. Budgets are the primary tool by which governments can manage the economy, address social needs and remedy economic failures. They are an investment in the attainment of national priorities.</para></talk.start><para>As such, budgets must be about the pursuit of ideals, of lifting people out of poverty and despair and providing them with the opportunities and security to realise their full potential. This is the great dividing line, the great issue of principle, between Labor and the current Howard government. Labor believes that government has a responsibility to invest in individuals as well as the communities in which they live and work. The coalition believes that individuals prosper only when government leaves them to fend for themselves.</para><para>One of the groups most marginalised by this government's ideology is the unemployed. In seven years, what have the unemployed got from this government? They have a privatised employment service that recycles them through endless programs with little chance of meaningful employment at the end; they have mutual obligation programs that are more about demonising the jobless than providing them with employable skills; and they have a traineeship and apprenticeship system that is being increasingly exploited by employers as a source of cheap labour rather than as an opportunity to skill-up our work force and improve the productivity of the Australian economy.</para><para>As the shadow minister for employment services and training, I am disappointed that we as a nation still waste too much of the talent of too many of our people. Unemployment is, without question, still one of the greatest policy challenges we face. Unemployment is a scandal of wasted potential. Unemployment saps the confidence and self-esteem of our fellow Australians. It damages the social fabric and has profound negative consequences for social cohesion. As has been seen in other countries, if it is ignored and neglected, left to a fate to be decided solely by market forces, unemployment creates a permanent underclass.</para><para>Today, 609,700 of our fellow citizens are without a job. On top of this official figure, more than 700,000 Australians currently work part time and want more hours. A further 1.16 million, who are counted by the ABS as not in the labour force, would still like to have a job. Altogether, nearly 2Â½ million Australians are not getting the financial and social stability that comes with having enough work. Unemployment amongst our Indigenous communities is currently running at six times the national average. More than 850,000 childrenâ17 per cent of all dependent childrenânow live in households where neither parent has a job. It is also becoming increasingly evident that a growing section of our community is becoming entrenched in long-term joblessness. The latest data released by the Department of Family and Community Services shows that 394,499 people have been on unemployment benefits for more than 12 months, which is a higher figure than when this government was first elected, despite a decade of economic growth. </para><para>As well as growing welfare dependency, unemployment is becoming increasingly ghettoisedâthat is, it is concentrated in a small number of regions or neighbourhoods. While nationally unemployment has been ebbing lower, communities in areas such as Wide Bay in Queensland, the Tweed and Illawarra in New South Wales, outer western Melbourne, and many Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory and Western Australia are enduring an unemployment rate of well over 10 per cent. However, the plight of the unemployed and the continuing rise in long-term joblessness should come as no surprise to any member of this parliament. It is no coincidence that this deteriorating situation coincided with the Howard government's decision to cut funding to labour market programs by 50 per cent, or $1 billion annually. As part of its ideological crusade, the government scrapped much of the assistance put in place by the previous Labor government's Working Nation program, irrespective of how effective that assistance was proving to be. </para><para>We have a government that, on the one hand, complains about a growing culture of welfare dependency while, on the other hand, it savages the very programs that would assist the unemployed to move off welfare and return to the economic and social life of our community. We have a government that specialises in vilifying the victims of economic change, labelling them as dole bludgers, job snobs and cruisers. As well as slashing funding for labour market programs, the Howard government has privatised the delivery of employment services. The Job Network, established in 1997 without parliamentary debate or community consultation, is now the government's flagship assistance program for the unemployed. The Job Network replaced programs delivering specific services with a much more open-ended funding regime centred on employment outcomes. Within the Job Network, intensive assistanceâsoon to be repackaged as `customised assistance'âis the highest level of assistance available and is targeted toward those with the greatest barriers to employment. </para><para>Ministers Brough and Abbott regularly boast about how much money the Job Network is saving the government. In response, the following point has to be made: both ministers are correct, but this is a boast that has had a human cost as well as a long-term economic cost. Under the Keating Labor government, funding for employment assistance represented 0.67 per cent of GDP. That figure under the Howard government has declined massively to just 0.39 per cent of GDP. On an international comparison, Australia invests 43 per cent less than the OECD average on help for the unemployed. The budget currently before us continues that legacy. Whilst the flexibility and emphasis on employment outcomes that underpin the Job Network have the potential to deliver better outcomes for the unemployed, fundamental flaws in the funding structure and inadequate levels of government support have greatly undermined the effectiveness of the system. </para><para>It is not just the Labor Party voicing these concerns. In September last year, both the Productivity Commission and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations released detailed evaluations of the Job Network's performance. Both assessments provided compelling evidence that the current funding model is seriously flawed. The department's report found that participation in intensive assistance raised the employment prospects of the long-term unemployed by a mere 0.6 per cent. As the report acknowledged, the overwhelming majority of job seekers who obtained jobs after participating in this intensive assistance would have got jobs anyway. On top of this, the Productivity Commission found that many job seekers received little or no assistance while apparently in the intensive assistance phase. This is popularly called `parking' in the industry. The report also went on to say:</para><quote><para>...the  Intensive Assistance program is neither intensive nor assistance to some disadvantaged job seekers. </para></quote><para>Separate research conducted by David Abello from the UNSW and Helen Macdonald from the Brotherhood of St Laurence that involved interviews and focus groups with providers and job seekers concluded:</para><quote><para>The evidence tends to refute the notion that competition improves service quality. Rather it seems to have exerted a downward pressure on service quality and outcomes. Despite having been a much-touted centrepiece of the Job Network's design, job seeker choice appears to have played little part in driving standards.</para></quote><para>Given these findings, it should therefore come as little surprise that the employment outcomes being achieved by intensive assistance compare unfavourably to those that were being achieved under the most effective Working Nation programs such as JobStart.</para><para>According to the most recent data produced by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, only 17 per cent of those who participated in intensive assistance found full-time employment. In the case of the most disadvantaged job seekers, only one in 10 found full-time work upon completing intensive assistance. As a result of these poor outcomes, job seekers are being increasingly recycled through the Job Network. Information obtained by Labor through the Senate estimates committee process reveals that 49 per cent of people participating in intensive assistance had already been through the program previously, 23 per cent had been through the program at least twice before and five per cent had been through at least four times. </para><para>Members should note these figures in particular as I recall Minister Brough telling parliament on 27 February 2001 that the Keating government:</para><quote><para>... placed upon the Australian unemployed the greatest fraud of allârecycling the unemployed through unemployment programs, giving them false hope, but never delivering.</para></quote><para>Given the data now available on the Job Network, I would suggest that Minister Brough and his government are guilty of the very accusation that they levelled at the previous Labor government. Importantly, in its report the Productivity Commission considered the implications of the changes due to take effect from 1 July this year as part of ESC3. Specifically, the commission concluded:</para><quote><para>The proposals for Customised Assistance under the Active Participation Model guarantees a much higher level of interaction with jobseekers ... However, there is no guarantee that individual jobseekers will get access to any Job Seeker Account funds or that the 3 day a week requirement need amount to genuinely significant assistance. Accordingly, some jobseekers with large barriers to employment may not get much direct assistance from the Job Network.</para></quote><para>The Productivity Commission paints a bleak outlook for the long-term unemployed. At the time that these reports were released, Minister Brough issued a press release stating:</para><quote><para>The Job Network is clearly delivering results.</para></quote><para>This is nothing short of an extraordinary analysis and highlights just how out of touch with reality this government has become.</para><para>The two reports I have mentioned do not suggest that active labour market programs are pointless or a waste of money, but they do indicate that without adequate funding their effectiveness will continue to be greatly reduced. Inadequate funding has meant that those who did gain access to intensive assistance did not get the help that they needed. Only five per cent got any form of work experience and only 14 per cent received vocational training. The deficiency in the Job Network is obvious: not enough is being invested to improve job outcomes for disadvantaged job seekers, particularly those lacking relevant work experience in a mainstream job and/or relevant skills.</para><para>I now wish to turn to another program that the government holds up as one of its greatest achievements: Work for the Dole. Since 1996 the government has spent close to half a billion dollars on this program, and it will spend $147 million in this budget. Despite this significant investment of taxpayers' funds, every evaluation has consistently shown it to be a mediocre scheme at best. The latest data from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations reveals that 67.1 per cent of participants were still unemployed following completion of the program. According to research produced by ACOSS, amongst others, these results compare unfavourably with the programs it replaced. For example, the previous Labor government's JobStart program for the long-term unemployed had a success rate of close to 60 per cent, even though it was assisting people who were far more disadvantaged than those currently participating in Work for the Dole.</para><para>The reason for the mediocre results is that Work for the Dole offers limited employment experience, much of it in unskilled work, and little formal training. Further research recently undertaken by the UNSW found that participants in the program were stigmatised, making it actually harder for them to secure mainstream employment. The government made much of the `wastefulness' of the previous Labor government's labour market programs when it scrapped them in 1996. If it adopted the same hard-nosed approach now, it would immediately scrap Work for the Dole. As every member of this House knows, Work for the Dole was never designed to get people into jobs; it was designed as a political exercise.</para><para>This very fact was confirmed when Minister Brough's spokesman told the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph </inline>in December of last year that the program was not about training but about stopping the unemployed watching Oprah. Not only was this a further crude attempt to vilify and stereotype the unemployed, but such comments highlight the simplistic basis upon which the Howard government develops public policy. Labor do not condone those people who fail to take seriously their job finding responsibilities. Indeed, we introduced mutual obligation. Passive welfare can indeed be debilitating. It is about time, however, that the government fulfilled its responsibilities as well. While the current government believes that simply keeping job seekers active will lead to future employment opportunities, Labor recognises that without relevant skills and recent experience in a mainstream workplace job seekers will continue to find it difficult convincing employers to take them on.</para><para>Finally, I wish to turn to the government's New Apprenticeships system. The Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, regularly boasts in the House that under his government the number of people undertaking apprenticeships and traineeships has doubled. However, this expansion appears to have come at the expense of quality training outcomes, both for the individual as well as for the Australian economy. Job Watch, a community legal centre in Victoria, has provided evidence that employers are increasingly exploiting the New Apprenticeships scheme as a source of cheap labour rather than as an opportunity to skill up the unemployed. A special SBS investigation revealed the case involving fast food retailer Hungry Jacks. When the retailer opened a new outlet in Hornsby, New South Wales, every single one of its 50 new employees were employed as trainees. One wonders who was doing the training. Many of these were high school children simply looking for a little extra pocket money.</para><para>Unfortunately, these are not isolated cases. Many employers, in particular those in low-skill industries, appear to be exploiting the scheme as a de facto wage subsidy program. According to the Australian Industry Group's Heather Ridout, the growth in the New Apprenticeships scheme also disguises `an alarming fall in technical and engineering apprenticeships'. For example, engineering enrolments in New South Wales TAFE colleges alone are down 35 per cent over the past eight years. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations has identified skills shortages across a range of industries, including child care, secondary school teaching, panel beating, metal fitting and metal fabrication.</para><para>These skills shortages highlight a failure of government policy. Under this government, the nation's training dollar is not being targeted towards addressing acute skills shortages in the economy or providing young Australians with the skills that will improve their long-term career prospects. Australia must raise the skill levels of its work force if it is to address skills bottlenecks and remain fully competitive in the international economy. This can only be achieved if government works cooperatively with industry to provide the vocational education and training experiences that will both equip individuals and reward employers. Instead of appropriately resourcing those collective institutions already in placeâthe industry training advisory boardsâMinister Nelson has actually cut their funding and created his own ambiguous round table of stakeholders.</para><para>A further indication of the scheme's inadequacy is the consistently higher non-completion rate amongst trainees. Thirty-seven per cent of participants in the scheme do not complete their training course. On top of this drop-out figure, between 20 and 30 per cent of those undertaking traineeships are receiving inadequate training. It should therefore come as little surprise to members that skills growth as a contribution to productivity growth has dropped by 75 per cent in the last 10 years, from 28.6 per cent in the late eighties and early nineties to only 2.9 per cent in the late nineties.</para><para>The Howard government fends off Labor's concerns about quality by attacking Labor's record. But what you will never hear from Minister Nelson is how it was the previous Labor government who, in the 1980s, took on the states and pushed them to put in place new industrial arrangements and legislation that enabled the traineeship system to be established in the first place. You will not hear the Howard government acknowledge that it was the Whitlam Labor government that provided the first Commonwealth financial support for apprenticeships back in 1973, when it established the National Apprenticeship Assistance Scheme. Prior to that time, the Liberals had been in office for 23 years and had done absolutely nothing to put such a scheme in place. It is surprising that the minister for education does not acknowledge Labor's achievements, given he was an ALP supporter and member back then. Indeed, Minister Nelson was never more correct than when he told the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> in 1994:</para><quote><para>Labor policies are usually much better for people ...</para></quote><para>The minister was right then, and his statement rings true today. Unfortunately, he is now a member of the government that is destroying the good policy framework which was inherited in 1996.</para><para>NAAS was a landmark for apprenticeships in Australia. It marked the beginning of what was to be continuous Commonwealth funding for apprenticeships and ensured for the first time that apprenticeships became a national priority. Unfortunately, you will never see such visionary public policy from this government. Under this government, the long-term unemployed have been abandoned to the ravages of the marketplace. The government's current policy framework is failing to tackle entrenched joblessness. As I have previously mentioned, the number of Australians who are relying on long-term benefits and have been unemployed for more than 12 months is today higher than it was when this government first took office back in 1996. It is little wonder, then, that ACOSS has recently labelled the government's approach to job creation a `policy quagmire'.</para><para>A serious effort to tackle unemployment, to skill-up the Australian work force and to move us towards full employment requires substantial investment from government, but when you consider the alternative you realise that the cost of this investment is absolutely worth bearing. It is a price we have to pay to end child poverty, to restore social cohesion and to spread prosperity across all sections of Australian society. Instead of finding new and more draconian ways to breach the unemployed and generally make their lives a misery, the government should be making that positive investment now. Unfortunately, however, for seven years Australia has had a government that simply does not believe in investing in our greatest resource: our population.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>12645</page.no><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name><name.id>83S</name.id><electorate>Chisholm</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI always like to take the opportunity to speak on any appropriation bills that come before the House, for two reasons. Firstly, I think that the expenditure of Commonwealth money, public money, deserves to be scrutinised and, secondly, I believe that this government has priorities that are vastly different from those of the Australians it represents. Essentially, that is what the expenditure of public money is all about: it is expenditure for the priorities of the government of the day. It is a direct measure of the government's intentions and the relative importance it places on various policies and components of the budget, and, consequently, it is a direct indication of the direction that the government wishes to take Australia in. After today's events, we know the direction in which this government wants to take Australia; sadly, that is not where the populace wants to go.</para></talk.start><para>The two bills that are currently before the chamber, <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-03</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-03</inline>, are significant not only in the indications they give us of government intentions but also in their scale. Combined, these two bills represent requests for appropriations of over $1,453 million. Firstly, I will look at Appropriation Bill (No. 3), in which the government is requesting the appropriation of $1,190,967,000. The expenditure of finance under Appropriation Bill (No. 3) includes $406,357,000 for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I have tried to investigate what that is being spent on. If any of you deal with immigration matters like I do, you will know that it is certainly not being spent on staffing overseas posts, the staffing of which is currently cut down to ridiculous levels. I would be quite fascinated to know where all that money is going.</para><para>Also in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) are the following amounts: $245,892,000 for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry; $108,165,000 for the Department of Defence; and $94,690,000 for the Department of Health and Ageing. It is fairly interesting that the Department of Health and Ageing is getting the least out of the moneys that are being appropriated in this bill. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) requests $263,750,000 from consolidated revenue for the purposes of capital works and payments to the states and for other purposes. These are very significant bills and very significant sums of money. I plan to deal with a number of the individual appropriations during my contribution this evening. I also intend to put forward my view on alternatives and more appropriate priorities for Australia.</para><para>One thing mentioned in the portfolio overview of the Department of Health and Ageing is the medical indemnity assurance programs. I have continued to take a real interest in the operation and regulatory framework of the insurance industry and have had a number of questions listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> relating to the oversight of the provisions of professional indemnity insurance, and medical indemnity insurance, in particular.</para><para>I believe that the operation and oversight of medical defence organisations have been a continuing story of neglect by this government, a neglect that has threatened to permanently close down portions of the medical profession through the inability of practitioners to obtain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost. It is also prohibiting people from being able to get services from doctors in some areas, because they simply are not providing that service any more since they cannot take out medical indemnity. An article in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> of 18 February this year illustrates this point. The article, by Morgan Mellish, states:</para><quote><para>The federal government signalled yesterday it might modify its medical indemnity reforms after several doctors' insurers claimed they would not survive under the new regulatory regime.</para><para>Three of the remaining six doctors' insurers are rebelling against the proposed changes, saying they could be forced out of business.</para><para>The problems, which affect about 11,000 GPs and specialists, mainly in Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria, could lead to a doctors' crisis in those states.</para><para>Treasury officials held urgent talks with the insurers yesterday after the Medical Protection Society of Tasmania, which covers 90 per cent of that state's doctors, claimed last week that it was on the brink of collapse.</para></quote><para>We have seen the collapse of several of these medical insurers. This is a dire situation caused by the neglectful oversight of the government and the continuation of a problem that at least in its crisis stages goes well back into last year. As I said earlier, I have two questions on notice from 16 May last year relating to medical indemnity insurance that remain unanswered by the Treasurer. The problem surrounding the oversight by APRA of medical insurance providers requires significant investigation, and I await the answer to my questions.</para><para>While hoping that the government finally acts in a way that will ensure that the vital services provided to our doctors continue, the government has recently introduced into the House legislation which has yet to be debated: the <inline ref="R1730">Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1731">Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002</inline>. This legislation recognises that these medical indemnity groups were predominantly subscription based membership organisations and were not running as proper insurance organisations and that there have been some problems within the industry overall that have gone unchecked and unregulated. Now the government proposes to bring those organisations under the regulation of APRA and also proposes to introduce capital adequacy tests of $5 million. We are yet to see whether this will meet with the approval of the entire industry. As the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> indicated, there are grave concerns with it. But we need to have some sort of standard of regulation or we will continue to see the collapse of this industry, and if we have the collapse of this industry we will have the collapse of doctors, particularly in specialist areas. Having said that, I have grave concerns about APRA's ability to oversee that role, and we are yet to see the outcome of the HIH royal commission and what it will have to say in respect of APRA's role. APRA itself has been gravely underfunded and has been short-staffed for quite some time.</para><para>I turn now to the issue of private health. Private health is a very big issue in my electorate of Chisholm. Some 65 per cent of my constituents have private health insurance. It is something that they are entitled to have. This government said in the lead-up to the 2001 election that the government's policies would lead to reductions in premiums and that private health insurance would be more affordable and attractive to consumers. But since the election in 2001, the government has increased premiums in excess of 14 per cent. This year's increase of 7.4 per cent comes on top of last year's average increase of 6.9 per cent. With regard to the CPI, in 2002 it was 2.9 per cent and in 2003 it is three per cent. That is a total of 5.9 per cent, but these insurance companies have raised premiums by 14 per cent. As a result, many families with private health insurance will pay an extra $150 to $250 this year and, together with last year's increases and the decision by some funds to abandon discounts for regular and up-front payments, many Australian families will now be paying $300 to $500 more for their premium than they did before the election in 2001. That is despite this government's promises that the introduction of the private health medical rebate would reduce the premiums. It has done no such thing. I put a question on notice last year to the Minister for Health and Ageing. I asked:</para><quote><para>When assessing requests by health funds for premium increases, does the Minister make it a requirement that, where premium increases are approved, the levels of coverage for the fund are maintained?</para></quote><para>I at least got an answer; it was a very informative answer. The answer was no. So when they go and approve substantial funding increases they do not ask for anything in return. They actually get nothing in return; we are not guaranteed provisions. I am personally having a fight with my private health insurance provider at the moment, because they have refused to pay a bill to a surgeon who has performed great works on my son's hands. So it is a bit of a personal crisis, as well, at the moment and I am hoping it will be resolved very shortly. It is an issue that is out there and that is hurting many in our community.</para><para>This comes on top of the government's impost through the Medicare levy surcharge. I conducted one of my regular mobile offices on Saturday and I had at least two people come up to me on this very issue of the Medicare levy surcharge. Most people were coming up to talk about how they did not want war, but two people in particular came and saw me about the Medicare levy surcharge. One woman said her husband had recently had a pay rise and they were very happy in their household, but it was actually going to make them $3,000 worse off a year. Why? Because, of course, he went into the next level of taxation with bracket creep, but also they were hit by the Medicare levy surcharge. They have three children in high school and this year they have had to say to the school that they cannot meet their so-called voluntary contribution to the state system. They are terribly embarrassed by this and now they are exploring whether they should fork out for private health insurance to actually claw back this man's pay rise. This is what people are facing day in, day out, and this government has promised that private health insurance will get cheaper. It has done no such thing.</para><para>It is impossible, however, to discuss the expenditure of Commonwealth public money without putting that expenditure in context by looking at other government expenditures and programs and investigating the relative value of other funding proposals. One such proposal that I have brought to the House on numerous occasions is the provision of sufficient numbers of Commonwealth funded aged care beds in my electorate of Chisholm. The lack of aged care beds in the community I represent is a disgrace. I recently asked again a number of questions on notice to the Minister for Ageing, the member for Menzies, relating to provisions of aged care beds in my electorate and the surrounding electorates, and I got some very fascinating information back. Actually, this minister answers his questions on notice; I am very impressed. To my surprise and distress, the provision of these crucial aged care services appeared to be weighed heavily towards which party holds the electorate. Several Liberal seatsâincluding Kooyong and Higgins, and even the minister's own electorate of Menziesâhad many more beds allocated than the electorate of Chisholm, despite Chisholm having a population of people over the age of 70 years that is greater than all the adjoining electorates.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HM5</name.id><name role="metadata">Georgiou, Petro, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83S</name.id><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name></talker><para>âChisholm does! The Chisholm population of over 70s is 15,048; Kooyong is 14,057. I currently have an operational shortfall of 239 beds. Kooyong has in excess of 593 beds. Higgins, which has an over-70s population of 12,957âfewer than Chisholm, againâhas an additional 247 aged care beds. Needless to say, Kooyong and Higgins are held by Liberal members, one of them joining us in the chamber this evening. I thought it was very informative that my electorate of Chisholm, with the highest proportion of people over the age of 70, has the greatest shortfall.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In Chisholm there are currently 1,115 operational aged care beds, both high and low care, and a further allocation of 192 beds; that is, a further 192 beds that the Commonwealth has funded but that are yet to be built. Acting on the assumptionâand I accept that it is a flawed assumptionâthat every bed that is allocated becomes operational, this means there is still a shortfall base on the government's own target of 47 beds. This is unacceptable. I have people, daily, in my office, who cannot get an aged care bed for their loved ones. Right now, in Chisholm, there is a shortfall of 239 beds, and that is on the government's own conservative estimation of the actual need in the electorate. It is distressing for so many in my community that elderly people in need of the care provided in aged care facilities can only obtain this care if they move away from friends, family and the community of which they are a part. This is unfair and an unreasonable attack on the elderly and their families in Chisholm.</para><para>For the majority of people, putting a family member into a nursing home is already a very stressful and strained time. You do not want to then find that you are three bus rides away from that aged care facility. Sadly, two aged care facilities in my electorate have closed down, with no requirement that those beds stay within the zone in which they were provided. Funnily enough, several of those beds moved to the electorate of Menziesâthe minister's own electorateâand it is up in the air as to where several others should go. Not only is there a shortfall; the beds that were there have been moved away. People who put a loved one into an aged care nursing home are often aged themselves; they are either aged children or aged spouses. They do not need the extra burden of having to travel to visit those relatives.</para><para>I maintain a longstanding and genuine interest in the universities in my electorate of Chisholm. I attended one of them, Monash University. I am very proud to boast that there are two very large universities in my electorate, Monash Universityâone of Australia's largestâand the city campus of Deakin University. My concern for their operation stems from their importance not only as educational institutions but also as local employers. Monash University and Deakin University are two of the largest employers within my electorate. The university campuses in Chisholm have tens of thousands of students enrolled and cover a gamut of educational disciplines. Deakin University has for many years been recognised as one of the leading universities, through study of universities Australia wide. Monash is one of the big eight and has a phenomenal record in both academic and research senses.</para><para>Unfortunately, these great institutions are not able to provide the services they wish to provide. The government has cut university funding to the order of $5 billion since it came to power, and this is having a detrimental impact upon those universities' capacity to provide the level of education they desire to provide. There have been cuts to staff. At Monash University in the first year I was elected, there was a cut to the arts faculty of in excess of 70 people. In the next year, there was a cut to the science faculty of 80 people. Yet again, we are going through another round of what might be a compulsory reduction in staffing numbers at the same time as enrolments are increasing, particularly of overseas students. There has been an increase in the cost of higher education. People like my younger brother, who did all his university study through HECS, says he has a HECS bill amounting to the GDP of a Third World nation, and he probably does! He probably should have stayed at university for a shorter time! HECS is growing and students have suffered and are suffering. Academics are suffering. There is an increase in the amount of stress that staff are currently experiencing. There has also been a cut in research dollars.</para><para>Fairness has been cut from the system. Since 1996, the Howard government has overseen a 22 per cent increase in average class sizes. During the past eight years, the number of teaching staff at our university has been in steady decline. There are now 2,136 fewer teachers than there were in 1996, despite a massive jump in the number of students, particularly overseas students. What you find at Monash University, in what is affectionately known as the `Ming Wing'âwhere unfortunately there was a very tragic occurrence last year when two students were shot and killedâare very large lecture theatres that are completely packed to the rafters and students literally sitting in the aisles on top of one another for what are meant to be tutorials. You cannot have a tutorial with a couple of hundred students and one poor tutor. It is ludicrous. In the short time since I was there as a student, the situation has declined dramatically. Because of a cut of more than $5 million in funding by the Howard government, cash-strapped universities are being forced to load up teachers with more and more students, which is causing a drastic increase in staff workloads and pressures and putting quality under severe pressure.</para><para>We used to have pride in our educational system in Australia, and I think that is going backwards and that it is to our detriment. It will also backfire for this government, because overseas full fee paying students will ask: `Why come to Australian universities if I'm not going to be given the standard and quality of education that I could have been guaranteed previously?' The other ridiculous thing the full fee paying situation has seen is numerous worthy applicants for places within universities being rejected. I had a student last year approach my office. The cut-off score for law at Monash was 98.7. She received 98.5 and she won the Monash law prize, but she did not get a place in Monash law. She was the last child of nine. She and her twin sister had gone to school on full scholarships; they were both very bright girls. But their parentsâfunnily enough, after raising nine kidsâdid not have a lot of money. If she had been able to find the full fees, she could have got into Monash law on a score of 91. It was obscene. The university would not budge, the HECS system would not budge and the university lost out on a brilliant student. She decided to go to Melbourne and do arts. I think that is a tragedy of this system and an indication of the funding crisis our universities are going through.</para><para>If I had more time, I would also be talking about the lack of money going into before and after school care within my electorate. We are having a great deal of problems with that. I would also be talking about the baby bonus, where money is being wasted hand over fist in a ridiculous system that is actually not assisting anybody in the work force with the decision to have a child and stay out of the work force. I was going to end by quoting from a rather interesting speech that Tony Abbot gave to the Young Liberals and their conference in Adelaideâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84S</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83S</name.id><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name></talker><para>âI won't, because I am going to run out of time. I thought this speech contained an interesting indictment on the government. The minister said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Until recently, business leaders were generally astounded to learn that comparatively poor people faced higher effective tax rates than they did.</para></quote><para>That is the situation that this government has put people into. They have actually made it almost impossible to move from welfare to work because, if you do, you are squashed all roundâyou lose your benefits and you are hit with a greater tax rate. Somehow, this is the government that taxes less and provides more. I think we need to get our priorities right in this country and have a government that genuinely cares about families and which, instead of just using that idea in rhetoric, actually demonstrates it through the delivery of better quality services for our community. I think they stand condemned by their actions.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>12650</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name><name.id>84S</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline> provides members of this House with a chance to consider the performance of the governmentâin this case, a government so obsessed with rushing into an as yet unnecessary war that it has dropped the ball completely on domestic matters. Accordingly, I was very pleased to be able to second the amendment proposed by the member for Fraser, particularly the issues raised in his second clause. We have finally heard something from the government about its plans for the health system, but only after it has allowed bulk-billing rates to drop to completely unacceptable levels. In my electorate of Bass, the percentage of unreferred consultations that are bulk-billed has now dropped to below 50 per centâit is just 49.8 per cent. In other words, people living in my electorate have less than a fifty-fifty chance of being bulk-billed.</para></talk.start><para>This makes an absolute mockery of the government's claim that it supports a universal health system. The situation in reality is far worse than it appears on the surface. It is almost impossible to find a general practitioner in my electorate who is prepared to bulk-bill under the current arrangements offered by this government. In fact, it is becoming harder in Tasmania to find a GP who will bulk-bill than it is to find a Liberal member of the House of Representatives. This is perhaps no coincidence. This government seems not to care about insuring that the most basic of services are properly provided to every Australian regardless of where they live. I suspect that the Prime Minister in particular thinks it is not really all that badâafter all, bulk-billing rates in his own electorate continue to sit snugly above 80 per cent. Perhaps the Minister for Health and Ageing does not get the true picture either. In her home territory in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, the rates are generally well above 70 per cent. The picture that is painted is one of stark contrast between reasonably well serviced populations in the big cities and the hopelessly underprovided communities of rural and regional Australia. This will undoubtedly end up being the most remembered legacy of this government: a country divided between those who have and those who have not.</para><para>These social policies will drag this country back almost to the pre-Industrial Revolution days. The gap between rich and poor is steadily increasing whilst the government looks on, completely indifferent to the plight of ordinary Australians. As I said previously, it is virtually impossible in northern Tasmania to find a bulk-billing doctorâof course, that is if you are able to find a doctor at all. Take the case of a family who moved to Launceston from another part of Tasmania. They were faced immediately with two medical issues. Firstly, the husband became ill with a virus. He was unable to find a general practitioner who would see him and had to visit the local hospital where, after a 5Â½ hour wait he obtained a bit of relief. The children suffer from a particular condition and required a local doctor's referral so that they could attend a local specialist school. The family inquired unsuccessfully at around six or seven local practices before contacting my electorate office in desperation. Some practices told them they were not taking new patients; others wanted the fee up-front. I was able to find them a doctor who would bulk-bill them, but even then only after the payment of a small initial fee and having to wait for four days. Families should not have to go through such a convoluted process to obtain basic medical services. You should not have to ring your local MP in order to find a doctor.</para><para>This example raises a number of issues but, fundamentally, it comes down to two: the lack of doctors engaging in general practice, particularly in regional areas, and the unwillingness of doctors to bulk-bill. The Prime Minister says that the universality of Medicare provides only for the right to treatment in a public hospital and the right to recover the Medicare rebate for general attendance. But the very basis of the second element in the minds of most Australians, if not the Prime Minister, is that GPs will actually be willing to bulk-bill if requested to do so. In this House on 5 March, the Prime Minister quoted from a previous minister for health, Dr Blewett, in his attempt to portray that Australians have no right to have expectations about bulk-billing. He quoted Dr Blewett's words as follows:</para><quote><para>Direct billing will be available to everyone, where the doctor agrees, so that the patient does not have to claim a refund for the cost of medical treatment. But this is a choice left to the doctors.</para></quote><para>That was a choice that was actually not all that hard for a doctor to make when the government provided an appropriate environment within which bulk-billing was a realistic social service for general practitioners to supply.</para><para>This government does not provide such an environment. As the chief executive of GP North, a doctors' organisation based in my electorate, has said, the low bulk-billing rate in Bass was the result of inadequate Medicare funding by the federal government. His words were:</para><quote><para>If the Government was prepared to adequately remunerate doctors through Medicare for providing a service, I dare say you would see a change. This is the reality coming home to roost. The bottom line has to be recognition that the cost of services is greater than Medicare provides.</para></quote><para>My staff and I have spoken to many GPs in my electorate and they say that they, unlike the big medical firms of Sydney and Melbourne, cannot run viable practices given the numbers of patients they treat under the current amounts they would receive if they chose to bulk-bill.</para><para>Most of the medical practices in my electorate are mixed practices, and they see patients from all client groups. Until now, they have been happy to subsidise veteran patients under the gold card scheme by direct billing with no co-payment. Now a number of practices have advised their veteran patients that they will either have to pay the full amount and then recover the rebate or make a co-payment. The reason the doctors give is that they can no longer treat veterans for the fee they get from the government. And how does the government respond when its memorandum with the doctors expires? It does nothingâexcept, of course, to blackmail the doctors with a unilateral indefinite extension of the scheme with no increase in fees after three years. Yet the government remains happy to trumpet that the gold card is apparently alive and well. `Just go and find another doctor,' it says. It says that to the veteran whose doctor has advised him that he will no longer direct bill. The reality in electorates like mine is that there is probably no other doctor willing to direct bill veteran patientsâor anyone else, for that matter.</para><para>It is a gradual process, but ultimately it all ends up going against the patient. It used to be the case that medical practices in my electorate bulk-billed just about everybody who requested it. Many of even those patients, such as the veterans and pensioners who could be bulk-billed, are making a co-payment. An increasing number have to pay the full bill to the doctor themselves and then later claim the rebate. An older couple contacted my electorate office recently. The husband has a disability, and the wife is his carer. Their doctor began requiring them to pay their bills in full and then to handle their own reimbursement. For this couple, and no doubt for many others, this is both a cash flow problem and a physical inconvenience. It is actually not easy for her to get out of the house to leave her husband alone to go around and make the claims and do all of those necessary things. They may also have to go without something else while the rebate is processed and sent to them.</para><para>It is fine for the Prime Minister to pronounce his rhetoric that says, in effect, that bulk-billing really has nothing to do with Medicare. The Prime Minister says that this is a matter for patients and their doctors to reach agreement about, but that is not what Australians expect and it certainly is not what Australians deserve. The expectation of Australians is that the government will deliver an environment in which it is realistic for doctors to choose to offer bulk-billing to those of their patients who request it. Australians, like the family and the couple that I have already mentioned, should have access to bulk-billing wherever they live and whether or not that concept just happens to fit into the Prime Minister's own narrow definition of what might have been intended.</para><para>We need more doctors practising in outer suburban, rural and regional Australia and we need a system which actually encourages them to bulk-bill when they are there. This government's scheme to deal with the former has been a failure and it has done absolutely nothing to address the latter. I also want to draw the attention of the House to the in-progress negotiations on the General Agreement on Trades in Services, known by the acronym GATS. I can see that my colleague is quite delighted that we are going to be touching on that subject.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr Emerson</name></talker><para>âIt is highly relevant.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84S</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name></talker><para>âIt is highly relevant to Australia's future. Australia was a signature to the agreement from its inception in 1995. I am sure that I speak for the vast majority of Australiansâalthough not my colleague the member for Rankin, I am sureâwhen I say that I actually knew very little about the agreement when we signed up to it, or of its possible effects on the Australian economy, jobs and service industries. For this reason I think it is important to explain a little of the background. I know that many citizens of this country listen in to or later read the proceedings of this House, and they will be quite surprised and very interested to hear more about this matter and its history.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Basically, GATS provides a framework of rules, agreements and regulations which govern international trade in services and is an international treaty overseen by the World Trade Organisation, the WTO. As described in the discussion paper prepared by the Office of Trade Negotiations, under the GATS, WTO members can negotiate commitments to open specific service sectors to foreign competition and to afford foreign suppliers the same treatment as domestic suppliers. Members can also make commitments about the operation of their domestic regulation of services. But there are three very important riders: first of all, the nature and extent of these commitments is a matter of choice for the governments of signatory members; second, member governments can choose not to make commitments in a particular area; and, third, commitments can also be structured so as to discriminate between domestic and foreign suppliers.</para><para>The current round of negotiations began in January 2000, with negotiation guidelines and procedures being adopted by the WTO services council in March 2001. Under these procedural guidelines, we are now reaching the very serious second stage. WTO ministers agreed that members should lodge initial requests on 30 June last year, with members expected to respond to initial requests with an opening offer by 31 March this year, just days away. It should be noted that an initial offer has no legal status and can in fact be withdrawn or altered at any time. It should also be noted that the members have no obligation to respond positively to any request and there is no requirement for reciprocity.</para><para>In the Office of Trade Negotiations' discussion paper, it is stated:</para><quote><para>In July 2002, the Minister for Trade ... undertook to consult widely in preparing Australia's response to the requests received from other WTO Members. In responding to these requests, the Government will ensure that its ability to regulate and continue to support public services is maintained, in full accordance with the GATS Treaty.</para></quote><para>It is really important that Australia participates fully in world affairs, but it is equally importantly that when doing so the interests of Australians are fully considered and fully protected. I hope the minister is able to fulfil his undertaking to consult widely before Australia responds, and certainly before we make any final commitmentsâalthough I am a little dubious, seeing that most of the negotiations are apparently not allowed to be consulted upon because they are secret.</para><para>The world's economy, and consequently Australia's own, has changed much in a very short space of time. We are told that four out of five Australian workers are now engaged in service industries. Out of a total of $31.1 billion in Australian services exports in 2001-02, nearly half went to Asia. Whilst Australia used to import more services than we exported, we moved into surplus following the Sydney Olympics. Trade in services is becoming more and more a prominent feature of our trade performance. And there are real pluses in Australia's participation in the GATS because it can increase the options and certainty for our exporters in the sector. That is because once a selective commitment to open trade in a particular service is made it is binding. It cannot generally be revoked without penalty. On the other hand, a WTO member can exclude a sector from GATS commitments, whether entirely or partially, and it is also free to determine internally what services sectors will be reserved for state owned enterprises and whether such sectors should be opened to foreign competition.</para><para>The opening gambits in the current round see Australia having made requests of 35 fellow members. These seek the removal of barriers which discriminate against Australian services exporters. In return, Australia has received requests from at least 22 WTO member countries seeking new commitments or extensions to our current schedule. The requests to Australia cover a wide range of the service industry, from professional services through to health, tourism and the environment and include two sectors which I would like to explore in more detail: first of all, postal and courier services and, second, transport of all typesâmaritime, air, road and rail.</para><para>In relation to postal and courier services, Australia has no existing commitments. The pending requests to Australia do not, for the most part, seek full commitments without limitations for all postal services. This, it appears, is in recognition of the government monopoly on the supply of regular letters. However, we are asked to make full commitments in respect of courier services and others in relation to express delivery and postal services.</para><para>Australia has existing commitmentsâalthough not comprehensiveâon a broad range of transport services, but we have made no commitments in respect of rail and have made only partial road commitments. We have some key limitations on maritime transport commitments. The requests made to Australia this time around seem to be wide ranging and extensive. In the maritime area, requests are seeking non-discriminatory access to essential port services and to multimodal transport facilities and services. We are also asked to remove limitations on national treatment and market access. Full coverage is sought in respect of road transport, repair of road and rail transport equipment, and passenger and freight transport by rail.</para><para>Returning to the issue of postal services, it is perhaps pertinent to have a look at the current dispute between Canada Post and UPS, a United States based private courier company. The essence of the case is that UPS is suing the Canadian government for $250 million in damages, claiming that the operations of Canada Post breach the free trade agreement between the countries. Amongst the specific claims by UPS is that Canada Post's courier service is cross-subsidised by its access to the postal network and that the government provides benefits to Canada Post employees that are not available to others. This scenario would be, of course, a possibility here if our domestic postal services were to become the subject of concessions under international free trade agreements.</para><para>This is not the first time that deregulation of our postal industry and our postal services has been mooted. This country's approach to postal services and regulation was, until the election of this government, one which balanced service with profit. As a result, we still possess a universal standard letter pick-up and delivery service across the country at a standard cost to the consumer wherever they might live. Unlike bulk-billing, this is an example of where all Australians are essentially treated in the same way wherever they live or work. We must not allow remaining universal services such as this to be put at risk.</para><para>We have already seen the Howard government tinker with the possibility of radical deregulation of the postal industry. These moves would have greatly jeopardised Australia Post's capacity to fulfil its community postal service obligations in a uniform manner and at the same cost to all Australians. Australians mobilised to prevent the government pursuing this course, but it is significant to note that, during the government's little foray into deregulation, overseas postal companies were amongst those lobbying for it to proceed.</para><para>As a signatory to GATS, Australia should respond responsibly to requests made of it, but above all we must protect the basic services provided to Australians. The jobs of Australian workers must also receive the highest consideration. Sadly, the CEPU, the union representing Australian postal workers, believes it has not been allowed to adequately put forward a case in defence of either. It appears that, in contravention of the minister's undertaking to `consult widely' in preparing Australia's response, a lack of transparency and openness on the part of this government has prevailed.</para><para>I would like to return to the implications of the GATS negotiations for the maritime services industry. Unfortunately, once again we do not have very much detail of where the government is choosing to go with this. We do not know what they are asking for, and the government does not see fit to release the documentation. There is a basic commitment to fully consult, but once again we sorely lack the detail.</para><para>The DFAT paper that I referred to a number of times, and that was circulated by the Office of Trade Negotiations, refers to market access and national treatment limitations, including Australian flag requirements. Many members who have heard me speak in the past would know that I have raised on many occasions the desire of the government to damage Australia's national flag. The government continually act in a way that undermines our industry and our jobs and that puts our coast at risk. They have made it quite clear that not only are they complacent about the option of foreign ships and foreign crews working on our coasts but they openly embrace it. Instead of saying, `Maybe we should go steadily and surely with this,' they open their arms and say, `You with the dodgy ships, please come on in. We'll be fine; don't worry about that.'</para><para>Although I am particularly concerned, I am not shocked that the government refuses to be very open in its consultations about what requests have been made of it, or that it would move towards the further deregulation of the Australian shipping industry and the further deregulation of our coast. I am very concerned that this secret negotiation will once more put our fleet, our jobs and our environment at substantial risk. There has been little effort to engage in public debate about how Australia might be proposing to respond, and there appears to have been a reluctance by the government to even permit one-on-one discussions. Its silence and its record speak for themselves. On this issue, we can only fear the worst.</para><para>In the small amount of time remaining to me, there are so many other things that I would like to touch on, but I do want to raise one particular issueâthat is, workplace relations. In my electorate, there is a meatworks called Blue Ribbon. This abattoir has been in the media on a number of occasions over the last couple of years. It has had consistent management changes and a couple of investigations into management operations. At each of these steps, we have seen the workers being put through an absolutely dreadful process of not knowing what their future is, not knowing whether they will have a job and certainly not knowing whether they will get their entitlements. Once again, these workers are faced with exactly that.</para><para>The company that has taken over management of this organisation now requires everybody to sign an individual contract which they are not yet allowed to see. If they do not sign that contract, their future is quite limited. It appears that the company says it can get away with this because these people are trainees; therefore, they are moving from a training contract to an employment contract, and the company has the right to offer them whatever it so chooses. The reality is that most of these people are on a traineeship, but most of them would be hard pushed to tell you whether they received any training. It appears that this organisation got a bit of a handout from the government in order to get some cheap staff. Now it has to pay the appropriate wages for the abattoir industry. The company does not seem prepared to pay them, so it is looking at some potentially very frightening agreements. I think if the agreement was above board and was able to be subject to scrutiny then the company would have no real concerns with putting it forward so that the workers could have a look and so that they could talk to organisations able to negotiate on their behalf. That is certainly not the process that has been gone through.</para><para>I want to point that out, because this is only a small workplace. It is a big workplace in our town, but looking at the big scheme of things it is only a small workplace. These are workers who do not have the power to argue for themselves very strongly because this is a competitive area of the market in which to get jobs. This government has, once again, failed to provide any kind of industrial relations framework which provides the workers with any protection. I think we have a right to expect that this government, when it talks about more jobs and better pay and about fairer systems, will provide those things for our community. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>12656</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe cognate debate on these bills, <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>, gives me an opportunity to make some observations on the government's priorities in the expenditure of taxpayers' money. In particular, in my own area and throughout Australia, we are very concerned about the collapse in bulk-billing that has occurred under the stewardship of this government. It does not really surprise me because in 1987 on the John Laws program and on the Alan Jones program the then Leader of the Opposition and now Prime Minister saidâand I can remember the words quite well because at the time I was working for the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawkeâ`Without punning too much, I will take a scalpel to Medicare.' He also said that he would tear it right apart. He described Medicare as a disaster, and he said that he would get rid of bulk-billing. These are long-cherished goals of the current Prime Minister; of course, with those statements he lost the 1987 election. He became a little bit wiser and more cunning as he got older and, as a consequence, ditched his overt plans to take a scalpel to Medicare, to tear it right apart, and replaced them with covert plans to dismantle Medicare by stealth.</para></talk.start><para>He is well under way in implementing his plan to dismantle Medicare by stealth. In fact, in my own electorate there has been a drop of 46,000 in the number of bulk-billed services just in the last two years. Logan Hospital is now being flooded with patients who ordinarily would be able to attend a GP. But because of the collapse in bulk-billing, they find that they cannot afford the up-front cost of going to a GP and, therefore, they are going to Logan Hospital's outpatients instead, putting it under unbearable pressure. I could spend an inordinate amount of time going through the statistics but the best demonstration of the statistics would, in fact, be a visit to Logan Hospital to see how much pressure that hospitalâin a low-income areaâis under as a result of the Prime Minister's stated goal of taking a scalpel to Medicare and tearing it right apart.</para><para>I contrast the unwillingness of this government to find any taxpayers' money that it might allocate to addressing the problem of the collapse in bulk-billing with its willingness to find money to finance an attack on Iraq. Today is a very dark day. In anticipation of this day, along with other concerned citizens in our local area, I organised a peace rally in Logan City just a couple of weeks ago. A number of people were organised to speakâand I was one of themâbut a number of other members of the community who had participated in our rally came forward and said that they would like an opportunity to say a few words about the war, which I had said at that time was virtually inevitable. One of those who came forward was a young lady who was a GP practising in Logan City. She made the very valid observation that it is amazing that this government can find money to fund an attack on Iraq but it cannot find money to address the collapse in bulk-billing and the doctor shortage in low-income areas. </para><para>I wish to comment on the merits of the argument that the government has put forward that the expenditure of taxpayers' money on an attack against Iraq is a worthy expenditure. That argument has no merit whatsoeverâit is a completely unworthy cause. It is, amongst other things, a waste of taxpayers' money; more fundamentally, it is a waste of human life. On this very black day in Australia's history, we see that a tragedy is about to unfold. On the Labor side we oppose the war. When I am asked, `Why do you oppose the war?' I say, `There is one very simple and compelling reason: it is wrong.' The war against Iraq is wrong. It has a number of disastrous consequences, one of which is that it completely undermines the operation and authority of the United Nations. </para><para>If this world is to have any chance of peace in the 21st century, it must rely on the authority of the United Nations. The United States, Great Britain and Australiaâin the actions that President Bush has taken, along with Prime Minister Tony Blair, and as relayed to Prime Minister John Howard as an instruction which he dutifully fulfilledâin turning their backs on the United Nations are helping to destroy it and are helping to destroy any prospect of peace in the world in the 21st century. The United Nations is our only hope for world peace. Once you start, as individual countries, saying that there are circumstances outside the United Nations and outside its charter which warrant an attack on a sovereign state, where does it stop? What do we say to North Korea if it continues along the path it is currently treading? Do we say that it is all right for the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia to attack Iraq but it is not all right for North Korea to attack another country? The world will be sent into chaos because there will be no rules governing the resolution of international conflict.</para><para>Saddam Hussein is a cruel dictator. He is a murderer, he has gassed and tortured his people and he continues to torture his people. In doing so, he has created a flow of refugees. But when these same refugees from Iraq arrive in Australia, the Australian government says that they are not genuine refugees. Government members stand up, day after day in this parliament, and point to the cruelty, the oppression and the torture of Saddam Husseinâbut when Iraqi refugees arrive in Australia they say they are not genuine refugees. I say that they cannot have it both ways, but this government always seeks to have it both ways.</para><para>The tragedy, of course, is that if it were not for the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>, if it were not for the government's manipulation of that incident and its role in helping create that incident, then we may not be at war today. It is arguable that the government's handling of the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> substantially boosted its vote at the last election and resulted in its return to power. And if it were not for some hanging chads in Florida, Republican President George Bush may not have been elected. So, but for some hanging chads and the entry of <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> into Australian territorial waters, we may not have a war. But, sadly, tragically, we do, because of the actions of American President George Bush and because Prime Minister John Howard has taken his instructions from President Bush.</para><para>Labor has said, repeatedly and consistently, that Saddam Hussein must be disarmed. But we equally say that the weapons inspections are working and that this is a war that is completely avoidable, unnecessary, immoral and wrong. Now, the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia are saying to the Iraqi people, `We are going to liberate you by bombing you, by killing thousands of innocent Iraqi women, children and men.' In this case, by attacking a sovereign state, the Australian government is the aggressor. It is attacking a sovereign state and it is validating attacks on sovereign states by other countries outside of the United Nations. We, the Australian Labor Party, support the Australian troops, but we oppose the government. We oppose, vehemently, the government's decision on this tragic day.</para><para>I despise, too, the treatment of this war by American citizen Rupert Murdoch and his News Ltd organisation, his editors and many of his journalists. They are portraying this as a video game. I have hereâonly by way of exampleâthe front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of last Saturday. It says, disgracefully, `Boom, boom, boom'. When we go to the story, it says that a White House official told the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline>:</para><quote><para>`Boom, we're going in hard and fast.'</para></quote><para>And get this. He says:</para><quote><para>`This time next week, sit by your TV and watch the fireworks.'</para></quote><para>This is an American White House official saying that there are going to be fireworks. This is blasting to death Iraqi women, children and men, yet American citizen Rupert Murdoch and his journalists are portraying this as some sort of fireworks display. This is not the Bicentenary of Australia. This is not the Olympics. This is the killing of innocent Iraqi women, children and men. Yet this disgraceful tabloid newspaper says, `Boom, boom, boom'. What does that say to children? That this is some sort of video game? When they see it on television, they are being told, `Have a look at the fireworks display.' What is this saying to Australian children? What sorts of values is it trying to impart on them? They will be confused as to whether this is real or some sort of video game. The big feature inside the newspaper says:</para><quote><para>The only thing missing when the bombs start dropping over Iraq will be the thumping crescendo of the <inline font-style="italic">1812 Overture</inline>. Pyotr Tchaikovsky could not have asked for a more spectacular light and sound show to accompany his legendary celebration of military might.</para></quote><para>This is a bloody disgrace! That is what American citizen Murdoch is trying to ram down our throats. Just the other day, the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> in Melbourne said, `Our war'. Our war! This should be no-one's war, but they say it is our war as if it is some romantic notion. The <inline font-style="italic">Guardian</inline> has done an analysis. Of Rupert Murdoch's media empire, it says, `How lucky can Murdoch get! He hires 175 editors and, by remarkable coincidence, they're all in support of the war.' We have 175 media outlets supporting the war and supporting American citizen Rupert Murdoch. Rupert Murdoch told America's <inline font-style="italic">Fortune</inline> magazine:</para><quote><para>... once it'sâ</para></quote><para>referring to Iraqâ</para><quote><para>behind us, the whole world will benefit from cheaper oil which will be a bigger stimulus than anything else.</para></quote><para>That is very consistent, of course, with his famous interview with the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> magazine, where he said:</para><quote><para>The greatest thing to come out of this for the world economy, if you could put it that way, would be $US20 a barrel for oil. That's bigger than any tax cut in any country.</para></quote><para>That is American citizen Murdoch's assessment of the case for war: it would cut the price of oil. Of course, if Labor were ever to dare mention that as a possible motivation, the Prime Minister and the foreign minister, beating their breasts, would say, `Oh, my goodness, how could you ever suggest that this war could have anything to do with the price of oil?' We do not need to, because American citizen Rupert Murdoch has done so. </para><para>Today in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> Dennis Shanahan said, in an article entitled `Howard winning own war at home', that the total number in favour of the war without United Nations support was 22 per cent. That is a great victory, isn't it? We have 71 per cent opposed, but this magazine, this rag, says, `Howard is really going well in getting the support of the Australian people for a war against Iraq.' He does not have the support of the Australian people and will not get the support of the Australian people, because they know that long ago John Howard signed up to the coalition of the willing, and that meant being willing to attack Iraq with or without United Nations support. And he just waited and waited for his instructions to come from President Bush, and they came by phone from Air Force One from a meeting that Australia did not even attend.</para><para>The Prime Minister has handed over the foreign policy of this country to the US administration. Not only that, he has handed over other important matters for Australia. We know that the negotiations currently under way on a trade dealâeuphemistically called a free trade agreement with the United Statesâare directly related to Australia's acquiescence and subservience on the war against Iraq. Just as Australians know that John Howard signed up months ago to the coalition of the willing and a war with Iraq, with or without the support of the United Nations, they know that this is part of the deal. He was dishonest with the Australian people then, and he is dishonest now. Just yesterday, when denying Labor's correct allegations that these two are very deeply entangled, he said that he saw the two things as quite separate. He is denying statements by his own trade minister and his own foreign minister, and I will just give a couple of examples of those statements. His trade minister said: </para><quote><para>... an FTA would help engender a broader appreciationâin both countriesâof our alliance and our common role in helping underpin the stability and prosperity of East Asia and the Pacific. This is now doubly important given the nature of the threats to securityâand especially to Western interestsâin the region. </para></quote><para>The deputy sheriff sentiment is alive and well in this government. I will not go through all of these statements, but I will point out that the foreign minister delivered a speech called `The strategic advantages of a free trade agreement with the United States'. Then government members look down the camera and say, `We've never said that; we've never linked these two.' Of course a trade deal with the United States and a war against Iraq are linked, and neither are in Australia's national interest. When will this Prime Minister start behaving in Australia's national interest instead of in the national interest of other countries?</para><para>The sad reality is that, in making these decisions, the Prime Minister has compromised our trade policy and he is also ultimately compromising the alliance with the United States. I support the alliance with the United StatesâI always have; I am a strong supporter of itâbut article 1 of the ANZUS Treaty, the alliance document, says that we must go through the United Nations in resolving international conflict. If the Prime Minister has done anything to the alliance, he has torn up the ANZUS Treaty by ignoring article 1. Now he is entering into a trade deal with the United States that will be discriminatory in its nature. That is what this deal is. It is a deal that will have special arrangements, special market access, between Australia and the United States to the exclusion of East Asia. </para><para>You would think that this Prime Minister had already done enough damage to our relations with East Asia by offering to bomb themâfor example, through pre-emptive strikesâan offer that I am sure is going to be declined. He has done enormous damage with his remarks that he sees Australia as the deputy sheriff to the United States in this region. Now he wants to continue the damage by negotiating a discriminatory trade deal with the United States that excludes the countries of East Asia. What are they going to think about this? I was in China recently, and I know what they are thinking about it. A senior government member told me that it reinforces impressions that Australia no longer considers itself to be a part of this region. The Prime Minister is treading a very dangerous path in entangling trade policy with the military alliance. All it is going to do is further antagonise Australians towards the alliance because, when they find out that this is not going to be a free trade agreement at all, that we will not get unfettered access to the American market, Australians will say, `We've been dudded again by the Americans.'</para><para>I am pro-American, but this administration and the Howard government are reckless in their behaviour not only on trade policy but also fundamentally on the policy of a war against Iraq. The Prime Minister of Australia has today, in his public declaration of support for this war against Iraqâin fulfilling a private commitment made ages agoâdramatically increased the risk of a terrorist attack on this country or on Australians overseas. We are one of only three countries that has formed this disgraceful coalition of the willingâthat is, willing to attack Iraq without the support of the United Nations and willing to kill Iraqi women and children.

Estimates of the number of North Korean in China illegally at any one time seeking food, shelter and work range from several thousands to hundreds of thousands.</para><para>(3)	Yes.  The Australian Embassy in Beijing has reported to the Australian Government on the plight of DPRK refugees.  However it is difficult to obtain hard information on this matter as the Chinese government restricts access its border regions contiguous with the DPRK and DPRK refugees seek to conceal their presence in China.  Australia has also raised the issue of the treatment of returned DPRK border-crossers with the DPRK.  However Australian (and other) diplomats do not have the freedom of travel and access to investigate the plight of returned refugees in the DPRK. </para><para>(4)	China regards those crossing the border illegally from the DPRK not as asylum-seekers but as illegal economic migrants, and seeks to return them in accordance with its bilateral agreement with the DPRK on cross-border movements. </para><para>(5)	China has allowed safe-passage for a small number of DPRK citizens to travel on to third countries.  South Korea has accepted a total of 3131 North Korean defectors since the end of the Korea War, many of whom have come to South Korea from China via a third-country transit. </para><para>(6)	North Korea has said that returned border-crossers faced no consequences on return.  Other commentators claim that returned refugees face possible months or years of incarceration.  There have been no confirmed reports of execution.  </para><para>(7)	Australia has discussed these issues informally with the UNHCR.  The Chinese government is aware of Australia's views on these matters. </para><para>(8)	The UNHCR is working to establish a mechanism, in cooperation with China, for it to screen DPRK asylum-seekers in China.

China is a member of the UNHCR Executive.</para><para>(11)	An instrument covering the expeditious arbitration over differences in refugee policy is a standard inclusion when a UNHCR office is opened in a country.

Australia is not, however, in a position to verify such assurances.  For that the Government looks to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as the body mandated to verify countries' compliance with their NPT safeguards agreements.  Australia is a strong supporter of the IAEA and its system of nuclear safeguards.  </para><para>(3)	Yes.  Australia has a good working relationship with Iran, which includes dialogue on arms control and disarmament issues.  Australia will continue to urge Iran to conclude an Additional Protocol to its safeguards agreement with the IAEA, which would enable the IAEA to apply strengthened safeguards measures in Iran, particularly aimed at providing assurance there are no undeclared nuclear activities.  Accepting an Additional Protocol would be an important means by which Iran could assure the international community that it is engaged solely in peaceful nuclear activities.</para><para>(4)	Yes.  In bilateral contacts with both North Korea and Iran, the Government regularly raises its concerns about the development and export of missiles and related technology, particularly with reference to ballistic missile systems capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction.  </para><para>(5)	The Government is aware of speculation that firms or individuals from countries other than North Korea may have been involved in the supply of missile-related technology, materials or expertise to Iran.  Publicly available reports indicate that Russian and Chinese entities may have been so involved.  It should be noted that many countries, including Russia and China, apply controls on the transfer of certain items, materials and technologies to prevent the proliferation of missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction.  However, commercial activities that could contribute to missile programs may sometimes occur without the knowledge of governments. </para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Bingzhang, Mr Wang</title><page.no>12855</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1470)</subtitle><id.no>1470</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>12855</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Danby</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 February 2003:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Is he aware that on 10 February 2003 a Chinese court convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment a US based dissident, Wang Binzhang, on spying and terrorism charges.</para><para>(2)	Is he aware that Mr Wang was only brought to trial after being kidnapped by Chinese State Security whilst Mr Wang was in Vietnam.</para><para>(3)	Can he confirm that the Beijing authorities arrested Mr Wang for terrorist activities, activities that were in fact the organisation of a pro-democracy political party and the publication of a pro-democracy magazine.</para><para>(4)	Is he able to give any credence to the charges on which Mr Wang was convicted, namely that he was (a) organising and leading a terrorist group, (b) passing military secrets to Taiwan, (c) plotting to blow up the Chinese Embassy in Thailand and (d) advocating assassination and kidnapping in internet essays.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>12855</page.no><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Downer</name><name.id>4G4</name.id><electorate>Mayo</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows :</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Yes.</para><para>(2)	I am aware of unconfirmed reports claiming that Mr Wang Bingzhang was kidnapped by Chinese State Security.

took the opportunity during the visit of the President of Greece to Australia in June last year publicly to reiterate the government's position.  While in the end the return of the Parthenon marbles is a matter to be resolved between the Greek and British Governments, we will continue at appropriate opportunities to draw the attention of the United Kingdom to the strong community feeling in Australia in support of the Greek Government's contention that the marbles should be returned.</para><para>(2)	Prime Minister Blair took careful note of our position and told me at Coolum that he understood the feelings in Australia on this issue.  Both President Stephanopoulos, during his 6 June 2002 visit to Canberra, and Prime Minister Simitis in our 4 July 2002 talks in Athens, officially registered with me the Greek Government's strong appreciation of the stand we have taken.  The Australian Hellenic Council has also honoured me with its 2002 Nike Award , partly in recognition of the government's position on the return of the Parthenon Marbles to Athens.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs: Israel</title><page.no>12860</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1517)</subtitle><id.no>1517</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>12860</page.no><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Quick</name><name.id>AV5</name.id><electorate>Franklin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 13 February 2003:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	What has been Australia's response to the continued violation of international law and UN resolutions by Israel.</para><para>(2)	Has the Government made any protest regarding breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention by Israel in relation to (a) the confiscation of land and construction of settlements, (b) extra-judicial killings and assassinations of persons in the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza and (c) the destruction of homes in a manner which resulted in the death of a 65 year old woman in Gaza in early February 2003.</para><para>(3)	Is he aware of reported plans by Israel to deport Palestinian leaders; if so, will Australia caution Israel against deportations.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>12860</page.no><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Downer</name><name.id>4G4</name.id><electorate>Mayo</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	We have continued to call on Israel, in the UN and other forums to abide by international law and UN resolutions.</para><para>(2)	Australia has consistently supported resolutions in the General Assembly of the United Nations on the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the occupied territories, the most recent being UN Resolution 57/125 of November 2002 when we voted in favour of the Fourth Committee resolution on the applicability of the Geneva Convention to the occupied territories.</para><para>	(a)	Yes.
