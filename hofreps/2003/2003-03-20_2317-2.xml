The pre-eminent issue for this parliament, and our obligation as representatives of all Australians, is national and global security—not Iraq. As one paper editorial pointed out last year:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Australians do not need to be persuaded that Saddam Hussein is an evil despot who kills and oppresses his own people and whose regime is a threat to his neighbours. That is true of the leadership of perhaps a third of the world's nations ...</para></quote><para>Modern terrorism is without doubt the No. 1 security issue. A war with Iraq distorts and dangerously undermines that critical security priority.</para><para>It is a disgrace that this government has restricted members of parliament in this debate to half the usual speaking time on a decision which is the most significant any nation can take—to send its citizens to war. That is typical of the Howard style of government. I have previously spoken in this House and outside it against plans for war with Iraq. Because of time restrictions, I will not repeat many of the points I have previously made, although they are relevant today.</para><para>This war, without UN support, will worsen national and global security. That view has been expressed by distinguished Australians like General Peter Gration, former Chief of the Defence Force; senior Office of National Assessments analyst Andrew Wilkie, who resigned in protest over this government's push to war; and Ray Funnell, former Chief of the Air Force, who last week said on ABC Radio that what the Prime Minister has done `... is he's followed, almost in lock step a man who has demonstrated ... strategic stupidity. And I refer here to President Bush.'</para><para>For the first time in our nation's history, Australia will be the aggressor; invading another nation. This government is subserviently following America on a path of strategic stupidity. Strategic stupidity: that is the damning—and accurate—assessment of one of Australia's most respected and senior military figures, ignored by this Howard government.</para><para>In the US, similar concerns have been expressed by General Brent Scowcroft, former National Security Adviser to Republican Presidents Ford and Bush Sr; by General Zinni; by General Clark; and by many senior members of the military and the legislature. Veteran US Senator Edward Kennedy said earlier this month:</para><quote><para>Surely, we cannot afford to shatter the very coalition we need in order to combat the obviously greater and more imminent threat we face from Al Qaeda and its terrorists ...</para><para>...				...				...</para><para>Two weeks after 9/11, Secretary Rumsfeld claimed that we had “bulletproof” evidence of the link. But a year later, CIA Director Tenet conceded in a letter to the Senate Intelligence Committee that the Administration's understanding of the link was still “evolving” and was based on “sources of varying reliability.”</para><para>In fact, the link is so widely doubted that intelligence experts have expressed their concern that intelligence is being politicized to support the rush to war.</para><para>The Bush Administration was wrong to allow the anti-Iraq zealots in its ranks to exploit the 9/11 tragedy by using it to make war against Iraq a higher priority than the war against terrorism.</para></quote><para>The US Senate's longest serving member, Robert Byrd, has commented:</para><quote><para>The President is on the wrong track in insisting on rushing into war without the support of the international community, and specifically the United Nations. Not only is America's reputation on the line, but so is our war on terror.</para></quote><para>Put simply, those who advocate war have failed to present any credible evidence of links between Iraq and terrorists. Liberals who have claimed otherwise think they have better information than the CIA and the US Senate intelligence committee. They should give them a ring. In fact, they are desperately promoting misconceptions and lies to prop up the case for war. </para><para>Perversely and dishonestly, this government claims that war with Iraq is needed to provide support for the UN—the same UN that President Bush has badgered, threatened and now ignored. Their logic is that we should support the UN by starting a war that the UN does not support. That is simply idiotic. US Senator Byrd has attacked the Bush administration's diplomacy and this point by saying:</para><quote><para>The world is now wondering, which is the greater threat to the relevance of the U.N.: a rogue nation that flaunts the will of the international community; or a permanent member of the Security Council that views the institution as useless unless it submits to its will? ... More threats of U.N. irrelevance will only portray the United States as a bully superpower.</para></quote><para>Air Marshal Funnell made similar comments:</para><quote><para>If you look back to the 12th September 2001 and the immediate aftermath of that horrific event in New York and Washington, President Bush was leading a nation that was united in a great and deserved cause and he was supported without reservations by the nations of the world and by the UN. And contrast that with today, just 18 months later, his nation is divided, most of the world is against him, alliances are crumbling, multi-national institutions that have been developed over decades are under enormous pressure and how do President Bush and his egregious Secretary of Defence react? They react by trumpeting we don't need any of you.'</para></quote><para>Ray Funnell continued:</para><quote><para>Well, I'm sorry, Mr President but you do. I mean, if you want to remain leader of the free world you have to be something more than just a military superpower and a diplomatic bully. Leadership requires more than just telling people what to do or else—but that's the way he goes about it.</para></quote><para>The sad but inescapable truth is that this push to war without UN support risks undermining the UN itself and the system of international peace and order that Australia, as a middle-ranking power, relies on. </para><para>Those who support this war of invasion have even argued that we need to go to war with Iraq to teach North Korea a lesson. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have used this ploy. I find it frightening that anyone in a position of responsibility could be so shallow and ignorant as to suggest that as a basis for international relations, much less a campaign of war. In fact, what it does is to highlight just how much this war with Iraq distorts our genuine security priorities.</para><para>Perhaps most dishonestly, the government now asserts that war is needed on humanitarian grounds to protect Iraqi citizens—Iraqis just like the ones fleeing persecution on the MV <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>. This government went to extraordinary lengths to deny them the chance to be considered as refugees in Australia. Does anyone really believe that the same government that turned its back on these refugees is now asking us go to war to protect the refugees' brothers and sisters who are still in Iraq? Indeed, these humanitarian concerns have been notably absent from the UN resolutions. They have been injected into the debate in recent weeks by increasingly desperate politicians facing strong opposition from their own people.</para><para>If the case for war is so strong, why is it that only three of the 190 nations in the UN have committed troops to it? Why aren't the 30-plus nations who joined together in 1991 to remove Saddam Hussein from Kuwait with us today? Why aren't the Islamic nations who supported the 1991 Gulf War with us today? Why aren't the scores of nations involved in the war against al-Qaeda in Afghanistan with us today? Why aren't our neighbours, who supported the war on terror and who have worked with us so closely both before the Bali bombing and since, with us today? Why aren't the nations of the world—virtually all of whom supported the war on terror following September 11—with us today? How has the Bush administration turned the support and sympathy of the world for America following September 11—including from many of its traditional foes—into open anger and defiance?</para><para>Liberal politicians like to dismiss these criticisms by saying that Labor is anti-American. Are they saying that Ray Funnell and Peter Gration are anti-American? Are US Senators Kennedy and Byrd anti-American? Is former federal Liberal Party President John Valder, whom I have quoted in earlier speeches, anti-American? That claim by our opponents is self-evident nonsense and the refuge of those who have nothing but fear and smear to support their case. Instead of sending our troops halfway around the world to invade Iraq, we should be working with our allies and friends in our region and around the globe to deal with terrorists who were responsible for acts such as September 11 and the Bali bombings. That must be our security priority—whether George W. Bush likes it or not.</para><para>In the seconds remaining, I want to record my support, and that of my constituents, for our troops. I wish them a speedy and safe return. My heart and best wishes are with them. We know they will perform their duties with courage and valour. Make no mistake, they and their families have our unconditional support. It is those responsible for this war, not our troops, who deserve our criticism. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Latham</name></talker><para>—The war party.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ET4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bevis, Arch, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEVIS</name></talker><para>—It is this Liberal government and this Prime Minister—as the member for Werriwa said, the war party—who deserve our condemnation, and it is they who will face the anger of an increasingly concerned Australian population.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>13088</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The invasion by Australia of another country is the most grave action that this nation can take to oppose that country and its policies. This parliament is asked to support such action, which may begin in three hours time from now. In addressing that question as a parliamentarian, I am conscious of the concerns and representations of my electors. Each of their communications to me—both for and against action—I am personally responding to: as an officer in the reserves of the armed forces of this country, I am conscious of the welfare of our serving men and women and their families; as a proponent in this place 12 months ago of the International Criminal Court, and as a barrister who practised extensively in international law before entering parliament, I am conscious of the importance of the lawfulness of any military strike by Australia; as a parent and husband, I am conscious of the long-term consequences of failure and error; as a representative of the people, I know that I must ultimately act on the basis of what I believe to be the right course. That course is set out in the motion moved by the Prime Minister in the House, and I endorse it. </para></talk.start><para>The opposition opposes the motion, but an examination of its amendment shows that it agrees with the government on two fundamental points. First, it agrees that the basic objective for Australia's policy towards Iraq is `that Iraq must disarm'—to quote from the opposition amendment and the government proposal. Second, and for this I am gratified, both sides accept that the Australian service men and women involved in the conflict have the unequivocal support and full confidence of the parliament.</para><para>The difference comes down to legal authority. Those opposite claim that only a UN-led force may disarm Iraq. I disagree. In my view, UN authority to disarm Iraq already exists. In 1990, Security Council resolution 678 authorised military action against Iraq. It authorised the use of all necessary means to liberate Kuwait and to restore international peace and security in the area. The military action was spectacularly successful. As a term of the cease-fire, which was expressly requested by Iraq on or shortly after 3 April 1991, Iraq agreed unconditionally to destroy, render harmless and remove all of its chemical and biological weapons. So much is recorded in resolution 687. Similar conditions related to other weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>However, Iraq did not disarm. Then, in 1998, we had Operation Desert Fox—the military action by the US and some of its allies against Iraq attempting to enforce disarmament. It was supported in the Australian parliament by the Labor opposition. There was no doubt whatsoever on any side that the legal authority for that action, principally by the Clinton administration, derived from the terms of resolution 678.</para><para>In November 2002 a further Security Council resolution, numbered 1441 and passed unanimously, accepted that Iraq was in `serious breach' of its obligations recorded in 16 previous resolutions. That resolution is still in effect today. It means that Iraq has breached the conditions of the 1991 cease-fire. It also means military force to secure the objectives of the UN is authorised. It was true in 1998, and it is true today. It is also commonsense that ignoring basic cease-fire conditions ought not be permitted by any responsible UN member state, nor by the UN itself.</para><para>In 1991, it was the Hawke Labor government that decided to join the US-led Operation Desert Storm. It was the Hawke government that accepted the cease-fire and its terms which Saddam has now broken repeatedly. In 1995, when it was necessary to threaten military action against Saddam because of his failure to cooperate fully with weapons inspectors, the Keating Labor government supported that course on the basis I have set out. In 1998, the then Labor opposition, led by the member for Kingsford-Smith, who now so noisily opposes war, strongly endorsed the military action against Iraq on the same basis. Now, when the Howard government prepares to finish the task of disarming Iraq, Labor opportunistically opposes it.</para><para>This is Bob Hawke's war, and the coalition is finishing the job he failed to do. It is not the first time that Labor has spectacularly failed Australia's foreign policy interests. It did so over East Timor, when it abandoned the striven people of that country 30 years ago. Only the coalition has the moral courage to do what is right—right for Australia, its people and for the world.</para><para>The real position of the opposition is that it has no position. It has manufactured a legal excuse to hide its foreign policy failures and to exploit what it sees is a mass of potential supporters which it supposes is opposed to government policy. Michael Costello, the former chief of staff to the member for Brand, let the cat out of the bag on the ABC last week when he said: </para><quote><para>This is the simplest international issue I have ever seen. It is clear, uncomplicated, straightforward, the legal authority is there.</para></quote><para>The ALP has again shown that it is a failed, irrelevant institution and that it will not address the real interests and concerns of the Australian people nor of the world. This debate, if nothing else, proves that the member for Hotham leads a pathetic rabble.</para><para>Now let me address the real opposition, the left-wing political establishment in this country which wields such influence in the media and in our educational and professional bodies. These are the members of the postmaterialist left and the cynical left who staff the political desks of some media outlets, some unions and some professional bodies. They are intellectual despots who do not believe in the Australian value of a fair go.</para><para>The first attack of this opposition is that the government course lacks all credibility because it is supported only by the USA and the UK. It is hard to think of any other nations I would want to see ourselves allied with more. Our three nations have been beacons of justice and have carried the banner for world peace and international prosperity more than any others. We should be proud to be so allied. But in fact there are 27 additional countries which have joined the coalition to disarm Iraq, and I seek leave to table a list of those countries.</para><para>Leave granted. </para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name></talker><para>—I thank the House. Almost all of these countries have been oppressed by dictators and state-imposed terrorist regimes. They know what it is like to feel the heel of a killer like Saddam. There are 15 other nations which have indicated their logistical support, and now even the skittish French, who derailed the UN peace process, have publicly stated that they will support the effort if Saddam uses his ugly weapons of mass destruction.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This other opposition attack by alleging that Saddam is not so bad, that what he has done he did in the interests of Baath socialism, and that Australia is just as bad by denying entry to Iraqi refugees fleeing his regime. That latter assertion is incorrect, as the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has shown in detailed responses in this House. Their argument also fails to address the point that, if Saddam is overturned as a result of his wicked recalcitrance, persecution of Iraqis will cease and that refugees can, if they wish, return home. But, most grossly, it fails to address the horrible record of abuse of human rights in Iraq by Saddam and his nefarious sons, which was set out in the addresses of others in this House, including the member for Bennelong and the member for Higgins.</para><para>Another criticism is that this action will invite terrorist activity against Australia. The member for Batman joined this attack, predicting that road transport, ships and trains would be blown up. There is no evidence of this, and the true position is that all Western nations are vulnerable to international terrorists, as is shown by the German nationals blown apart in Tunisia and the French nationals killed in Pakistan. These incidents show why it is necessary for all right-thinking nations to act to make the world a more secure place. Australia cannot escape notice by rolling itself up into a little ball and hoping that the world will not see us. The world changed on 11 September 2001 and, sadly, several of my constituents were reminded of that by the terrorist acts in Bali on 12 October 2002.</para><para>We cannot dismiss lightly the possibility, which I believe to be real, that Saddam's weapons of mass destruction could fall into the hands of terrorists. He has a record of supporting financially suicide bombers in Israel, who have wreaked such terrible havoc on so many innocent people, and we know that terrorist cells have operated with immunity in parts of Iraq.</para><para>Finally, let me speak of a better future for Iraq and this country's relations with a free Iraq. I look forward, as the result of our action, to a new tradition of Arabic democracy in the Middle East. I look forward to the day when the people of Iraq can enjoy the financial benefits of their oil reserves and wells to increase their standard of living and amenity. I warmly encourage the Iraqi groups in Australia who have contacted me, including the Assyrian Church of the East, with proposals for Australians to lead the humanitarian programs to rebuild Iraq, so that Australia is remembered in that unfortunate country not only as liberators but also for our record of kindness and support. This would be consistent with Australia's great tradition for standing up for the underdog, the weak and the downtrodden. I urge all Australians to move forward with the Australian government in that great endeavour to forge a new Iraq.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>13090</page.no><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name><name.id>83S</name.id><electorate>Chisholm</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—When I was first considering running for parliament and facing the prospect of sitting in this chamber, the things in my mind were domestic issues: high-quality, affordable health care for all Australians, affordable education, fair and compassionate government services, a just taxation system, support of those in need and concern for my constituents in Chisholm. What I did not dwell on was the prospect of debating the commitment of Australian forces to war. And the first thing that I want to do is to send my best wishes and prayers for the safety of our Australian troops overseas. They have my support and appreciation for their commitment to Australia and their profession as military personnel. My objections to the actions of this government are in no way a reflection on or criticism of Australian service personnel. They do Australia proud.</para></talk.start><para>That being said, I do not believe that the government should have committed Australia and, subsequently, Australian troops, to armed conflict. The commitment of Australia to any armed conflict must be a decision of last resort. But that is not the case with the government's actions this week. Diplomacy and actions in which the entire world community are able to act cohesively must be our objective. Unfortunately, the US administration appears to be ignoring world opinion—holding a view that, unless the Security Council agrees with the United States, then the Security Council is wrong.</para><para>Over the last few years the US has exercised a number of vetoes while sitting in the Security Council chamber. As a permanent member, it was the right of the US to do so. In fact, six of the last eight vetoes at the Security Council have been exercised by the United States. So the US has no fundamental objection to a veto. Importantly, at no time did the exercise of the veto by the US constitute a failure of the United Nations or a demonstration that its processes were unworkable. The structure of the United Nations Security Council is such that, for any action to be authorised by the council, the concurrence of all five permanent members is required—the five declared nuclear nations. Throughout the history of the United Nations, this has avoided any permanent member using their status to coerce the council into acting against the wishes of any member. This has ensured that Security Council approval for military action is a very high bar to jump—approval is not automatic.</para><para>That the Security Council did not accept the draft proposal recently put forward by the US, Britain and Spain indicates that the case for war was not proven. But the current US administration seems to hold a different view when other permanent members are exercising a veto. This had been described as a failure of the Security Council. This is a view that I do not share. I think it critical that every attempt is made to remove weapons of mass destruction from Iraq by peaceful means before considering military conflict. The UN gives us the legal and moral authority to undertake military actions. It shows that the body whose charter is to safeguard world security has collectively reached a decision, with the approval of all five declared nuclear powers, to act in the interest of world security. And, in the absence of such a determination by the members of the United Nations Security Council, further efforts should be put toward diplomatic solutions, such as increased weapons inspections. Instead, the US has committed itself to war.</para><para>The disastrous consequence for us here in Australia is that the Prime Minister has, at the behest of US President George Bush—in one lone phone call—also committed us to military conflict. This is not a conflict that we are undertaking to preserve or defend Australia. This is not a conflict that we are undertaking to repel an aggressor of a sovereign nation. This is not a conflict that we are undertaking as a result of a determination of the United Nations Security Council that the world community must act to preserve world peace. This is a conflict we are undertaking because the Prime Minister of Australia was willing to go all the way with the USA and did not even consider Australia's broader interest beyond the US alliance.</para><para>In the absence of a UN Security Council resolution, the only reason I can see for Australia to enter armed conflict is if our nation or one of our allies is facing imminent attack. Prior to this action being decided 48 hours ago, Iraq was not, in the foreseeable future, planning to attack either Australia or one of our allies. Neither has Iraq been implicated with the attack in the US on September 11 nor in the bombing of Bali. Australia should not be committing our armed forces to military conflict in Iraq. We should be actively engaging in diplomatic dialogue to reduce both the risk of war and the risk posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Iraq does not pose a direct threat to us or our allies. We are not in clear or present danger of attack from Iraq. The Prime Minister's tortured argument that Iraq's weapons pose a threat to us through their possible use by a third party is not logical. If such a potential was the only cause for action, the presence of international weapons inspectors removes the danger. One email I received summed it up nicely. It said:</para><quote><para>Today in a televised interview Mr Howard asks, “What is the alternative to war?” and in the next news item Chief Weapons Inspector Hans Blix gives him the answer as he expresses his disappointment that the weapons inspections were not given more time and that the “impatience” of some put an end to a process that was working.</para></quote><para>Indeed, last night Hans Blix yet again addressed the Security Council expressing his disappointment at curtailing a process that was working and had been delivering outcomes.</para><para>Australia's interest is served through our strong engagement in multilateral forums such as the United Nations and through our strong support for our alliance with the United States. This is not an anti-US stance. Our support of the UN and our support of the US are not mutually exclusive. We are able to disagree with our friend and ally America while maintaining and valuing the ANZUS treaty. There is nothing that compels us to act, in this case against our national interest, with the US in Iraq. As a good friend we can disagree. Instead, the Prime Minister has chosen to support unilateralism over the collective security that is afforded to Australia through our UN engagement. He has chosen to place Australia and Australians in danger through his commitment to this conflict.</para><para>I urge the Prime Minister and all members of his government to rethink this commitment and question deep within themselves whether they genuinely believe this to be in Australia's best interest. I certainly believe the constituencies of all members of this House are also urging them to do just that. I certainly do not, and the majority of Australians do not, support the course of action that the Prime Minister has sent us hurtling down. The majority of Australians are opposed to the government's actions. Yes, Saddam Hussein is a despotic leader, yes he has committed atrocities, and yes he should be disarmed—but not by unilateral aggression. This does not stop terrorism; it in fact gives the green light to other nations to say, `Aggression is okay. You just mount a supposedly logical argument and you can embark on a unilateral action; you can invade another nation-state.' Terrific: India and Pakistan can now have a legitimate war over the disputed territories of Kashmir—both countries with nuclear weaponry. We give the green light to South Korea or North Korea to decide to embark on military conflict. Who next? What next?</para><para>Where is the voice of reason from the Liberal Party? Where is the spirited defence of the sanctity of human life from those opposite in the chamber? We have heard nothing but silence. Not even a lone voice has been heard in dissent from the backbench in respect of the Prime Minister's stance. I despair at the lack of individualism shown by the defenders of free choice in the government. Where is the doubt, the concern and the understanding of their constituents' views? They have been silenced in defence of an indefensible act.</para><para>I trust our service personnel are quickly and safely returned to their loved ones in Australia. I condemn the actions of this government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>13092</page.no><name role="metadata">Georgiou, Petro, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GEORGIOU</name><name.id>HM5</name.id><electorate>Kooyong</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This motion commits our troops to disarming Iraq, by force if necessary. It is the weightiest motion to have come before this House in a very long time. The resort to force, with its risks and the prospect of casualties, both civilian and military, is something that everyone in this House abhors. For a considerable period we all hoped that this would not come to pass, and that a peaceful resolution would be achieved. It is a cause of immense distress that these hopes have been dashed. </para></talk.start><para>Many elements come together to precipitate a commitment to military action, but the fundamental element here is Iraq's refusal to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction. Under the 1991 cease-fire that brought an end to Iraq's war of aggression, and the terms of which were incorporated in UN Security Council resolution 687, Iraq unconditionally committed to the destruction of its weapons of mass destruction. The succeeding 12 years have seen nothing less than a sustained resistance by the Iraqi government to all international efforts to enforce UN resolution 687. Despite every United Nations sanction and every incentive for compliance, Iraq remains in substantial breach of its obligations to unconditionally remove, destroy or render useless all of its chemical and biological weapons, and to fully declare and verify this. </para><para>Such has been the success of Iraq's resistance that noncompliance has come to be seen as the norm. The reality is that without the commitment of the Bush and Blair administrations at the Security Council, and the massing of forces on the Iraqi borders, there would have been no readmission of weapons inspectors. And despite the massing of such forces Iraq has still not accepted the need to fully disarm. As chief weapons inspector Blix reported to the United Nations in January:</para><quote><para>Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance—not even today—of the disarmament, which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and to live in peace. </para></quote><para>In recent months the limited success that the weapons inspectors who have re-entered Iraq have had is not due to any sudden Iraqi conversion. As Dr Blix said in his March report: </para><quote><para>It is obvious that, while the numerous initiatives, which are now taken by the Iraqi side with a view to resolving some long-standing open disarmament issues, can be seen as `active' or even `proactive', these initiatives 3-4 months into the new resolution cannot be said to constitute `immediate' cooperation. </para></quote><para>It is a cause of great regret that the commitment to forcibly disarm Iraq has been made without a further resolution in the Security Council. This further resolution is something that I, and a large number of others, believed to be desirable and that could contribute to Iraq's peaceful disarmament. But, although united on the need to disarm Iraq, the Security Council was unable to agree on a further resolution. There will be a variety of explanations for this manifest breakdown in diplomacy, and some have expressed the fear that this spells the end of the United Nations' relevance. But the United Nations is a complex and robust institution with enormous capacities. It is in all our interests that it be sustained and strengthened. The role of the United Nations in the reconstruction of Iraq has been foreshadowed, and the fact is that the authority for the use of force does rest on existing United Nations Security Council resolutions. </para><para>The legal basis for the authority to forcibly disarm Iraq is succinctly set out in the UK Attorney-General's statement, and at rather greater length in the joint advice to the Australian government by the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Resolution 678 of 1990 authorised member states `to use all necessary means to uphold' the demand that Iraq quit Kuwait `and all subsequent relevant resolutions and to restore international peace and security in the area'. The cease-fire conditions embodied in resolution 687 of 1991 bound Iraq to disarm itself of weapons of mass destruction. Resolution 1441 of 2002 found Iraq to be in material breach of its disarmament obligations but gave Iraq a final opportunity to comply with those obligations. Continuing noncompliance has reactivated the authorisation contained in resolution 678 for member states to use all necessary means to achieve Iraq's compliance. </para><para>On the issue of unilateral action, it is important to put on the record the judgment of Dr Michael Costello, an incisive critic of American doctrines of unilateralism and pre-emptive war. Dr Costello has said: </para><quote><para>... it's action that's authorised by the resolution of 1990, ... so in that sense it's not unilateral action ... 			...			...</para><para>... if we support the multilateral system, we should urge the UN to do this and even if they don't vote there's legal authority to do it and we should insist that its decisions are implemented. </para></quote><para>Iraq, under its leader Saddam Hussein, maintains an abhorrent system that represses, murders and persecutes its population. There are many such regimes and rulers throughout the world. But, as I have said previously, there is no prerogative under international law to remove such governments at will. There are arguments that Iraq should have been given more time to comply with the United Nations, and some have argued that, even without compliance with United Nations resolutions, the containment of Iraq could continue indefinitely. But the reality that is now transparent is that the Iraqi leadership will not disarm peacefully. Iraq has displayed no intention of doing this—not in the face of 17 Security Council resolutions, not in the face of international sanctions, not in the face of international condemnation, and not in the face of the threat of force. Resiling now in the face of enduring Iraqi intransigence would undermine international stability and embolden terrorists and extremists. And, as the Prime Minister has said, if we do not deal with rogue states acquiring weapons of mass destruction, the chances of such weapons falling into the hands of terrorists and being used by them against us inevitably increases. </para><para>As I have said, disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction is the cause for military action against Iraq. I deeply regret that, inevitably, military action to achieve this risks bringing suffering to innocent people. I sincerely hope that this will be limited. But so appalling is the character of the Iraqi government, and its repression and murder of the people of Iraq, that the use of force to disarm Iraq carries with it the prospect that in the future the suffering of the Iraqi people will be greatly relieved and their human rights secured. </para><para>I know that, just as there is not consensus in the international community about action on Iraq, neither is there unanimity in the Australian community. This reflects the very difficult nature of this problem. There is disagreement between the parties. But despite these differences on policy, we do need to unite and I believe we are all uniting in support of the Australian troops who are deployed in the Persian Gulf. I voice the sentiments of countless others in wishing our forces a safe, short and successful mission. Our thoughts are with them and their families.</para><para>I want to acknowledge the concerns that have been expressed to me by constituents of the Kooyong electorate and others. Inevitably, they will not all agree with what I have said on this subject, but I would like them to know that I have taken their concerns into account and I have not come to my position lightly. </para><para>Many commentators anticipate that any armed conflict will be brief. I hope that these anticipations prove correct. Rebuilding and stabilising Iraq, however, will be a burden that the international community will have to carry in the longer term. The people of Iraq will need not just immediate and wide-ranging humanitarian aid, but also substantial support and assistance in the years to come. The rebuilding of Iraq will be a responsibility that the international community should not shirk. I commend the motion to the House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>13094</page.no><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MELHAM</name><name.id>4T4</name.id><electorate>Banks</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are now in the final countdown to war. In a few hours the clock will tick down on George Bush's ultimatum. Shortly thereafter, the killing will begin. We will see the beginning of an overwhelming military offensive. This will be the most intense and ferocious bombing campaign in history, designed in the words of the US military to shock and awe Iraq into submission. </para></talk.start><para>Much has been made of the advances in military technology since the 1991 Gulf War. The US military certainly have many more so-called smart bombs—weapons that will supposedly focus the attack on the Iraqi military and Saddam Hussein's regime. As in 1991, we will see selected video images of the attacks, but this time they will be displayed at the US Central Command headquarters on the very latest plasma TV screens on a set designed by a leading Hollywood producer. As in 1991, the US will make a big effort to sanitise the conflict, to make it clean and presentable on prime time television news bulletins, but on the ground it will be the same story—the same horror of countless wars and conflicts through history. Many people will die. They will die horribly, ripped apart by high explosives, crushed by debris, burnt to death or killed in countless other ways. In the aftermath of war, there will be many more casualties—deaths caused by the breakdown of Iraq's medical, sanitation and food distribution systems. </para><para>None of us can predict the death toll of civilians from the forthcoming bombardment of Iraq. But the warning of a bombing campaign that will shock and awe makes it likely that direct casualties will be numbered at least in the thousands. The US and UK ground forces committed to this campaign are comparatively modest, and there will be a very heavy reliance on air power. If the Iraq military, especially Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard, manage to make a stand in the urban areas of Baghdad, the US will face a choice between the risk of high casualties among their own troops or applying massive firepower from a distance with the certainty of heavy civilian casualties. Given the US determination to minimise their own casualties, innocent Iraqi civilians, themselves the victims of Hussein's brutal dictatorship, may well pay a terrible price. </para><para>As I have said, no-one knows what the final toll will be but some indication of the potential humanitarian crisis is given by a strictly confidential United Nations planning document, first reported in the <inline font-style="italic">London Times</inline> newspaper on 23 December last year. This document has since become publicly available on the Internet but has received surprisingly little publicity. Dated 10 December 2002, the UN analysis of likely humanitarian scenarios was written to assist UN contingency planning for the event of an attack on Iraq. The document focuses on the humanitarian consequences of a range of anticipated military scenarios. Based on World Health Organisation estimates, it forecasts that as many as half a million people could require medical treatment to a greater or lesser degree as a result of direct injuries or indirect effects, including the spread of disease. The UN assessment forecasts that Iraqi medical supplies will be completely inadequate and that casualties will be exacerbated by the likely absence of a functioning primary health care system in a post-conflict situation. </para><para>The UN analysis points out that the damage to Iraq's electricity network will severely reduce water and sanitation services and that nearly 40 per cent of Iraq's highly urbanised population will need to be provided with potable water. Also, a potentially high number of indirect casualties may arise from the assessment that `the outbreak of disease in epidemic if not pandemic proportions is very likely'. The UN further warns that the nutritional status of some 3.03 million people countrywide will be dire and that they will require therapeutic feeding, according to UNICEF estimates. The UN estimates that there will eventually be some 900,000 Iraqi refugees requiring assistance, of which 100,000 will be in need of immediate assistance. An estimated two million people will require some assistance with shelter. It is anticipated that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees will initially be unable to provide required support for the 130,000 refugees already in Iraq.</para><para>Significantly, the UN assessment also rejects comparisons with the comparatively positive humanitarian outcome of the 2001 Afghanistan attack, given Iraq's high level of urbanisation and the fact that international sanctions over the past decade have produced a situation in which 60 per cent of Iraq's 16 million people have no other means with which to provide for essential requirements other than monthly government food rations. One can only hope that these grim assessments prove to be overly pessimistic. I hope so, for tragically the die is now cast.</para><para>When I spoke in the last debate on this matter I argued that an attack on Iraq without the explicit authorisation of the United Nations Security Council would be contrary to international law. Nothing the government have said since has changed my view. Their arguments for the legality of what is about to happen have been quite unconvincing. Moreover, they have conspicuously failed to explain why a continuation of UN inspections could not achieve the objective of verifying the elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction capabilities. There was another path to be taken today: the path of diplomacy, backed by a unanimous Security Council. That could have secured a peaceful outcome. Instead, for their own reasons, George Bush, Tony Blair and our own little Prime Minister, John Howard, have chosen the path of war.</para><para>The Prime Minister has committed Australia to an unnecessary war. He has committed our nation to a war contrary to international law. He has committed us to a war of aggression. The Prime Minister has committed us to a war that may well result in the slaughter of many thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians. When the bombing begins in a few hours, the early images will be sanitised. We will probably not see much of what is happening on the ground, but terrible things will be happening. Maybe, down the track, we will see some of that horror. When we do, no-one should forget our Prime Minister's personal responsibility. The Prime Minister will have blood on his hands, and no amount of public relations spin will ever wash it off.</para><para>I am of Lebanese descent. Through the seventies, eighties and early nineties I watched the television images coming out of Lebanon as it was ravaged by civil war. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed during that civil war. Lebanon is rebuilding today. What shocks me is the arrogance of the American President, the British Prime Minister and the Australian Prime Minister, and their simplistic, Anglophile view of the world. This war they have committed us to will do nothing to defeat terrorism. It will engender resentment in the Arab world—not because of support for Saddam Hussein but because of the way this war has been engineered. This Prime Minister and the American President have walked to the beat of the drums of war from the very beginning. This is the outcome they have sought from the beginning. Quite frankly, there is only one way to prosecute the removal of Saddam, and that is through the international community and the United Nations. That should have been the way we went. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>13095</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Bronwyn, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP</name><name.id>SE4</name.id><electorate>Mackellar</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Twelve years have passed since Iraq agreed to accept unconditionally, under international supervision, the destruction, removal or rendering harmless of its weapons of mass destruction, ballistic missiles with a range of over 150 kilometres, and related production facilities and equipment. The agreement provided for the establishment of a system of ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with the ban on these weapons and missiles. Iraq had to make a declaration, within 15 days, of the locations, amounts and types of all such items. They were the terms of Security Council resolution 687 of 3 April 1991. Twelve years later we are still trying to ascertain just how little of that commitment has been fulfilled.</para></talk.start><para>Resolution 1441 said that, if Iraq did not comply as it was required to do previously, action could be taken to make sure it did. So there is no question about the legality of the action that is going to be taken by the so-called coalition of the willing. The fact of the matter is that Saddam Hussein's regime poses a threat to international peace. It poses a threat in terms of terrorism. It has in its possession weapons of mass destruction, a fact which has been clearly evidenced by the inspectors who have gone into Iraq over the past few weeks. They have shown that the resolution Iraq accepted all those years ago has still not been fulfilled. I am sure that those people—and there are some—who write to me and demonstrate to say that they do not wish action to be taken, and who use the word `peace', have good hearts and speak with sincerity. But we have to learn from the lessons of history. We have to learn from what happened when people said that we did not want to take action, because we wanted peace—peace at any price.</para><para>We learnt from World War II what happened when the opportunity was there in 1936 for Baldwin and the Allies to go in after Hitler went into the Rhineland. That opportunity was not taken. There was an attempt then at appeasement. There were the famous words of Neville Chamberlain, who came back to London a hero: that war had been averted. It was only the condemnation of history that showed him to be the ultimate sell-out. He ceded the Sudetenland and then saw Hitler take the whole of Czechoslovakia, followed pretty rapidly by Austria. The world said, `Well, the Austrians agreed to it.' It then escalated, and country after country fell. Six million Jews were put to death in concentration camps. Hundreds of thousands of Allied troops laid down their lives to fight for freedom. Untold millions of lives were destroyed. That could have been averted if action had been taken sooner. About Cambodia the world said, `We want peace; we do not want to intervene,' and Pol Pot murdered three million people.</para><para>So there are lessons of history to be learned and they tell us that it is necessary to take this action now. I believe President Bush has shown great courage. It is written that action was not taken in 1936 because public opinion in the countries concerned wanted peace and would not have been with their leaders. Strong leadership at that stage was just not there. It was not there until Mr Churchill finally came to the fore. It has not been easy to make these difficult decisions. It has not been easy for our Prime Minister. It has not been easy for members of the government to come to the conclusion that this is a necessary thing.</para><para>Those people who talk about what war will bring—the death of millions—forget that death is the instrument of rule used by Saddam Hussein now. People who say, `Let's not go to war,' forget that thousands and thousands of Iraqis have already been killed by Saddam Hussein. Are their lives to count for nothing? The fact of the matter is that death is happening in Iraq now. This is the man, Saddam Hussein, who used mustard gas—the gas that many countries abhorred and refused to use in World War I because it was just so dreadful. This is the man who used it in the Iraq-Iran war, and 20,000 casualties resulted when a combination of mustard and sarin gases was used. This is the man who gassed 5,000 Kurdish people within Iraq, using gases and weapons of mass destruction. This is the man who would use a murderer's intimidation against individuals to make them toe the line. It is not a question of there being no killing. It is not a question of the people of Iraq being free from what flows from war. Already there is death, suffering and torture under the hands of the man against whom this war will be prosecuted.</para><para>I hear it often said, and I will join with those who say it: `War is not something anyone looks forward to. It is used when there is no other alternative available.' I have heard people on the other side of the chamber argue that there is an alternative available—that there should be more diplomatic exchanges. But those diplomatic exchanges have not worked. We have heard the words of France. I am very pleased to say that France does not speak with a single voice. Chirac does not speak for all Frenchmen. It was with a sense of pride that I read the words of my friend Pierre Lelouche, who was a former adviser to Chirac and who himself is now a deputy in the French parliament. He is a member of the centre-right party, the UMP. He is reported to have said:</para><quote><para>The US is already legally empowered to go to war against Iraq because of Resolution 1441.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>Here is a world where terrorists can get hideous weapons—it is up to the leaders of the West to protect their people.</para></quote><para>Bernard Kouchner, the founder and president of Medecins sans Frontieres and a former leader of the interim UN administration in Kosovo, said:</para><quote><para>The removal of Hussein is the primary concern ... What is worse ... is leaving in place a dictator who massacres his people. I wish people would actually listen more to the ones most threatened by all this, the Iraqi people who are subjugated by this dictatorship.</para></quote><para>So the words do come from a wide range of people. The support is there, but it is the strength of leadership that is needed at this time. It is not easy to make a decision when there are many people who express and legitimately use their freedom of speech in this country. If they tried to do a similar thing in Iraq they would certainly be imprisoned or worse. In this country you are free to make your point of view heard, but it takes the strength of leadership to determine that it is in the national interest to take a particular course of action when there is a loud voice expressing a contrary view.</para><para>In supporting the motion as moved by the Prime Minister, I do so knowing that the coming times are going to be difficult and that there will be voices raised against the action that we are taking, but hopefully not against our troops who will be serving in those lands—our splendid troops, who will fight valiantly in the name of Australia. For those people who say we should have an independent foreign policy, I say we do have one. Australia has always been fiercely independent but she has always been a nation who has chosen to take part when the international community is at risk—as well as taking part in our own interests. We will always do that, because that is the nature of the Australian people. Peace at any price was proven in World War II to be too great a price to pay. By taking action now I believe that the world will be spared seeing terrorists being supplied with weapons of mass destruction from Iraq and that we will see a greater degree of peace possible in the world—real peace, and not peace at any price.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>13097</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name><name.id>84S</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I cannot start my comments without making one remark in relation to the contribution by the member for Mackellar.

All over Australia children are in playgrounds, classrooms, child-care centres or happily playing in their homes. Iraqi children will not have that same chance for that same experience today, and we are part of the reason that they will not. In Iraq it is about 3 a.m. It is predicted that the invasion of Iraq will commence in the next few hours. Some 41.1 per cent of the Iraqi population is under the age of 14; five million young boys and 4.8 million young girls will no doubt have learned by now that Australia is just one of a handful of nations prepared to drop bombs on them. Today we make war on children.</para><para>This government would have you believe that we make war to improve the lives of Iraqis. We bomb them, apparently, in order to protect them. Let us look for a moment at the raft of excuses this government would give us in order to justify this action. It talks about regime change—that we must protect the Iraqi population from the terror of Saddam Hussein. The foreign minister has questioned this side's level of condemnation of Saddam Hussein. My view, and that of those on this side, is abundantly clear. Saddam Hussein's disregard for human rights stands condemned, as does his use of chemical weapons and torture against his own people. There are currently 800,000 displaced people within Iraq and 750,000 living in neighbouring countries. We abhor what this appalling dictator stands for, just as we abhor the actions of those who created and armed him. But this government cannot have it both ways. It cannot claim to be supportive of Iraqi people who are victims of cruel and violent oppression on one hand and then deny them refugee status on the other. The thing that appals me the most is that members of the government actually believe that the casualties that will occur over the next few days will be worthy sacrifices. Whether you die at the hands of a dictator or at the hands of an invader, you are still dead.</para><para>The Prime Minister would have us believe that he is acting in accordance with United Nations wishes. If that is the case, call a vote; get a directive, because there is not one in existence now. Resolution 1441 does not contain an automatic trigger for war. A single nation should not take on the role of the world's policeman. How long will it be now before another nation believes it has the right to play that role? The authority of the United Nations must be upheld. The two world wars of the last century were tragic conflicts. The Second World War, in particular, eventuated in part because the nations of the world did not allow the League of Nations to be effective. Since 1945 the United Nations has been allowed to play a significant role not only in ensuring world peace but also in calling rogue nations and leaders to account. As a result, we enjoyed in the second half of the last century a relatively strong period of peace. Australia ought not to be a country that is leading the charge to diminish the authority of the United Nations. In doing so, we diminish only ourselves.</para><para>The Prime Minister and his government would have us believe that Iraq is responsible for the threat of terrorism that we now face. In fact, the Special Minister of State, on ABC radio this week, claimed that `there are a lot of indications' linking the 11 September terrorist attacks with Iraq. That is not true. There is no evidence of such a link. Al-Qaeda has stated its opposition to Arab states such as Iraq. Lord Douglas Hurd, former British Conservative Foreign Secretary, has posed the following questions:</para><quote><para>Do we help or hinder this essential struggle against terrorism by attacking Iraq ... Would we thus turn the Middle East into a set of friendly democratic capitalist societies ready to make peace with Israel, or into a region of sullen humiliation, a fertile and almost inexhaustible recruiting ground for further terrorists ...</para></quote><para>Robert Higgs of the US Independent Institute has noted such simplistic interpretations of the ease of changing the nature of governments in the region, saying:</para><quote><para>The sheer preposterousness of this expectation suggests that it is fueled more by quasi-religious zealotry than by logic and evidence.</para></quote><para>We cannot, however, now underestimate the risk of terrorism on our own shores as a result of our aggressive action. This threat to Australia is one of the justifications given by the government for our involvement, yet the Prime Minister is unwilling to fess up to the Australian people about whether there is in fact any increased threat to our national security. There is probably little doubt that our actions in joining this unjust war will have that effect. An increased threat to our national security may thus be an outcome of our involvement, but not necessarily a reason for it.</para><para>The Prime Minister has often relied on the disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction as justification for this invasion. I support this disarmament but I firmly believe, as does the United Nations, that there are still peaceful mechanisms available to bring this about. The Prime Minister has focused his most recent remarks on an attempt to convince our nation that the opposition do not care for our troops. I am offended and outraged that he would make such an allegation and play such filthy politics with the families of our service people. I, like all members, have a very special respect for our service personnel. We support our troops. We do not believe they should be there but we know who is responsible for this terrible decision. It is not them; it is the leader of this nation. If Australian lives are lost, and I fervently hope that that will not be the case, how will this Prime Minister explain to the families—to the parents, children and partners—that their loved ones were injured or died in a war and in a country that they did not have to be in. There are consequences of committing our troops to war, and the Prime Minister must be held responsible for them. If the Prime Minister is so concerned about the welfare of our troops, he must release the results of the Gulf War veterans health study. He is sending these young men and women into an area without informing them what the health risks are. I understand that this report has been sent to him. He now has a duty to make this information public.</para><para>Let us now consider the role played in this conflict by the existence of oil. Some officials have argued that Iraqi oil should be considered spoils of war. The Council on Foreign Relations has counselled that oil revenues must be used for the Iraqi people, lest they believe that this action was taken for imperialist rather than disarmament reasons. One of the most telling comments comes from Rupert Murdoch, quoted in America's <inline font-style="italic">Fortune</inline> magazine:</para><quote><para>... the whole world will benefit from cheaper oil which will be a bigger stimulus than anything else ...</para></quote><para>And he made this comment, quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> magazine:</para><quote><para>The greatest thing to come out of this for the world economy, if you could put it that way, would be $[US]20 a barrel for oil. That's bigger than any tax cut in any country.</para></quote><para>Concern about government information provided on the justification for this war is not limited to the Australian people. Henry Waxman of the US Congress wrote to the President this week. He said:</para><quote><para>In the last ten days ... it has become incontrovertibly clear that a key piece of evidence you have cited regarding Iraq's efforts to obtain nuclear weapons is a hoax. What's more the CIA questioned the veracity of this evidence. This is a breach of the highest order and the American people are entitled to know how it happened.</para></quote><para>I also call upon our Prime Minister to be honest about the reasons for this war.</para><para>History has taught us that a combined and unified approach by the nations of the world is the best recipe for peace. That is why this aggressive action by a few nations is so dangerous. Our involvement speaks volumes about our place in the world. It speaks volumes about how our Prime Minister views our role. He has cast us as a vassal nation to the United States. We are not going to war because of the Prime Minister's concern about the humanitarian violations of the Iraqi government. We are not going to war because Iraq was responsible for September 11. We are not going to war for the purpose of disarmament. We are not going because we as a nation have been directly attacked or even threatened. We are going to war because our Prime Minister has neither the courage nor the conviction to say no. He cannot resist the call from <inline font-style="italic">Air Force One</inline>; he cannot resist his favoured friendship with the United States President. I ask the Prime Minister a question. When the president of another country rings him and asks him to jump to their needs, is his answer, `How high?' That is certainly how the Australian people feel now.

Countries and alliances existed according to whether they stood on the side of the Soviet-led communist bloc or the American-led Western alliance. Today, however, the Cold War is no more. The collapse of the Soviet Union, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the unification of Germany shattered the bipolar world order that emerged from the ashes of World War II.</para><para>Today the gravest threat to international stability in this post Cold War world is not the threat of nuclear confrontation between two superpowers but instead brutal, barbaric and indiscriminate acts of terrorism. Today the gravest threat to the communities, economies and values of pluralist nations and free peoples everywhere is the evil shadow of indiscriminate terrorism. We live in what might now be called the age of global terrorism. The almost unimaginable acts of terror that were committed on 11 September 2001, when two hijacked American passenger planes were forced to crash into the two World Trade Centre towers in New York, heralded a chilling new world order that few could have predicted in its true and deadly form. Closer to home, we are all familiar with the devastating and cowardly act of terrorism that was committed at the Sari nightclub in Bali in October 2002, which saw the tragic loss of hundreds of innocent lives. The devastating loss of life and the manner in which it took place has also dealt a shattering economic blow to the people of Bali and Indonesia.</para><para>The clear lesson for our country, and indeed for all nations, is that terrorism can strike at any time and in any place without warning. No longer are acts of terrorism merely evil acts that occur in remote and far off places. They are very real in both their evil purpose and close proximity. This is the new character and dynamics of international relations in the post Cold War world. Global and strategic politics in the 21st century is now defined in different and more frightening ways.</para><para>In this age of irrational and evil global terror that now prevails the possession of weapons of mass destruction by any rogue state or any despotic individual is clearly an unacceptable risk to the order and security of civilised countries. It is clearly a risk that is unacceptable to the future peace and prosperity of countries like Australia, Britain and the United States—and indeed to the entire free world. Where Iraq fits in is that under Saddam Hussein Iraq is one country that actually possesses these weapons of mass destruction together with biological and chemical weapons. Saddam Hussein also has a track record of using them. He will use them again. He must, therefore, be disarmed. It is worth quoting the words of the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. He stated:</para><quote><para>I defy anyone to say that this cruel and sadistic dictator should be allowed any possibility of getting his hands on chemical, biological and nuclear weapons of mass destruction.</para></quote><para>These are the words of a very courageous Prime Minister. Those who continue to talk of giving peace and diplomacy a chance clearly do not understand the background and history of this issue. They also clearly do not understand the kind of man Saddam Hussein is or what he is capable of doing. </para><para>Saddam Hussein has a history—a track record—of using tools of terror against his own people and against sovereign neighbours. This is a brutal dictator who led his country in war for eight senseless years against Iran. This is a brutal dictator who systematically rapes, tortures and murders his own citizens. This is a brutal dictator who led his country, in August 1990, into a senseless and unprovoked invasion of Kuwait, which led to the international community's endorsement of resolution 678, passed on 28 November 1990, that authorised a UN-led military eviction of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Following the successful eviction of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, the UN passed resolution 687 that provided the guidelines for a withdrawal of UN forces. A central feature of resolution 687 was that Iraq comply with the international community's demands that Iraq abandon its weapons of mass destruction. Resolution 687 also pointed very clearly to the fact that weapons of mass destruction posed a substantial and real threat to the region's peace and security. More than a decade later, together with resolution 1441, this still remains the legitimate foundation for any effort to disarm Iraq.</para><para>It is 12 years now since resolutions were passed at the UN in New York demanding Iraq's disarmament. Yet Iraq continues to possess those weapons of mass destruction and continues to flout the diplomatic goodwill and initiatives of the international community. It is 12 years since the world first offered Saddam Hussein's brutal regime the opportunity to turn its back on external aggression and violence. Every effort has been made through 17 UN resolutions, stretching over a decade, and countless diplomatic initiatives to disarm Iraq and embrace its people. Does anyone seriously believe that an 18th UN resolution and another week could make a difference? In short, diplomacy has been tried and it has failed. The time to use force is now. History has demonstrated that diplomacy alone does not achieve results against dictators where there is no credible threat to use military power.</para><para>Saddam Hussein is a brutal dictator who has already ignored over a decade of international diplomacy that strove to embrace Iraq and give its people hope of a better future. He is a leader who has totally ignored every act of goodwill and encouragement that has flowed from the corridors of the United Nations in New York and the foreign offices of many countries. Diplomacy has been given a chance. Indeed, diplomacy and statecraft have been given every chance to deliver results, and none have been forthcoming.</para><para>All Australians will appreciate that the decision to commit a nation's forces to military conflict is without doubt the most serious that any government can ever make. There must, therefore, be absolutely compelling and just reason for the calling of these armed services, especially where they are called to impending conflict in an overseas theatre. In my judgment there is compelling and just reason for Australia's participation in the coalition forces assembled to confront Iraq. There are other European countries involved—Denmark, Holland, Italy, Poland and Spain—as well as Asian powers such as Japan and Korea. There are some 30 countries in all that have signed up to the coalition determined to disarm Iraq.</para><para>In conclusion, I want to convey in this chamber to the soldiers, sailors and airmen of the Australian Defence Force serving in the gulf the very best wishes from the people of my electorate of Ryan. I know that the thoughts and prayers of all Australians will be with the young men and women of the Australian Defence Force serving in the gulf. Those who choose voluntarily to serve their country by wearing a military uniform are the very best our country has to offer. They are courageous in character, generous in substance and patriotic in spirit. They are the keepers of our democracy and the guardians of our prosperity and the precious freedoms we enjoy in this country but all too often take for granted. Our Defence Force personnel in the gulf deserve our admiration, our gratitude and our respect in the immensely dangerous task they face. May your mission be speedy and successful, and may you be kept safe for your loved ones as you do your duty for the worthy and noble cause of enhancing peace and security both in Iraq and in our world.</para><para>Finally, I want to state very clearly in this parliament that I understand the strong views held by those who disagree with me. I also respect your right to hold those views. In particular, I respect your right to convey peacefully those opinions to me and, for those residents of Ryan, to convey those views peacefully to me as your elected representative in our nation's parliament. That is the strength of our country. That is the majesty of our democracy. That is what inspires me, as a member of the nation's parliament, and that is what makes me proud to be an Australian.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>13102</page.no><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JACKSON</name><name.id>00AN2</name.id><electorate>Hasluck</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As I stand here now, not only does the clock run down on my contribution to this debate but it also runs down to the deadline set down by USA President George Bush.

This government, in the name of the Australian people, has committed us to be an integral part of an invasion force that will unleash great violence, the consequences of which are now unforeseeable and uncontrollable. That is a mighty arrogant decision.</para><para>I am deeply concerned about some of the possible ramifications of this action, many of which have already been canvassed by previous speakers in this House. Not only are there moral and ethical implications but also what does this mean for Australia's strategic relations with our neighbours? Does the government have any concern or regard that two of our closest neighbours—Indonesia and New Zealand—have roundly condemned this action? And what about the increased risk of terrorism and where we are in the region? How can anybody believe that our involvement and participation in this invasion force will not increase the likelihood of terrorism on the shores of Australia?</para><para>This is not the first time I have had the opportunity to speak in this parliament concerning what was previously the threat of—and now is the reality of—war in Iraq. I do not resile from any of my former comments in this debate. But today I want to speak directly to my constituents in the electorate of Hasluck, and I want to make sure that they know where I stand and how I feel about this issue. Many constituents—those who have stopped me in the streets of my electorate, or have phoned, written or emailed me over recent months—have echoed my own feelings on the possibility of war in Iraq and Australia's involvement. They also demanded two things of their elected representatives. Firstly, that we do everything within our power to find a peaceful solution to the current crisis and, secondly, that we do not support Australia being involved in a US-led war with Iraq without the broad endorsement of the world community—preferably through the processes of the United Nations. I join my Labor colleagues in raising my voice in continuing to oppose this war. I believe it is a sad day when this parliament has failed its constituents and certainly my constituents in Hasluck. I believe that the Prime Minister has failed the Australian people in the way in which he has conducted himself on our behalf throughout this debate.</para><para>At this stage, it is appropriate for me to record my personal support for the members of the Defence Force who have been deployed and their families, as well as the best wishes of the electors of Hasluck. Western Australia's involvement has been quite significant in the forces that have been predeployed or are currently in the gulf. In Western Australia there are many families and friends of those servicemen and servicewomen who are on active duty. In particular, I acknowledge the Western Australian based frigates—the <inline font-style="italic">Anzac</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Darwin</inline>—that have both been deployed to the gulf along with a Navy diving team from HMAS<inline font-style="italic"> Stirling</inline>. Of course the Special Air Service Regiment, which is based in my home state of Western Australia, is set to play, as it always does, a critical and possibly dangerous role once war breaks out. I want to use this occasion to convey my sincerest best wishes and support to those service personnel, who are on what appears to be the verge of the great unknown, and to their families and loved ones. Our thoughts are with them and I extend the best wishes of the electors of Hasluck. I note the comments that were made by the member for Cowan yesterday in the chamber concerning the defence forces and hoping that appropriate support is put in place to assist them and their families.</para><para>It was the predeployment of those troops that really brought home to me the true nature of this debate. The decision to commit to war puts on the line the lives of not only those troops but also ordinary Iraqi families who will suffer the horrors of war. I, along with most Australians, was devastated by the impact of the Bali bombings that occurred last year, particularly on innocent Australians and their families. We know just how devastating that impact was. As a nation, we were shocked and we were appalled at how quickly and destructively so many young lives could be taken. It has been, I think, somewhat ironic that the Prime Minister has sought to use this tragedy as a justification in part for his support of unilateral action against Iraq. I think that link is wrong. Indeed, the only comparative link that I can make between the appalling events in Bali and the current situation in Iraq is my fear that thousands of Iraqi families will be subjected to similar devastation in the coming weeks as they live with the consequence of bombs. You really have to wonder whether the reasons for the coalition of the willing having decided to drop those bombs make a difference to those Iraqi families and whether those arguments will matter when their loved ones have been lost. One of the great advocates of nonviolence, Mahatma Gandhi, said:</para><quote><para>What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans and the homeless, whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or the holy name of liberty or democracy?</para></quote><para>His comments remain valid today.</para><para>I went to find out what the situation might be for many of the families in Iraq. I was appalled to discover that of the Iraqi population of some 24.5 million: half are under 18; one in eight children die before the age of five; 294 women die per 100,000 births; over five million people currently have no access to clean water; and increasingly children are staying away from school and working to help supplement their family's income. Devastation has really been wrought in Iraq over the last two decades. The country has gone from being in the mid-seventies a prosperous economy, fuelled by the sales of its huge oil reserves, to a situation now where much of the country's infrastructure has been devastated and 12 years of international sanctions have limited the people's ability to rebuild and invest in social systems, such as health care. All of these things have had a significant impact on the children in Iraq. So I spare a thought for them today. As I have said previously, I sometimes wish it were the leaders of countries who had to take to the battlefield to sort out these resolutions. I suspect in those circumstances that armed conflicts would be far less likely and I am certain that a much greater effort would be directed to alternatives to military action.</para><para>I have said that I want to touch on the role of the Prime Minister in this debate as the days have unfolded. The other day in this House, when the Leader of the Opposition was making a reply to the Prime Minister's motion, we saw the Prime Minister turn his back on him. I say to the Prime Minister that that is not first time he has done that. He turned his back on Australia's important international relations, including with countries in our immediate region such as Indonesia. In recent weeks he has turned his back on the majority of Australians opposed to this war by dismissing their protests as `mob action'. On Tuesday he turned his back on the United Nations process by committing troops to war instead of pursuing a diplomatic resolution to the crisis. And on Wednesday he turned his back on the parliament when he cancelled question time and refused to answer questions about the most serious decision a government can make: committing our troops to war. I just want to ask him, perhaps rhetorically: when, Prime Minister, will you have the courage to turn your back on the demands of President Bush when they are not in Australia's national interest? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>13104</page.no><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GAMBARO</name><name.id>9K6</name.id><electorate>Petrie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—One of the hardest decisions a government can make is to commit its nation's forces to military action. This has been a very tough decision undertaken by the Prime Minister, and it is one of the most historic decisions that any Prime Minister has to make for any country. Nobody wants war. I do not, and I know that many of my friends and family members agree with me on that particular issue. War is the last resort and it is regrettable. But the fact is that the United Nations Security Council has failed to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. In the past I have been supportive of no action without UN backing. Although I would have liked to have had UN backing, I realise that the failure of the Security Council to act on the intent of its resolutions has left us with no choice. The decision by the Prime Minister to commit troops to the situation in Iraq has been done in a framework that is both moral and legal.</para></talk.start><para>In an ideal world, the UN Security Council would ensure complicity from rogue states. But that has not been the case. If we wait and do nothing, we risk the escalation of situations in North Korea, Zimbabwe, the former Soviet states and between Israel and Palestine. Have we forgotten how UN indecisiveness resulted in crises such as Kosovo, Rwanda and Bosnia? It is hard to imagine a world without checks and balances, a world with no sense of integrity, no justice. Such an amoral world would permit constant human rights violations and place in turmoil the ability of countries to guarantee the security of their own people. It would proliferate the use of weapons of mass destruction and permit terrorism to reign supreme.</para><para>This is not a world that I want to be a part of. It is a world that is increasingly likely if we permit terrorism to reign supreme and do not disarm Iraq. We are not alone in thinking this. Some 30 countries have agreed to join Australia, the United Kingdom and the US as part of the coalition for the immediate disarmament of Iraq. They include Afghanistan, Albania, Azerbaijan, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, Eritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Georgia, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey and Uzbekistan. In addition, approximately 15 other countries have offered defensive assets.</para><para>As Australians, we have freedoms, rights and a democracy that permits debate on such sensitive issues as this. From my electorate of Petrie, I have received many letters of support and also letters opposing the war with Iraq. I thank all of my constituents for their efforts to write to me. I have read and listened to their arguments, and I understand their concerns. Nobody wants war, but the alternative presents us with a situation that would be adverse not just for the Iraqi people but for us all. The consistent action by Iraq to defy consecutive United Nations Security Council resolutions over the past 12 years has demonstrated that Saddam Hussein does not hold the UN, or the very principles by which we live and abide, as worthy. He shows the same contempt for the United Nations and international calls for him to disarm as he shows for his own people.</para><para>According to Amnesty International, the Iraqi people have experienced disappearances, systematic torture, extrajudicial executions, arbitrary detention and unfair trials. The Iraqi government manifests its own political agenda at the expense of the Iraqi people. Since the 1990s, sanctions against Iraq have jeopardised the rights of people to access food, health and education. Each year that sanctions remain in place, roughly 60,000 Iraqi children under the age of five will die. These sanctions only exist because Saddam Hussein has failed to honour a cease-fire agreement that he signed 12 years ago. There is broad international agreement for Iraq to disarm and for an improvement in the conditions of the Iraqi people, as demanded by both common decency and the Iraqi people themselves.</para><para>When Hans Blix, the United Nations weapons inspector presented his report in January this year, he stated:</para><quote><para>... Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance—not even today—of the disarmament, which was demanded of it ...</para></quote><para>This was reiterated in Dr Blix's most recent report on 7 March, in which he was still unable to report that Iraq had cooperated fully with United Nations inspectors. Resolution 1441 was the last in a series of UN Security Council resolutions that called on Iraq to disarm fully. It gave Iraq that final opportunity to comply with its breaches of previous resolutions and was drafted in a manner that meant that, by failing to comply, Iraq would face serious consequences. It recalled previous resolution 678 from 1990 and resolution 687 from 1991. Resolution 678 authorised all necessary means to implement subsequent resolutions that would restore peace and security to the region.</para><para>Iraq's continual defiance of the original intention of the cease-fire agreement it signed in 1991 and the subsequent UN Security Council resolutions sets a precarious agenda for like-minded rogue states to proliferate their weapons of mass destruction and engender a world devoid of rights and liberties. The message from the International Crisis Group is very clear on this issue:</para><quote><para>There are situations, and this may be one of them, where there is no alternative but to resort to war to achieve legitimate international objectives.</para><para>...				...				...</para><para>What can be stated unequivocally is that the alternative to war, if there is one, is not to do nothing.</para></quote><para>The decision to commit our troops to military action against Iraq has been taken in the best interests of what is right for Australia and in the long-term interests of national and international security.</para><para>Australia is a multicultural, democratic nation and one that honours and respects other cultures and beliefs and the rights of all to equality of opportunity. At this time in history, it is important that people should be judged for who they are and not for their race, colour or creed. The issue lies with Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi government, not with Islam. We are a multicultural nation, and as a first generation Australian I am proud to be an Australian. The coming days and weeks will write a very important chapter in the history of this nation, and racism should not feature in it.</para><para>The situation at home in our cities and towns will be just as important as what is unfolding half a world away. My electorate of Petrie is home to many defence families, particularly in the southern end of the electorate. We commend the men and women of our Australian Defence Force and their commitment to serve their country both at home and, as always, abroad. As a nation, we reflect on the job they undertake with courage and conviction. We admire them, and our thoughts go out to them, their families and their loved ones. On behalf of the people of the Petrie electorate, I offer them our thoughts and prayers for a very safe journey back to Australia.</para><para>We have never been a country to shy away from a duty we see to others or to our own people. We hold fast to the belief in democracy and freedom. At the start of this speech, I spoke of the difficulty of committing troops to military action, but a world of terrorism and sedition is a greater threat than military action now. Military action is obliged by the UN resolutions and honours the sentiment of the vast majority of Iraqi people, who desire regime change and the opportunity for a better life for themselves and future generations. The decision to commit our forces may not be an easy decision to make, but it is the right decision.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>13105</page.no><name role="metadata">Vamvakinou, Maria, MP</name><name role="display">Ms VAMVAKINOU</name><name.id>00AMT</name.id><electorate>Calwell</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Never is there a more critical passage for a nation than when its leaders make a decision to go to war. In our case, the Prime Minister has committed us to a war which the international community and public sentiment here at home, including the federal opposition, consider to be illegal and morally wrong—illegal because it is set to take place without the sanction of the UN Security Council and morally wrong because it is the result of a unilateral action based on a new and dangerous concept of pre-emptive strike.</para></talk.start><para>At about 12 o'clock today, Australia will begin its passage from a well-respected global citizen, a defender of international law and supporter of the authority of the United Nations, a country not generally known for conducting a belligerent or aggressive foreign policy and one that does not prey on its neighbours, to a country that, by rushing to be at the forefront of the coalition of the willing, has placed itself in very precarious and uncharted waters. It is this loss of our innocence that grieves me the most, and I know that it grieves and bewilders the people of Australia. I know many have argued that the world has changed dramatically since September 11. Indeed, it has changed; we cannot deny that. But it is precisely because of these changed circumstances that now, more than ever, we need to pursue resolution and action within the processes of the United Nations. Now is not the time to throw caution to the wind, to sidestep international law and participate in an action that, far from protecting our national interests, exposes our country and our citizens to the harm of potential retribution.</para><para>Try as I might, I cannot see how participation in an American-led war on Iraq can serve our national interests. How is it in our national interests to be party to a war which, in the words of the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, lacks legitimacy? At 12 noon today, we begin to gamble with the future of our national interests and security. Australia cannot afford to place itself outside the UN processes. We cannot afford to be marked as a crusader nation—especially given our geographic location. Whether we like it or not, our neighbourhood is Asia and many of our neighbours are of the Muslim faith. It is in this neighbourhood that we trade and conduct business activities that have significant impact on our economy. This is the message that has resonated loud and clear in my own electorate of Calwell but also in the broader Australian community, and this is the message that the Prime Minister has chosen to ignore.</para><para>Over the course of the past few months I, like many of my colleagues, have sought and obtained the views of residents of my electorate. I can tell you that opposition by the residents in the electorate of Calwell to action without United Nations support was as high as 83 per cent in survey returns. No doubt members opposite, if they were able to speak openly and honestly, would report similar attitudes and feelings in their own electorates. My constituents, like a great many other Australians, are deeply concerned about the anticipated deaths of innocent civilians during the execution of this enormous military action against Iraq, but they are also concerned about the impact of this unilateral war closer to home.</para><para>We have a very large Muslim community living here in Australia; in fact, we have a very large Arabic community. Australians of Muslim and Middle Eastern appearance have endured vilification and abuse since September 11, and the Prime Minister has done nothing but pay lip-service to their predicament. Australians of Arabic and Muslim background can find no comfort in the Prime Minister's reassurances because there is none. His actions constantly contradict his words. In fact, Australians across the board can take no comfort in the Prime Minister's reassurances because he is, unfortunately, driven and swayed by the ideological agenda and military timetable of a foreign President, the President of the United States. Our Prime Minister has forgone his duty to the Australian people by involving us in a war that is not directly our business, leaving us highly exposed subscribers to a doctrine of pre-emptive strikes which will strain the future of international cooperation and security.</para><para>Today is a sad day for Australians but also for the people of Iraq. I have no doubt that many of them want to see the back of Saddam Hussein, but I am certain that they were hoping and praying that this crisis would be resolved by diplomacy and not war. Instead, sometime within the next few hours the might of the American military machine will darken their skies. Only time will tell whether this military assault will become their liberator, but what is certain is that death, displacement and destruction will be visited upon the people of Iraq today. </para><para>Disarmament through diplomacy was not given a chance to fully exhaust its processes because it fell victim to the neo-conservative ideologues that run the Bush administration. Our Prime Minister must be condemned; for, in his own moment of truth, he has finally shown how much he and his government have fallen for the appeal of the White House hawks. He has shown how much he is prepared to make Australia—for the first time ever—an aggressor nation willing to defy international law and world public opinion. What concerns me is the lack of foresight the government is showing in relation to our neighbourhood. Is it really in our national interest to be encouraging the view that we are white colonialists, or white crusaders, as put to me recently by a visiting Malaysian academic? Did the Prime Minister, or indeed the foreign minister, at any stage consult with any of our regional neighbours before embarking on this strategy of pre-emptive strike?</para><para>At a time when the Asia-Pacific region is at the crossroads, with rising tensions in the Korean peninsula, the government does not appear to be too concerned about the possibility that its actions could isolate us and thus leave us vulnerable. What contingency plans, if any, does the government have in this scenario? Can the Prime Minister assure us that, in the event of trouble in the region where Australian national interests and security are at stake, our American ally will come to our aid? Many people fear that, if the US had to make such a determination, it would be done on the exclusive basis of its own national interests. If those interests should be inconsistent with Australia's then the answer is, perhaps, don't hold your breath.</para><para>Never has a script for war been written with so much hypocrisy and posturing. We do not know what will happen from this point onwards because we cannot totally predict the outcome of a pre-emptive strike policy engineered by a superpower that has treated the UN with nothing but contempt and disdain. We are concerned that the Prime Minister of Australia has indulged in the President of the United States' deception, sharing in his vanity and recklessness and in his phoney diplomacy to justify a manufactured war. As such, John Howard has let the people of Australia down. He stands condemned for discarding the diplomatic process in favour of unilateral military action. He stands condemned for seriously and dangerously compromising Australia's national security, he stands condemned for unnecessarily endangering the lives of Australian service men and women, he stands condemned for placing in serious danger the lives of Australian citizens, and he stands condemned for allowing the reputation of this great country to be tarnished and perhaps irreversibly damaged through his commitment to the coalition of the willing. Finally, he stands condemned for aiding and abetting one country's determination to preserve its economic, military and political supremacy over all others at the expense of Australia's national interest.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>13107</page.no><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phillip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARRESI</name><name.id>ZJ6</name.id><electorate>Deakin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I come to this debate on Iraq today after giving deep consideration to all sides of the debate. It is an issue that has weighed heavily on my mind both as a freedom-loving Australian and as a representative of the people of Deakin in this parliament. It is an issue that also weighs heavily on the minds of many in my electorate. I want to assure the people of Deakin that I have listened to the sincerity and the conviction with which they have expressed their thoughts. I would also like to assure them that their views have been conveyed to the government. I respect their concerns and points of view. Like many in this House, I have also received hundreds of vitriolic emails from outside my electorate. These messages have done nothing to advance that side of the argument.</para></talk.start><para>Broadly, there are two common themes on this issue. Some have argued that there should be no action taken against Iraq without Security Council backing. Others argue that Iraq does not currently pose a threat to Australia but that we may become a target if we join in the coalition of the willing. I am not so presumptuous to assert that my conscience is superior to theirs. To paraphrase the words of Jack Straw, British Foreign Secretary, `No person has a mortgage on morality or a monopoly on wisdom.' </para><para>Let me be clear: I would have felt a greater degree of comfort if the permanent members of the Security Council had rallied together—if they had spoken with one voice to support the immediate removal of the threat that the Iraqi regime poses. Some members of the UN were all too prepared to play Saddam Hussein's cat and mouse game with the weapons inspectors indefinitely. I find it almost abhorrent to ask the Iraqi people to put up with a couple more months of torture, persecution, rape and executions to allow weapons inspectors more time. More time after 12 years is certainly not the answer; it is pure naivety to presume it is.</para><para>This is about the denial of Saddam Hussein to comply with 17 clear and unambiguous resolutions of the UN Security Council. By Saddam's noncompliance with the resolutions to immediately and absolutely disarm, the world community is left with no choice but to end his despotic regime and to rid it of its weapons of mass destruction and its ability to sell weaponry to borderless terrorist groups. </para><para>At the end of the day, I am swayed by the notion that to do nothing is to deny the very freedoms and liberties that we enjoy here in Australia being available to the people of Iraq—a people long oppressed, abused, tortured and murdered by one of the world's most despotic regimes. I am swayed to support this motion by the necessity to send a clear and unambiguous message to those borderless terrorists: that one more regime from which they enjoy succour will be removed and that the likelihood of them getting their hands on weapons of mass destruction from this regime for their murderous intentions on the Western world will be lessened. Action taken against Iraq is in the name of freedom and in the name of ending the humanitarian abuses inflicted by Saddam Hussein and the more than one million Iraqis on the payroll of the Iraqi Secret Service. </para><para>If free nations around the world sit idly by at a distance, claiming geographic detachment as a defence, then we undermine our democratic foundations. This is not the Australia that I love. This is not the Australia that we have all come to cherish and respect for the values that it holds, particularly its humanitarian values. Whilst it troubles me to think we are actively commissioning our young service personnel, it also plays on my mind to think that such oppression, devastation and barbarism is taking place as we speak.</para><para>The very institution that claims to protect human beings from such acts as a facilitator of peace has faltered. This fact is undeniable. History will note forevermore that, when it came to the crunch, the UN buckled and some of the permanent members of the Security Council shirked their responsibilities as nations claiming to support liberty and the principles of freedom. Regrettably, this is not the first time the United Nations has been noticeably absent when it was needed most. The United Nations was reluctant to be involved in intervening in the atrocities taking place in Kosovo, it was quiet when it came to Africa, it cannot be found in Zimbabwe and who knows where it will be on North Korea. Its capacity to credibly and effectively deal with threats that will surface in the future is now, as a result of its inaction, severely compromised.</para><para>Those claiming to have another answer to this issue refer to the containment of Iraq. Containment has been tried and tested in Iraq. It was tried and failed in 1998 when the weapons inspectors were forced out. That forceful removal continued and, time after time, containment failed. Other commentators propose ridiculous arguments about our foreign policy being beholden to the United States. The United States is an important ally in our regional security, but our foreign policy has been dictated based, first and foremost, on our national security, not on short-term populist appeal. It takes into account our regional position.</para><para>I had the good fortune to visit Jakarta last week, where I met with a number of Christian-minded Indonesian MPs as well as members of the Islamic parliamentary hierarchy. The clear message I got from the meetings we had was that Australia's position is understood. To the Indonesian MPs, it is clear that our motivations are not anti-Islam but rather antiterrorist. The distinction is there and well understood. In return, I understand that the action by the US led coalition may give courage to some extremist Islamic elements within Indonesia. However, at the end of the day, we need to take action for the medium- and long-term interests of Australia and the values and freedoms we hold dear.</para><para>In the lead-up to this debate, I had reservations on three fronts: first, the humanitarian considerations; second, the legal arguments for war; and, third, the precedent set by engaging in pre-emptive military action. I have already covered the first and most important of these issues, the humanitarian considerations. As to the legal argument, I am now satisfied that the government has received adequate advice through the Attorney-General's Department and the International Law Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that the use of force in this instance does not transcend international law. I am advised, and therefore confident, that there exists sufficient legal foundation for this action. Furthermore, a group of international law experts from around the world wrote an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 18 March lending their support. They were responding to a joint letter published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald </inline>on 26 February 2003. In offering their expert legal opinion, the group stated:</para><quote><para>Twelve years of resolutions and sanctions, and promising dire consequences, have not brought Iraq into compliance. When a policeman refuses to enforce the law, and gives a series of hollow “last chances”, there comes a point when citizens and criminals alike lose respect for both police and the law.</para></quote><para>I regretfully believe that this action is warranted and justified—not only justified in law but also, more significantly, morally justifiable on humanitarian grounds.</para><para>On the more perplexing issue of the precedent set by the pre-emptive action, I am confident, having been assured that the action is legal, that the uncertainty of engaging in pre-emptive action is lessened. The risk in engaging in pre-emptive action is that it may send a message to nations seeking an excuse to put their finger on the trigger in attacking neighbouring countries. However, what distinguishes this action from those some have cited as possible theatres of conflict— namely, Pakistan, Indonesia and India—is that the action has legal authority and, more importantly, in this case we are dealing with a despotic regime that has thumbed its nose at the world community. In any future attempt at pre-emptive action, each case will have to be judged on its own individual merits. </para><para>I doubt that any other despotic regime in the world could take much comfort from this precedence, knowing that they too could receive the full retribution of the world community if they enter into pre-emptive action without moral and legal foundation. But in saying this I recognise that we are opening up a new geopolitical-military paradigm which remains to be tested and will pose a challenge to the legitimacy of any future Western opposition.</para><para>In the days to come our decision in this parliament will be judged. To those who claim an electoral backlash against members who support the government's motion, my answer is simple: what happens at the next election is not my concern today. It would be morally reprehensible for anyone to be making such grave decisions on possible electoral support at the next election.</para><para>Finally, I pray for the men and women of the ADF who are in the gulf region doing their duty. May you come back to your families safe and well and may you come back to a grateful nation, one that has learned its lesson from scorning its service men and women.

We have come to this point because of a series of failures—almost, one could say, on all sides. There was certainly failure in terms of the diplomatic process at the UN. But the core diplomatic failure is the failure of the United States, Britain and Australia, the three countries that are committing troops to this action, to convince their fellows in the United Nations—and, in the case of the first two, in the UN Security Council—that it is justifiable to go to war against Iraq because of Iraq's shortcomings, great, significant and deep as they are. We know the history. The history has been paraded by members of the government about what the problem is in relation to Iraq. But we also know something else: in just over an hour's time we will have a fracture point and a fault line between the past and the future.</para></talk.start><para>The most significant international entity we have had, the United Nations, which was developed after the Second World War, has succeeded beyond measure compared to the League of Nations, which utterly failed after the First World War. What the League of Nations lacked more than anything else was some kind of peacekeeping force and an ability for the league to enforce decisions of the whole body. That was remedied through the UN Security Council. Throughout the history of the Cold War, the capacity of the United Nations to deal with crises was completely blocked because of the political and ideological divide between the East and the West. The power of veto was exercised time after time from both the communist side and the Western allied side, so that there could not be a fundamental resolution of the wars, the problems or the crises that faced the United Nations.</para><para>But we are living in a post Cold War period. We are not living in a bipolar period, where it is just those with black hats and those with white hats; we are living in a multipolar period and a period of enormous change. But we are also living in an increasingly democratic period, where the fundamental tenets that were the basis of the formation of the United Nations—that all of the nations of the earth should come together in a council, in an assembly, to determine their fate, and that the great lack that there was in the League of Nations, that of enforcing decisions and resolutions, should be addressed—are met in this United Nations. We saw in resolutions 678, 687 and 1441 the capacity of the United Nations with regard to those countries that are at its core, the five permanent powers in the Security Council, which were the key powers in 1945. This is an aged institution which is not contemporary—and that is one of the problems it faces—but when they set their minds to looking for a majority decision and a decision reached without veto, it was possible to come to that.</para><para>What we have here is a fracture line of immense importance. Here we have three countries, three members of the United Nations, which could be depicted as a triumvirate or a troika or, as I suggested yesterday in the House, as the new Holy Trinity—the United States, the only superpower on this planet at present; Great Britain, a former superpower but a faded diplomatic force and one that is allied directly to the United States in this conflict; and Australia, under this coalition government—being led by people who are utterly convinced in their Christian right to go to war with other countries. And there could be a string of other countries, not just Iraq, because of the President of the United States, a Christian fundamentalist—and we know that we have had attacks by Islamic fundamentalists.</para><para>If we go past this fracture point to create a world in which the religious wars of past centuries between the Catholics and the Protestants, which ran for about 300 years, are to be revisited upon us because of the fundamentalist approach taken by our great powers, we are in great peril. We know for a certainty that we are involved in a real war against terror—not just against al-Qaeda but against a series of other organisations, such as Jemaah Islamiah and others in South-East Asia. We also know that there are states that back terror. Neither President Bush nor Prime Minister Blair, nor Prime Minister Howard, has made a cogent, coherent, concise, contemporary case for war that could convince the United Nations Security Council, the members of their parliaments—save for the United States; their congress was locked in early—or the majority of people within their constituencies. </para><para>This war does not have the backing of the majority of the people in the United States, Britain and Australia. We know there has been no clear-cut case that could convince the Security Council—as it was convinced with resolutions 678, 687 and 1441—that it is right and proper and just and legal and moral to go to war with full UN sanction against a member state because of what it had perpetrated against another. That was the case in relation to Iraq and Kuwait. It is the case now with resolution 1441 if Iraq had not satisfied what was demanded there. But there was no automaticity in relation to 1441. The United States and Britain, with Australia as an outrider, had to convince nine out of 15 members of the Security Council with no veto—not just one, two or the seven members that they seem to have—as they did with 1441, for this to be a completely justified war. </para><para>So this is a major fault line. This is three countries determining, by their very wish and choice, that they could go to war on the basis of whatever pre-existing United Nations resolutions there were. If this is sanctioned, surely it gives sanction to any other member state of the United Nations to say: `There are other resolutions that have not been lived up to by member countries in the past—we know them they are littered throughout the history of the United Nations—they have not been acted upon. It is our choice to operate in a fashion where we will say that the resolutions have not been satisfied. We will pre-emptively take action because that is justified by the United States.' No person in this country could believe that it would be right and just for any member states to simply decide that they are going to go to war because there have been past resolutions; but that is what we are being asked to believe, and asked to sanction, by our Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Britain and the President of the United States. </para><para>It is not right, or proper for action to be taken—as it will be in just under an hour's time—against Iraq without full UN sanction. If there are those who think that the United Nations needs to be brought completely up to date, that it needs to be reconstructed, let it be done in the future, and let those governments and those leaders who argue that there are deficiencies resolve those deficiencies. But we now have to deal with the current situation. </para><para>No-one can truly believe that the great problem the world faces is Saddam Hussein and his regime in Iraq when we know that the war on terror has visited New York, Washington and Bali. We know that the war on terror is inexorably moving—because of the decision taken by this Prime Minister and this government—closer to the very doorstep of Australia, into our suburbs and across our land. We know that we need multilateralism and the rule of law to defeat those terrorists who would seek to wipe out Western civilisation and Western secular democracies. The way to defeat them is not by trampling upon the agreed processes we have had in the past to resolve war and conflict. It is not to fracture what was there, but to support the United Nations and to resolve our problems with these people as quickly as we can by certain and definite action from the United Nations as a whole. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>13111</page.no><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name><name.id>CK6</name.id><electorate>Moreton</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is an important debate. It is one that I am sure all Australians wish we were not having to have. There are many different views, but it is extraordinary that those opposite are promoting division rather than unity at this important time in the world's history and in our nation's history. Those opposite say there is no link between the agents of terror and Saddam Hussein, yet they keep evoking the consequence of terror that will result from Australia standing strongly with some 30 other nations at this time to deal with these issues. </para></talk.start><para>Australia must stand up for human rights. For a dozen years the world has allowed Saddam Hussein to continue down the path of violating basic human rights. It has not been possible for those within his nation to have a contrary view to him. Those who have a different religious background have not been able to express their view. Those who have come from a different ethnic background have not been able to survive. They have been the victims of torture, institutional rape, the gouging out of children's eyes—all of these horrors have occurred. These are facts. </para><para>I respect strongly the views and concerns of those who have different approaches to that of the government. Everyone needs to understand that no-one wants war. The Prime Minister has said this on many occasions, and I totally agree. While I share the genuine ambitions of those who say no to war, sadly it seems that nothing anybody says is going to stop Saddam Hussein from continuing to ignore countless United Nations directives over the last dozen years. He has said no so many times and shows no interest whatsoever in abiding by the world's directives to disarm.</para><para>It is worth noting that there are only six countries in the world that for the past 100 years have maintained democratic traditions. Australia is proudly one of those six. New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and Switzerland are the other five. We are one of those nations which can rightly say that we have respect for people of all backgrounds to ably contribute to society. That is the way we organise ourselves, so we are in a position to judge a regime that is doing the exact opposite.</para><para>There are those who are saying that it is not our fight, that it is not relevant. It will only become relevant when it is too late. As the Prime Minister has suggested, does it take an attack onshore to make it relevant to Australia and its people? No, it does not. We must stand for something. Moreover, we must ensure that we fight this fight offshore, not onshore. It is critical at this time that, when we talk about national security, we know we cannot maintain it unless there is a sense of support for all in our communities. Without community harmony in our multicultural society there can be no national security. </para><para>It is important that all in this place show leadership, support and a sense of unity—but we are not seeing it from the Australian Labor Party at this critical time. For people who come from a variety of backgrounds whom we see in our communities, in our streets, in our neighbourhoods and in my own electorate this is certainly very relevant. Kurdish people who have fled Iraq, who have fled the Saddam regime, understand only too well the hurt that has been inflicted upon their families by this evil man. I have been meeting with them, and I understand their concerns. As the Prime Minister said on 4 February, while they want to see the end of Saddam, they are worried that the first people Saddam will pick on—in the way that he has always picked on them and victimised them—will be the Kurds. </para><para>We must spend time thinking about the feelings of those 15,000 Iraqis who are part of Australian society today. They are here for the best of reasons. We must not allow any of them to be targeted or to be made to feel fearful in our society during this time. The 280,000 people who are respectful followers of Islamic traditions, the Australian Muslim community, have risen to the occasion in the way that they have expressed their sense of Australianness, especially since Bali but most profoundly since the September 11 horror. That sort of Australian conduct needs to be rewarded with our support as Australians of all backgrounds, particularly at this time. </para><para>As a minister in the government, I am doing my bit—along with the Prime Minister, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and, indeed, all government members—to try to provide strength and support to members of our local communities. The Australian National Dialogue of Christians, Muslims and Jews was launched last week in Sydney. Members of each of those three faiths are sitting down and talking to each other about how they share a common destiny in this country and how they lament the fact that in other parts of the world there is no opportunity to realise any ambition like that, with Iraq being the worst example of that lack of opportunity. </para><para>It is important that we are all in the business of promoting a sense of unity and not using rhetoric or what is occurring elsewhere in the world to drive a wedge in our communities. It is shocking to think that, in the nexus of the political cycle we are in, with an impending war, you have weak opposition leadership. The Leader of the Opposition's concern for keeping the Left behind his fragile leadership seems to be his motivation for opposition to what the government is doing. If the member for Brand were the leader, I believe things would have been different. In this nexus is a New South Wales election where the Australian Labor Party know that their do-nothing state government has let down people in Western Sydney where a lot of Muslims live. This also seems to be a powerful motivator for the sort of hysteria that they have been trying to promote in that part of Australia in the weeks leading up to this. Of course, many opposite are facing their own preselections and, as we know, they owe their support, their position in this place, to outside forces.</para><para>These sorts of issues are real in this debate. They are real because the member for Reid, the shadow minister for multicultural affairs, has been driving his own wedge. He has been trying to suggest to the Arabic community ethnic broadcasters in this country that the government is trying to shut them down or to control what they have to say. Yet we know it is not true; it is a total fabrication. According to his web site, in a speech on 17 November to the ethnic community broadcasters' National Ethnic Media And Multicultural Broadcasters' Council in Adelaide, the member for Reid said:</para><quote><para>I also told the conference that I am concerned about the increasing ability of overseas media to easily penetrate niche ethnic and religious markets in Australia. It is clear that some of these media sources are hostile to cooperation and to ethnic, political and religious conciliation. They reflect tendencies and values that are contrary to Australia's commitment to multiculturalism.</para></quote><para>The member for Reid was right in that speech of 17 November, but how does he reconcile that with his outrageous conduct over the last couple of weeks in trying to create fear in the hearts and minds of people who are feeling very vulnerable right at this time? It is a disgraceful course of conduct by the member for Reid and by others opposite who have been silent on the issue and who have not pulled him into line. There is a lack of leadership in the Australian Labor Party.</para><para>By contrast, this Prime Minister has shown strength and a sense of purpose. He has been willing to present himself as the person ultimately responsible for the decisions that have been made on behalf of the people of Australia. These sorts of decisions are never easy, but when you stand for something you know what you have to do and when you have to do it. As the Prime Minister said on 4 February:</para><quote><para>Australia is home to several hundred thousand people of Middle Eastern background ... Many of them could be torn between seeing Saddam brought to account and the possible dangers facing their families back in Iraq. During this time, they will need our compassion and our support. All Australians should ensure that this is offered.</para></quote><para>That is a reasonable message that again shows strong leadership from this Prime Minister, yet those opposite simply want to do the exact opposite and create a sense of fear and uncertainty amongst people who are already feeling vulnerable. </para><para>It is critical that Australians of all backgrounds get behind Harmony Day tomorrow, 21 March. There are 474 events and some 2,700 community organisations around Australia will be involved. By wearing the colour orange, Australians can say no to racism and yes to what brings us together—yes to support for our Australian friends of all backgrounds who are part of our community. Australians are united to defend our liberty, our free speech, our way of life and our values. That is what leadership is all about. When you take on a regime that those opposite in their contribution to this debate seem all too willing to try to excuse, it is one of those examples of just how hard strong leadership can sometimes prove to be. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>13113</page.no><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name><name.id>HH4</name.id><electorate>Scullin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I oppose Australia's involvement in a war as proposed by Prime Minister Howard this week. As I have said in previous contributions to the debate on the situation in Iraq, the military solution is the wrong solution. It is 11.15 a.m. Eastern Summer Time. The countdown to an invasion is now not measured in weeks, days or even hours; it is perhaps measured in minutes. Signals will commence to bounce off satellites and earth based communication centres. Jets and other aircraft will take off from carriers in the several air bases in the region. Bombing will commence. Missiles will be launched from land and sea. Subsequently, troops will be deployed—dropping from the air, moving in armed vehicles or moving on foot. Special forces will leave their secret bases. At the end of the day great destruction will occur. There are still many in the Australian community who, quite rightly and justifiably, ask why.</para></talk.start><para>Over the past several months the Prime Minister and other members of this Australian government have had the opportunity to explain to the Australian public why such action is necessary. Why is it that Australia should act on the call of the leader of another country—the United States? Many opposite have said that it is not only the United States that supports the action but also the United Kingdom. The call to our Prime Minister was not from Tony Blair; it was from George W. Bush. So that we get across the issue of our position on where the British Labour Party finds itself, I quite happily indicate that I am with the 139 members of the British Labour caucus who voted against the decision made by their leader, the Prime Minister. I think that goes to the need to understand that there is great debate about the actions that are about to occur. This should not simply be a matter of sloganeering and name-calling. There is still a chance to go through the issues as presented and try to achieve a way out that is much more peaceful in nature.</para><para>Right from the outset the opposition has taken the position that the way to go forward with the issues that surround Iraq—their weapons of mass destruction, the removal of those weapons and the modification of the behaviour of the regime that has led Iraq for several decades—is through the United Nations. It has become clear over the last few months and weeks that the only way there would be a peaceful resolution was through the United Nations. Each of the reports of the bodies that were given carriage of the most recent resolution, 1441—they being UNMOVIC and the International Atomic Energy Agency—has held out hope of successful achievement of the goal of removing Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. It has to be acknowledged that Hans Blix, on behalf of UNMOVIC, and Mohamed ElBaradei, on behalf of the IAEA, have indicated that. It has to be asked why this week—why today, why perhaps this hour—an action has to be embarked upon when progress was being made.</para><para>We have heard, through this debate and over the last few weeks, that the government is now pushing the barrow that there needs to be regime change because of the appalling behaviour of Saddam Hussein. The abuse of human rights in Iraq is a question that needs to be dealt with. But let us look at the time frame under which that has developed and at the way Saddam Hussein has been given succour. When those abuses of the human rights of individuals are highlighted and mention is made of Iraq's incursions into neighbouring countries—such as Kuwait and, further back, Iran—do we learn the lesson of history? Do we learn the lesson of history about the incursion into Iran? Do we hear mention of who gave support to Saddam Hussein at that stage back in the late 1970s and early 1980s? No; because it is convenient to gloss over the changes of world opinion and the changes of backing.</para><para>At the end of the day these are central questions concerning what we confront now. Even if there is to be regime change, even if there is actually a plan post the devastation of Iraq about the way in which we put in place a new regime that will protect the minorities of Iraq—and will be able to guarantee that minorities such as the Kurds in northern Iraq will then be able to see this change—how will we ensure that in several years we have not created yet another monster? The only way we can protect ourselves in a new, developing global world order is through collective action at an international level and through making sure that the United Nations is given every opportunity to work.</para><para>We have not seen a proper discussion of the way in which the action that is about to commence will cause further instability in the Middle East region. What is going to be the effect of the action when neighbouring nations are dragged into the vortex that will be formed? Will it indeed lead to a more stable Middle East? I am of the opinion that it will not. Often I hope that many of the conclusions that I have come to are wrong.</para><para>What of the effect of Australia's involvement as one of only three nations that are committing defence forces to this action? What of the effect on our standing in our own region when our major neighbours are against the action? Even if we live in hope that the present Indonesian leadership is able to convince the populace of Indonesia that this is not a war against Islam, that perception will exist. In a nation like Indonesia, with a population of 230 million people, you do not need to expect a large percentage of people to come to that conclusion to know that we will have a continuing problem. The other aspect of the action is that it sends the wrong signals to a country like Indonesia, which is developing a democratic framework, about the way in which great democracies operate—that great democracies would take pre-emptive action against a sovereign state. Whether or not Iraq is described as a rogue state, it is action against a sovereign state.</para><para>There was time to get a peaceful outcome. There was time to ensure that Saddam Hussein changed his ways. I regret that the actions that are about to commence will lead to a bloody end to this affair.

The Labor Party are so split on this issue that they would be hopeless in government, as they are in opposition. They are split three ways. There are actually several members of the opposition who believe that we are doing the right thing but publicly have not got the guts to say so. Then there is the group that slavishly follows the line of the opposition leader—that force should be used only if there is yet another resolution from the UN. Then there is the group of opposition MPs who do not even agree with that line and who oppose the use of any such force under any circumstances. The Labor Party are actually split three ways whereas we on this side of the chamber are not.</para><para>The members for Watson, Franklin and Sydney cannot even support their own leader on this issue. What would they be like in government? If you cannot govern your own party, as the line goes, you cannot govern Australia.

What was Saddam's invasion into Kuwait—another school picnic?</para><para>The Labor Party opposition is the most disgraceful opposition in living memory. It is not content to throw bipartisanship out the window. Every Labor speaker that I have heard, as if under their own marching orders, has tried to terrify the Australian population by saying that this action means that we are now real targets for terrorists. Isn't it ironic that only a matter of weeks ago they denigrated this government for a householder mail-out to warn of the need for vigilance and said how unnecessary it was? Now they try to tell us that we are targets so we had better look out. Talk about sitting on both sides of the fence. Here we have an opposition that cannot make up its mind about which side of the fence to sit on but opportunistically and disgustingly tries to terrify the Australian population.</para><para>The idea that somehow we can make ourselves less vulnerable to being targets for terrorist attacks by shutting up and doing nothing is not backed up by experience or the facts. The French, Kenyans and Germans have suffered from terrorist attacks; their appeasing ways have not worked. French President Chirac has not achieved anything with his appeasement either. In fact, I believe he has actually done great damage to the cause of the United Nations, because he has led the charge for inaction—as only the French can do. I fear that his actions will lead the United Nations down the same path as the old League of Nations, with no authority and no unity. We had unity with 17 or so resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations and we had unity with the last resolution, 1441, which gave Saddam one last chance. He did not take it. That was over four months ago. How long does anyone want to give this horrible dictator?</para><para>Let us look at some of the untruths being spread by the Labor Party—first of all, that this is somehow an illegal action. The fact remains that the independent experts in international law in both the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are unequivocal in saying that our actions are not illegal. This is also confirmed by the British Attorney-General. The second furphy is that this is a unilateral action. The fact is that 30 nations have agreed to be part of this coalition of the willing for the immediate disarmament of Iraq and at least another 15 countries are cooperating. Let us look at some of those 30 countries.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name></talker><para>—That's more than three.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>848</name.id><name role="metadata">Secker, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SECKER</name></talker><para>—Much more than three.

We have Asian countries like Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, and the list goes on. So for anyone to suggest that this action is somehow unilateral is sheer nonsense. We heard the member for Banks, amongst others, disgracefully saying that the blood of the innocent victims in Iraq will be on our hands and on the hands of the Prime Minister. Inaction has already caused the death and suffering of over a million innocent Iraqis. How many more does he want before he acts?</para></talk.start></continue><para>Then there is the furphy that we should not act without the say-so of the United Nations through yet another resolution.

I am accused of not listening by some because I do not agree with their views. Either way, I have listened and I have sought their views—and they do vary, quite considerably. I have read numerous articles, both for and against, but in the end, even though there are always doubts in your mind when you look at all of the different reasons for and against the action, I keep coming back to the need to disarm Saddam Hussein in the only way he knows. We all hate war. We would all prefer to avoid it. But Saddam has left the world with no option. He alone can now avert this action.</para><para>I send our brave troops my thoughts and prayers for their safe return. I wish well the parents, families and friends of our troops, who I know will be supporting them. I have spoken in my electorate to parents of people in the Air Force, on the ground and in the Navy. There are a few in my electorate who will have a certain unease. There is no doubt that there is some unease out there, because nobody likes war. There is concern about what is going to happen. You can never predict what happens in a war. But, in the end, I support this motion. I hope for a speedy result in the form of the liberation of Iraq from the control of this awful dictator.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>13116</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Nearly 33 years ago the future Deputy Prime Minister of Australia Jim Cairns wrote the book <inline font-style="italic">Silence Kills</inline>, which dealt with a previous deception of the Australian people by a coalition Prime Minister. It is interesting to note, when we see the massive demonstrations around this country and particularly in rural and regional areas, and when we see the John Valders and Peter Baumes of this world going public at such an early stage in the lead-up to this conflict, that the numbers of those who demonstrated in May 1970, the demonstrations about which that book was written, were very small— 8,000 in Brisbane, 25,000 in Sydney and 70,000 to 100,000 in Melbourne. Clearly, in the context of the recent outpouring of opposition to this war in Australia, the eventual opposition by the Australian people to our involvement in Vietnam looks very paltry.</para></talk.start><para>I speak of misleading the Australian people because the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, misled the Australian people as to why we were in Vietnam. He stated that we were asked by South Vietnam. History has shown that the actual request came from the United States of America. In this conflict we again have an obsequious government which is essentially following US dictates and which has misled the Australian people and the troops going to the Middle East, insofar as this undertaking was made many months ago. It was not made after the phone call last week; it was made in far earlier discussions with the American administration.</para><para>Throughout this debate we have been regaled with a nauseating list of guilty actions by the Iraqi regime—gouging out the eyes of four-year-old children, putting people in acid baths et cetera. But these are not new facts. I have been interested to note that the people who seem to get most emotional about these outrages in Iraq are the people who tend to take the least interest in human rights around the world. In 1982 when Ronald Reagan took Iraq off the list of supporters of terrorism around the world, in December 1983 when Rumsfeld went to have a few cups of coffee with Tariq Aziz and in November 1984 when the United States restored diplomatic ties with Iraq, these events were already occurring. It is quite interesting that the main basis on which coalition members are defending our involvement in this war is human rights abuses in Iraq, because these are not new—they are decades old and, quite frankly, they were condoned by the American administration because Iraq at that stage was regarded as a reliable ally.</para><para>We have heard other speakers tell us about the dreadful actions of the Iraqis in using gases on Kurds and in Iran. It is interesting to note that in regard to the invasion of Iran, which is now criticised by coalition members, the United States provided air strike suggestions to the Iraqi government and supplied their reconnaissance information to the Iraqi regime. This invasion, which is used today as such a dreadful thing and a reason for our action now, was condoned and abetted by the United States administration. Between 1985 and 1990 they issued 77 licences for biological products to Iraq.</para><para>When we look at the lone three sponsors of this resolution at the UN, which failed to get support, we see that Spain is one of them. Prime Minister Aznar was virtually pleading to the cortes the other day, `We won't send any troops. We know public opinion is totally against us. We know we have cosigned this resolution but we will definitely not be sending any troops.'</para><para>We have dealt with the US long-term relationship with Iraq. There was a very interesting article in the <inline font-style="italic">Guardian Weekly</inline> last week in regards to the United Kingdom, the other co-sponsor. That article revealed that under the Thatcher government, Paul Channon, the minister for trade, hid from the American administration, the complicity of the UK administration in helping Iraq to build Falluja 2—which is regarded as one of the main possibilities for the production of mustard gas. Not only that, but Britain provided export credits. They provided export credits behind the backs of the American administration to facilitate this program which is now so dreadful. It is interesting to note that the Ministry of Defence in Britain weighed in, warning that it could be used to make chemical weapons. So we have a situation where one of the co-sponsors aided—in a period when even the United States was starting to have doubts about Iraq—the build-up of these weapons which we are now so embarrassed by and so critical of.</para><para>The government is so desperate to raise the issue human rights abuses because other arguments have disappeared. On the question of legality, Professor Andrew Byrnes, a Canberra based legal scholar, said:</para><quote><para>... it is the only a vaguely respectable argument but it is based on very weak legal grounds.</para></quote><para>We all know they did not have the effrontery or the hide to attempt to put a resolution through the UN Security Council last week because of a lack of support. The Prime Minister can argue until the cows come home that they did not do it because the French would veto it. We all know, despite all the wire taps on diplomats at the United Nations, despite the spying on Chile and despite all the US heavying of other delegations, they could not get a majority because the rest of the world does not agree with them.</para><para>It is interesting to note in all of this reliance, supposedly, on resolutions 678 and 1441 that paragraph 14 of resolution 1441 requires that the Security Council be kept seized of detail—a clear message that there was not an automatic endorsement of unilateral action by a few countries. Similarly, it is interesting that, if there is support for this in previous UN resolutions, the original draft of 1441 included a specific clause to allow this. It was deleted because it could not get support at the UN. So this argument that we can rely on resolutions years ago, when they failed to get endorsement in this last fortnight, is an extremely weak argument.</para><para>I will move now to al-Qaeda. When this started there was great endorsement of the US and its war against terrorism, as there still is, but Thomas Friedman, a noted authority in the Middle East—and many members might have read some of his books—said that the US has been `big on attitude, weak on strategy and terrible on diplomacy'. The former National Security Adviser Brzezinski said:</para><quote><para>The concern I have is that our single-minded and, unfortunately, rather demagogic fixation on Iraq is undermining the credibility as well as the legitimacy of US leadership.</para></quote><para>They had international support in dealing with al-Qaeda and Afghanistan but the world has little faith in the US argument that al-Qaeda is somehow aligned with Iraq. The United States have even dropped that off in the last few months. Instead of this supposed connection that they were going to establish and prove to the world, they are now saying, `They are not really connected, but they have these weapons that might get into the hands of terrorists.' </para><para>Quite frankly, if you look at the state of Russia these days and the kinds of people who are getting 10c a week for work in former laboratories there and the evidence we have of materials being smuggled into Europe illegally and the situation in Pakistan, this argument that we had better knock them over before they provide weapons to terrorists is condoning American policy of world hegemony where they act against anyone and everyone.</para><para>In regards to the way in which the US has handled this, it is interesting to note the comments of Robin Cook, in his speech in the House of Commons this week. He said:</para><quote><para>The reality is that Britain is being asked to embark on a war without agreement in any of the international bodies of which we are a leading partner—not NATO, not the European Union and, now, not the Security Council.</para><para>To end up in such diplomatic weakness is a serous reverse. Only a year ago, we and the United States were part of a coalition against terrorism that was wider and more diverse than I would ever have imagined possible. History will be astonished at the diplomatic miscalculations that led so quickly to the disintegration of that powerful coalition.</para></quote><para>He is saying that the US has squandered international sympathy in regard to its action against Islamic fundamentalism because it has become so single-mindedly obsessed with Iraq, a country which historically has been among the most secular, if dictatorial, in the Middle East. It is a country that has been condemned by bin Laden because of its lack of religious beliefs. Now we are going to move in there supposedly because of an alleged adherence.</para><para>In the journal <inline font-style="italic">Arms Control Today</inline>, January/February 2003, John Steinbruner said:</para><quote><para>Under prevailing circumstances of access, it would be impossible to identify and disable all dedicated terrorists and rogues before they have accomplished nefarious deeds, and it would be foolish to attempt to do so by national military operations. A campaign of that sort conducted by the United States under the doctrine of coercive pre-emption is more likely to stimulate the destructive application of biotechnology than to prevent it.</para></quote><para>Furthermore, he said:</para><quote><para>... the central contention—that pre-emptive attack can prevent the acquisition of mass destruction technology—is not realistic and does not provide a responsible basis for protecting the United States or anyone else. Preventive action against potentially unmanageable threats is indeed an increasingly vital security interest, but that cannot be accomplished by coercive methods. It will require the systematic exchange of sensitive monitoring information for mutual protection, and arrangements of that sort cannot be established while one party is wielding a confrontational threat against the others. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>13119</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to speak on this very important matter of Iraq and Australia's involvement in a coalition force to disarm Iraq. From the outset, let me state that I am uncomfortable in going to war. However, let me also state that I am even more uncomfortable in allowing a regime like that of Saddam Hussein to have control of weapons of mass destruction. Over 12 years and through 17 United Nations resolutions, Saddam Hussein has failed to rid himself of these weapons. The Labor Party condemns the Howard government for deploying troops to the gulf, but the reality is that, if it was not for the deployment of our troops to stand alongside those of the USA and the United Kingdom drawing a line in the sand, weapons inspectors would never have been allowed back into Iraq in the first place. It has also been extremely disappointing to hear comments from opposition members on this matter that must be giving Saddam Hussein and his regime great satisfaction. They are trying to convince Australians that continuing on the process of warnings for Iraq to disarm will in fact lead to disarmament. But after 12 years, why would Iraq disarm now if there were no threat of military action? After 12 years of Iraq's non-compliance with the United Nations, and after exhausting all diplomatic measures possible, the world is left with no choice but to undertake action.</para></talk.start><para>The British Labour Prime Minister, Tony Blair, summed up this point well in his speech this week when he talked about the fact that the world can no longer play the waiting game. He said:</para><quote><para>What would any tyrannical regime possessing WMD think viewing the history of the world's diplomatic dance with Saddam? That our capacity to pass firm resolutions is only matched by our feebleness in implementing them.</para><para>That is why this indulgence has to stop. Because it is dangerous ... if such regimes disbelieve us. Dangerous if they think they can use our weakness, our hesitation, even the natural urges of our democracy towards peace, against us. Dangerous because one day they will mistake our innate revulsion against war for permanent incapacity; when in fact, pushed to the limit, we will act. But then when we act, after years of pretence, the action will have to be harder, bigger, more total in its impact. Iraq is not the only regime with WMD. But back away now from this confrontation and future conflicts will be infinitely worse and more devastating.</para></quote><para>Unfortunately members opposite are backing away; it is as if the ALP were apologists for Saddam Hussein. If we do not stand up now and confront the problem directly, we are giving Saddam more time to develop weapons of mass destruction. If we do not stand up now, we are sending the message to terrorists across the world that resolutions are not backed up by action.</para><para>United Nations resolutions 678, 687 and 1441 were given legal authority to use force to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. All of these resolutions were passed under chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. In resolution 678, the Security Council authorised United Nations member states with all necessary means to liberate Kuwait and restore international peace and security to the area. Resolution 687 imposed a conditional cease-fire on Iraq following the liberation of Kuwait based on Iraqi compliance with obligations to disarm its weapons of mass destruction. It also reaffirms the authority of resolution 678 and refers to the threat to peace and security in the area posed by weapons of mass destruction. In resolution 1441, the Security Council recalls resolution 678 as a relevant resolution to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction disarmament, recalls further that the cease-fire in 687 was conditional upon Iraqi compliance with Iraq's obligation to disarm and decides that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of this obligation. It also gave Iraq one final opportunity to comply, deciding at the time that any Iraqi false statements, omissions in its declarations or other than full cooperation with weapons inspectors would be a further material breach of its obligation.</para><para>It is abundantly clear that Saddam Hussein runs perhaps one of the most oppressive regimes in the world, and the oppression of the Iraqi people is something that we have all heard stories about in the past few months in particular. In addressing the threats Saddam's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction poses, it is impossible to ignore his record on human rights. Indeed, his treatment of his own people underlines why he poses such a threat to his neighbours and to the broader international community. Members opposite have been completely silent on these atrocities, but many Australians heard this week a broadcast on the John Laws program when he read a report that was published in Britain by a group called Indict. Indict were recent observers in Iraq and their report details some of the most abhorrent abuses of humans known to man. One example is of opponents of the Iraqi regime being placed alive, head first or feet first, into a shredding machine and the remains of bodies later being used as fish food. Not only is it terrifying that a regime could subject its own people to this sort of treatment, but it is also terrifying to think that a regime like this has weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>Human rights advocates such as Amnesty International have also given examples of the atrocities that have occurred. According to Amnesty International:</para><quote><para>Victims of torture in Iraq have been subjected to a wide range of forms of torture. The bodies of many of those executed had evident signs of torture, including the gouging out of the eyes, marks of severe beatings and electric shocks to various parts of the body, when returned to their families. Some detainees died as a result of torture. Many torture victims now live with permanent physical or psychological damage. </para><para>...					...				...</para><para>In the mid-1990s Iraq introduced judicial punishments such as amputation of hand and foot, branding of forehead and cutting off of the ears, and many people have been left with permanently mutilated bodies as a result of such punishments.</para></quote><para>We can also not forget the deadly weaponry and weapons of mass destruction that remained unaccounted for when inspectors left Iraq in 1998. This included 10,000 litres of anthrax, the VX nerve agent program, up to 6,500 chemical munitions, at least 80 tonnes of mustard gas and biological poisons including sarin and botulinum toxin. More recently, Dr Hans Blix said:</para><quote><para>There is a discrepancy of 6,500 bombs. The amount of chemical agents in these bombs would be in the order of about 1,000 tonnes. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we must assume that these quantities are now unaccounted for.</para></quote><para>We cannot turn a blind eye to these unaccounted for weapons, including biological and chemical weapons. We cannot turn a blind eye to the al-Samoud missiles or the drone aircraft that have been recently found by inspectors. The dangers that a regime such as Iraq poses with these unaccounted weapons is frightening, but there are many countries across the world that recognise the need to stand strong and united on this matter. There are now 30 countries that have agreed to be part of the coalition for disarming Iraq. In addition, there are another 15 countries that are cooperating with the coalition and are offering defensive assets should Saddam Hussein use weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>What would the Labor Party say to the Kurdish Prime Minister, Dr Barham Salih? This is what Dr Salih said to <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline> reporter Richard Carleton on 16 February:</para><quote><para>This is not an academic exercise for people here. We have been through this before. People here do not await the outcome of inspections in Baghdad and do not have to wait for the verdict of Dr Blix about whether Iraq has weapons of mass destruction or not. We have come to expect the worst of this regime and people are concerned.</para></quote><para>When asked about his feelings about American, British and Australian soldiers coming to Iraq to fight a war, the Kurdish Prime Minister said:</para><quote><para>... I can understand the sensitivities. I mean, war is not an easy option for people. This should be about freedom, liberation. This is not too different from what happened in Germany and Italy and other parts of the world that were gripped by fascism and dictatorships. I wish we could do it on our own and we did not have to burden other countries to come to our assistance, but we are helpless in the face of tyranny. You cannot be for peace without doing something decisive about this tyranny in Baghdad ...</para></quote><para>I will conclude today by quoting comments from Elie Wiesel, a Nobel Peace laureate and a Holocaust survivor. He said:</para><quote><para>The nightmarish question of what such a man might do with his arsenal of unconventional weaponry is why, more than ever, some of us believe in intervention. We must deal sooner rather than later with this madman whose possession of weapons of mass destruction threatens to provoke an ever-widening conflagration. What it comes down to is this: we have a moral obligation to intervene where evil is in control. Today, that place is Iraq.</para></quote><para>As I said at the start, I am uncomfortable in going to war—but let me also state that I am more uncomfortable in allowing a regime like that of Saddam Hussein to have control of weapons of mass destruction.

We are told that we are going in there to uphold UN resolution 1441 and other UN resolutions which Saddam Hussein has violated. We are told that he has been flouting UN resolutions for 12 years. If this is so important, why is action only being taken now? Why not in year 1, year 2, year 3, year 4, year 5, year 6, year 7, year 8, year 9, year 10 or year 11? Why now? And why is the UN itself not authorising this action to enforce its resolutions?</para><para>If someone breaks the law, we are not allowed to take the law into our own hands and administer punishment ourselves. Without a UN resolution, the coalition of the willing is merely a vigilante gang. One day there will be a motorbike gang with `coalition of the willing' emblazoned on its leather jackets, as `coalition of the willing' becomes a byword for reckless indifference to the rule of law, reckless indifference to proper process and reckless indifference to the suffering of innocent men, women and children that their activities may cause.</para><para>We are told that we are going in there to give democracy and human rights to the Iraqi people—but to do this we ignore the democracy of the United Nations. Let us bury the spin of the US and Australian governments that there is no UN resolution because of the French veto. That resolution was withdrawn because it could not get majority support on the UN Security Council. That resolution was withdrawn because it did not have the support of the international community. As of today just five countries, a handful, have committed forces to the invasion.</para><para>I heard the Liberal member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly, referring in her remarks to the German veto.

It is disconcerting that Liberal members of parliament who are voting today for this war know so little of history.</para><para>If it is our duty to bring democracy and freedom to Iraq, are we to stop there?

I suspect not.</para><para>We are told that we are going in to fight terrorism, to help secure Australia from terrorism. But the Leader of the House admits that our invasion of Iraq increases the risk of terrorist attack in Australia—and surely he is right. Instead of using all their resources and energies in the fight to capture Osama bin Laden and round up al-Qaeda, the US and Australia are distracted in Iraq. This attack itself will produce more Osama bin Ladens. Deny it as much as you like: this will be seen by some Islamic fundamentalists as an act of religious aggression. Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda will not be hurt by this; they will profit from it.</para><para>I pause momentarily to acknowledge that it is now 12 o'clock—high noon. The deadline set by George Bush for Saddam Hussein has just passed and, from this moment on, the world that we have come to know will change. I want to use the words of freelance journalist Peter Freundlich, who I think summed up the idiocy of the logic of this very well. He says:</para><quote><para>All right, let me see if I understand the logic of this correctly. We are going to ignore the United Nations in order to make clear to Saddam Hussein that the United Nations cannot be ignored. We're going to wage war to preserve the UN's ability to avert war. The paramount principle is that the UN's word must be taken seriously, and if we have to subvert its word to guarantee that it is, then by gum, we will. Am I getting this right?</para><para>Further, if the only way to bring democracy to Iraq is to vitiate the democracy of the Security Council, then we are honour-bound to do that too, because democracy, as we define it, is too important to be stopped by a little thing like democracy as they define it.</para><para>Also, in dealing with a man who brooks no dissension at home, we cannot afford dissension among ourselves. We must speak with one voice against Saddam Hussein's failure to allow opposing voices to be heard. We are sending our gathered might to the Persian Gulf to make the point that might does not make right, as Saddam Hussein seems to think it does. And we are twisting the arms of the opposition until it agrees to let us oust a regime that twists the arms of the opposition. We cannot leave in power a dictator who ignores his own people. And if our people, and people elsewhere in the world, fail to understand that, then we have no choice but to ignore them.</para><para>Listen. Don't misunderstand. I think it is a good thing that the members of the Bush administration seem to have been reading Lewis Carroll. I only wish someone had pointed out that “Alice in Wonderland” and “Through the Looking Glass” are meditations on paradox and puzzle and illogic and on the strangeness of things, not templates for foreign policy.</para></quote><para>As shadow minister for the environment, I feel a responsibility to mention to the House some of the environmental impacts of the proposed war. As it happens, millions of birds are making their way across Iraq on their annual spring migration to northern breeding grounds. At this time of year, March-April, you have the greatest number of birds in Iraq and, from a biodiversity point of view, this is the worst possible time of year to have a war. Iraq is on a key migration route for many birds that winter in Africa and breed in Europe and Western Russia in the summer. Iraq's two major rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates, are an important part of the route for many long distance migrants, including pelicans, storks and the shore birds that breed along the Caspian Sea and in central Asia. It is estimated that, when we had the first Gulf War, tens of thousands of waders were killed on the Northern Arabian Gulf coast. There was approximately a 97 per cent reduction in the number of coastal waders present compared to a previous baseline study. The number of waders remaining in the impacted zone in March to May 1991 suffered an enormous decline, from an estimated 130,000 to approximately 4,000 or less. There are many other environmental issues as well, such as the prospect of acid rain, damage from oil slicks and the like.</para><para>When Prime Minister Howard came to power in 1996, he came to power on the back of a memorable promise to make Australians feel relaxed and comfortable. It was a very good line. I felt myself being drawn to it, and I was then a Labor candidate. But seven years later, the Australians I talk to do not feel relaxed and comfortable. They feel tense and frightened, and the Prime Minister's actions in committing Australian troops to invade another country have ensured that Australians will go on feeling tense and frightened for many years to come.

Over and over again in this place, I have heard only three countries mentioned: America, the United Kingdom and Australia. But there is more to this story. There are 30 countries—I repeat, 30 other countries—which have agreed to be part of the coalition for the disarmament of Iraq, and each of these countries is contributing in its way what it deems appropriate to the disarmament of Iraq and the destruction of its weapons of mass destruction. In addition to these 30 countries, 15 or so countries are cooperating with the coalition. Let us now look at the major players who have chosen to ignore UN resolutions 678, 687 and 1441. I will go back in history a little.</para><para>As a member of the New South Wales Parliament, I joined a group of parliamentarians in a protest against the French nuclear testing in the Pacific. It took the wrath and commitment of many countries to force France to stop the testing. And this is the country that would not assist the many people who are suffering under Saddam's regime. And what of the hypocrisy of Germany? That country would not support the disarmament of Iraq, whose list of chemical suppliers, dated from 1998 to today, contains 31 major suppliers and 14 of them are from Germany. The nuclear suppliers list, dated from 1996 to today, has 62 company names on it and 33 of them are from Germany. What makes this even more disturbing is that Germany is a signatory to the chemical weapons convention, the European convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons and the UN sanctions on Iraq. This is hypocrisy at its worst. </para><para>No sane person wants or agrees with war, but this government believes that the decision it has taken is not only right but also legal, despite the endless debate from the `legal beagles'. Since September 11 we have all faced a different world: a world that is scary, where people have become unsure and afraid of the terrorist culture which followed that terrible attack in New York. The whole world's security is threatened by Saddam Hussein's regime—a brutal, cruel dictatorship. It may not be a direct threat to Australia, but it is a grave threat that Iraq is led by a mad dictator who is in possession of chemical and biological weapons. Despite the UN calling 17 times by resolution for him to disarm, he has continually refused to do so. We must keep in mind that he has used these weapons against his country's own men, women and children.</para><para>In the electorate of Hume, which I represent, I have faced a vigorous and sometimes vicious and threatening campaign by a vocal minority, but many constituents have quietly told me that they agree totally with John Howard's decision. Most of them are well informed with facts and have indicated that Saddam Hussein must be stopped and that the suffering of his people must end. This demonstrates what I have always known: Australians are well-informed, fair-minded citizens of the world. They are not influenced by the spin doctors and they are prepared to make sacrifices to liberate the Iraqi people from a bestial tyrant. Hume constituents are aware that the end of Saddam's regime will diminish the number of Middle East states which sponsor terrorism. We must send a very clear and concise message to other countries that such behaviour, such defiance of the UN, cannot be tolerated. It will also mean the end to Saddam's dictatorship, the end of his role as a sponsor of terrorism and the end to his menacing nuclear weapons program. </para><para>I take a moment now to acknowledge the professional dedication of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who are proudly serving their country away from their families and friends. I salute each and every one of them. I pray for their safe return and remind them that they have the support of the majority of their fellow Australians. Godspeed to all of you. I have heard some people complain that the credibility of the US has been damaged by war without the approval of the Security Council. I remind all of them that a US coalition intervened in Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s to stop ethnic cleansing and genocide while the United Nations stood by, wringing its hands and doing nothing.</para><para>Enough is enough. Saddam Hussein must be disarmed and his people freed of this brutal regime. As I said at the beginning of my contribution to this debate: the decision that has been taken by the Prime Minister was not taken lightly. It was a decision that needed to be taken in the interests of world security and any future threat that may occur as a result of the sponsoring of terrorism by dictators such as Saddam Hussein. It was a decision that needed to be taken to ensure that the long-term security of this country is protected. More importantly, it was a decision that had to be taken by a Prime Minister who is willing to put himself before the people—as he has done in the past—to make very difficult decisions that many Australians may not like. I am sure the bulk of Australians will applaud and congratulate the Prime Minister on these decisions.</para><para>In closing, as I said earlier, none of us likes war. None of us likes to see our children, our friends and our relatives going to war. War is the most horrific thing that can happen to the population of this world, and I am sure that there is not one person in this place or, indeed, in this country, who would openly say that they support war of any kind. I will just make some brief comments on the point that I made about visiting Mururoa Atoll during the 1990s, when the French were arrogantly testing nuclear weapons. I went to that place in the company of people who have a different ideology to me—people who are very strong on human rights. I want to place on record here today that many of those people who are sanctimoniously criticising the government and the Prime Minister for making this decision are the very same people who went to protest against France's contribution to the arrogant testing of atomic bombs in the Pacific.</para><para>In closing I want to say, as have many of my parliamentary colleagues, that I totally support this motion and that I am totally behind and supportive of the Prime Minister and his cabinet for the very difficult decision that they have made in committing Australia to the US-led coalition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>13124</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to add my voice to those who oppose this unjust war.

He spoke of the tremendous, easygoing, adventurous spirit of young Australians travelling the world, being open to other cultures and meeting everyone as friends and of how he was sure that that would continue. But how will the rest of the world view Australian travellers now? Will they see us as representatives of an egalitarian people from a diverse and tolerant society or will they see us as warmongers?</para><para>In World War I, Australia fought as part of the British Empire—that was who we were—but the experience at Gallipoli helped forge our own separate national identity. In World War II, we fought a just war against fascism. In Korea, we were part of a force with UN backing against aggression. In Vietnam, the coalition government of the day lied to the Australian people by telling this parliament that South Vietnam had requested our assistance. In the first Gulf War, we were part of a UN force, as we were in East Timor. There is no UN mandate here. We are not bringing peace; we are invading a sovereign country and making war. This is an unjust war without UN backing.</para><para>The comments of the Prime Minister and those in the government in trying to justify our involvement have been nothing short of disgraceful. We have heard a lot about the evils of Saddam Hussein. There is no doubt that it is correct that he is an evil tyrant who has oppressed his own people. But, in the Gaza Strip this week, six Palestinians in a refugee camp were killed by the Israeli army, including a toddler shot in the head. What is the government saying about that? What is our government saying about the death of an American peace activist—23-year-old Rachel Corrie—crushed by an Israeli army bulldozer? Ariel Sharon has already ruled out any so-called `roadmap for Middle East peace' proposed by the Americans. He has declared that Israel will continue its occupation of Palestine in defiance of UN resolutions. What is the government saying about that?</para><para>Our government is about to redefine us in the eyes of the world as willing backers of US militarism. We had three nations meet in the Azores: the United States, the United Kingdom and Spain. We were not even invited to the meeting which determined that there would be war! The Prime Minister took a phone call and immediately said yes to President Bush, because we all know that that decision was made many months ago, before the predeployment of troops. We were not even at the meeting where the decision was made, and yet one of the nations which was at the meeting—Spain—is not sending troops to this war. Just three nations are sending troops: the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. What does that say about the sort of nation that we are? We are a multicultural nation, and yet here we are sending a message, particularly to the Islamic world, that we are a part of the old, white, Anglo-Christian order—and we have the President of the United States who invokes God in defending his government's actions. I say that Islamic fundamentalism is a danger and a threat, but I also say that Christian fundamentalism is a danger and a threat. We should not be revisiting the Crusades, because that is how this war is being perceived by the international community.</para><para>We have heard a lot of criticism of France and its statement that it might use its veto, and yet it indicated very clearly that, if we were to wait just one month, it would take the veto off the table. But let us have a look at the record of vetoes. The United States has used the veto 76 times—35 of them on resolutions on Israel. During the 1980s, the United Nations was concerned with Saddam Hussein's use of chemical weapons—provided by US corporations with the backing and sanction of the US government. On 21 March 1986 the Security Council President, speaking on behalf of the Security Council, stated that the council members were:</para><quote><para>... profoundly concerned by the unanimous conclusion of the specialists that chemical weapons on many occasions have been used by the Iraqi forces against Iranian troops ... [and] the members of the Council strongly condemn this continued use of chemical weapons in clear violation of the Geneva Protocol of 1925 which prohibits the use in war of chemical weapons.</para></quote><para>The United States voted against the issuing of this statement. What hypocrisy! The United States was then supporting Iraq against Iran, because it knew that Iraq—whatever the criticisms of Saddam Hussein—was, and remains, a secular nation. It has no connections with al-Qaeda or with Islamic fundamentalism. Indeed, Osama bin Laden will be very happy with the decision of the so-called coalition of the willing to go to war.</para><para>Iraq does not represent a threat to Australia. We are, with this decision, supporting a pre-emptive strike, which changes forever the way that international politics works. The United Nations has been extremely damaged, not by its own actions but by the actions of the United States, the UK and Australia. There are alternatives to war. The UN weapons inspectors were doing their job, and we should have allowed them to finish that job. The great contradiction was pointed out by Robin Cook, in his courageous speech, when he said:</para><quote><para>Ironically, it is only because Iraq's military forces are so weak that we can even contemplate its invasion. Some advocates of conflict claim that Saddam's forces are so weak, so demoralised and so badly equipped that the war will be over in a few days.</para><para>We cannot base our military strategy on the assumption that Saddam is weak and at the same time justify pre-emptive action on the claim that he is a threat.</para></quote><para>That contradiction is very stark, as is the contradiction when you open up the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of last week and see `the mother of all bombs'. Here we are talking about weapons of mass destruction, but the Western powers are proudly saying, `We've got a bomb which is the most powerful non-nuclear weapon ever produced.' Do you think that is not going to kill civilians? This is an outrage, and we should not be a part of it.</para><para>In conclusion, the argument that we have on this side is very much with the government's decision; it is not with our forces in the Australian Defence Force. We hope that each and every one of them is able to return safely to Australia. But it is our argument that they should not be there. The best way to keep those forces safe is for them to return as soon as possible. We do need regime change in some places of the world—it would certainly be a good thing in Iraq—but it should be brought about peacefully, just as we should bring about a peaceful regime change against this warmongering government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>13126</page.no><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOCKEY</name><name.id>DK6</name.id><electorate>North Sydney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Small Business and Tourism</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I say at the outset that I fully understand the anxiety and concern of the people of my electorate who have expressed to me a view that they obviously would prefer that there be no war with Iraq. I share their view. I would prefer, as I think all Australians would prefer, that there be no war with Iraq. War can inflict horrific pain on fellow human beings, it creates economic devastation and it can have flow-on effects that we could never possibly foresee at the time that we are in a position to have to send our troops into battle.</para></talk.start><para>We are undertaking this partnership with 30 other nations. We have committed our troops, with the leadership of the United States and with Great Britain, on the basis that we see Iraq's behaviour as a material threat to the safety of our nation and our people. There are two tests. The first is: does Iraq have weapons of mass destruction? Even the shadow foreign affairs minister, the Labor Party spokesman, Kevin Rudd, has publicly accepted, as have numerous members of the Labor Party, in agreement with us, that Iraq does possess weapons of mass destruction. There are 10,000 litres of concentrated anthrax that are as yet unaccounted for in Iraq. The fundamental point is: if you can get heroin from Afghanistan onto the streets of Sydney and Melbourne today, you can get anthrax from Iraq onto the streets of Sydney and Melbourne. We cannot wrap ourselves in a cocoon and pretend that we are isolated from the world.</para><para>The second point is: does Iraq support terrorism? There is irrefutable evidence that Iraq supports terrorist activities, and there is no more irrefutable evidence than Saddam Hussein publicly and openly, on television broadcasts around the world, presenting cheques for $US10,000 to the families of Hamas suicide bombers—rewarding their families for, in their view, the ultimate act of sacrifice.</para><para>The war with Iraq is going to be a long war. It will be a short battle—at least we all hope that will be the case—but the war involving Iraq will be long because it is one part of the broader war against terrorism. Laurie Oakes reported in yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> a speech by James Woolsey, the head of the CIA during the Clinton administration, in which he quite properly enunciated the argument that we are now in the middle of the fourth world war. The First World War was, of course, triggered with the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand. The Second World War was triggered by the invasion of Poland. The third world war, if you like, was triggered by Winston Churchill's `Iron Curtain' speech on 5 March 1946. That war—the Cold War—ended in 1989 with the pulling down of the Berlin Wall.</para><para>The fourth world war started on 11 September 2001, when nearly 3,000 people from about 40 different countries died in the World Trade Centre at the hands of a terrorist attack. Four Australians died in the World Trade Centre attack. That war began because we in the Western world have taken for granted the fundamental principle that you are better off if you aspire to certain levels of success. We take it for granted that the world wants to be democratic and we take it for granted that so many impoverished people across the world have access to the material pleasures that we have.</para><para>What convinced me in this debate and about this debate is the link between Iraq and terrorism and the fact that we are in a war against terrorism that will be solved perhaps 20 per cent or 30 per cent by military action. But making up the other 70 per cent must involve addressing the fundamental core reasons for terrorist activity. We must have such a remedy.</para><para>Nothing I have seen has been more distressing than Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, in Jordan and on the Gaza Strip. You can meet third generation Palestinians who have no sewerage and no water, and up to eight people can be living in a small room. Each night the consistent factor across all the refugee camps is their access to television. Every day and every night they watch TV and they see beautiful people in beautiful cars and in beautiful houses, people with wonderful education attending wonderful restaurants that provide beautiful food and they say, `I can never have that.' And increasingly a younger generation, at times up to a third generation, are discovering that they can find more hope in death than in life. As access to information becomes more prevalent across the world, as more people have access to information, we in the West are going to have to deal with the fact that the aspirations that we hold dear and the fundamental rights and entitlements that we take for granted are not going to be the same for all people across the world.</para><para>The war with Iraq of course does involve military action, and it must, for all the reasons the Prime Minister outlined. But the challenge for Australians—every Australian—is to understand that we must be part of an overall response to the war on terror not just by sending our military to do the job but through our own financial commitment. We need a worldwide, modern equivalent of the Marshall Plan. In June 1947 George C. Marshall proposed that there must be both an economic response and a political response to the problems of Europe.</para><para>More than 16 countries were liberated in Europe by the United States. But that was political liberation. If we are going to liberate nations from the threat of terrorism, we need to have a similar plan now that involves all the Western nations putting their hands out to support those countries that might need the same basic infrastructure that Europe needed after World War II—the health plans, the education plans and the basic infrastructure that is going to rescue the aspirations of millions of people who at this time have no hope for the future.</para><para>This is the challenge. It will not be politically popular in Australia. It is a challenge for the Labor Party and it is a challenge for us to make sure that this war against terror does not end when the final bullet is fired in Iraq. The war against terrorism is a war against poverty and the world must move and plan right now.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>13127</page.no><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name><name.id>83K</name.id><electorate>Gellibrand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is quite eerie to be speaking in this debate right on the deadline that the US has set—the 48-hour deadline for Saddam Hussein to get out of Iraq—to be in a country many thousands of kilometres away debating whether or not we should be participating in military action against Iraq and to be fearful that bombs could be falling as we speak. There is some sense of devastation already for those of us who are very unhappy with the decision that Australia is participating in this military action.</para></talk.start><para>I find it depressing to be standing here today. Like many other people in this House on both sides, I find it very upsetting and quite devastating. I, like many other members of the community, feel sick about what will happen to so many people in our community but also in Iraq as a result of this action being taken. In fact, it is hard really to even comprehend the cost and devastation that will be caused by this war and to see if there will really be any winners.</para><para>I fear for our soldiers—our service men and women—and for their anxious families. Labor do not agree with the government's decision to send our troops to war but we are proud of our troops. We are proud of you and the efforts that you will make on behalf of our country. We support you, although we do not support the government's decision. We know that you have no choice and will do your duty to the best of your abilities. We trust that our services have trained you well for that. We wish you a speedy and safe return and offer all of our support.</para><para>I fear also for the impact on our children and young people in Australia—the anxiety attacks and other behavioural problems—that will inevitably result from the extensive exposure they will have to the images of war in the media. In fact, Young Media Australia has already warned that primary school children are the most at risk, being old enough to understand some of the images that they are seeing and to fear what will happen to them. Young Media Australia urges, as do I, that parents and care givers take extra care at this time to reassure their children that they will be safe. Hugs, cuddles or any other type of reassurance, as well as keeping an eye out for signs of anxiety, are particularly important at this time.</para><para>I also fear for our children who are a little older than this because our decision to participate in this action is teaching our children and young people something which will cause great problems in the future. They will get the wrong message about the appropriate way to deal with conflict. We are not teaching our children that violence is the answer to any sort of conflict. I also fear for the Iraqi civilians, especially the women and children, who will inevitably be victims in this war. There are 13 million children in Iraq, and it is estimated that of those some 500,000 are already malnourished and that tens of thousands are likely to die either directly from the military action or from the chaos that will result in the weeks and months following the bombing of Iraq. We also know that the general effects of war are always horrific on women and children. The use of health care services during and after war shows the disproportionate effect on women. We see the economic impact of war treating women much more severely. We know that the militarisation of economies moves funding away from health and education budgets. In some recent conflicts, we have seen sexual crimes used as a deliberate strategy as part of war.</para><para>My major concern about Australia participating in this war is the human cost. It seems startling that, as we begin the 21st century with military conflicts such as this one, we have basically shown that we have learnt nothing from the tragedies of war in the 20th century. Not only do I personally share the fears of so many in our community about our nation going to war but also I feel the frustration of standing here in this parliament and not being able to stop what I believe is wrong for our country. It is a key concern for me that this decision will be very damaging to Australia's future as a small to middle sized power and as part of the Asian region. If we abandon our international forums and collective decision making, how will we ever resolve future disputes in this region? What message are we sending to our neighbours? Is it that, if you are big enough or strong enough, you can afford to ignore any of the rules? How can this be right, let alone help our long-term interests as a small to middling sized power? I believe that the international environment as a whole is affected by the approach that has been taken. </para><para>What power—moral or otherwise—will we have in the future when North Korea, Sudan, Burma, Syria or any other country decides to flout international law or UN decisions? I, as much as anyone, am disgusted at the brutality of Saddam Hussein and the way he has used his regime against his own people. Like the Kurds and Iraqis who have fled to Australia and who have settled in my electorate, I would like to see their homeland freed and a representative government in place. But is this the way for us to achieve it? And will it actually work? That is a question that no-one seems to be answering at the moment. There is something very unsettling and odd about our seeking to establish democracy in a country by taking military action that did not get the majority support of the UN Security Council. If this were really the concern—the welfare of the Iraqi people—why haven't we talked more about committing to the vital restructure and rebuilding of Iraq that will inevitably be needed after this action has taken place? If we believe our course of action is right, why aren't we talking about committing ourselves to the huge humanitarian effort that will be required and to taking more refugees into this country? The government has been silent on this and, despite the previous speaker, the member for North Sydney, talking very passionately about it, he has not been able to ensure that his government is making those commitments at this time, as it should be.</para><para>But I also want to ask: what about all the people who have fled to Australia, escaping the other brutal dictatorships of the world? For example, where is Burma on the US radar of concern to free the world from brutal dictatorships or despots? Furthermore, where is Burma on our government's radar? They may not be amassing military weapons of mass destruction, but their military regime is ensuring that the heroin that they grow and supply around the world is still killing thousands of young people every week—many of them in our country. Why is this abusive, repressive military regime not of more immediate concern to Australia? This is just one example that I have chosen. My electorate is full of people having fled violent, racist, repressive, brutal regimes, and not one of us here in this parliament wants to lend any support to any of those regimes. But I think it emphasises that we must have a policy that looks at our national and regional interests and is consistent on who we go after and why. It must be part of our long-term goals and interests—ours, not just America's. This is where I think the purpose of participating in this war and Australia's involvement in it unravels. Along with the general public, I am really at the point where I am uncomprehending of why we have made a decision at this stage to take this action, without the support of the United Nations.</para><para>We teach our young people all the time that they should respect the umpire's decision. Children across the country are being taught that, if there is a disagreement— whether in sport, in the schoolyard or anywhere—the umpire makes the final decision. When we talk about this conflict, the umpire is the United Nations. When it comes to sport, industrial relations or international relations, Labor believes in respecting the umpire, because the bottom line is that it is all that we have to give us consistency, some sense of respecting the rule of law and some sense of legitimacy. I am sad to be standing here today and saying that, when it comes to settling the current crisis, our Prime Minister, who is such a keen cricket enthusiast—in fact, I think he has described himself as a cricket tragic—and who admires these sportsmen who always abide by the umpire's decision, did not like the umpire's decision and decided to play his own game. He has made a bad call in doing this and set a bad example. I fear for this country that we will be much the worse for it in the long term.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>13129</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Forty-five minutes have passed since the deadline, and Saddam has chosen not to take the peace option. In the handful of hours before more than 30 countries join to enforce the internationally agreed conditions of the negotiated peace that followed the 1991 Gulf War, we condemn Saddam's regime for refusing over more than 12 years to abide by the 17 resolutions of the United Nations Security Council regarding the threat it poses to international peace and security. One of the greatest sins I can imagine is to give away a peace previously secured at great human and material cost. It is wrong to turn our backs on what has passed—the purpose and price of previous military engagement. We will remember.</para></talk.start><para>I often say that it is the duty of all of us in public life to honour and uphold the freedoms, peace and prosperity that our service personnel, along with our allies, have delivered to all Australians. Our military embodies the finest traditions of service, dedication and professionalism, and has done what has been asked of it by the civilian led governments of the day. The ADF personnel and the veterans before them are all heroes to me, and I add my heartfelt expression of unequivocal support for the Australian service men and women and other personnel serving with the international coalition. Our full confidence is in them, and we hope all will return safely to their homes. In this context I want to make my remarks today about the government's deployment of ADF elements in the region to the international coalition of military forces prepared to enforce Iraq's compliance with its international obligations under successive resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, with a view to restoring international peace and security in the Middle East region.</para><para>Opponents of the government's decision, a number of whom have contacted me to convey their views, seek to characterise this action as a unilateral and unjustified attack on Iraq—something new; free of context; a debate that starts with a fresh slate. I have listened carefully to these views—and I have at least tried to listen when they are delivered as interjections at peace rallies—and have considered them against my own thinking. In fact, I have thought very deeply about this issue and have canvassed new aspects of how this debate should proceed, such as challenges of succession in Iraq, diplomatic momentum and inertia, and the parallels with the domestic guns buyback reforms and the liberation of East Timor.</para><para>Like many of my colleagues, I am subjected to claims that I am merely parroting government propaganda and personal attacks about lacking courage and guts. Let me assure all concerned that I have mixed feelings about the course of action we are debating here today and have arrived at an on balance view after careful assessment of information, convictions and arguments that all form part of the debate. It has hardly been a journey to exercise machismo. I have asked myself the following three central questions in forming this view on Iraq and weapons of mass destruction. Does Iraq possess weapons of mass destruction? Do these weapons represent a threat to Australia's interests? If so, should we do anything about it?</para><para>When Iraq was repelled from Kuwait, military action was ended on the condition that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capability be disarmed. When UN weapons inspectors were forced out in 1998, many questions remained unanswered about Iraq's arsenal. Saddam's son-in-law subsequently revealed the extent of Iraq's anthrax program and was killed for telling the truth. Saddam has used these weapons before—even in humanitarian atrocities on his own people, which many before me have described. He has displayed a contempt for human life such that innocent people are frequently used as the disposable tools of his totalitarian regime. His regime has invaded two neighbouring countries and bombed five.</para><para>As 17 UN Security Council resolutions testify, the existence of these weapons in the hands of a regime with form of this kind in using them threatens global security and the peaceful existence of countless millions of people. The rise in terrorist activity, including senseless attacks on innocent people, adds to the urgency to remove the threat of these weapons and disarm Iraq, as has been insisted on by the UN for more than a decade. As recognised by Hans Blix, military build-up and the credible threat of armed intervention were the only things that achieved a change in Saddam's behaviour and secured the re-entry of weapons inspectors.</para><para>I want to thank the governments and taxpayers of the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Australia as the only ones prepared to amass the will, resources and diplomatic momentum to genuinely give peaceful resolution a chance. This coalition put the lead in the diplomatic pencil. While others demanded the right to pontificate and parade around claiming virtue for the limited progress this achieved while contributing precisely nothing to its momentum, they were in fact actively blunting the diplomatic pencil by their actions and statements. I particularly want to pay my respects to the five US service personnel killed in the Black Hawk helicopter accident on 25 February, when their helicopter crashed in a sandstorm during night-time training exercises in Kuwait. Believe me, they have paid a price for the military build-up that has delivered the diplomatic option so many others wish to talk about and build upon.</para><para>The `let's have more diplomacy' advocates who are critical of the military build-up ignore the reality that it has only been the military build-up that has produced diplomatic possibilities. To still claim that diplomacy alone will achieve the disarmament of Iraq is to let blind hope triumph over more than a decade of experience. Many people have talked about condemning one, condemning another and condemning governments. They have talked about shame and about who should have the finger pointed at them over this difficult time. The biggest sin we can commit is to ignore the work and sacrifice of those who have come before us. In 1991 thousands of troops paid a price for disarming Iraq and repelling them out of Kuwait. Humanitarian atrocities have been talked about in here. They were added to by that military conflict. The biggest crime is that we need to revisit those things.</para><para>Those who should be condemned are those who have allowed us to let go of the peace and the opportunity for stability that the 1991 intervention delivered to us. We have given that away. That is a crime that the international community, including us, should stand condemned for. There was that effort, that sacrifice and that loss of life to secure the repelling of Iraq out of Kuwait and to provide the foundations for the disarmament of this horrendous regime. We have given that away. That is where the condemnation should lie. I wish to return to where I began: it is a great sin to not uphold the work and the achievements of the military personnel who have gone before us. The ADF personnel who were part of the coalition in 1991 did their duty and got so close to the outcome, but the world community dropped the ball on them. They had achieved the repulsion of Iraq out of Kuwait. They had secured a peace plan to see Saddam disarmed of his weapons of mass destruction capability, and we stand condemned for not enforcing it at that time.</para><para>This is not a fresh action; this is the enforcement of a peace agreement—an agreement won at great cost to life, to infrastructure and to opportunities, an agreement won at great expense. And we have given it away. We all stand condemned for that. We are debating a motion today about whether to enforce a peace that so many had fought so hard to secure and that we simply did not conclude. It is not a new action. It is not an attack. It is enforcement of a peace plan.</para><para>I listen to people condemning the government for not doing anything about humanitarian atrocities in Iraq. The case has been laid out particularly well by those before me—far more eloquently than I have done. But let us not forget why we are here: we dropped the ball. We paid the price to secure a peace and a plan that would ensure ongoing peace in the Middle East and we did not see it through. We all stand condemned for that. I support the government's measures to enforce the peace that those before us had secured. Somehow, we looked the other way and lost what they had worked so hard to deliver to us. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>13131</page.no><name role="metadata">Sercombe, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SERCOMBE</name><name.id>QK6</name.id><electorate>Maribyrnong</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Douglas Hurd was Britain's Foreign Secretary during the 1991 Gulf War. If Douglas Hurd were a member of the Australian parliament instead of the British parliament, he would be a pretty unusual character, because he is actually an intelligent, thoughtful Tory—an intelligent, thoughtful conservative. In the February edition of the Royal United Services Institute for Defence Studies journal, he produced an article entitled `Between peace and war'. In that article he poses two questions. His first question relates to security in the Middle East:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Would it be a safer and better place—</para></quote><para>that is, the Middle East—</para><quote><para>after a successful attack to overthrow Saddam Hussein?</para></quote><para>His second question relates to security in the Western world and asks, `What is the effect of the attack on our own safety?' Towards the end of his article, Douglas Hurd indicates that he is somewhat pessimistic in terms of the answers to those two questions. In relation to the question about the Middle East being a safer and better place, he says:</para><quote><para>A genuinely democratic Iraq might well act as a fresh spur.</para></quote><para>He is talking about a democratic Iraq in the context of it perhaps being an important initiator of that process elsewhere in the Middle East. He goes on:</para><quote><para>But everything would depend on the circumstances. At one end of the range of possibilities a new Iraqi government installed by British and American military force and sustained by our occupying troops for months or years after a war in which many Iraqis were killed, could have the opposite effect. The reaction against what would appear as imperialism rather than liberation could be destructive. We might win the war in six days, and then lose it in six months.</para></quote><para>I think those words are quite instructive—`We might win the war in six days and then lose it in six months.' As I said, Douglas Hurd does indicate that he is somewhat pessimistic in the answers he expects to emerge from his questions. In relation to his question about the effect on the security of the West, he says:</para><quote><para>It was essentially for self-defence that we went to war in Afghanistan ... We freed the Afghan people from the Taliban, but after Bali, Mombasa and the alarms which sound around us every day, who can say that he or she feels safer now than before the Afghan campaign? We kicked the hornets' nest to pieces, and the hornets buzz more angrily around us. It seems certain that we are now faced with a ruthless long-lasting struggle against growing numbers of Muslim fundamentalists and extreme nationalists through Asia and North Africa who do not hesitate to use violence against the West.</para></quote><para>He goes on in his article:</para><quote><para>Do we help or hinder this essential struggle against terrorism by attacking Iraq? Do we increase or diminish the numbers and determination of those enemies? Would we thus turn the Middle East into a set of friendly democratic capitalist societies ready to make peace with Israel, or into a region of sullen humiliation, a fertile and almost inexhaustible recruiting ground for further terrorists for whom Britain is a main target?</para></quote><para>One might add `and for whom Australia is a main target'. As I said, an intelligent, thoughtful Conservative, Douglas Hurd, the former British Foreign Secretary, indicates that his responses to those questions are pessimistic.</para><para>I want to pose a third question: how does this course of action relate to Australian security more directly and to the priority that Australia needs to place on security issues? On previous occasions in this parliament, I have spoken particularly about Indonesia. I notice that as recently as yesterday the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> had an article entitled `US attack may ignite Indonesian anger'. The article says:</para><quote><para>Muslim leaders in Indonesia reacted angrily yesterday to US President George Bush's ultimatum on Iraq, repeating their strong warning that a unilateral attack could spark violence by Islamic radicals in Indonesia.</para></quote><para>The story goes on:</para><quote><para>Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim nation, is strongly opposed to an attack on Iraq without the backing of the UN.</para></quote><para>I would simply add in this context that there are very few countries more fundamental to Australia's security than Indonesia, and that any serious consideration of Australia's security needs to take account of their views. We need to take account not only of the Muslim world in our own region but of the heavy commitment that Australia is making to the Middle East when, I would strongly argue, we have much more pressing priorities somewhat closer to home.</para><para>Earlier this month, the Centre for Independent Studies produced an <inline font-style="italic">Issues Analysis </inline>paper called `Papua New Guinea on the brink', written by Mike Manning and Susan Windybank. This analysis has been quite controversial in Papua New Guinea, but as a member of an Australian parliamentary delegation to PNG last year I would say that some of the points that are made in the paper really resonate. The paper commences:</para><quote><para>Papua New Guinea (PNG) shows every sign of following its Melanesian neighbour, the Solomon Islands, down the path to economic paralysis, government collapse and social despair.</para></quote><para>The paper discusses secessionist movements, particularly those in resource rich parts of Papua New Guinea, such as Bougainville, and says:</para><quote><para>The government appears to have lost control of parts of the oil-rich Southern Highlands, which are contested by strong men and criminals.</para></quote><para>It goes on:</para><quote><para>History has demonstrated that the security of PNG and Australia are inextricably linked. The 60th anniversary of the Kokoda Trail battles last year commemorating the defeat of Japanese invasion forces in PNG ... is a reminder that its territorial integrity is directly related to the defence of continental Australia.</para></quote><para>The large amounts of aid that successive Australian governments have poured into PNG are evidence of that. The article goes on:</para><quote><para>It is not necessary, however, for a state to threaten Australia militarily (as in 1942) to cause serious security problems. Should PNG's downward spiral continue so that it unarguably becomes a `failed state', it could attract transnational criminals, people smugglers, drug and arms traffickers—and terrorists. PNG can neither effectively monitor its land and sea borders nor control parts of its territory, making it relatively easy for such groups to slip in undetected and use the country as a base for operations or point of entry into Australia.</para></quote><para>The article talks about PNG's `porous land border' with the Indonesian province of West Papua in that context and says:</para><quote><para>The risk that Islamist terrorists may use PNG as a haven cannot be dismissed in light of last year's Bali bombing. PNG's strategic backwater status and institutional instability could provide new opportunities to exploit the weakest link. Terrorists could pay PNG's criminal gangs to assist them with preparations for attacks on Australian soil or against Australian civilians and assets ...</para></quote><para>Further on, it continues:</para><quote><para>The ability of Australian authorities and their PNG counterparts to work together effectively on these issues is limited while the central government is unstable and weak, and security forces are rundown and demoralised. Australia has spent over a half a billion dollars since independence on assistance to the PNGDF ... while an AusAID project to strengthen the police force has been running for over a decade. Yet these key state institutions remain under-resourced, poorly equipped and ill-disciplined.</para><para>Until recently, there had not been any PNGDF patrols of its land border with the Indonesian province of West Papua in a decade because of resource shortages.</para></quote><para>The research piece also talks about the risk being high of PNG descending into anarchy. Those are indeed alarming views, but they are put forward by people who are specialists in Papua New Guinea. Mike Manning is an Australian who is now a PNG citizen and is well known, I am sure, to many members of this House. He is a man with impeccable credentials for speaking about PNG. So these are not ill-considered views; they are very serious views—and they are views that are reflected in our discussion about other parts of our immediate region.</para><para>For our government to be giving the overwhelming strategic priority it is presently to issues a considerable distance from our shores, when there are extraordinarily important areas within our own backyard that we need to be attending to, strikes me as being extraordinarily negligent. This commitment of forces to Iraq and the unilateral action—or the trilateral action—that appears to be unfolding in Iraq have very serious and damaging long-term consequences for Australia, for the reasons that Douglas Hurd gave in the British context. In the Australian context in particular, this action very directly results in attention being drawn from much more fundamentally important issues that go to the heart of Australia's security. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>13133</page.no><name role="metadata">Ticehurst, Kenneth, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TICEHURST</name><name.id>00ANF</name.id><electorate>Dobell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to support the Prime Minister's motion on Iraq. I believe this action is in Australia's best interests and will give the Iraqi people a chance to live peacefully, free from the brutality and lunacy of a tyrant. We can no longer allow Iraq to maintain and build weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein has used these weapons on his neighbours and on his own people. He promotes terrorism, he harbours terrorists and he trains Iraqi children to become terrorists. After 12 years and 17 UN resolutions, diplomatic efforts to free Saddam Hussein of his weapons of mass destruction without a fight have come to an end. We now realise that force is the only way he will be brought to account.</para></talk.start><para>The response from my constituents has been very supportive, for the most part. The display of emotion by Dobell community members—their tears and kind words for the brave Australian troops, their concern for innocent Iraqi civilians and their deep-rooted respect for John Howard for making a wise and most difficult decision—has been heart wrenching. Dobell's large veteran population also understands and respects the necessity of the coalition's stance. I salute our Australian Defence Force personnel and wish them a speedy and safe engagement. Last August I had the privilege of working with the RAAF Air Lift Group at Richmond. I was able to see their dedication and the professional way that training and other activities were carried out. They will no doubt carry out their duties with distinction, just as older Australians did in earlier conflicts. I look forward to welcoming them all home, safe and sound.</para><para>Australians have never shirked their duty and their sense of responsibility when it comes to international events that may well have had a profound effect on our nation. Iraq is no different a case. The world changed forever on September 11, 2001. Terrorism knows no bounds. Are we to take no action—sit on the fence—and wait for yet another UN resolution in the full knowledge that its 18th resolution on Iraq will be vetoed? Unfortunately, Labor have taken the soft option. They believe the noisy minority and subsequent polls.</para><para>Perhaps this matter could have been resolved peacefully if every country had supported a new resolution demanding that Iraq disarm immediately or face the consequences. Saddam Hussein saw that the world was diplomatically divided. He knew that there was little resolve behind another UN resolution and he was therefore smug that no action would be taken to disarm him. The opposition has persistently and blatantly argued for a UN resolution, but the UN lost its force and credibility the moment the French declared that they would veto any resolution that called for the removal of Saddam Hussein's weapons by force.</para><para>In this parliament, the member for Indi spoke of France's self-interest and greed behind its peacekeeping stance. This also applies to Germany and Russia, who in their defiance of any resolution to disarm Iraq with force have, ironically enough, ruined any chance for a peaceful outcome. In fact, the prime concern of France, Germany and Russia is neither for the innocent Iraqi civilians nor that a war will promote further terrorism. Their stance has everything to do with their domestic and international self-interests.</para><para>Germany's Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, won his election narrowly last year due to his anti-war stance on Iraq. He has since stated, in a February speech to the German parliament, that this was the mandate on which he was re-elected and has described his main international orientation as being to prevent wars. For the first time since the Second World War, Germany has formally announced a policy based on openly opposing the United States and seeking to thwart it by building alliances with other states. Mr Schroeder has clearly indicated that Germany's future lies in cooperating with France and the European Union, rather than the United States. In a recent BBC news article, Schroeder said unity with France was indispensable.</para><para>Both countries are key members of the European Union and they would most likely wish to see the EU develop as a counterbalance to the unipolar US. Yet Germany, like France, supports the war against terrorism. There are 900 German peacekeepers and 92 special forces personnel operating alongside US and UK troops hunting for al-Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan. Germany and the Netherlands were in command of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan in February to maintain the security of Kabul.</para><para>Of 82 million Germans, 3.4 per cent are Muslim, though these are mostly Turkish who are generally less supportive of Islamic radicals. While Germany may have considered the potential for increased terrorist acts within Germany in its decision not to support unilateral action against Iraq, this is in no way the driving force behind their standpoint. German companies have been important suppliers of arms to Iraq since the mid-1970s. This included a deal to build a supergun, for which some German businessmen have been charged. According to a German newspaper, in Iraq's weapons report to the UN, over 80 German companies are listed as dealing with Iraq as late as 2001.</para><para>Russia's opposition to war in Iraq is more ambivalent than France and Germany's. Its economy is dependent on oil exports for 40 per cent of its revenue. The cost of producing Russian oil is high and any fall in price below $US25—currently it is $US32—per barrel would affect its economy adversely. In contrast, Iraqi oil is very cheap to produce and Russia fears that any massive increase in the production of Iraqi oil, post Saddam Hussein, would depress oil prices. Russia has been protecting itself in the case of a regime change in Iraq by having discreet talks with the exiled Iraqi opposition regarding future oil contracts. To show his displeasure, Saddam Hussein has suspended the contracts of one of the largest Russian oil companies, Lukoil, to develop its West Kurna oilfield.</para><para>Russia is a major buyer of Iraqi oil under the UN oil for food program. Russia is therefore under pressure to assume an anti-war stance on Iraq in return for preferential treatment by the current Iraqi government. Russia is also indebted to Iraq for its support of Russia's campaign in Chechnya and its urging of Muslims within the Russian Federation to not hinder or obstruct Russian activities in any way. Furthermore, Iraq owes $US8 billion to Russia inherited from the Soviet Union days. A US led war against Iraq would dwindle Russia's chances of ever being repaid.</para><para>Russia's foreign minister and the German government have cited the threat of increased terrorism as the reason for their stance on Iraq. Australia's opposition leader has also argued that our involvement in this war will generate and encourage terrorism and, as a result, Labor argues that Australia will become more of a target. Would it be safer for Australia to sit on the sidelines while the rest of the world goes and fights for an international cause? Is that the Australian way? I think not.</para><para>Terrorism has already occurred on Australia's doorstep. If we do not stop Saddam Hussein from maintaining and using his weapons of mass destruction, these mass weapons will spread among other rogue states and the future of Australia and the rest of the world will be in jeopardy. Our Prime Minister understands that scenario only too well. John Howard has thought long and hard about all the ramifications of the government's decision. He is a man who will make the right decision for the national interest irrespective of popularity. My wish for the people of Iraq is for them to have what we Australians have: freedom, democracy and the right to live in peace.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>13135</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to pick up on some of the disgraceful comments made by the member for Dobell before getting to the substance of my speech. He says in this place that Labor has taken the soft option. What a cheek to say that Labor has taken the soft option when we have been advocating that we in Australia take a position which is in Australia's national interest. If you want to talk about soft options, how soft an option was it when your Prime Minister did not do the hard thing on behalf of the men and women of Australia who would have to go and serve and on behalf of the people of this nation when he got the telephone call and say no but did something that was in the interests of the United States of America. You want to talk about taking the soft option: the Prime Minister of this country stopped acting in Australia's national interest and has been acting in the interests of a foreign country. If you want to talk about soft options, talk about that.</para></talk.start><para>What has been missing in this debate is any discussion at all about acting in Australia's national interest. It seems to me that the Liberal and National parties cannot understand and have no comprehension of the fact that Australia's national interest could be different from America's national interest. It is amazing that all of these people on the other side in the Liberal and National parties make out they are educated and can understand a few things, yet none of them can grasp this essential difference. We have a Prime Minister who promised us the world, that he would be a hard man for Australia and stand up for Australia's national interest.</para><para>I remember very well the advertisements before the 2001 election campaign where we saw the Prime Minister of Australia bang the podium and say, `We will decide. We will make the decision in relation to asylum seekers.' He was prepared to prove that he was pretty tough when he was dealing with a few rickety boats bringing people in need to Australian shores. He was going to be a big, strong man; he was going to be the person who acted in Australia's national interests. That is what he promised us. He said, `We will decide.' Now here we are in a situation where, more than ever, we need an Australian Prime Minister who will decide what is right based on what is in Australia's national interests, not based on what is decided anywhere else.</para><para>The Prime Minister has proved that he is not a strong, tough man at all. He is not someone who can take tough decisions. He just goes along with what other people decide. He is so besotted with the American President that whatever George W. Bush asks of him he will do—whatever the price, whatever the cost. What he is interested in is his relationship with George W. Bush. He wants to be George W. Bush's favourite. The price that we pay for his obsession with being George W. Bush's favourite is the damage to our reputation in our region and the risk to the lives of 2,000 Australian personnel who are now deployed as a part of this operation—not to mention the increased risk to Australia's security, which is a logical consequence of Australia's involvement in this very small coalition which is about to invade Iraq.</para><para>I heard the member for Dobell say earlier that the opposition have been going around saying that there will be an increased risk of terrorism in Australia. He was making the political point that this was something that only we were saying. I think he has to better acquaint himself with this issue, because a statement was made yesterday by the Director of Homeland Security in the United States that the US and its allies—which includes Australia—would be at greater risk of terrorism as a result of participating in this small coalition of countries that is about to invade Iraq. I say to the member for Dobell: please inform yourself better in relation to this debate, because that statement was made not by the opposition but by the Director of Homeland Security in the United States administration and was repeated in this House yesterday by no less a figure in the government than the Leader of the House and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Tony Abbott. So it is not just the Labor Party saying these things; these are well-accepted realities that will be a consequence of Australia's involvement in this military effort in Iraq.</para><para>As a proud Australian, as someone who believes in Australia and who understands what this country is capable of, I want to say how disappointed I am to see a Prime Minister who does not share that vision. The Prime Minister does not believe in Australia; he does not believe that we are good enough to make our own way in the world or that we are big enough, strong enough and smart enough to decide things for ourselves. He believes that all we have to contribute is to just go along with the United States. Recently, I said that Bob Menzies had a view of Australia as being just a colony. He used to go to London to get his riding instructions. He was besotted by the British royal family; he had a drooling obsession with them. He used to get his instructions from London, the centre of the empire, and that is how he viewed Australia. Decades on, we have a Prime Minister who still has the same view. The empire might have changed but it is still the same idea: Australia is just an appendage, not a country that can make up its own mind about international affairs or choose its own future and confidently pursue its own national interests. We now have a Prime Minister who only views Australia as being a country which says yes every time to great foreign interests. That is not the vision I have for the future of Australia. That is not the hope that Australians have for what this nation should be. How embarrassing and humiliating for Australia that a decision was made to go to war—Australia included—yet Australia did not participate in that decision.</para><para>An important meeting took place in the Azores between the United States President, the British Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Spain—it was chaired by the Prime Minister of Portugal—where a decision was made to go to war and essentially to deploy Australian troops. And where was our Prime Minister? He was not there. He did not make the decision. We now have a situation where they are running Australia's foreign policy and our defence priorities by remote control. They make a telephone call and our Prime Minister says: `When do you want them? Where do you want them? We'll do whatever you want.' These are not the actions of a Prime Minister who is acting in Australia's national interests. </para><para>I want our Prime Minister to be a proud Australian. I want our Prime Minister to stand up for Australia's national interests. I want our Prime Minister to be a strong man—strong enough to stand up for Australia's national interests—not a weak man who just says yes and does whatever other great nations decide would be in Australia's national interests. I want a Prime Minister who can stand up and articulate what Australia's national interests should be. I want a Prime Minister who can confidently pursue Australia's own national interests and develop our own foreign policy agenda that is based on our national interests. We have seen from the Australian Prime Minister disgraceful, weak behaviour at a time when we needed him to be strong on behalf of the Australian nation and strong on behalf of the 2,000 men and women who have been deployed to serve in this conflict. He has taken the weak option and has not acted in Australia's national interests.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>13137</page.no><name role="metadata">Hawker, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAWKER</name><name.id>8H4</name.id><electorate>Wannon</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I listened with some curiosity to the member for McMillan. All you could really say about his little contribution is that it contained some tedious repetition, crossed with a liberal dose of what George Orwell labelled `newspeak'—there really was no substance there. It was a bit disappointing. I would like to support the eight-point motion moved by the Prime Minister on Tuesday. As the Prime Minister pointed out, this is a very difficult decision he has taken, which is supported by the government. It is a difficult decision for Australians and it is a difficult decision for our service men and women who are in the Gulf.</para></talk.start><para>I believe it was the correct decision, and a number of reasons have been extensively elaborated by the Prime Minister and other government members on why we should be involved. There are many reasons why we should proceed with this course of action. The Iraqi regime has had 12 years to comply with the cease-fire agreement of 1991. Since that cease-fire, it has continued to refuse to get rid of its weapons of mass destruction and we have had 17 resolutions of the United Nations to try to get it to comply. Over 30 official letters have been sent by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, trying to get some sense out of Saddam Hussein. During all that time he has thumbed his nose at the UN and at world opinion, and he continues to ignore those requests that he agreed to in 1991.</para><para>The question we should all be asking is why Saddam continues to manufacture these weapons of mass destruction. These chemical and biological weapons have horrific consequences; we saw that when he used them. I think the reason we should move now was made quite clearly and eloquently by the British Prime Minister when he said that we have Saddam Hussein on one path, making his weapons of mass destruction, and terrorists on a parallel path, and that it is only a matter of time before the two get together. The consequences are quite terrifying. Clearly, if we sit back and do nothing, as the world did in the 1930s—and if I have time I will come back to that—the consequences will be quite terrifying.</para><para>I think it is important to note that Australians have seen the tragedy of Bali and know that this terrorism is not something that happens just in New York, or something that happens only to Germans in North Africa—as has been pointed out—or to the French in some other places. It something that is happening right on our doorstep. If anyone is in any doubt about that fact, at least one terrorist organisation—and remember that there are several that we know of—al-Qaeda, has made it clear that since East Timor we are already on the list. So any suggestion that our involvement now in this action will change that is just spurious.</para><para>The next point I would like to make relates to the suggestion that not many countries are involved. It is quite clear that speakers who have said that have not really done their homework. As pointed out by Mr Richard Boucher, a spokesman from the US Department of State, 30 countries have agreed to be part of the coalition for the immediate disarmament of Iraq. Amongst those countries are quite a few from Europe and some from the Middle East and from Asia; there are some from our region—for example, the Philippines, Korea and Japan. As pointed out by Mr Boucher, in addition to these 30 countries there are another 15 or so, probably more, that are cooperating with the coalition. So, in fact, a sizeable number of countries in this world share a view about what needs to be done. They certainly support this difficult decision that has been taken, a decision I believe is the correct one.</para><para>It has also been pointed out quite clearly that earlier United Nations resolutions authorise this action. The Prime Minister in his speech, and indeed in the motion, made that quite clear when he listed resolutions 678, 687 and 1441 as a clear authorisation by the United Nations for this action. It is also interesting to look at the argument mounted against this action by members of the opposition. I noted with interest an article by Paul Kelly in yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>. He said in part:</para><quote><para>The Labor position has a distinctly French look. ... Australian forces should be returned from their Gulf deployment. But the 225,000 US forces threatening Iraq must remain in place to encourage Saddam Hussein to co-operate with the weapons inspectors. The objective remains the disarmament of Iraq's WMD capacity. Crean, like Chirac, insists this can be achieved by peaceful means but, like Chirac, he won't accept any responsibility for its enforcement.</para></quote><para>As Paul Kelly says:</para><quote><para>This is a popular but bankrupt stance.</para></quote><para>It is also interesting to go back a bit and have a look at the transcript of a BBC program broadcast at the beginning of February which was presented by Alistair Cooke, whom I think most people would know of. He is a rather wise person. In this particular letter he made some very chilling points. He said:</para><quote><para>... throughout the past fortnight I've listened to everybody involved in or looking on to a monotonous din of words, like a tide crashing and receding on a beach—making a great noise and saying the same thing over and over.</para><para>And this ordeal triggered a nightmare—a day-mare, if you like.</para><para>Through the ceaseless tide I heard a voice, a very English voice of an old man—Prime Minister Chamberlain saying: “I believe it is peace for our time” — ...</para></quote><para>A sentence the context of which I am sure all honourable members will recall. He went on to point out:</para><quote><para>... a sentence that prompted a huge cheer, first from a listening street crowd and then from the House of Commons and next day from every newspaper in the land. There was a move to urge that Mr Chamberlain should receive the Nobel Peace Prize.</para></quote><para>We all recall what happened after that. Alistair Cooke went on to say:</para><quote><para>I bring up Munich—</para></quote><para>he then goes into quite a lot of detail about what happened—</para><quote><para>and the mid-1930s, because I was fully grown, on the verge of 30, and knew we were indeed living in the age of anxiety.</para><para>And so many of the arguments mounted against each other today, in the last fortnight, are exactly what we heard in the House of Commons debates and read in the French press.</para><para>The French especially urged, after every Hitler invasion, “negotiation, negotiation”.</para><para>They negotiated so successfully as to have their whole country defeated and occupied.</para></quote><para>He goes on:</para><quote><para>In Britain, the general response to every Hitler advance was disarmament and collective security.</para><para>Collective security meant to leave every crisis to the League of Nations. It would put down aggressors, even though, like the United Nations, it had no army, navy or air force.</para></quote><para>Those are very chilling words. It is a warning, if ever there were one, that it is a question not of just being popular but of taking responsible action at a time when you can take it, before it is too late and before, inevitably, weapons of mass destruction get into the hands of terrorists and appear anywhere in the world—heaven forbid, even in Australia. That is why the Prime Minister is to be congratulated on his courageous decision. His decision is fully supported by the government and, interestingly, it is now quite strongly supported by the general public in Australia.</para><para>A couple of straw polls have been in the wind in the last couple of days. In the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> today, the following question was put: Now Australian troops are committed, are you in favour of war in Iraq? `Yes', said 75.4 per cent.

Those who put forward the suggestion that we are trying to undermine the alliance because we have a mature disagreement with an alliance partner are playing very loosely with the truth. One questions their motivations in doing so. Labor are very strong supporters of the alliance, but that does not mean that we cannot have mature disagreements with an alliance partner, as we have done in the past and may well do in the future. That does not mean that we wish to threaten the alliance with some disagreements about our alliance partner's strategies. We believe that it is wrong.</para><para>What is particularly galling about this set of circumstances is that we on this side believe that the Prime Minister made a commitment to the United States when it was divided and wracked by internal conflict about the course of action it would take. There was a great battle between the hardliners—the neoconservatives and the Richard Armitages—versus the internationalists such as Colin Powell on the course of action they should take. We believe that, at the time that this debate was raging within the American administration, the Prime Minister of our country made a unilateral commitment to the Americans to deploy troops. He then sought to deceive the Australian public after that commitment had been made, after manoeuvres of the <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline> had occurred and after our troops had been trained.</para><para>We believe that the Prime Minister was not honest with the country and that the decision to deploy the troops was made some time ago without consultation with the Australian people. That decision was made at some period of time between July and October last year. The problem is that the consequences of this action have not been explained to the Australian people. When looking for the consequences of these actions, I read an excellent paper presented by the Parliamentary Library, called <inline font-style="italic">Iraq: issues on the eve of the war</inline>. I would like to touch on the executive summary of the paper. It says:</para><quote><para>The impending war against Iraq will have unpredictable consequences.</para><para>Internally these include the humanitarian crisis and post-conflict security situation.</para><para>The US plan is for full control under military command with minimal involvement of exiled groups but using the (vetted) existing regime network without the key elements of Saddam's regime.</para><para>There is widespread criticism that the plan does not deal with the key issues of political reconstruction and appears to represent a retreat from US declared aims of democratising Iraq.</para><para>A war may result in regional instability if Iraq fragments and creates problems for individual Arab states linked to the United States.</para><para>Achieving regime change in Iraq is part of a wider US Bush doctrine to change the nature and dynamics of the Middle East (and the world). This is feared by the individual Arab states, though there have been some positive results in terms of superficial reforms.</para><para>A war against Iraq would, more likely than not, be seen as an anti-Islamic attack by the US and may win more recruits and empathy for Islamic extremism.</para></quote><para>I would just like to touch on the parliamentary research paper that talks about some of the debates that have occurred within the administration and what the outcomes or regional objectives of this conflict are. It says:</para><quote><para>The stated objectives of regime change in Iraq and the disarmament of its WMD, do not include what some observers and Bush officials see as an historic opportunity for the US to determine the nature and dynamics of the Middle East (and beyond) by promoting democratisation and modernisation and, as a consequence, undermining Islamic extremism.</para><para>...				...				...</para><para>Current US thinking on Iraq was initiated by Paul Wolfowitz now Deputy Defense Secretary and by Douglas Feith and other now senior officials who have advocated the fall of Saddam since the early 1990s. These views were later taken up by Vice President Dick Cheney who now leads the group known as the Neo-conservatives. Others who share the same views include Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Richard Perle, Chairman of the Defense Policy Board. They argue that a democratic regime in Iraq will have positive effects in the region.</para></quote><para>These effects are:</para><quote><para>It would discourage other states, i.e. Syria and Iran, from supporting `terrorists', i.e. groups operating in Lebanon against Israel.</para><para>These developments in turn would exert pressure on the Palestinian Authority, stripped of its regional supporters, to renounce terrorism and negotiate a peaceful outcome with the Israelis.</para><para>With the US no longer relying on Saudi Arabia for its oil and bases, Saudi influence would decline, and it may be dissuaded from funding Islamic charities linked to terrorist groups such as Hamas which operates in Israel, and Al Qaeda.</para><para>It would encourage citizens in the region to press for reforms, after a successful, prosperous and democratic Iraq is established, and though unstated, may result in other regime change in Arab states.</para></quote><para>The research paper further says:</para><quote><para>While regional objectives and pressures may be said to have produced some positive reactions ... this overarching policy presented as a causal relationship, belies the complex and unpredictable nature of events in a volatile region. As Robert Higgs of the US Independent Institute notes, `the sheer preposterousness of this expectation suggests that it is fuelled by more of a quasi-religious zealotry than by logic and evidence'. Lord Douglas Hurd, former British Conservative Foreign Secretary, posed two critical questions in relation to war on Iraq and central to the US and British dilemma:</para><para>Do we help or hinder the essential struggle against terrorism by attacking Iraq? Would we thus turn the Middle East into a set of friendly democratic capitalist societies, ready to make peace with Israel, or into a region of sullen humiliation, a fertile and almost inexhaustible recruiting ground for further terrorists for whom Britain is a main target?</para><para>It needs to be noted that most of the `terrorist' groups, both secular and religious, in the region are aimed at Israel while others, based on Islam, are against their own governments, some of which though brutal and oppressive, are supported by the US.</para><para>More important—</para></quote><para>in terms of this argument against al-Qaeda and its linkage—</para><quote><para>is the fact that Al Qaeda, though weakened, does not rely on state sponsorship and has operated through small semi-independent and like-minded groups. Al Qaeda opposes Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq. The Arab states likewise have no love for Al Qaeda or Islamic extremism, which threaten their regimes. Many of them including Egypt, Algeria and Syria have in fact acted violently against Islamic extremist groups and parties. Seen in this light, a US war against Iraq would not undermine Islamic extremism, which has resulted among other things, in the September 11 attack.</para></quote><para>That leads to the key of some of our concerns: that this action was not an action that was lightly or unilaterally taken by the United States within its higher echelons; it was seized with a great debate. In fact, the resolution put forward—which is 1441—was seen by some as a compromise by the hardliners to the softliners. The parliamentary research paper from which I have quoted indicates that, when resolution 1441 was put forward to the United Nations on 8 November 2002, United States people told key members that it would not provide an automatic trigger for military action. In fact, they intimated that further evidence would be provided to back up a further resolution. That resolution has not occurred.</para><para>In consequence, the actions taken and the unilateral commitment that has been made by the Howard government does imperil us in this region. That has not been appropriately acknowledged here or in many of the debates, particularly by those on the opposite side. This is a situation that will cause great change in our region. It is a situation that has not been thought through thoroughly by the Howard government and, as I said, it will have dire consequences for those in the region for years to come.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>13141</page.no><name role="metadata">Moylan, Judi, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MOYLAN</name><name.id>4V5</name.id><electorate>Pearce</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have made no secret of my preferences in this tragic time. I am a passionate devotee of peace. Many of us fervently hope for as much effort to be made for peace as is made for war. My preferred course would have been to contain Iraq and to work through the United Nations to secure its disarmament. Like everyone in this House, I have wished and prayed for a way to resolve this matter without bloodshed. There is no picturesque speech that can mitigate the horror of warfare and its consequences. The ideal would have been for the `great assassin' to realise his time is up and to accept exile, rather than choose to further the suffering and misery of his people. He appears unmoved by their plight and unwilling to make any concessions to ensure a peaceful outcome. In the case of such an adversary, I cannot endorse the prevarications of the opposition. To demonstrate weakness, forbearance and patience to a fiend of this calibre is not to invite peace. He demonstrates to the world every day that this merely titillates his sense of the macabre and steadies his resolve. The key element of a rapid move toward the war option has been triggered by the frustration of working within the framework of the United Nations Security Council, where the majority view seems to be to appease him.</para></talk.start><para>Some countries have not played a constructive role to resolve this impasse over Iraq. There has been a common tendency to impugn the undeniable commitment to peace that the United States, Britain and Australia have shown over the past centuries. No-one can deny imperfections where superpowers are concerned, but I urge the House to acknowledge Australia and its allies as a potent force for peace. In the longer term, if we are going to tackle terrorism and maintain peace, we will have to go deeper for the answers. Crippling debt and poverty mean that the desperate and dispossessed are easy targets for those intent on causing division and conflict between people and countries. A commitment by us to work to eradicate poverty therefore becomes vital in ridding the world of the threat of terrorist acts. Equally vital should be our commitment to instigating measures for the rehabilitation of Iraq, even as the conflict begins. Our concern must now be for humanitarian aid and the rebuilding of one of the world's most ancient and respected cultures.</para><para>To that end, I ask the government to increase the financial commitment to humanitarian aid and to give to this cause weight equal to that it gives to the conflict. If Iraq is worth liberating, contributing to the cost of rebuilding and providing for the immediate humanitarian needs are also worthy. And the needs are great. According to the latest figures released by UNICEF, almost half of Iraq's total population are children, with 11.3 million under the age of 18. Of the 3.5 million children under the age of five, more than one in eight will die before they reach their fifth birthday. The maternity-mortality ratio has more than doubled since 1990. Almost 60 per cent of the population are fully dependent on food ration distribution, making 18 million people food insecure. The lack of medicines and adequate diet has already made children very vulnerable to sickness. </para><para>UNICEF has estimated that five million people are at risk of lack of access to safe water and sanitation. Any disruption to electricity generation following a conflict would seriously interrupt the provision of safe water for such a population, and this has serious consequences for sewerage and sanitation services. In addition, say UNICEF, the present supplies of vaccines and drugs in the country are sufficient for approximately four months. As a result of conflict, there are likely to be substantial numbers of refugees. In the last conflict many of the refugees died from exposure, lack of nutrition and sickness. UNICEF has had a long-term commitment to Iraq's children. I fully support their work and the belief that they and others have in this work. Groups like CARE Australia and other NGOs should be adequately funded to minimise suffering due to the effects of war on the Iraqi people. I ask our government to play a major role in funding and supporting their efforts. </para><para>In addition to providing increased humanitarian aid, I ask the government to use its influence to prevent the bombing of civilian targets and the laying of antipersonnel mines, which I know we have banned but which I understand the United States reserves the right to use. This will help to reduce harm to civilians during the conflict and after it. In the longer term, I ask our government to step up its activities internationally to rid the world of weapons of mass destruction and to ensure tough penalties for those whose illegal trade in these devices provides the means for terrorist activities, which threaten world peace. We must also use our good relationship with the United States to encourage its administration to support international measures to reduce the deeply worrying escalation in arms production.</para><para>The community feels a deep sense of frustration at the inability of the United Nations to act. Despite the frustration, there have been many people quietly working to try to find peaceful resolutions to conflict. It has been a privilege for me to have had access to some of these people and organisations dedicated to this end, and I am grateful for their suggestions and wise counsel.</para><para>Who of us in this House can deny having grave misgivings as we prepare for military action? Patriotism is a virtue to which we all aspire. I do not doubt that both sides of the House possess it in equal measure. However, in the opposition I regret that it comes from minds unwilling to take any responsibility or to carry any notion of the long-term aspirations and loyalties that the government espouses. The canard of the opposition—and I use this French word advisedly—is that the government is cowardly, firstly, because its members will not forsake their solidarity and, secondly, because it will not forsake its allies. Almost all of those on the other side, to a man and woman, have emerged from their factional caves to launch this barb. The alleged cowardice of the government is that it acknowledges our danger and is prepared to look squarely upon the face of the great assassin, to shudder and to act. In closing, I would like to pay tribute to the men and women of Australia's defence service. I support them and their families, and I pray for their safe return.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>13142</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Martyn, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTYN EVANS</name><name.id>N36</name.id><electorate>Bonython</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the Prime Minister's motion on Iraq. I understand that, as I speak to the House, Australia is at war and that the operation about which we previously spoke prospectively is now in active effect. The fact that Australia is now at war means that what we can do as a people and as a parliament is hope that the war is short, thereby ensuring that the loss of life on all sides of this conflict is minimised. I say that on behalf of both the Australian and coalition side and the side of the Iraqi people.</para></talk.start><para>The world has not been able to agree on any issue in respect of this particular conflict, and the United Nations itself was never able to reach agreement on how to deal with the question of the disarmament of the Iraqi regime. In fact, they have not been able to agree over a 12-year period of time in which the Security Council came to discuss this matter. That is since the conclusion of the first Gulf War in 1991, when Iraq unconditionally surrendered to the coalition, which had been endorsed by the United Nations Security Council. Indeed, it was a United Nations Security Council resolution which brought about the unconditional acceptance of that surrender of Iraq and the unconditional acceptance by Iraq of its disarmament and forsaking of weapons of mass destruction in the future. Since that time no-one has been able to reach effective agreement on how that would be achieved and certainly no-one has been able to reach agreement with Iraq and with Saddam Hussein on how that might be brought into practical effect—and that has included the United Nations Security Council. During that whole period, and during the period in which United Nations inspectors were in Iraq in the early 1990s, Iraq brought into effect the whole of its new biological weapons program. It developed most of its biological warfare program, its anthrax program, while those United Nations inspectors were there. Indeed, the inspectors were totally unaware of it until one of Saddam's relatives defected, towards the end of that program, and brought that very program to the world's attention.</para><para>We can see from the whole of that 12 years just how difficult it has been to deal with that regime. I am sure that the whole of the world—apart from that regime itself—and most of the Iraqi people themselves are only too well aware of just how evil that regime is. If we need any reminding of that, we can read an article in the United Kingdom's <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Observer</inline> of 16 March 2003, written by one Barham Salih. Mr Salih is Prime Minister of the Kurdistan region in Sulaymaniyah in northern Iraq. In that article, he states:</para><quote><para>This regime has cost the lives of at least two million Iraqis. Four million more have been forced to become refugees. Iraqi Kurdistan is filled with the mass graves of victims of genocide - the Anfal campaign that in 1987-88 may have killed as many as 182,000 Kurds. Today marks the fifteenth anniversary of the Iraqi chemical weapons attack on Halabja that killed 5,000 Kurds.</para></quote><para>That is just a short quotation from that article. It goes to illustrate just how evil a regime is that would produce nuclear weapons, that would produce anthrax weapons, that would produce VX nerve gas, that would produce Scud missiles and launch them against other states, that would invade Kuwait and that would invade Iran in a war that killed one million people.</para><para>You might say that this kind of activity over a period of many years, decades, would justify the war that we see launched today. But, of course, the end does not always justify the means, as we know only too well in our own cultural context. Countries like Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom—cultures like ours—know only too well that the end does not justify the means. The reality is that this is a regime which should be removed from power. Saddam Hussein is not a person who could, in anyone's language, justify the control of a country—a country with the history and with the dignity of the people of Iraq. He should not control such a country as Iraq. He should not control the people of Iraq. He should not be able to torture and kill the Iraqi people in the way that he has. </para><para>However, the United States, the United Kingdom and the government of Australia, and those who are participating in the so-called coalition of the willing, should have worked through the proper and due processes of the United Nations. They should not have been frustrated in that process by countries like France. They should not have been frustrated in their legitimate and reasonable efforts to bring about a diplomatic solution—a solution in which the negotiators and the inspectors were attempting to bring about the proper disarmament of Iraq over a period of 12 years.</para><para>But, frustrated in that process they were, by the very government who had agreed to unilateral disarmament and the disposal of its weapons of mass destruction following their defeat in the Kuwait war of 1991. Through their process of frustration, that government, and the government of France, as well as other governments on the United Nations Security Council—those permanent members who have the right of veto; those permanent members who, like France, have threatened to use their right of veto under almost any circumstances—have effectively borne some great culpability for the war that we see today, just as those who have launched the war which we are involved in today must also bear responsibility for the failure of the diplomatic process. But, as I said before, the end does not justify the means, and it does not justify it even when the enemy that you face is as terrible and as great and as evil as one such as Saddam Hussein. We must always bear that in mind in a country as good and as strong as Australia. It is too tempting to use the power and might of the weapons, the army and the air force that you have when you are a country like the United States or the United Kingdom.</para><para>However, we do find ourselves in this situation. I have always been a very strong supporter of the United States alliance and of the way in which the United States has supported Australia, and we have supported the United States. Notwithstanding anything that occurs during this conflict, I will remain a strong supporter of that United States alliance. Indeed, we have our own Australian troops, and the members of the Air Force from the Edinburgh Air Force Base, which is in my electorate, as part of that conflict. I am a very strong supporter of those troops who are part of this conflict. Those who are from my own electorate and the Defence Force base at Edinburgh will, I am sure, take a very strong and professional commitment to the work that they will do as part of his conflict. I am sure that in their professional commitment to the work that they will do they will enjoy the strong support not only of their local member but of all of the members on this side of the House. So, no matter how they came to be in the situation that they are in from noon today, they will enjoy our strong and continuing support in the work that they do.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

I recognise the hard work he too has put into trying to address this enormously important issue. A large number of countries are involved in the coalition to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. There are many countries that are tired of Iraq's delays and obfuscation and that believe the international community needs to act to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. Many of these countries have long been concerned about developments in Iraq and now that diplomacy has ended are willing to back up their concerns. Over 40 countries will participate in or support the coalition to disarm Iraq. Among those publicly supportive so far are Afghanistan, Albania, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, Eritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Mongolia, Honduras and Rwanda. Many more countries will be lending their support behind the scenes. Obviously, military action could not be undertaken without the assistance of a range of countries in the Middle East region including, crucially, many of Iraq's Arab neighbours.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMR</name.id><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I warn the member for Ballarat!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name></talker><para>—I do not think the contribution of Iraq's Arab neighbours to this campaign should ever be underestimated. Contributions that will be made include the provision of troops, basing and overflight rights. For example, Poland will contribute 200 soldiers, including special forces, chemical and logistical units. Poland's president said in announcing this that Poland knew very well what the consequences of neglect and indifference to a military threat could be. Denmark will contribute a submarine, a frigate, doctors and army liaison staff. The Netherlands has already committed patriot missiles to the defence of Turkey and is sending a frigate and submarine to the theatre. Spain has said it will send a hospital ship, a refuelling ship and a frigate. Spain would also allow the use of Spanish military bases and will provide chemical and biological weapons experts. The Korean cabinet will ask the national assembly to approve a plan to send an engineering battalion of between 500 and 600 soldiers.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Many countries in the Asia-Pacific region agree with us that Iraq must be disarmed, and they have made strong statements in support of the need for force.

Philippines Foreign Secretary Ople said on 16 March that the forcible disarming of Saddam was mandated by Security Council resolution 1441 and the Philippines would be part of the coalition of the willing. The assertion made by some that Australia is just part of a coalition of three is nonsense.

As all members of the House will know, the government is deeply committed to protecting the safety of Australians overseas and my department's travel advisories, naturally enough, are being reviewed constantly. Throughout the week I have announced strengthened travel advisories for a range of countries in the Middle East. Australians for quite some time now have been urged to leave Iraq using available commercial means. But, fairly obviously, now Baghdad airport is closed. Our advice to those Australians who now remain in Iraq is that, unless they are able to leave overland—and I suspect that would not be easy—they should stay well away from any strategic or military locations.</para></talk.start><para>At this stage, at the time I am speaking here, we believe there are 15 Australians still in Iraq. Twelve of them are believed to be in Baghdad and three of them in northern Iraq. This number of 15 includes four media representatives—two of whom are in Baghdad and two of whom are believed to be in the north—seven human shields and four long-term residents. This does not include a number of dual nationals, who are well integrated into the local community, and I do not have a figure for how many dual nationals there are. Advice has been communicated to these Australians that our ability to provide consular assistance is obviously limited in the extreme.</para><para>In addition, Australians should not travel to Kuwait, Israel, Jordan or Syria, and any Australians who are in those countries are advised to leave. Australians should also defer nonessential travel to Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Bahrain, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Australians should depart, unless their presence is essential and they are satisfied that their safety and their contingency plans are adequate.</para><para>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue to provide practical advice that Australians should heed in the event they become caught up in a hostile environment. Our deep concern about security in the region has been exemplified in contingency planning for our missions in the Middle East. Decisions to draw down staff in these missions have been announced in various travel advisories that we have updated. Our embassies in Tel Aviv and Amman have drawn down to emergency staff, and other embassies may very well follow. Our embassies in Beirut, Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Teheran have directed staff dependants to depart. Australians working for the United Nations have, I believe, all now been evacuated from Iraq. We will continue to consult daily, perhaps even hourly, with our key consular partners, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand, on further possible contingencies. Any activation of contingency plans affecting Australians will be preceded by clear public advice.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Terrorism</title><page.no>13149</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>13149</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is again to the Attorney-General.

The legal authority derives from Security Council resolutions 678, 687 and 1441, all passed under chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. In resolution 678, the Security Council authorised United Nations member states to use all necessary means not just to liberate Kuwait but to restore international peace and security in the area. Resolution 687 imposed a conditional cease-fire on Iraq at the end of the Gulf War, based on Iraqi compliance with obligations to disarm its weapons of mass destruction. In resolution 1441, which was passed unanimously on 8 November last year, the Security Council recalled resolution 678 as a relevant resolution to Iraqi weapons of mass destruction disarmament, recalled that the cease-fire in resolution 687 was conditional upon Iraqi compliance with its obligations to disarm and decided that Iraq remained in material breach of this obligation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Since 8 November and the passage of Security Council resolution 1441, Iraq has chosen not to comply with that resolution because it has chosen not to `actively, immediately and unconditionally' cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors. The cease-fire is now revoked. This straightforward legal argument is accepted by many countries and is an argument, interestingly enough, endorsed by the former chief of staff of the former Leader of the Opposition, who is indeed a great supporter of the Labor Party; he stood for preselection for a Sydney seat—the seat of Lowe—and is very highly regarded by members on the other side. The fact is that he has fully endorsed these arguments. In a way, more interestingly for the opposition, in 1998—and members of the opposition may not recall this—there was an operation undertaken by the Clinton administration called Operation Desert Fox. I can see a blank look on the faces of members of the opposition.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name></talker><para>—I can always see a blank look on your face. Operation Desert Fox was an operation which included the use of cruise missiles and bombs. Missiles were fired against Iraq. It was a substantial bombing campaign of Iraq. At that time, the then opposition spokesman for foreign affairs, the member for Kingsford-Smith, told this House—this is in March 1998—that `resolution 678 is still in force'. This was an argument which was repeated by the member for Brand when he was the Leader of the Opposition and by the member for Brisbane who, at the time, was the opposition spokesman on defence. To the best of my knowledge, there was no dissent within opposition ranks about the legality of the Clinton administration's bombing campaign against Iraq and, indeed, the deployment of Australian troops earlier in the year in order to support miliary pressure on Iraq at that time. So it came as a surprise to us on Sunday morning to hear the member for Griffith, who is the current opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, say that the use of force in these circumstances had suddenly become illegal. It was legal in 1998, but it has suddenly become illegal now—perhaps because the Bush administration is in office and not the Clinton administration.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Interestingly enough, on the very same morning—it shows how disoriented the opposition is—the Leader of the Opposition was asked, and did not know, whether it was legal or illegal. He then said that he was waiting for advice. Months and months of debate on this issue of Iraq had been going on, but the Leader of the Opposition was still waiting for advice. The incredible thing is that only last night, when he was interviewed on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline>, he said that he still did not have any advice. But he added—and I think these are interesting words—that `whether it was legal or not did not matter'. A lot happened during the night, because at lunchtime today at the Press Club he said that he had got legal advice—although he never said who he had got it from—and that the legal advice was important. Yesterday it did not matter; today it is important. It simply exposes the vacuousness and opportunism of the opposition's position on the very serious issue of Iraq.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMullan</name></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

I do not write them myself; the department prepares them in consultation with our missions overseas. There have been significant changes in the travel advisories, and I articulated five, six, seven or so of those changes that have taken place in recent times. We do, from time to time, upgrade global travel alerts, but I make this point: what the situation is in terms of the security of Australians in Nicaragua, Buenos Aires or Reykjavik may be an entirely different thing from the security of Australians in Amman, Oman, Jakarta or the Philippines. Whilst we do from time to time have global travel advisories, we update them only when we have information which we believe is relevant to every single place on earth. In this particular instance, it is a matter of judgment but my judgment is that the best thing to do is to make sure that we focus primarily on the country-specific travel advisories, because the situation that you might find in Kuwait or in Amman in Jordan is, I would have thought, very obviously entirely different for Australians from the situation that you might find in Buenos Aires or in Panama City.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Security</title><page.no>13152</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>13152</page.no><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GAMBARO</name><name.id>9K6</name.id><electorate>Petrie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Attorney-General.

As I indicated in response to questions from the member for Barton, Australia has been on an unprecedented level of security alert since September 11, and the alert that was raised on 19 November last year remains current. As I said earlier, Australia has been a terrorist target since at least 11 September 2001. </para></talk.start><para>The government have done a lot to protect the public. We acted quickly and effectively to strengthen our counter-terrorism abilities to reflect the threat. In the last federal budget, $1.3 billion was allocated for extra staff and resources to our security, law enforcement and border protection agencies to meet the challenges of the new security environment. Another $100 million was allocated to further upgrade those capabilities following the Bali bombings. The government also developed a comprehensive package of counter-terrorism legislation, the bulk of which was passed last year. As the House is aware, a key element is the ASIO bill, which is yet to be passed. It is proposed that that be introduced today, and we look forward to the cooperation of the opposition in obtaining passage of this important legislation as quickly as possible.</para><para>The government has also strengthened its intelligence sharing and cooperative security arrangements with Australia's regional neighbours as well as with traditional partners and other countries around the world. At home, we have strengthened our cooperation and coordination with states and territories to enable a swift and effective response to any terrorist incident within Australia. In Perth this week there has been a national counter-terrorism exercise conducted. The suggestion that has been made by previous questions—that we should increase the threat levels in Australia as a result of the likely conflict in Iraq—I have already answered. As I said, since the predeployment of Australian forces, there has been no intelligence received requiring the raising of the overall threat level in Australia. </para><para>The level of counter-terrorism alert is under continual review against a backdrop of international developments and of threat information. The Australian system works on the basis of information and response. Our intelligence agencies carefully analyse relevant information and assess the threat to Australia. As I have said, Australia is on a heightened level of alert, and this has involved upgraded security measures and heightened levels of intelligence activity focused on counter-terrorism. As a measure of prudence and precaution, some additional security measures have been implemented with respect to some Australian embassies overseas, some foreign interest in Australia and some Australian interests, including defence facilities. Our intelligence agencies will continue to monitor trends and activities and, should there be any indication of an increased threat to Australia, relevant agencies and the government will respond appropriately. Should information become available to the government which requires a change to threat levels, the public will be advised. As the conduct of our very successful national security public campaign demonstrates, the government takes its responsibilities to inform the public about the threat environment very seriously.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs: Indonesia</title><page.no>13153</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>13153</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the foreign minister.

I think it would be worrying for all members if, in the course of debate, one was not able to say that one did not believe that someone had told the truth. It has always been accepted that to say someone is a liar imputes motive to them, but in the past to say that someone has not told the truth certainly has not imputed motive. If the remarks you have just made are interpreted by other people who may take the chair in your place as meaning that they can bring an embargo upon people who want to raise issues like that in debate, we are really turning the debates in this House into things they were never meant to be. If in the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia a member cannot rise and accuse someone of not telling the truth in a very well ordered way, I think we are going to turn the debates in this House into rather sanitised versions of things. It would just be ridiculous.

I have not, in my view, made it more difficult for future occupiers of the chair to determine whether or not a remark is appropriate. I note that, with the remark the member for Isaacs was asked to cease from making, she acknowledged the chair, so she was not offended by it. There is a general desire on both sides of this chamber for the standard and the language to be recognised. I do not intend to change House of Representatives practice.

No-one could have been anticipating this conflict with anything but the greatest reluctance and anxiety. Many of my own constituents have expressed to me their deep concerns and, in a number of cases, strong objection to any conflict. We all have immense concerns about the loss of life which any military confrontation brings. We would be less than human if we did not. Yet the human cost of military action must be weighed against the cost of inaction. It is not a simple case of war versus peace; it is a case of war versus ongoing violence and repression.</para><para>From a distance, the costs of continuing repression and tyranny are easier to ignore and less confronting than the cost of military intervention. But this does not make them any less profound. Turning a blind eye is easier, less controversial and perhaps more palatable, but the longer term consequences may be worse. We have seen many examples in recent years where the human cost of failure to act was far greater. We saw it in East Timor between 1975 and 1999. We saw it in Rwanda in 1994, where the pleas for United Nations help to end the bloodshed and genocide were ignored. The tragic cost was the death of 800,000 Tutsi civilians. The United Nations failure of will was inexcusable.</para><para>It is worth noting also the example of Kosovo, because it also bears on the question of legitimacy of action. In Kosovo, the United Nations failed to shoulder its responsibilities, stymied by its own veto system. As a result, the United States was forced to take the lead and headed a NATO force which ended the bloodshed in the Balkans. Yet very few would have questioned the legitimacy of such action, even without UN sanction. Would the US led NATO intervention have been any more right if Russia had not used its veto? The fact is that it was the right thing to do regardless of the UN veto. The existence or otherwise of a veto by one of the permanent members of the Security Council is not the sole arbiter of what is right, what is moral or what is legitimate.</para><para>The same applies to the current situation in Iraq. France's determination to use its veto, for whatever political or commercial reasons, prevents a united approach. It does not make the need for action any less compelling. Last week, a last-ditch effort to secure a united front with a British compromise proposal to strengthen the inspections regime by laying down six very clear and tangible benchmarks for Iraq's compliance was rejected. Remarkably, France rejected those even before Iraq did. France had made it abundantly clear that they were not interested in supporting any further resolutions to apply increased pressure on Iraq. On the one hand they assert a desire to see Iraq disarm but on the other they reject any efforts to secure that compliance.</para><para>Tragically, there will be loss of life in Iraq. Yet just as tragic is the ongoing loss of life, the continuing suffering caused by Saddam Hussein's campaign of genocide and torture—a record that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives over the past decade or so, that has some four million Iraqis living in exile, that has caused Iraqi refugees in Australia and other countries to urge military action to free their country of this tyrant. In weighing the moral case for action, the cost of inaction must be considered.</para><para>I will quote a small part of a speech made last month by Jose Ramos Horta, the Nobel peace prize winner, called `Counting the cost of war', in which he said:</para><quote><para>It would certainly be a better world if war were not necessary. Yet I also remember the desperation and anger I felt when the rest of the world chose to ignore the tragedy that was drowning my people.</para><para>We begged a foreign power to free us from oppression, by force if necessary.</para><para>So I follow with some consternation the debate on Iraq in the United Nations Security Council and in NATO. I am unimpressed by the grandstanding of certain European leaders. Their actions undermine the only truly effective means of pressure on the Iraqi dictator: the threat of the use of force.</para></quote><para>He concluded:</para><quote><para>History has shown that the use of force is often the necessary price of liberation.</para><para>A respected Kosovar intellectual once told me how he felt when the world finally interceded in his country: “I am a pacifist. But I was happy, I felt liberated, when I saw NATO bombs falling.”</para></quote><para>Iraq must be disarmed. No-one but the most naive would deny that. The threat to world security posed by chemical and biological weapons being supplied to terrorist organisations is unthinkable. The mentality demonstrated on September 11, in Bali or in any number of other terrorists attacks—a mentality which deliberately inflicts maximum suffering on innocent civilians—will use the most potent weapons available. This, combined with a number of repressive and tyrannical regimes such as Iraq which either have or are developing such weapons, presents a frightening prospect to the world.</para><para>When weapons inspectors left Iraq in 1998, large quantities of these weapons materials were unaccounted for. In fact, in 1991 Iraq had been given 15 days to fully declare its stocks of weapons of mass destruction and 90 days to destroy them. After 12 years of defying 17 United Nations resolutions—some authorising the use of force in the event of non-compliance—which required Iraq's total disarmament of weapons of mass destruction, this has still not been achieved.</para><para>The other point which is so important is that the resolve of the world's free nations and the credibility of the United Nations are at stake here. If, after so many ultimatums, the United Nations and world leaders had simply walked away from this, their authority would have been greatly diminished. If they had failed to take action, no future ultimatum to Iraq or any other tyrannical regime would have been taken seriously.</para><para>I make two other points. Firstly, after this conflict is over we must make a serious commitment to addressing the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. I note that Australia has made an initial commitment of $10 million to international aid agencies for immediate contingency planning and preparedness. This will enable a start to be made with food, water, sanitation and health care. The government has made it clear that this is only the start and that more will be forthcoming.</para><para>Our support needs to be substantial and continuing. We must work with the United Nations and NGO aid agencies to provide further and ongoing financial, logistic and personnel support. We must also work with multilateral agencies where we can to assist with Iraq's reconstruction. These obligations will not be short lived. Australia, along with all UN members, must and will play its part in helping to rebuild Iraq and improve the life of its people. The recent pledge by Britain, the US, Spain and Portugal to protect Iraq's natural resources, particularly its oil, for the Iraqi people will certainly help. So too will the end of the regime of international sanctions.</para><para>The last point I make is that, regardless of our opinions on this war, we must give our utmost support to Australian Defence Force personnel serving in the gulf. These outstanding young men and women serve their country with distinction, regardless of the political debates that may rage around them. Their commitment to duty and to their country is pre-eminent, and we greatly admire them for that. We pray for a speedy and safe return for all.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>13161</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I start by sending a message to our Defence Force service men and women who are now at war in Iraq and to their families back here in Australia, who are no doubt feeling increasingly anxious about the safety of their loved ones. The Australian Labor Party fully support our military personnel in the Middle East and pray for their safe and speedy return home.</para></talk.start><para>It is true that we do not believe the Prime Minister has made the right decision in committing our forces to a US led pre-emptive strike on Iraq, but we will never waver in our support for our troops. They are not asked their opinion on whether the government should commit to war; nor would they offer one. They have a legal and moral duty to act as the government of the day instructs them. In this they do not have a choice. I have every confidence that they will serve Australia with great courage, skill and honour. We also pledge our support to their families and their loved ones at this difficult time.</para><para>It is estimated that the war will cost Australia $900 million. Uniquely, those same troops who have been sent to the Middle East can be comforted in the knowledge that Defence will be paying for the war. There has been $660 million ripped out of Defence this year, and in total $900 million over the next two years. This is John Howard's L.J. Hooker war, which the proceeds of Defence land sales will fund.</para><para>Today we are debating a motion to send our troops to war. This motion reflects a decision by the Prime Minister that he took in July last year. We are stripping away the pretences of being or not being in the coalition of the willing. The only one left who denies or doubts that Australia always was in the coalition of the willing is the Prime Minister himself—the very person who perpetrated the canard in the first place. Howard government members say they are against the war but they willingly locked into the war months ago. Before a shot is fired, the first casualties are the small `l' liberals. Already vanquished, they have been totally neutered and muted.</para><para>The formal decision to go to war was taken in the Azores, where Spain and Portugal—which are not sending troops—made the formal decision that Australian troops should go to war. No-one disputes that war will have terrible consequences for Iraqis, but it is the consequences of war for Australia that are likely to impact most on Australians, for a long time. Even Minister Abbott agrees with that. A former secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has said that this is the worst Australian blunder in 50 years. The Prime Minister says that this is not a war against Muslims but he fails to demonstrate how this perception will not grow amongst them.</para><para>Much has been said by coalition members about what a terrible tyrant Saddam Hussein has been, what a murderous dictator he is and how he persecutes his own people. No-one disputes that. What is disputed is why we should suddenly act now. Why is this humanitarian argument so forceful today? The very same argument does not apply to North Korea, does not apply to Syria and does not apply to Zimbabwe. What humanitarian action is the government proposing in those cases? Absolutely nothing.</para><para>There is no link between Saddam Hussein and September 11 or Bali. September 11 and Bali were terrible events. We should be embarrassed in no way, and on no account, in tracking down those who perpetrated September 11 or October 12; but no-one has been able to demonstrate that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime are directly linked to al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiah or any other terrorist organisation. It is true that Saddam Hussein's regime has weapons of mass destruction—that it has awful chemical weapons—but no-one has established that they have been given to any terrorist organisation. That they should be eliminated is beyond question. That the regime should be changed is beyond question. But surely it behoves those who have now launched this war to establish the direct connection.</para><para>As much as we might like one, there is no direct connection between Saddam Hussein and terrorist organisations, or Saddam Hussein and the giving of weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organisations. </para><para>It is true to say that the Australian Labor Party are very proud of our relationship with America. After all, it was a Labor wartime government that made the critical decision to turn away from the UK for our own security and to look to the United States. In the Labor Party we have never had a craven attitude to the UK and we have never had a craven attitude to the United States of America. We have had a grateful attitude, we have welcomed their support and we have been very loyal and faithful allies but we are not subservient; we are not craven. We will occasionally disagree—and we need to disagree in this instance. Not one member country in our region is a member of the coalition of the willing. No member country in our region is committing troops to this war on Iraq.</para><para>We are urged all the time by those who are expert and by the Australian people to be self-reliant to the maximum extent possible. We need to try and protect Australians, Australia and our interests. Unlike America, we cannot stand alone. If we want to protect this country against terrorist attacks, we utterly and absolutely need the assistance and cooperation of people in our region. Has John Howard, at any time in this Iraqi crisis, led a mission through countries in our region to explain our position? Of course not. Not even the foreign minister has been sent on such a mission. In fact, we sent a civil servant to talk to our neighbours to explain our position.</para><para>I do not think it is fashionable these days to have doubts and uncertainties, but I have doubts and uncertainties about what has been embarked upon today. There can be certainties about the outcome of the war. There can be certainties about the impact and devastation on the Iraqi people but what will be the outcome? Are not people within Middle Eastern countries—whether they are Muslims, Copts, Christians, Jews or any other religion—entitled to go to bed at night safe? Are they not to enjoy having a home and work? Are they not to enjoy being able to live in peace? In this 21st century, is it impossible for us to say that we can have peace and cooperation in the Middle East? If just one half of all the determination and money that is going into the war in Iraq, went into peace, humanitarian aid and good governance, I am sure the people of the Middle East would be better off. And I am sure the world as a whole would be far better off.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>13162</page.no><name role="metadata">Prosser, Geoff, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PROSSER</name><name.id>RI4</name.id><electorate>Forrest</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think I echo the view of all in this House when I say that nobody wants war. I stand today to place on the record my considered support for the government's commitment of Australian troops to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction and ensure compliance with all the UN resolutions made on the subject.</para></talk.start><para>It is fair to say that the people in the electorate of Forrest have mixed views on this issue. I want to place on the record my gratitude to all those who have made the effort to ring, write or email me to give me their views and opinions. I have spoken to many who have strongly supported the government's stance, as well as those who oppose war at all costs. That is the point, though. There will be costs if the world allows Saddam Hussein to continue to pursue and possess weapons of mass destruction; it sends a very serious message to other rogue states. It could also result in those weapons coming into the possession of those who seek to make fundamentalist religious points by wreaking violence on thousands of innocent people. It could result in a world where international lawlessness is rife, and where the international community is powerless to stop it.</para><para>The UN has been calling for Saddam Hussein to disarm for 12 years, passing no fewer than 18 resolutions. Where was the UN Security Council on Rwanda and where was it on Kosovo? Many of the atrocities that were committed in these countries could have been prevented had the Security Council faced up to its responsibilities. The French have largely been culpable in rendering the UN ineffective. Intent on throwing their own weight around, they seem to have forgotten that they have almost rendered the only institution in which they have any weight as ineffectual.</para><para>The Australian people should not forget that it was not that long ago that we were boycotting French goods because of France's nuclear testing in the South Pacific and their subsequent detestable actions in the <inline font-style="italic">Rainbow Warrior</inline> affair in Auckland Harbour, New Zealand. One of my own constituents in Forrest was caught up in this incident and rang to remind me of France's actions. Entertaining despots is a speciality of France, given Mugabe's recent visit there. </para><para>I have examined this issue and the evidence and arguments carefully, and I have come to the conclusion that Australia, the US and the UK are doing the right thing. In our post September 11 landscape we cannot afford to walk away from this issue. Merely wishing that weapons of mass destruction will not be used by rogue states like Iraq, or that they will not fall into terrorists hands, will not keep Australians safe. I remember the feelings of anger and helplessness at the time of the Bali bombings. I also remember thinking that we have a duty as parliamentarians—and as a government—to do all we can to protect Australians. We must be sure to act in the national interest. I can understand those who have come to different conclusions and I respect other opinions, but I abhor the way the opposition is playing politics with this issue.</para><para>My thoughts and support and those of my constituents are with the men and women of the Australian Defence Force and their families. I encourage my constituents to get behind the `Walk for our Troops' being organised by the Busselton RSL. It is the Busselton RSL's intention to make a show of support for our troops by walking the 250-odd kilometres from Busselton to Perth. The veterans leave Busselton at 7 a.m. on Saturday. I urge all Western Australians to get behind them and the cause of our troops. I am sure that when these proud veterans walk past Campbell Barracks it will be a powerful message to our soldiers. The walk is not meant to be a symbol of support for war but rather a statement for our troops that we understand they are doing a job; they are only playing their part and they take with them our prayers and our support. I trust that this necessary conflict will be short, that it will meet its objective of disarming Iraq and that all our soldiers will return home safe and have the support of all Australians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>13163</page.no><name role="metadata">Sawford, Rod, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SAWFORD</name><name.id>3J4</name.id><electorate>Port Adelaide</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Iraq: whether the argument comes from so-called doves or hawks I remain unconvinced by the many half-truths and half-debates from either which conveniently and deliberately leave out salient points inconvenient to their particular point of view. There is plenty of synthesis, precious little analysis. Right from the very beginning bipartisanship has not been possible. But it should have been. The only conclusion one can possibly reach by the decision to go to war is one of failure on all sides.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, there is the monumental failure at an international level. The United Nations has failed not only in this debate but also in the previous debates, particularly those affecting the Middle East. The Arab world in particular is rightly offended by the failure of the international community to insist that Israel go back to its 1967 borders. I note there is precious little acknowledgment of the serious Arab world in its efforts to get Saddam Hussein to go into exile. It was, of course, the last shot in the locker but that last shot would have been more effective if the border issue concerning Israel and its neighbours was bedded down in agreement years before. Of course while discussing Saddam Hussein and his murderous elite regime, one can make the point that, if they had any love for their country and their people whatsoever, they would take the opportunity of exile offered by the Arab world. The United Nations, and particularly the Security Council, has been very badly damaged and that fact alone does not auger well for the future security of the world.</para><para>I take particular exception to the actions of the French government, supported by the German government, for largely domestic and investment reasons. Both of these countries have huge investments in Iraq. I read in a British publication that in recent months the French oil firm TotalFinaElf signed billions of dollars of oil contracts with Saddam Hussein. If that is true, if that is a significant factor in the French government's action, then not only is the Security Council of the United Nations compromised but so is the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Perhaps it is time for France to be replaced on the Security Council by a representative of the European Union. Flagging its intention to veto any second resolution whatever the content gave Bush, Blair and Howard the opportunity to rationalise the dismissal of the UN Security Council. Like Bush, Blair and Howard, Chirac is also flawed on this issue.</para><para>The current impotence of the United Nations and the disingenuous grandstanding by the French and German governments in particular have provided a rationale of sorts for the coalition of the willing, albeit flawed. But all the spokesmen for the coalition of the willing have failed too. Their expositions and their politics have faltered badly and failed to even convince citizens in their own lands. It is not only the mass rallies in each of these countries that have proved that. President Bush, Prime Ministers Blair and Howard, Vice-President Cheney, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, Foreign Minister Downer and others have all been guilty over the last 12 months of using language and tone that is punctured by threat, aggression, intimidation and heavying that has diminished the hope of a diplomatic solution.</para><para>Australians polled on this issue have been unequivocal in their responses. As a majority of nations in the democratic world have indicated, Australians would rest their support on a successful second resolution to resolution 1441. So did I. They did not want war but they indicated pretty clearly that up to 80 per cent would support a United Nations resolution to disarm Iraq by force if necessary. That has all gone. We are now a divided nation.</para><para>Although I appreciate the views of some of my colleagues of no war under any circumstances, I am not one of those people. The arguments of no war under any circumstance, including a United Nations resolution, did not convince me. Like the hawks, they too failed to identify all the elements in the debate, conveniently forgetting the plight of the Kurds, the Shiite Muslims, the Marsh Arabs, the educated Iraqi classes—some of whom are in exile—and the failure of 12 years of containment against Iraq. Nor was I convinced by the arguments that this was about American control of Iraqi oil—French or German maybe, but not American. That fails any rational analysis, as does the terrorist target argument. Australia was a terrorist target before and remains so now, admittedly at a much more heightened level. What has changed is more dangerous than that. We could now become the target of rogue states.</para><para>But what of the majority of Australian people like me and my constituents who have been dismissed out of hand by this government? They have been disenfranchised, as a citizen would be in a tyrannical state. The Howard government knew what Australians believed. The foreign minister knew. The frontbench knew. The backbench knew. They all knew. As with the Bush administration and the Blair government, the Howard government could not win the debate. That basic tenet is an absolute basis for democracy and dates back to the ancient Greek senate. This loss in the debate must be acknowledged. They lost the debate. That is the real failure. They were incapable of exhibiting the necessary intellect to convince the free world. But where does this leave the majority of Australians? For the first time in the history of this country we are expected to support pre-emptive strikes and be, in theory and practice, the aggressor.</para><para>There is a trinity that governs all human behaviour. It is driven by beliefs that it matters what you think, how you try, what you do and that all three are right. It matters that they are right and coherent. In the Iraq situation, I believe that on all sides of this House there is unanimity about the need to disarm and remove Saddam Hussein. That is the first part of the trinity. Get the idea, get the rationale right. But that is not the problem. The second part of the trinity is to get the process right. On this the coalition of the willing has demonstrably failed. It could not convince its own populations, let alone the governments of the unwilling. It could not win the debate, and that is the nub of the problem. Lazy intellect or plain wrong; it is either one or the other. If you cannot get right the second part of the trinity—that is, the process—the third part of the trinity, the outcome, is likely to be an unmitigated disaster, not only for the Iraq war but also for all future conflict. Pre-emptive attack has now been approved. The intensity of fear that that will generate is simply mind-boggling.</para><para>I have never believed that this country would take the role of aggressor. I have never believed that this country would support the principle of pre-emptive strike. I have always believed that that principle was evil and the province of rogue states. No more for Australia and Australians: we will be tarred with that label forever. That will be the legacy of the coalition of the willing. No longer will young Australians travel anywhere overseas confident that their accent will bring a friendly response. No longer will Australians have the honourable reputation of good world citizens. That reputation was precious and that reputation is now damaged—and for what? The inability of Bush, Blair and Howard to win the debate. That is the raw, unadulterated core of the problem. All these three once proud democracies are diminished in the eyes of the world, particularly for those despicable states who may just take the current example of the coalition of the willing as the pathway and the justification to do their own evil.</para><para>In conclusion, the recommendation put forward to this parliament by the Labor Party should challenge those fair-minded individuals on the government back bench. We know there are some; we just wonder whether they have the courage to take up the challenge. Eight backbenchers on the government side could change this course. Eight backbenchers on the government side with courage, conviction and a bit of ticker could change the course of history for all Australians. All of the coalition backbench know from contact with their electorates that what I have said in this address today is true: that up to 80 per cent of Australians do not and will not support a war against Iraq without the approval of the United Nations Security Council. That is true in the United States; that is true in Great Britain. Australians have been sending that message loud and clear to all coalition electorate offices; they are giving our electorate offices the same message.</para><para>This is a little challenge for the backbench over there. What about the member for Sturt, the member for Boothby, the member for Pearce, the member for Kooyong, the member for Adelaide, the member for Herbert, the member for La Trobe, the member for Hindmarsh, the member for Fairfax, the member for Murray, the member for Gilmore and the members for Hinkler, Wannon, Dunkley, Curtin, Makin, McPherson, Deakin, Eden-Monaro, Forde, Macquarie, Parramatta, Corangamite and Mallee? Get your heart pumping. Get your head in sync. Believe in your soul. Support the Labor amendments and make a change for the better for all time for the reputations of all Australians. Reject the pre-emptive strike. It needs but eight good men and women—that is all it needs—on the coalition back bench. Don't be like the party room this week where not one of you had the guts to stand up and even ask a question of your Prime Minister. How about getting in here when the vote is taken and using your conscience, your head, your heart and your soul?

I did so purposely, because I do not think that anybody wants a nation to go to war. I believe that we should not be in this war against Iraq at the moment, and I believe that the amendment put forward by the Leader of the Opposition is quite correct. I support the amendment. I do not believe that we should have predeployed our troops. It is very obvious to me that the Prime Minister had in fact already agreed to do this some months ago. But I make this point: having said that I completely agree with the Labor party's position on this matter—and we are as one and singing completely from the one song sheet—I am like the previous speaker, the member for Port Adelaide: I am one who would have supported a United Nations resolution which stated that force needed to be used to disarm Iraq. I say that because Saddam Hussein is somebody who is evil. He is somebody who not only tortures his own people but even murders his own relatives. I remember distinctly, for instance, his enticing his daughters and sons-in-law back to Iraq only to kill both of his sons-in-law. This is a man who is more evil than evil. He is a man that in some shape or form needs to be brought to account.</para></talk.start><para>But I simply make the point that there are right ways of doing things and there are wrong ways. Unilateralism and pre-emptive strikes are the last resort. That is a resort that should not be used, particularly if we say to ourselves that we have an international order, that that is the United Nations and that they are the ones that police the international order. I fear now for what is going to happen in this world, given that the United Nations has been weakened as a result of what was started only a couple of hours ago.</para><para>I feel very much for our troops. I make this point: most of our troops over there are there because they have been ordered to be there. In most cases, I might say, they are probably relishing the thought. They are trained for that, and I am sure that they will look after themselves quite adequately. Australian troops have always been known as one of the best fighting forces in the world, and I have no doubt that they will acquit themselves well. I can tell you that the SAS squadron—and I have had the pleasure of meeting a number of its members—is very hard and very good at what it does. I say to them that we are proud of them. I certainly am proud of them. I think everybody on this side either is proud of them or should be proud of them, because they are simply doing what they were asked to do by the government of their country.</para><para>I was also in that Vietnam era, and I was balloted out. Those who were born on 12 June went to Vietnam. Those who were born on the 14th went. But I was born on the 13th and did not go. I am not saying that I was completely unhappy about that, because I was against that war at the time as well and I marched at one of the protest marches. But I remember the very many friends that I had at that time—many of whom are now deceased, some of them taking their own lives as a result of what happened in Vietnam. They came back here to a less than warm welcome. I would hate to think that that sort of action on the part of the Australian people could ever be repeated. For that reason, I make it very clear here today that, whilst I oppose the fact that we have gone to war and the way we have gone to war, I personally would have been completely in favour of it with a UN resolution. If we had waited a little longer we may have been able to get that UN resolution. I want to say something about the French involvement later on.</para><para>I am, have always been and will always be a very strong supporter of the US alliance. At the moment, I think the Americans are feeling a little different to everybody else in the world. How could you not feel that way after the events of September 11, when 3,000 people are killed in your country—not in the capital city, but in the largest city, arguably, in the United States and the Western world? I was there last year. As I said in a previous debate, I read some of the messages that were put on the fences opposite the World Trade Centre, and I could only cop about 20 yards of it because it moved me so much. There are about 200 yards of these messages. I can understand the frustration that the American people are feeling at the moment. However, there are a lot of people in the United States who are against this war, and some of them marching even now. I saw on the AAP that 300 people are marching down Rodeo Drive—or Wiltshire Boulevard, which is next to Rodeo Drive, for those who have been to Hollywood. There is a lot of antagonism even within their own country, as there is around the world. The fact is that nobody likes to think that there could be mass casualties, which there may well be—though God forbid there are.</para><para>I want to again make the point I made previously: we cannot be in a situation where we allow ourselves the luxury of being anti-American. We may not agree with what they are doing this time, but our alliance is such that, in my view, it will stand for a long time in the future. Sometimes there are some things you cannot agree on. Friends cannot agree with each other on everything. This is one such thing. We do not agree with the way this has happened. We would have preferred them to wait. We would have preferred them to have a UN-backed resolution that would have allowed them to go in. But we must not be anti-American. We must try to see if there is some way that we can feel what they are feeling, given the events of September 11. We should consider that while we are having these deliberations.</para><para>I want to say something about those people who, from time to time, try to equate the Iraq situation, in terms of the inaction of the United Nations, with the situation in Israel. All I can say is that the Israeli government do not murder their own people, they do not torture their own people and their president does not kill his sons-in-law. The reality is that it is nonsense to try to equate the inaction on UN resolutions in relation to Israel and the Palestinian question with what is happening in Iraq. The other point I want to bring up in this debate is the Zionism conspiracy theories that you hear all the time. I read a very good article by Gerard Henderson, who writes that the idea that conservative Jews are behind the Iraq push is as dodgy as French platitudes. He says:</para><quote><para>Correctly or incorrectly, the US considers not only that Americans face a real and present danger but that the US is at war. Bush said as much in his recent address to the American Enterprise Institute, declaring that after September 11, “we must look at security in a new way because our country is a battlefield in the first war of the 21st century”.</para></quote><para>Again I make the point: I completely support my party's position on this without question, but people should understand the frame of mind that the American people are in at the moment. Henderson goes on to say:</para><quote><para>The US policy is not driven by Zionism but rather by fear of homeland terrorist attack. And the French position is not motivated by a search for peace but rather by (traditional) French duplicity.</para></quote><para>I do not want to comment on that, except to say that when I consider the actions of the French with respect to this whole issue, where they did not play a very good diplomatic role, I sometimes wonder what the many tens of thousands, if indeed not hundreds of thousands, of British, American, Australian and other troops that are lying in graves on the battlefields of France would think about this. As I said, I simply wanted to speak at the end of this debate to make it very clear that I believe we should have waited a little longer. Having said that, I understand—I try to understand, anyway—that we need the US alliance, and that the reality is that, in some shape or form, we must be very careful not to be seen to be anti-American. I can certainly assure you that those on this side of the House are not against the American alliance, but we are against the way the decisions have been made with respect to this war.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>13167</page.no><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name><name.id>ZD4</name.id><electorate>Bennelong</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will very briefly make a few remarks to close this debate. Perhaps I could bounce off a comment made by the member for Bowman that I totally agree with. I agree with his remark that some of the conspiracy theories concerning the role of Israel in this are completely ill-founded. I am struck by two images of electoral processes in the Middle East in the last few months. I am struck by the image of the re-elected Prime Minister of Israel, Ariel Sharon, being pulled off television midway through an advertisement because, according to the Israeli Electoral Commission, the advertisement did not comply with the electoral laws of Israel. A few weeks earlier, I read that the President of Iraq had been elected with a vote of 100 per cent. I do not think the President of Iraq would be pulled off television by the independent electoral commission. It drives home the point—the very simple, but very relevant point—that the only truly democratic country in all of the Middle East is the state of Israel, and it is something that all of us should bear in mind.</para></talk.start><para>I want to thank everybody who has participated in this debate. As I said earlier, and I want to say again, I respect the fact that there is a range of views in the Australian community on this issue. I understand that, and it has been a difficult debate for the community; but it is a debate that nonetheless has had to be had. On occasions, governments are required to take decisions that are difficult and challenging but are, in their view, in the long-term national interest of the nation. I want to thank my colleagues for the immense thought, consideration, understanding and steadfastness that they have displayed on this issue. I thank them for that. It is very important to me, it is very important to the government, and it is very important to how we represent ourselves to the Australian community. We believe it is the right decision, we believe it is legally sound and we believe it is in the national interest.</para><para>I want to emphasise that, although Australia is participating as part of a US-led coalition, our operations as a military force will take place under a separate national command. We will have separate rules of engagement and separate targeting policies; and as recently as this morning it has been emphasised, in discussions with our military, that those separate targeting policies will be robustly interpreted and enforced. There are areas where we do have differences with the Americans in relation to this, and we will continue to pursue our different views regarding such things as cluster bombs and so forth in the various international fora. I know that a number of my colleagues have spoken about these issues during the debate.</para><para>What happens in Iraq when the conflict ends is important. We do believe—and I think most Australians believe—that the departure of the Saddam Hussein regime will be beneficial for the Iraqi people. We have no doubt about that. Iraq will be a happier, better country without Saddam Hussein, and that should be remembered. We will play a significant part in the reconstruction process. We are prepared to at least match—indeed, go further—than the contribution we made to the reconstruction of Afghanistan. On that occasion we contributed some $43 million. Australia has already pledged $10 million, and I see us going beyond that figure. I want to endorse the remarks that have been made by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding that.</para><para>I also think that the post-conflict stage, the phase 4 stage, should be characterised by a significant involvement by the United Nations. Whatever may be the reaction of some in the House, that is a view that we have put to the American administration and to the British government in the course of our discussions on this. I also think that, domestically, there could well be a role for the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in relation to oversighting the Australian involvement in the phase 4 process. Perhaps there is a role for the committee—I know these committees are independent of the executive and I would not want to transgress in any way on their independence; but perhaps there is a place for the establishment of some kind of subcommittee to oversee that, because we have made a very strong commitment to the process of disarming Iraq. We have done that because we believe it is in Australia's long-term national interest. </para><para>We do worry about the ultimate and fateful coming together of weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism. I share the passionate view of the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, that the world will face a bleak future if ever those two things are joined. That has been the basis of my approach on this, as it has been the basis of Mr Blair's courageous approach in his own country—an approach that has won the admiration of not only his opponents in the United Kingdom but also those who are normally separated from him politically in this country. I am proud to call Tony Blair an international friend of mine on this issue. He has shown great leadership and I admire him immensely.</para><para>Lastly, I want to address some remarks to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force—particularly today, the day when it has become known that they have begun to be involved in operations. However much we may differ and quarrel about the merits of this issue, surely we are united in the expression of a passionate hope and, for many, a prayer that they will all return home safe and sound. Surely on that issue we can all say, with one voice, that is how we feel.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WU5</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Gavan O'Connor</name></talker><para>—They shouldn't be there!</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I remind members of their status in the House.

In order for ASIO to detain and question a person, the Director-General of Security must obtain the consent of the Attorney-General before seeking a warrant from an `issuing authority'.</para><para>The Attorney-General must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that issuing the warrant will substantially assist the collection of intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence and that relying on other methods of collecting that intelligence would be ineffective.</para><para>If the warrant being sought requires a person to be taken into custody immediately and detained, the Attorney-General must also be satisfied of a number of conditions. Importantly, the Attorney-General must be satisfied that the person may alert another person involved in a terrorism offence of the investigation, or the person may fail to appear before the prescribed authority, or the person may alter or destroy a record or thing that they may be requested to produce. Without this provision, terrorists could be warned before they are caught, planned acts of terrorism known to ASIO could be rescheduled rather than prevented, and valuable evidence could be destroyed.</para><para>If the warrant concerns a person between the ages of 14 and 18, the Attorney-General must also be satisfied that it is likely that the person will commit, is committing or has committed a terrorism offence.</para><para>An `issuing authority' will either be a federal magistrate, a federal judge or another authority set out in regulations. In the extraordinary situation of a warrant resulting in a person being detained for more than 96 consecutive hours, only a federal judge or another authority specified in regulations can be the issuing authority. An `issuing authority' may only issue a warrant if it has been requested in accordance with the proper procedure and it is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the warrant will substantially assist the collection of intelligence that is important to a terrorism offence.</para><para>A warrant issued under the bill will require a person to appear before a `prescribed authority' to provide information or produce documents or things. A prescribed authority will either be a person who has previously been a judge of the High Court, Federal Court, Family Court, Supreme or District Court of a state or territory. If there are insufficient people in this category, the Attorney-General may appoint a person currently serving as a judge in a state or territory Supreme Court or District Court, or, as a final choice, the president or deputy president of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</para><para>The warrant may request that a person appear at a particular time or order the person to be taken into custody to be brought before the prescribed authority. If a person is to be taken into custody immediately and detained, this will be the responsibility of the police, normally the Australian Federal Police.</para><para>In some situations, a person with highly relevant information may refuse to volunteer it. For example, a terrorist sympathiser who may know of a planned bombing of a busy building, but who will not actually take part in the bombing, may decline to help authorities prevent the attack.</para><para>In order for the new powers to be effective, penalties must apply to those who fail to answer questions accurately or produce documents or other requested things. The maximum penalty for the offences will be five years imprisonment.</para><para>A person will not be able to decline to give information or produce a document or thing on the ground that to do so would tend to incriminate them. However, evidence obtained as a result of the questioning will only be admissible in relation to charges related to non-compliance with a warrant issued under the bill.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Safeguards</inline></para><para>The bill contains a number of safeguards to ensure that ASIO's powers are exercised reasonably and that a person is treated fairly whilst in custody or detention. Questioning of a person under a warrant will always take place before a prescribed authority.</para><para>When a person first appears before the prescribed authority for questioning under the warrant, the prescribed authority must explain what the warrant authorises ASIO to do, the period the warrant is to be in force and the possibility of facing criminal sanctions if the person does not cooperate. It must also advise the person that they have the right to seek a remedy from a federal court in relation to the warrant or their treatment under the warrant and this information must be provided when the person first appears before the prescribed authority and at least once in every 24-hour period subsequently. A prescribed authority may also give directions under the warrant regarding the detention of the person, including permitting the person to contact another person. The directions must be consistent with the warrant and any changes to the warrant approved by the minister in writing.</para><para>The bill includes a special regime for questioning young people. Warrants cannot be issued in relation to a person who is under the age of 14. A warrant may be issued in relation to young people between the ages of 14 and 18 only if the Attorney-General is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the person will commit, is committing or has committed a terrorism offence. Access to a lawyer cannot be delayed for young people. And young people questioned under a warrant will have the right to contact a security cleared lawyer and to have a parent, guardian or other representative present at all times.</para><para>All persons detained under a warrant will have the right to contact an `approved lawyer'. All warrants authorising the taking of a person into custody and detaining them must provide that the person may access an approved lawyer. An `approved lawyer' will be a legal practitioner of at least five years experience who has been approved by the Attorney-General after undergoing a security clearance.</para><para>In exceptional circumstances, access to an approved lawyer may be delayed for up to 48 hours. In order to delay access to an approved lawyer, the Attorney-General must be satisfied that it is likely that a terrorism offence is being or is about to be committed and may have serious consequences. However, after 48 hours, all persons will have the absolute right to contact an approved lawyer.</para><para>A person subject to a warrant has a right to complain to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS) in relation to ASIO, and to the Commonwealth Ombudsman in relation to the Australian Federal Police. The IGIS will be empowered to advise the prescribed authority of any concerns he or she may have about the legality or propriety of ASIO's actions. The prescribed authority may direct that the questioning be suspended until it is satisfied that the IGIS's concerns have been addressed.</para><para>The person must also be treated with humanity and with respect for human dignity, and must not be subjected to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, by anyone exercising authority under the warrant or implementing or enforcing a direction of the prescribed authority. In addition, the Director-General must ensure that video recordings are made of a person's appearance before a prescribed authority for questioning and any matter or thing that the prescribed authority directs to be recorded. There are significant penalties for officers who do not follow the stringent processes and safeguards in the bill.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Additional safeguards</inline></para><para>During debate on a previous version of the bill, the government moved a number of amendments to the bill that added to the already extensive safeguards contained in the bill.</para><para>The bill now clarifies that an ordinary or frisk search of a person must, if practicable, be conducted by a person of the same sex.</para><para>Significant amendments were made to the `prescribed authority' provisions. For example, the bill now explicitly requires the prescribed authority to explain the warrant to the person being questioned, outline that person's rights, and explain the role of the prescribed authority and the role of every other person present during the questioning.</para><para>There are new safeguards to ensure that an interpreter must be provided at the request of the person being questioned. The interpreter will also be provided at the request of the prescribed authority.</para><para>The bill now requires that there be a written statement of procedures which must be followed in the exercise of authority under a warrant. And no action can be taken under a warrant until these procedures have been adopted in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. If these procedures are contravened, a person will have the right to lodge a complaint with the Inspector-General or the Commonwealth Ombudsman.</para><para>The bill includes important measures to ensure transparency and accountability in relation to the exercise of powers under a warrant.</para><para>ASIO's unclassified annual report must include a statement of the total number of requests made to the Attorney-General and to issuing authorities for warrants during the year and the actual number of warrants issued during the year. The annual report must also include the number of warrants issued during the year that require a person to appear before a prescribed authority and the number of warrants issued that authorised a person to be detained. And ASIO will now be required to publish (in the organisation's unclassified report to parliament) statistics including the number of hours each person appeared before a prescribed authority for questioning under a warrant. </para><para>The Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Directorate will be asked to review the new provisions and provide a report on their operation.</para><para>The government is mindful of the need for strong laws to protect our national security, yet preserve individual rights. The bill achieves those aims. The bill was not created on a whim but in response to identified needs. Australia's profile as a terrorist target has risen and we remain on a heightened security alert. In November 2002, the government issued a security alert in response to credible information of a possible terrorist attack in Australia at some time in the months following November.</para><para>Terrorism is not like ordinary crime. The way terrorist networks are organised and the destruction that acts of terrorism cause, distinguish terrorism from other types of crime. The Howard government takes very seriously its responsibility to do everything it can to protect Australians and Australian interests against the threat of terrorism. That is why this bill was developed. That is why the government has cooperated as far as is possible in ensuring the legislation addresses legitimate concerns without making the bill unworkable. That is why the government pursued discussions with the opposition for months in order to find a way to negotiate passage of the bill. </para><para>This bill is a decisive, yet measured response to the new security environment.</para><para>When the bill is enacted, we will have appropriate laws to protect the community from terrorism while ensuring that the rights of individuals are not unnecessarily impeded. I call on the opposition to support this vital legislation and not delay its passage any longer. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Melham</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>13175</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report No. 33 of 2002-03</title><page.no>13175</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I present the Auditor-General's audit report No. 33 of 2002-03 entitled <inline font-style="italic">Performance audit—Management of e-Business in the Department of Education, Science and Training</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para></interjection></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PAPERS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>13175</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>13175</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the House</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— Papers are tabled as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members.

We anticipated that the previous debate would last much longer and take us out to about five o'clock. In the event, it did not. The five minutes gives me an opportunity briefly to deal with the introduction of the legislation that the Attorney-General has just placed in the House on the amended powers of ASIO. Of course, I fully realise that, under the standing orders, I am not allowed to canvass the detail of that bill, as that would be anticipating debate. Just as that is not permitted in question time, neither is it permitted in the adjournment debate. However, there are certain features of this issue that stand outside the bill and go to the handling of the bill. Under the standing orders, they may be considered.</para></talk.start><para>There has been a deal of reportage about the motivations associated with the government's intention to reintroduce the bill now. I do not want to go into that or speculate about whether it is a piece of double dissolution legislation. What I want to do is correct some of the historical record associated with it. A bill to give ASIO these powers passed the Senate last year, with different but nevertheless workable provisions that ensured the protection of civil rights. At the same time, it ensured that ASIO ended up with powers greater than those of the FBI—that of course being a body which faces in its day-to-day duties even more serious threats to national security via terrorist activity than we do ourselves. The bill that passed the Senate at that time would have seen ASIO emerge with powers well beyond those of the American FBI. I, for one, regard it as a tragedy that the bill was not accepted at that time.</para><para>I emphasise that to emphasise the fact that the opposition does not oppose in principle the extension of additional powers to ASIO in these troubled times. We support it. Indeed, when I was Leader of the Opposition, we called for it. The opposition approaches this particular legislation not from the point of view of obstructionism but from the point of view of wanting to get the balance right. Having had discussions with the various opposition spokespersons who are directly responsible for the opposition's handling of this piece of legislation, I know that that remains the case. I think it is important that, when this legislation finally passes the parliament, it does so in a shape and form that the vast majority of the Australian people can feel comfortable with. That is important for the sense of security of the ordinary Australian citizen. It is also important for the belief that the government is being directed on the basis of not what is there for partisan advantage on security issues but what is there for protection, and ensuring that, in protecting ourselves, we uphold all the principles that make us a worthwhile and democratic nation.</para><para>That is our objective. I hope it will be the objective of the government, too. It is the intention of the opposition negotiators—of whom I am not one—that this bill, which we took a positive approach to previously, will be approached on the same basis again. I note without canvassing them that the government has made some adjustments to that legislation, and that is welcome. We suggested at the time that there were other adjustments that we were prepared to wear ourselves, and those adjustments were not taken up in the negotiations that occurred on that very fraught night, as I recollect it—almost the last night of sitting in the course of last year.</para><para>The opposition supports in principle that extension of the powers of ASIO. We support it in a context that ensures the rights of people who are not suspects. Remember that this legislation refers to people who are not suspects. If you are a suspect of a terrorist act, considerable civil libertarian rights descend upon you. That is the nature of our laws. However, these are folk who are not suspects. Therefore, this is innovative legislation in that regard. In these circumstances we as a parliament ought to be very careful in the way in which we handle this. As I said, the opposition is prepared to negotiate this on a positive basis. I do not want to see reportage of this tomorrow suggesting that we are not prepared to do that or that we were not in the past. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Leukaemia Foundation: World's Greatest Shave for a Cure</title><page.no>13177</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>13177</page.no><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name><name.id>00AKI</name.id><electorate>Dickson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last week, along with more than 140 people in my electorate of Dickson, I joined the ranks that the Leukaemia Foundation calls the bald and the beautiful—in my case, the not so beautiful. Scores of volunteers from all over Australia gave up their time and their hair to raise money for leukaemia research and patient support in the World's Greatest Shave for a Cure. The national target for this event in 2003 is $10 million. I am proud to inform the House that, in Dickson alone, members of the local Leukaemia Foundation branch expect to bank more than $20,000 in Shave for a Cure donations this week. When I last checked, they said the donations were still rolling in.</para></talk.start><para>This achievement is testament to the commitment and generosity of many people. I would like to thank everyone who contributed financially to the campaign, participants nationally, and all the individuals and organisations who gave the $700 to sponsor my shave in conjunction with Councillor Brian Battersby. I would particularly like to take this opportunity to inform the House of some of the personal contributions members of my community made to make this very worthwhile cause a success. These people are all volunteers. They are people who go about their work quietly and who expect no other reward than to know they have helped.</para><para>In particular, I would like to mention the efforts of Kaye and Glen Fox and Margot and Don Perrett from Albany Creek, who were my area's Shave for a Cure coordinators. The task was especially meaningful for the Foxes and Perretts, as both families have lost teenaged children to leukaemia in the past five years. Julia Fox, aged 17, and Tim Perrett, aged 19, passed away only months apart, in late 1997 and early 1998. Despite these tragedies, and because of them, the Foxes and Perretts gave up their time to organise and promote two of the shave events. Their amazing commitment and organisational skills really came to the fore as they coordinated hairdressers, sought sponsors, collected donations and ran a sausage sizzle—all of which were almost a full-time task in itself. I want to thank these people for their amazing work.</para><para>Another astounding local is Strathpine's 89-year-old Mary Crisp, who has a fine record of helping people with leukaemia. Mary's first contribution involved giving blood to a boy with leukaemia during World War II. In the past eight years, Mary has continued to help by making 601 trauma bears and by knitting 500 beanies for people who have lost their hair because of leukaemia and cancer treatments.</para><para>At the other end of the razor, there were many local people—people from businesses and groups who stepped up to shave or colour their hair. I would especially like to recognise the following people: the staff and students at our local schools; Pine Rivers councillors, including Councillor Graeme Ashworth; Dr Rhys Dallimore; Joe Minehan at the Albany Creek Tavern; the staff at Target Brookside; the staff of our northside Quest newspapers; Albany Village Shopping Centre; and Ray White Samford. I also thank Sam Riley, the Leukaemia Foundation's national ambassador, and Adrian Collins, its Queensland CEO. I recently enjoyed a breakfast with both of them at the Albany Creek Tavern, where awareness of this campaign was made known to the local community.</para><para>I also want to say thank you to all the other individuals and organisations who participated. Your work really does make a positive difference to many young lives. The Hanley family in my electorate is proof of this. Lisa and John Hanley are the parents of a six-year-old named Jackson, who is living with leukaemia. Jackson was diagnosed with the disease when he was just two years old. At that age, he was facing a disease that one in three young people do not survive, but, thanks to the love and support of his family—as well as medical advancements made possible by the work of the Leukaemia Foundation and other groups—Jackson is now in remission. He is attending year 2 at school and spending time with his little brother Maclean. His mother Lisa had her own shoulder-length hair shaved off last week so other families could benefit from the same support and education which the Leukaemia Foundation gave her family.</para><para>These examples are just a few amongst the hundreds of people in Dickson who gave their time, money and effort for this important cause in the past weeks. Since becoming a representative of these people, I continue to be astounded by the sheer effort and commitment they regularly make to help others, and today I want to thank them. Theirs is a giving spirit which, in its sincerity, will bring hope and help to many young lives. Thank you to all for your efforts.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Leongatha Secondary College: Petition</title><page.no>13178</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>13178</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last week I went to the Leongatha Secondary College and spoke to a number of outstanding students in relation to a number of different things—how laws are made, current issues in political life and a number of different local issues which they wanted to speak to me about. However, the big issue they wanted to talk to me about was Australia's participation in a war with Iraq. I gave those students a commitment when we spoke, and I am going to honour that commitment now by mentioning the views of those students in the federal parliament today. The students took the time to write a letter to me and organise a petition which was signed by teachers and students at the school.

Since the 11th September 2001, there has existed an increased air of uncertainty and international tension, which has escalated as the so-called War on Terror unfolds. Not only have many innocent people died in New York and Washington, but also in Afghanistan and Bali. Were war to be waged on Iraq, even more innocent people would die, for that is the one and only certain result of armed conflict.</para><para>We, as young people and future voters, wholeheartedly disagree with the position that the United States administration has taken on the issue of Iraq, and are ashamed that our government is one of the few supporting the US stance. It is deeply concerning that our Prime Minister and his cabinet, who are elected to represent the majority of Australians, have gone against the overwhelming tide of public opinion in order to satisfy the demands and interests of a foreign power.</para></quote><para>These students at Leongatha Secondary College thought a lot about what they wrote in this letter to me. They are thinking people. They are smart. They were articulate and very aware of what this issue meant for them and our nation. I made them a commitment to make sure their voices were heard in the parliament; today I honour that commitment.</para><para>I will, of course, make the arrangement to have the petition which they organised tabled in the parliament in the usual way. It is signed by hundreds of students and, it seems, a very large proportion of the teachers at Leongatha Secondary College. I would like to thank the college principal, Colin Boyd, for the mature way in which he handled the requests from the students as to how to best articulate their concerns about the war. They wanted to get advice from him as a respected person in their lives. He advised them to organise a petition and to raise it with me as their local federal MP. That is good advice. Today, in the parliament, the voices of those students at Leongatha Secondary College have been heard.</para><para>In the little time that I have left, I want to talk about the spirit of Leongatha Secondary College, which is one in which people are treated with respect. The students there are not treated like babies. They are mature, sensible young people, and they were able to organise a large group of students to come and see me. They were not required to be there but volunteered and wanted to be there. They had views to express and wanted to articulate their opinions to me. That is exactly the type of spirit that we want to see in schools and exactly the type of spirit that we want to engender in our young people. The people who presented the petition to me were Tom Quinn, Joanna O'Reilly, Conal Thwaite and Tully Fletcher—all outstanding young people in the Leongatha district and, I am sure, future leaders in their own right.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

We mouth platitudes but, when it comes to actually doing something about this issue, we seem to be missing in action. The issue I am referring to is the treatment of our veterans when they return. I speak with some authority because my late father was a veteran and my mum, when Dad passed away, was a war widow. It is interesting to note that one of the former ministers for veterans' affairs has wandered in; thank you. The issue is the treatment of veterans and how difficult it is for many veterans to access what I consider to be their due entitlements through DVA. These veterans have served in countries far away. They have left their families, they have put themselves under enormous pressure, they have seen their friends and cobbers killed and, in many cases, they have been POWs and gone through horrific experiences. When they come back, they have to go through the Veterans' Entitlements Act and all its complications. To my mind, we say one thing and we do the other.</para></talk.start><para><inline>A</inline> gold card, to my mind, is an entitlement. If you have a medical problem or a mental health problem, DVA should look after you. There should be no questions asked; it should be taken for granted. But we have a situation now in my electorate—and, I know, in many electorates around Australia—where veterans go to the doctor and doctors are saying, `Look, I'm sorry, but I don't accept your gold card. I'm having this philosophical, ideological argument with the government about my due entitlements as a GP. I'm sorry, but you're going to have to make a co-payment.' I think it is bloody disgraceful; I really do. Most of these people are well into their 80s. They have done the hard yards. They have sacrificed many things for our country. As I said, we mouth platitudes as we send them off to war today but, when they come home, they are really pushing it up the proverbial hill. Let us sort out all this philosophical BS between the government and the AMA so that our diggers and our war widows do get their entitlements and these people can live in peace and harmony for the rest of their lives.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Ovarian Cancer</title><page.no>13180</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>13180</page.no><name role="metadata">Draper, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DRAPER</name><name.id>0L6</name.id><electorate>Makin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Can I say to the member for Franklin, a dear colleague of mine, that we could not agree more with what he said in his statement today. However, as chairman of the health and ageing committee, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss ovarian cancer. According to the Cancer Council of South Australia, ovarian cancer was the eighth most common cancer among women in my home state in 2000. It was the fifth most common cause of cancer death amongst women. These facts highlight the need for all women to consult their doctors should they experience any of the symptoms of ovarian cancer. This warning has been issued by the Australian Divisions of General Practice Chairman, Dr Rob Walters, during Ovarian Cancer Week 2003.</para></talk.start><para>According to Dr Walters, ovarian cancer affects about one in 70 Australian women. Early detection and treatment of the disease is estimated to provide a 90 per cent chance of surviving past five years, but the problem is that most of the 1,200 Australian women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year have for too long avoided consulting their doctor. Having reached the advanced stage of the disease, many, sadly, do not survive longer than five years past diagnosis. Last year, the federal health minister, Senator the Hon. Kay Patterson, released a report by the National Breast Cancer Centre incorporating the Ovarian Cancer Program, <inline font-style="italic">Ovarian cancer in Australian women</inline>, which marked the first time that Australia-wide data had been collected to enable the development of a coordinated approach to improve the early detection of ovarian cancer.</para><para>The federal government announced funding of $500,000 in September 2001 for a two-year program to improve ovarian cancer control, some of which was used to establish the Ovarian Cancer Program. The report found that ovarian cancer, unlike some cancers in women, generally has a more favourable outlook for younger women. The report's author, Dr Anne Kricker, said the five-year relative survival rate after diagnosis of ovarian cancer is 42 per cent. According to Dr Kricker, about 20 per cent of women with ovarian cancer are under 50 years of age, but survival at these stages is better than in older women. On World Cancer Day this year the minister reaffirmed the Commonwealth government's longstanding commitment to cancer control, which has led to a reduction in the numbers of deaths from all cancer types by an average of 1.9 per cent for the past 10 years.</para><para>I urge all Australian women to be aware of the possible symptoms and to seek medical advice should they experience any of them. The symptoms can include pelvic or abdominal pain or discomfort, swelling in the abdomen and unexplained weight gain or weight loss with appetite loss, bloating, feeling tired and suffering back ache and cramps, vague but persistent gastrointestinal upsets, and bladder or other urinary problems. For their own peace of mind and wellbeing, it is far better for women who suffer any of these symptoms to see their doctor immediately. It may not be cancer but, if it is, by early detection and treatment they have a much greater chance of survival.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Celebrity</title><page.no>13181</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>13181</page.no><name role="metadata">Sawford, Rod, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SAWFORD</name><name.id>3J4</name.id><electorate>Port Adelaide</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The cult of celebrity seems to be an increasing obsession in this country. That it is accompanied by an increasing disrespect for the nation's institutions, no matter what they are, is of considerable concern. It certainly is not a great indicator of the future if we take notice of our history. One particular era to take note of is the period leading up to the Great Depression, the fall of the League of Nations and the Second World War. Don Bradman and Phar Lap dominated the headlines of the day. One, of course, was the greatest cricketer in Australia—maybe the greatest in the world—and the other was a champion big red racehorse, but neither was great in the real sense of the word.</para></talk.start><para>Greatness implies a creative and independent mind, the ability to challenge and take risks and the ability to follow through an idea and a process to a coherent outcome. That sort of greatness now, more often than not, escapes political parties, escapes business, escapes the public service, escapes the media. As a nation, we seem more concerned with the celebrities of sport, film, television and media. Yet few, if any, of these people reflect greatness. The truly great are too often anonymous in their own country. In any discussion on so-called celebrities I am reminded of what the philosopher Brecht said: `Unhappy is the land that needs heroes.' I have always had difficulty with that profound statement. My head tells me that Brecht is probably correct; my heart does not want to believe it—particularly when I am cheering for my favourite football team, the Port Power, who will win the AFL this year. But the prominence given to celebrities is a symptom of the increasing powerlessness and isolation of ordinary people. Do people like film, sport, media and television celebrities to be famous because they can convince themselves they help these people become what they are? As the tall poppy syndrome has shown in this country, they can either keep them there or they can topple them into obscurity.</para><para>What has occurred after the observation of the mass rallies for reconciliation and no war against Iraq? It is too early to make judgments about the Iraq mass rallies, but what about the march for reconciliation? It has, and has for a long time, disappeared from the national agenda. Do people actually mimic the celebrity world they admire and, like so many celebrities, live only for the moment? Remember those lines in the Hal David song:</para><quote><para>What's it all about, Alfie?</para><para>Is it just for the moment we live?</para></quote><para>Is greatness out of sight and mind for too many people? Is analysis so devoid in our newspapers? Have the big ideas and the will to achieve them gone missing in this country? They certainly have under the Howard-Costello government. No-one wants to talk about the vision thing. I wonder if the trifecta from Queensland might talk about it. The big ideas about basics—water, education, health, shelter and transport—are still required in this country. I know the member for Hinkler has a strong passion for transport and education. The big pity is the absence of great people in the government to achieve them. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Queensland: Regional Racing</title><page.no>13182</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>13182</page.no><name role="metadata">Entsch, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ENTSCH</name><name.id>7K6</name.id><electorate>Leichhardt</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last weekend the Queensland Minister for Tourism and Racing, by accepting a decision from her quango, the Queensland Racing Board, ripped the guts out of country racing. After a decision that was handed down, country races in Georgetown, Cooktown and Laura are no more. Cooktown has 108 years of racing history and Laura has 106 years. That is now finished; this year will be the last. Cairns has dropped from 36 race meetings to 12 and from 216 races over those 12 meetings to 63. Why are they doing it? They are doing it so that they can make sure they can maximise their profits through Sky television and UNiTAB—to hell with the state and to hell with the social and cultural benefits in those communities. They want to maximise their profits in Brisbane, bolster them in the south-east corner and destroy the small communities. It is an absolute disgrace that Minister Merri Rose has allowed this to perpetuate. What is even more unfortunate is that there are four Labor members of parliament in my electorate, and not one of them has opened their mouth and raised the issue of the impact of this. About $10 million is going to be lost in our northern communities through the destruction of these races, while they are going to build another footbridge in Brisbane. It is absolutely disgraceful.</para></talk.start><para>What do they need for Laura, Georgetown and Cooktown to continue to operate their once-a-year races? About $100,000 a year. That is all they need. But, no, they rip the guts out of them, take it all to Brisbane and say, `If you want to watch it, watch it on TV and bet through our local TAB.' I am calling on the minister to get a bit of guts, to get out there and have a go and to give these communities back what they deserve. The social and cultural aspects have to be taken into consideration rather than just the economic situation in South-East Queensland. If the minister is not prepared to stand up and do it now, I remind her that there is an election in Queensland very shortly. If she thinks she can dig a hole and bury this, she has another think coming. I can tell you now that people in Far North Queensland have had a gutful of this sort of incompetence. They have had a gutful of the lack of representation from their local state Labor members who are not prepared to stand up and challenge this.

There is a beautiful little township up there called Noojee, which has a population of about 200 people. It is an area that has been traditionally associated with the timber industry and which is increasingly associated with tourism and recreation, B&amp;Bs and those types of activities. They have a wonderful school there, the Noojee Primary School, which I have visited on several occasions. That school is lucky to have a great leader in Ron Gilchrist, the principal. This year they have had an increase in enrolments and they now have 26 kids at the school. Noojee is a great place. It is a place with a strong community and it is a place with enormous potential. The biggest thing holding it back at the moment is that it has no mobile phone coverage and no free-to-air television coverage. You cannot use a GSM telephone, you cannot use a CDMA telephone and you cannot get free-to-air television. If you can afford pay TV, you can only get the NSW coverage. In Victoria, we want to get Victorian coverage. </para></talk.start><para>I want to bring to the attention of the House a note that I received from the Noojee Development League in relation to this issue. In her correspondence to me, Jeanette Trottman, who has conducted a survey in the district, makes it clear what the issues are. In her correspondence with me, she said:</para><quote><para>No-one past the pub is able to get free-to-air TV and Austar is too expensive for a lot of people especially pensioners, it also shows the NSW news and weather and state-based shows such as Landline, again the NSW version is shown. No young person these days seems to be without a mobile telephone SMSing constantly, living in Noojee they feel out of the loop, not having mobile reception makes it harder for people setting up businesses etc to think of Noojee as an alternative.</para></quote><para>It is time that the federal government made a commitment to Noojee to do something to deal seriously with this issue the town confronts. It is not good enough in the 21st century for a town to have absolutely no services when it comes to GSM, CDMA and free-to-air television and for even the pay TV to be not a Victorian version but a New South Wales version. The finger pointing needs to stop. The federal government needs to commit to this small township in need of this support and to get on with the job of getting these important services to the district. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Queensland: Regional Racing</title><title>Maranoa Electorate: Rural Transaction Centres</title><page.no>13183</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Maranoa Electorate: Rural Transaction Centres</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>13183</page.no><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</name><name.id>YT4</name.id><electorate>Maranoa</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise firstly to support the member for Leichhardt in his comments in relation to the racing industry right across Queensland, particularly in rural communities, which has had the heart and soul ripped out of it.

I would like to bring to the attention of the Main Committee the many benefits that are flowing from the Liberal and National parties' Rural Transaction Centres initiative. I was recently in the north of my electorate in the town of Rolleston, where we officially opened the new rural transaction centre. Rolleston is a very dynamic, small community—one of many in my electorate—with a population of only 80. You can imagine how many services they have had for generations—virtually none, except for those that have been put there by people from private enterprise. Recently, MIM announced that they are going to open up a new mine in the area. That is an important development. The new coal mine will bring export dollars to Australia and jobs to this region.</para></talk.start></continue><para>With the help of community leaders, who played a vital role in the project, the local council successfully applied for an RTC through our Regional Solutions Program. If the community turnout at the rural transaction centre opening is any means of gauging support then this project has clearly been a resounding success. Whilst at the opening, community members could not speak more highly of this initiative of the federal government in bringing this sort of service into our small country towns. People said it gave them a sense of worth. They asked why, as proud residents of a rural town, they should have to travel to other towns to use the mod cons of today's world. Located in the Rolleston library and the Rolleston post office, this service is providing Rolleston with access to Medicare Easyclaim, ANZ banking services and giroPost. As well, the RTC provides computer, secretarial and photocopying services and rooms for visiting professionals.</para><para>I want to congratulate the Rolleston community on their efforts to improve access to local services. There is no reason why a rural community in this day and age should face barriers when it comes to accessing services when their coast and city counterparts are able to enjoy all the benefits of new age technology. The National and Liberal parties recognise the need to provide services such as Rural Transaction Centres in rural communities both in my electorate and right across the country. We have provided some $70 million over five years to help small communities establish Rural Transaction Centres, and it gives them access to basic private and government services. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 seeks to appropriate moneys from the consolidated revenue fund for the ordinary annual services of government—that is, recurrent services and recurrent expenditure on already established programs. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 seeks the appropriation of moneys from the consolidated revenue fund for purposes other than the ordinary annual services of government—for example, payments to the states and spending on new programs. During this debate, I will be discussing various proposals within both of these bills.</para></talk.start><para>The first point I would like to discuss is the appropriation to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003. It is proposed to appropriate $350 million for Australia's contribution to the International Development Association and Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 also appropriates $108 million for defence spending and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 appropriates an additional $125 million to the Department of Defence. I refer to these particular sections because of the current debate happening in the main chamber as we discuss this here—that is, the debate on the Prime Minister's decision to invade Iraq. I think we need to look at this expenditure and possible other expenditure related to the war on Iraq.</para><para>A couple of weeks ago, the Minister for Foreign Affairs volunteered $10 million to the United Nations emergency appeal. In this context, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> has reported that the cost of the military campaign to Australia will be between $700 million and $900 million. So we are looking at the government paying up to $900 million for the war in Iraq, yet contributing only $10 million to the humanitarian program which will need to be put in place immediately after that conflict ends. Australia is only one of three countries providing military might to the war in Iraq. The United Nations have requested about $300 million for humanitarian aid. Put in this context, the $10 million offered by Australia is just three per cent of the money asked for by the United Nations. Three per cent of the money asked for by the United Nations is going to be provided by Australia, yet we are only one of the three countries involved. We should be providing at least one-third of the funds required by the United Nations for the humanitarian effort.</para><para>In relation to the amount of money required by Defence in Australia for the war in Iraq—as I have said, it has been reported that it could be as much as $900 million—it was reported just yesterday that the President of the United States, George W. Bush, is going to ask the United States Congress for about $168 billion for the US-led invasion of Iraq. That $168 billion could eradicate poverty around the world, institute health programs around the world, institute programs which would allow for the education of children around the world and institute programs which would allow all people around the world access to fresh water—that same $168 billion being provided by the US to invade Iraq. It is an absolute disgrace. America could be a world leader and a friend to the world by applying those kinds of funds to undeveloped and developing countries to assist in their development and prosperity.</para><para>I now refer to another section of the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 where there is $245 million appropriated to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The main part of this appropriation is for drought relief. There is $178.6 million net additional for drought relief. I am pleased to see that the shadow minister is here because I want to relate this to the tragic season of bushfires that Australians have gone through in the last eight months or so. Bushfires and drought go hand in hand. When there is drought it is quickly followed by fires. The fires that we have recently seen in my area, in Canberra and in Victoria are the most tragic fires that this country has ever been through. However, is there anything in these appropriation bills for a bushfire strategy? There is not.</para><para>Mr Gavan O'Connor, the member for Corio and the shadow minister for regional services, territories, local government and tourism, has announced Labor's national bushfire strategy which would establish national plans for preparedness for, response to and recovery from the ravages of bushfire. It would support the establishment of a bushfire cooperative research centre to coordinate Australia's bushfire research effort. It would establish a national pool of up to 11 leased aircraft. It would establish an Australian interagency fire coordination centre with the responsibility for coordinating the leasing and management of national pooled resources, including aircraft, and national standard operating procedures. The shadow minister has said that by establishing a national pool of leased firefighting aircraft we will be able to provide our firefighters with access to a range of modern firefighting technology that would be beyond the resources of any one state to provide. He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>A fire co-ordination centre will make better and timelier use of fire-fighting resources, including aircraft. Our fire-fighting methods, equipment and protocols will be better co-ordinated.</para></quote><para>As I said, the government has done nothing to address the issues of bushfires in this country. It needs a national approach and only Labor will be able to provide that national approach. As we have seen in these appropriation bills, there has been nothing to address the threat of bushfires in our country.</para><para>I go on to Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003 which provides $23 million for the meningococcal immunisation program. This appropriation is welcomed by the Labor Party and the Meningococcal Association of Australia. Meningitis is an infection of the fluid of a person's spinal cord and the fluid that surrounds the brain. People sometimes refer to it as spinal meningitis. It is usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection and knowing whether meningitis is caused by a virus or a bacterium is important because of the severity of illness and the differing treatment options. Viral meningitis is generally less severe and resolves without specific treatment while bacterial meningitis can be severe and may result in brain damage, hearing loss or learning disability. For bacterial meningitis it is important to know which type of bacteria is causing the meningitis, because antibiotics can prevent some types from spreading and infecting other people.</para><para>I refer to this because my constituent Allan Brown has accepted the role of ambassador for the Meningococcal Association of Australia and of assisting in any way towards a better educated Australia with a view to reducing the incidence of meningococcal disease. The Meningococcal Association is a voluntary one with just three objectives: to work towards a better informed Australia and, as such, create a better awareness of meningococcal disease and its symptoms; to work to assist those whose lives have been affected by the disease; and to promote a greater emphasis on vaccinations and attention to research.</para><para>Allan's grand-daughter Cassy survived meningococcal disease but will require special medical attention for several years. The General Manager of the Meningococcal Association, Mr Joe MacManamon said:</para><quote><para>When I first met little Cassy and her mum I was impressed by their spirit of determination. Cassy realises she is fortunate to have survived one of the most awful diseases on planet earth. Her mum, Donna, is just so very happy that her daughter is alive and for at least the next 4-10 years she is happy to take Cassy to Sydney for the treatment which she hopes will restore permanent mobility to her legs.</para></quote><para>I am pleased to say that after some charity events in Newcastle one of the local car dealerships gave Cassy and her mum a vehicle so that they could travel backwards and forwards to Sydney for that treatment. They were finding it very difficult since they had an old car and did not have the resources to purchase a new vehicle. So I congratulate the local community for coming to the assistance of Cassy and her family. I also congratulate Allan on his commitment to the Meningococcal Association and to the cause, and I wish him well and offer him every support in his future endeavours.</para><para>I turn now to Labor's amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer on 3 March in the House of Representatives. That amendment has, as the House knows, three parts, and I would particularly like to refer to point (2) of the amendment where the shadow Treasurer states that the House condemns the government for its failures in economic management—in particular, its failings in relation to both income and expenditure policies. Point (2) says:</para><para>(2)	it has failed to deliver on its basic responsibilities to the Australian people, for example:</para><para>(a)	bulk billing has collapsed;</para><para>(b)	there is chronic under-investment in our public schools, TAFE colleges and universities;</para><para>(c)	the struggle to balance work and family life continues to get harder; and</para><para>(d)	entry level housing is becoming even less affordable for struggling Australian families; and</para><para>Australian families owe nearly $600 million to the government in family tax benefit debts, and over 670,000 families owe an average debt of $850. Along with, I am sure, everybody else in the House of Representatives, I have had much correspondence and much contact with many constituents who have been affected by this disastrous policy. This one letter to me demonstrates the enormous pressure that families are experiencing in our communities in relation to the family tax benefit debts. My constituent writes:</para><quote><para>Dear Kelly Hoare,</para><para>Please find correspondence enclosed from Centrelink regarding our Family Tax Bill. This is the first time we have ever received a bill such as this, we find it very hard to understand how we could find ourselves in such a situation as this. Why haven't we in past years been found to be receiving excess payments? It is a startling fact to have to repay $2821.45 so unexpectantly, and we feel that the system must be flawed somewhere.</para></quote><para>She is certainly right there. She goes on:</para><quote><para>We understand that if we owe the money then we must pay it back, which we have made arrangement to do so. We realise there is not much you can do about government policy but we would like you to protest on our behalf the stupidity of the system.</para></quote><para>As I said, that reflects the situation that many of my constituents find themselves in.</para><para>In relation to families being under pressure even further, the rate of bulk-billing by general practitioners has decreased by 11 percentage points over the last seven years, with only 69.6 per cent of GP services now being bulk-billed. More than 10 million fewer GP services were bulk-billed this year compared with when John Howard came to office, and the average out-of-pocket cost to see a doctor who does not bulk-bill is now $12.78, up 55 per cent since the Howard government came to office in 1996. It is another area about which I have been contacted by many people in relation not only to the decline in bulk-billing services and the increase in the costs of visiting a doctor but also to the shortage of doctors in regional areas. I have here an example which demonstrates the widespread problem that is experienced by my constituents. This man wrote to me:</para><quote><para>Dear Kelly,</para><para>I have enclosed a couple of Medicare receipts for your records. You will notice that my Doctor has given her self a pay increase....</para><para>My Doctor does not bulk bill all pensioners, they closed their books to new pensioners some years back.</para><para>...				...				...</para><para>These new fees will mean that the wife and me will get a 68 percent rebate for Medicare, which would put us back to the pre Whitlam era.</para><para>Of course, people say, “go to a doctor that bulk bills.” But Doctors are not a homogenous product. In my case the Doctor has a case study of 12 years of an on going chronic complaint, which several other Doctors missed diagnosed.</para><para>It is about time the government increased the rebate to pensioners that are not bulked billed. The money could come from those 50000 dollar a year Income pensioners who pushed out low-income aged pensioners like me.</para></quote><para>That reflects a general feeling of dissatisfaction right across our community. Another area where families are under pressure is in the area of child care. Up to 30,000 children are unable to get a child-care place out of school hours. This government is spending $800 less per child-care place than it spent seven years ago. Just last week I received an email from another constituent, a working mum in my area. She said:</para><quote><para>Dear Kelly Hoare MP,</para><para>I am writing to you as my Federal MP regarding the lack of child care places available for under 2 years of age children in our area.</para><para>I need help. I have a four month old baby and due to financial reasons have had to return to work. I cannot find any child care in Newcastle or the Hunter for my baby. I have called 26 child care centres in the area and all have a waiting list of approximately 2 years. I am relying on her grandmother at the moment but this arrangement cannot last long due to various reasons.</para><para>If I do not find child care soon I will need to leave my job which I do not want to do.</para></quote><para>...					...					...</para><para>This email highlights the pressure that families are being placed under. None of that pressure is being relieved by these appropriation bills; it should be relieved in the next lot of appropriation bills from this government, which will be brought down by the Treasurer in May. We demand that some of this pressure is lifted. We demand that the financial pressure on the families that we represent is lifted. We will be continuing to apply pressure on the government to do that. If it does not do it then it will reap the consequences at the next election, when all our constituents who have suffered under the past seven years will throw the government out.</para><para>In conclusion, I would like to refer again to the shadow minister's amendment which starts: `Whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading ...'. We have had many requests to oppose these appropriations to force the sacking of this government. We appreciate the view that there may be some legitimacy in repeating the actions of Malcolm Fraser in 1975 when he manipulated the Senate to block supply and force a general election. The actions of Fraser were then, and are now, deplorable. A properly elected government should not be held to ransom by a hostile Senate. However, Labor maintain that there is a need to reform Senate powers. Governments have repeatedly railed against the Senate's power to block government legislation and particularly budgets. During the last election campaign, Labor indicated a willingness to consider limitations on the Senate's capacity to block supply. Labor oppose the use of the Senate to block money bills because of the affront caused to Australia's fundamental democratic core.</para><para>Despite the affront caused to the Australian people by the Howard government, we must uphold the fundamental principles of democracy and fight the government cleanly and await the next election. Appropriation bills such as these, the budget bills that we anticipate seeing in May, the total cost to Australia and the affront to Australian families caused by the Prime Minister's decision to send Australia into a war in Iraq with two other countries—all these issues will be addressed at the next election, whether it be a double dissolution at the end of this year or an election in the full course of time. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>13190</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—These appropriation bills, <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>, afford members the opportunity to canvass issues that are of concern to constituents, particularly those that have wider community implications than the individual concerns of those who raise them. In the context of this debate, I seek to raise several matters of such concern. The first matter relates to the allocation by the federal government of 30 additional beds to the Glenburn Nursing Home in my electorate. I have raised in the parliament on previous occasions the concerns of residents in relation to this particular proposal. It is clear from any cursory examination of the material relating to this development that the 30 extra beds should never have been allocated to the Glenburn facility by the Howard government, nor should the City of Greater Geelong have issued a building permit for the redevelopment and construction of the 30 extra beds at its current location.</para></talk.start><para>With regard to the latter, this multistorey proposal is situated in a heritage precinct in Geelong and, in the view of the Drumcondra heritage group, it is a totally inappropriate redevelopment in a residential area that will compromise the care of residents, impede vehicular access on a busy thoroughfare, destroy the amenity of surrounding properties and pose a clear and present fire danger to clients occupying the facility. What is involved here is the expenditure of public moneys on a private nursing home facility where very significant questions need to be asked about the process by which this particular facility has been granted these 30 additional beds and, in the case of the local government authority, how it obtained the building and planning permits. The point relating to the clear and present fire danger to clients who occupy the facility is one that needs specific consideration by the current minister. Expert evidence has been presented to a VCAT hearing and to the federal government on the danger to residents from a fire accident, and a disaster that would occur in that eventuality is too horrendous to contemplate.</para><para>I raised this matter with Minister Andrews in a letter to him in February, following the death of a resident in an aged care facility in New South Wales as a result of fire, as part of my ongoing communication with him over a substantial period of time on this issue. It is a serious matter because the consequences of not taking action now to stop this redevelopment in the face of the evidence would constitute, in my view, a very serious breach of the duty of care to existing and future aged care residents. It is simply not good enough for the federal government or its administering department to handpass responsibility for this matter to a local government planning authority—in this case, the City of Greater Geelong.</para><para>In the case of the Glenburn Nursing Home, the federal department allocated the extra 30 beds to Cambrai Pty Ltd. Some directors of that company at the time were common to another company named Jadwan Pty Ltd, which operated the Derwent Court Nursing Home in Tasmania and with which the department was involved in litigation over a range of serious matters at that particular time. There are two serious matters relating to the process that ought to be investigated by the federal government and the City of Greater Geelong respectively. The first matter is how the extra beds ever came to be allocated in the first place. The second matter is how this proposal was ever approved in the first instance by the local government authority—and I refer to the City of Greater Geelong.</para><para>With regard to fire safety issues emanating from the proposed development, the matter was addressed in evidence to the VCAT hearing, at which Mr Bob Barry from the CFA outlined in detail the potential human disaster that could occur in certain circumstances should this development proceed. This advice should not be ignored by the minister, as this whole redevelopment has a disconcerting smell about it, from the local government processes that led to the issuance of the planning permit in the first place to the federal departmental processes that approved the bids. I urge both levels of government to thoroughly investigate this matter before the redevelopment proceeds and before a potential disaster occurs.</para><para>One of the major components of the federal budget is of course the expenditure on health. In many communities, especially regional communities across Australia, there is a deepening concern at the crisis in the provision of general practitioner services. This is the second issue that I wish to raise in this debate, because in the Geelong community the provision of general practitioner services is in a parlous state. I have received representations on this matter from the G.P. Association of Geelong, and I am indebted to Dr George Golding, the executive director of the aforementioned division of general practice, and his colleagues for their analysis of the current deficiency in the number of GPs in Geelong. I am also indebted to Dr Carl Grace, who has appraised me of the particular problems that he has had in his practice in recruiting suitably qualified doctors within the limitations posed by various government regulations and incentive schemes.</para><para>Put simply, the provision of GP services in Geelong is in crisis. It is estimated that in the region there is a shortage of 15 to 20 doctors. This is not only putting an intolerable burden on existing GPs and their practices; it is affecting the provision of medical services to my constituents. In a letter to the Minister for Health and Ageing on 3 June 2002, Dr Golding outlined succinctly the adverse consequences of this situation. Writing about the shortage, Dr Golding stated:</para><quote><para>This leads to a number of dire consequences:</para></quote><para>·	The increased demand on services particularly after hours for the public hospital Accident and Emergency Department.</para><para>This is a growing problem for our community. As bulk-billing has declined and as pressure has increased on GP practices due to the shortages, we are seeing a substantially increased demand for the services provided by our public hospital accident and emergency department. Dr Golding goes on in his letter to list the other dire consequences:</para><para>·	The increase in waiting times for patients to see GPs.</para><para>·	The closing of GP appointment books for new patients in many areas.</para><para>·	The increasingly heavy workload for GPs with consequences on GP and GP Family Health.</para><para>·	The non-availability of locum doctors to give GPs some respite from the heavy workload.</para><para>·	Time constraints for GPs preventing them from accessing the new MBS item numbers for Enhanced Primary Care and Chronic Disease Initiatives of the Department of Health and Ageing.</para><para>Regrettably, the interpretation of statistics presents a picture of the distorted availability of GPs in our region and other regional areas. I do not propose to canvass the complexities of that statistic analysis here today, but I should mention that the full-time effective equivalent GP-patient ratio in Geelong is the disturbing figure of one to 1,428—well above the desired ratio of one to 1,100.</para><para>The work force implications of this are serious indeed, the most serious being burnout in the existing work force, people waiting two to three days before obtaining non-urgent treatment, and outpatient appointments taking some three months. There are structural changes in this work force that exacerbate local problems. The cultural change among new graduating doctors has meant that many are unprepared to sacrifice productive family life for long hours at their practice. In addition, the increased percentage of females graduating has impacted on that culture in the split made between work and home. It means also that many female doctors are choosing not to go on after-hours rosters, for family and safety reasons. It is a situation that the government has the power to address, and it must do so in the interests of delivering quality primary health care at the GP level.</para><para>Unfortunately, in the program response the government has structured, significant anomalies and inequities are occurring between practices in our region which must be addressed. In the particular case of Dr Carl Grace's practice, Medicaid, which I understand is the last remaining bulk-billing practice in Geelong, Dr Grace has practical difficulties in accessing programs, such as the Approved Medical Deputising Services program and the exemptions that it provides. The barriers are substantial—in many ways, impractical—and are a real stumbling block to the employment of overseas doctors through the scheme, particularly the prohibitive visa requirements for doctors recruited under the scheme. I do acknowledge the attempts by government to address these difficulties, but my plea is for greater flexibility in the administration of the programs and a practical acknowledgment that certain provincial communities are falling between a rock and hard place on these matters.</para><para>The final medical issue relates to a potential crisis in Geelong in the provision of specialist medical services—in particular, obstetrics and gynaecology. It relates to the impact of the medical indemnity crisis on the future structure of the medical work force in these and other specialty areas. That crisis has the potential to trigger a mass retirement of obstetricians across the board as they bring forward their retirement plans in response to this insurance indemnity crisis. Once again, I am indebted to local specialist Dr Glen Baker for his lucid analysis of the Geelong situation and the problems that may arise locally if the matter of future litigation against specialists is not addressed and managed correctly. There are eight specialists in the abovementioned fields in Geelong, and several are seriously contemplating their future in practice as a result of uncertainties created by the failure of the government to announce details of its proposed reform package.</para><para>With the new medical defence insurance system starting on 1 July this year, the known details of the reform package indicate that the system will change from an incident based model to a claims based model, which may mean that doctors are liable for payout after they retire. As doctors who retire before 30 June this year will avoid this situation, many doctors are contemplating retirement before that date. In addition, there has been little information provided on the level of premium increases which, when combined with the possibility of the retirement payouts, has created real uncertainty in the ranks of those specialists. There are general manpower considerations that will impact over the longer term as an overlay to this immediate crisis. There are already problems with recruiting into these specialties and, given that they are relatively underpaid in relation to other specialties and the current medical legal uncertainties, it all adds up to another potential manpower crisis in the ranks of Geelong's medical profession. The local implications of such a deterioration in the provision of obstetrics and gynaecological services will be increased pressure on public services provided by Geelong Hospital and an ever-contracting choice of services for my constituents.</para><para>It is a serious situation and, on the back of these recent representations, I have written to the minister seeking an appointment to present this situation to her. I am disappointed that she is unable to meet with me during this parliamentary session, but I can understand this given the events of this week. I hope that my representations to her, both written and through her advisers, bear some fruit in terms of a solution to this emerging crisis. Doctors are anxious and their clients, my constituents, are feeling the effects of restricted access to, and the choice of, service.</para><para>In the remaining time available, I will turn to an issue that is currently before the parliament and will be the subject of quite significant budgetary allocations in the near future. I refer to the war on Iraq. I note that the war will cost Australia around $1 billion, and I also note that our contribution to the humanitarian effort in the aftermath is currently around $10 million—$1 billion to wage war, and $10 million to pick up the pieces. We are on the verge of a massive humanitarian crisis in Iraq. It is important for all Australians, regardless of their feelings about this particular engagement, to know that their government—however culpable it is for that devastation and humanitarian crisis—will not walk away from the moral imperative to provide adequate resources in the aftermath of the damage that this war will create.</para><para>I note that, after the 1991 conflict, an international study group estimated that some 50,000 to 70,000 children had died in Iraq as a result of that particular engagement. The medical demands in the aftermath of that war were horrendous. That study group has returned to Iraq and indicates that that community is in an even more parlous condition and more vulnerable than it was in the previous gulf engagement to the devastating effects of war. It expects the death toll of children alone to be in the region of 100,000 to 150,000. These are young lives that will be wasted as a result of this illegal action taken by the Australian government in Iraq.</para><para>There is a moral imperative here that has been ignored by the government. The potential humanitarian crisis in Iraq demands that any civilised community walk the extra mile in the cause of peace. No amount of evidence that coalition members on the other side present in relation to the past deeds of Saddam Hussein and the future deeds of that regime will gloss over the fact that staring you in the face is the death of 100,000 to 150,000 children, let alone their innocent parents. The medical and humanitarian crisis will be of such a dimension that we really do not want to contemplate it.</para><para>It is imperative that governments walk the extra mile to seek a peaceful solution and disarmament of this regime in Iraq. To the shame of Australia, we have turned our back on walking the extra mile. We have turned our back on the great humanitarian traditions that have been the hallmark of this country since Federation. We have joined, for the first time, in an aggressive pre-emptive act that will stain the good character of this nation for generations to come. Even though we might in our own communities have medical crises of some moment, we cannot walk away from the medical and humanitarian crisis that we will be responsible for in the aftermath of this engagement in Iraq. The Australian government must face its responsibility for constructing the peace, as it must accept its responsibility for the death and destruction that it will cause through this war.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>13193</page.no><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name><name.id>HH4</name.id><electorate>Scullin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>. One of my concerns about the way public policy is developed in Australia is that too often it is done in such a short-term time frame. Public policy is not developed in a way that is sustainable. It is more of a reaction to the need for instant gratification that is dictated by a culture dependent upon that type of short-term, 10-second grab. I wonder why that should be the case in a place like the Australian parliament. Another aspect of public policy that we seem not to have been able to adapt to and cater for is the fact that Australia is a federation. Too often at the federal level we shy away from a national approach on the basis that something is the business of the states. I believe that these are two of the great challenges: having a longer term vision and having a national vision. Australian governments, of whatever persuasion, need to adopt that view and ensure that it is the practice. Regrettably, I have to say that I do not believe the present government really has this focus.</para></talk.start><para>If we look at some of the areas of public policy that require that longer term thought, we could instance the government's attitude to its involvement in Iraq. It would appear that the decisions around the position that the Australian government has got us into are all about the here and now. There is not the great discussion of what may happen afterwards. The honourable member for Corio has just outlined the sorts of dimensions of potential destruction that may occur. Therefore, shouldn't it be a requirement that a government discusses the way it sees matters proceeding after such destruction or what we will be involved in with the reconstruction of a country so devastated? But we do not hear that. We do not hear the context of this change in the way a world order will operate, with the doctrine of pre-emption allowed to go forward. That is probably why I still sit in great comfort with the position the opposition was trying to achieve: the disarmament of Iraq through the aegis of the United Nations. That was a solution that could have been sustainable. That was a solution that had a longer horizon.</para><para>We can look at other aspects of public policy. There are plenty of examples of domestic policy that have the same requirement. I always remember that throughout the years of the Hawke-Keating governments attempts were made to ensure that the whole of the work force had access to occupational superannuation. I remember, as we came to grips with the complex nature of that piece of public policy, that the decisions that were being made had horizons of outcome that were 10, 20, 30 or even 40 years ahead. Those measures were being put in place for people's whole-of-life employment. Our opponents found it easy to decry the efforts that we were making because there was no immediate benefit—these were things we should not do because there was no immediate benefit. So there is always this thought that things that do not happen within the horizon of the next election are not things that a government should consider. That is wrong. That is arrant nonsense. We have an obligation as governments to look at that longer-term view of what we should be trying to achieve.</para><para>I also make the observation that at the federal level we have a haphazard three-year term. States such as Victoria and New South Wales—New South Wales goes to the polls on Saturday—have four-year terms. The Victorian government was elected on a platform that it would have four-year fixed terms and that it would set the date of an election. The date of the next Victorian state election has already been set, so there is that certainty, and there is a four-year period in which the state government can put in place those things that it wishes to achieve and those things that it presented to the electorate. Whilst the four-year term may not be a perfect period, I think it is a reasonable period to sell to the Australian electorate that we are going about our business in an appropriate way.</para><para>But I am not just talking about a four-year period operating in the same haphazard fashion of the present three-year periods. Why not bite the bullet? Why not have a four-year fixed term? Why not at least have the ability for a government, upon election, to know that it has a four-year period to set in place its agenda for action? Often, as I indicated earlier with the example about superannuation, that agenda for action will go beyond one term. That is appropriate, and governments would have to take that risk, but it is the way in which the debate is carried out that will be important. We would hope that all political forces will see that that longer horizon is important, that it is important for us to have that longer view.</para><para>I mentioned national approaches. Over 100 years ago, under a Constitution that was hobbled together to ensure that the six colonies signed up, there were certain undertakings made about which sphere of government would look after areas of policy. Another aspect that has caught up with us over the last 100 years is that we would have been unaware of some areas of policy that have developed—the notion of having to worry about civil aviation and the notion of having to deal with various forms of communication technology. We have been able to adapt to those types of things, but we still have a problem in important areas of public policy such as education, health and, to a certain extent, the environment. A national approach requires that the federal government sits down with the states and territories to try to come to an agreement. We have to ask ourselves now, as we are well into embarking upon the 21st century: is that an appropriate way for the Commonwealth of Australia to continue to carry out the business of government?</para><para>When we look at the issue of access to a health system, people are not worried about who is footing the bill or whether it is going to be done through a state health system or through the federal health system. In fact, when their taxes are paying for it, does it really matter whether it is done through Commonwealth consolidated revenue or through state coffers? What people want to see is that, when there is a need, that need is catered for. Slowly but surely, we have had to adapt to providing a seamless access to services.</para><para>We got over the hurdle about the cost shifting that might occur when a patient left a public hospital and was to be given pharmaceuticals as part of their ongoing treatment. It was realised by the state institutions that they bore the cost of providing the necessary medicines and drugs to patients on their discharge. They even thought of ways that they could cost shift an amount like that across to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which, of course, was a Commonwealth responsibility. On all occasions, because there was this split system, there were things provided by the state system which did not come within the safety net provisions of our PBS. But we were able to get agreement that we could get around that so that the person was not disadvantaged, that there was not this continuing argy-bargy about who was responsible.</para><para>So we see that, slowly but surely, initiatives were developed. For instance, in my electorate, the Northern Hospital saw that it had a problem because many of those that presented at its accident and emergency centre were really people that required a visit to their general practitioner out of hours. The way that general practice clinics now work—perhaps it is not nine to five, but it could be eight to six or eight to seven—they do not allow for those sorts of after-hours consultations. So the hospital has a problem where, amongst all those people attending for all the emergency reasons, it has a large group of people attending basically because they want to see a doctor. This then compounds waiting times at the accident and emergency centre. Figures given to me show that 29 per cent of presentations at the emergency department of the Northern Hospital in 2001 were, in the technical term, triage 4 and 5. That is defined as `non-urgent patients who could just as easily be treated by a general practitioner'. It is estimated that in 2002 that figure may have increased to over 40 per cent.</para><para>What we saw was that discussion—as I understand it, at ministerial level—led to an agreement that perhaps it was appropriate that an after-hours GP service be provided at the Northern Hospital. In fact, what occurred was that the state government made funding available for a facility. We find that the facility has been built, but now we have continuing discussion about the recurring funding of the facility and who should actually foot the bill. An interesting aside to this is that, as a result of changes after the last state and the last federal elections and a change in ministers, there is some difficulty in getting continuing discussion about the achievement of the proper operation of this facility. But, as I said, that is a small example at a local level of a problem that I suggest is replicated right across the nation; that is, where the Commonwealth government has to come to an agreement with a state government about an approach which, for the person presenting for these services, would mean that they do not have to worry about what sphere of government is actually footing the bill.</para><para>We have other national problems, like the fact that in outer urban areas, such as in the electorate of Scullin, we have a low level of general practitioners to population. We sort of fall through the net: we are not remote or rural enough to get the full benefit of the incentives that are being put in place. However, we still have this problem. This is even though, as I have always said and as I have tried to get across to people, the northern suburbs of Melbourne are just as much a region as other places in Australia. They cannot be considered as just part of the four million strong Melbourne metropolis. These are things that will require an approach that is national in nature but can be achieved at the local level.</para><para>Earlier I mentioned one area where we have had a change in the relationship between governments: the environment. That was due to the external affairs provisions of the Constitution. It was acknowledged that there were other ways in which the Commonwealth government could have influence over decisions that were made at the state and territory levels. We see the continuing dilemmas of salinity and access to water. The general principle of putting in place a proper water rights policy is characterised by differences between the state and territory administrations. We have an example in the Murray-Darling Basin, where there was a need for all the state governments that were part of that catchment to come together and create a body to apply a whole of government approach to the many challenges of that catchment. In the early years of the Murray-Darling and its administration, Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and the Commonwealth were able to come together. However, the upper reaches of the catchment start in Queensland and that state was a latecomer to the process. This meant that there were impediments to a full catchment view of the way to achieve outcomes. Fortunately, that has changed.</para><para>But the challenges are so great that, if there is continuing nitpicking about which administration picks up the tab or which administration is to put in place the proper legislative or regulatory parameters to achieve improvements in the basin, nothing will be achieved. In fact, if we look again at the problems of the Murray-Darling Basin, there is a need for a longer-term view because these are problems that will not be reversed overnight. These problems took many decades to be created and, regrettably, will take many decades to be solved. So there is no use in seeing the horizon as just this budget or the next budget. The horizon has to extend over several decades and must include looking at how we might achieve our goals through different spheres of government coming to agreed positions.</para><para>We as a nation have to look at the way we engage in the different international fora available. We have to look at how best to have a national approach to, for instance, greenhouse gas emissions through engaging in the Kyoto protocol. We should not shy away. You can have an independent position while acknowledging that the best way to achieve outcomes is to sign up to collective international action. The Kyoto protocol is a prime example of how the present government has not been able to get its head around those types of matters. Regrettably, it is another example of how, for too long, we have waited for instructions from the United States administration; the United States administration is again playing the tune to which we dance. It is important to have an acknowledgment that, through the Kyoto protocol, we can achieve goals such as limiting greenhouse gas emissions with the agreement of the business community and the states and territories; and the Commonwealth can show great national leadership. I have spoken about the modernisation of parliament in the 21st century. I think we should also look at modernising our constitutional arrangements and modernising our robust democracy so we can have a longer term and a national view of how Australia as a nation confronts the many challenges before it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>13197</page.no><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr QUICK</name><name.id>AV5</name.id><electorate>Franklin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>. Ten years ago last week, on 13 March 1993, I entered this place. Today I want to use the opportunity in my speech on the appropriation bills to reflect on the 10 years that I have spent in this place. Australia in 2003 is remarkably different from what it was like in 1993. Much has changed in my electorate and yet much has stayed the same. Franklin, the southernmost electorate in Australia, is a diverse electorate consisting of broadacre public housing areas, rural townships and Hobart suburbs on the east and south of the Derwent River. My electorate consists of four municipal regions: Huon, Kingborough, Clarence and Brighton. Each straddles the Derwent River yet each has a totally different make-up.</para></talk.start><para>Tasmania back in 1993 was doing it tough. Population predictions forecast that Tasmania would have approximately 320,000 people in the year 2050. Property values were stagnant, small business saw little hope of expansion and consolidation, and our young people were leaving in droves. Tasmania still has problems to solve if we are to take advantage of the feeling of optimism that is currently sweeping across the whole state. It is great to see this sense of optimism. Tasmania really suffers from its small population, currently 476,000, which is spread across three regions. This is compounded by having a unique electoral system which, in my mind, is stifling Tasmania's development.</para><para>Unlike other states that have single member constituencies, the Hare-Clark system in Tasmania has multiple member electorates with five members in each of the five federal electorates. Traditionally this has led governments of both political persuasions to focus a disproportionate amount of state and Commonwealth moneys on the three northern electorates of Bass, Braddon and northern Lyons in an attempt to win seats. This political pork-barrelling has seen the duplication of infrastructure unheard of and unseen anywhere else in Australia in a similar population base. There are three university campuses, seven ports, four airports and two world-class cricket and football stadiums for 476,000 people. It is ridiculous. This is a stupid waste of money and has contributed to Tasmanian governments of all persuasions being unable to ensure real equity and adequate service provision in all departmental areas, especially in health, housing, education and employment.</para><para>We need a better working relationship between state and federal governments and a realistic nonpolitical spending program. That would, in my mind, see a far more responsive and effective service provision for all Tasmanians. Tasmania, because of its widespread population, requires really innovative approaches to adequately address its problems and alleviate its difficulties. I say that because, in the 10 years that I have been a federal member, the greatest impact on me has been the impact that state and Commonwealth governments in their decision making have had on families. I have 38,000 households in my electorate, which is a lot less than in most electorates in Australia. Over the last 10 years the pressure on families has been enormous. Our wages are less and our employment options are a lot less than anywhere else in Australia. In the 10 years that I have been a federal member, middle management has virtually disappeared from Tasmania in insurance, banking, multinational organisations and Commonwealth government agencies. They have all gone to Melbourne and Sydney. We do not have state managers of Telstra like we used to, or state managers of Qantas and the like—the decision makers are going.</para><para>What impact does this have on our young people who wish to get a degree and become middle managers in their later lives? They have realised that in order to succeed you need to leave Tasmania—perhaps do your years 11 and 12 on the mainland or go to university in Melbourne and Sydney and get on the same rung as all the other young aspiring middle managers. So they are leaving and they are not coming back. I have two daughters, both of whom were educated in universities in Melbourne. One is now in London and the other is in Melbourne. I do not think they will come back. The opportunities are not there, nor is the earning capacity. Sarah is 24 and she is earning $65,000 a year as an editor in a publishing company—money unheard of in Tasmanian terms, where you would not achieve that wage until you were 45. We need to look at options. This is putting pressure on families. In my family alone, we have suddenly lost our two kids. Are they ever coming back?</para><para>This pressure by state and Commonwealth governments—but more especially by the Commonwealth government—is resulting in less cohesion in families. Our community focus is starting to have gaps in it. There is a sense that families are now on their own. Who is your neighbour? I remember settling in my suburb back in 1977 after I returned from working as a teacher in South Australia. In my whole suburban area there are only two families still there out of the hundreds that were there in 1977. We do not know who our neighbours are. This pressure to survive has been increasing on our families in the last 10 years. Families are now appearing to sense that they are powerless and easily manipulated. These fears are starting to permeate through families, who are worried about what other races and creeds are doing in our society. There is a fear of being burgled and of being threatened. We fortify our houses. I am sad to say that our state governments perpetuate this at election times. I have seen some of these TV commercials on prime time television, where we see handcuffs and promises to be tough on crime. Ever since I have been involved in teaching and politics I have been preaching about early intervention. We talk about and espouse the strengthening of families, usually at election time—lower class sizes, more support for families and for communities—then the elections disappear and the promises are not kept.</para><para>I have spoken about pressures on families, such as the 1,000 families in my electorate that cannot access child care. There are enormous waiting lists in my electorate. I have mothers and fathers ring up and say: `Coles have offered me some extra hours. I am desperate for the money. What am I going to do? I cannot get any child care. I need a couple of hours here and a couple of hours there. I need my child cared for after school. Can you help me?' As I said, there are 1,000 families in my electorate that cannot do it. They have to come up with other options—second-class options—that are putting pressure on them. There is a sense of guilt with mum working a couple of hours at Coles or Woolworths, wondering who is looking after the kids and whether they are safe. We used to call them latchkey kids back in the seventies when we had the early disadvantage program. There is this sense of guilt. It stymies parents' job options and it places them in really invidious situations. Because of our low population of 476,000 the big money players in child care do not come down to our state. They are not interested because you cannot make a buck. So we have community based child-care centres, and they are under enormous pressure to provide places for these 1,000 families that want their children to have access to child care. But where is the money? As I said, the big money is not in Tasmania so we do not have the capacity to open new child-care centres. </para><para>There is pressure on families when they want to go to the doctor. I am appalled that in Tasmania we have some of the lowest GP bulk-billing rates in Australia. Michelle O'Byrne in the seat of Bass is, I think, down to about 52 or 54. I have 56, and I have swathes of broadacre public housing areas. It is appalling. I have lots of rural areas. Trying to get a GP is virtually impossible. The only ones we get, for a very short time, are the foreign doctors, and we have a real hassle to keep those. If your kid gets sick in the country you are expected to go up to Hobart. I have private health insurance and yet, a couple of months ago when I thought I had broken my arm, I went to my private hospital and I could not believe it: `I'm sorry, Mr Quick, we have a facilitation fee before we see you, even though you have private health insurance.' That facilitation fee is $150. I managed to pay it on the plastic, but I thought of the low-income families in my electorate—and, as I said, our wages in Tasmania are a lot lower than anywhere else in Australia. Imagine families on low incomes if the little bloke breaks his arm or they think he has hurt himself and they rush him to the private hospital because there is a two- or three-hour wait at the  public hospital. They front up at the private hospital to hear: `I'm sorry, Mr Evans, we need a $150 facilitation fee before we look after your child.' It is another pressure on families.</para><para>There is the issue of housing in Tasmania. We have a lower home ownership rate and a larger public housing structure. I must agree that the First Home Owners Scheme was terrific. But I tell you what, the rich are taking advantage of it in Tasmania. We have real problems renting in Tasmania. You cannot rent a house in Hobart for love or money, unless you can afford the $400 to $550 a week for houses in Sandy Bay. The housing department have housing stock which is 50 years of age, I am ashamed to say. They have not got the money, they say, to refurbish the houses so they are selling them. I know a chap in Bridgewater, which is probably one of the most socially disadvantaged suburbs, who owns 14 of them. He is renting them out and making a nice killing. A friend of mine who is a real estate agent had a phone call from a chap in Brisbane who said, `Can I buy 50 of those housing department houses?' </para><para>People are being punished by insurance companies for house and contents insurance by postcode. If you live in certain suburbs in the poorer, socioeconomically deprived areas, you are being punished. In this same suburb of Bridgewater you could buy a housing department house for about $55,000 to $60,000, but the banks require double the normal deposit. The mortgage insurers put the pressure on the banks to have double the deposit. But five kilometres up the road where you can buy a house for $120,000—which is double the debt—you need only half the deposit. What sort of situation is this? What sort of pressure is that putting on families? They have to double their debt because the mortgage insurers are forcing the banks and credit unions to say, `If these people go belly up, we won't get the return on our investment.' </para><para>Child care, bulk-billing, trouble getting to see the doctor, housing, cost of amenities, private health insurance—that has gone up 14 per cent in the last two years—all place an enormous drag on people. Car insurance, house insurance—because of the collapse of HIH and what is happening with Enron and all the other big international companies—put pressure on people. The cost of petrol in Hobart is $1.06 a litre. If you are isolated out in these broadacre areas or in the rural areas, you are getting punished again. Private credit card debt is horrendous; I know how bad mine is. Other families are living on the plastic from week to week, month to month. Do the banks care? No. Dozens have disappeared in the 10 years that I have been in this place. They punish you every time you stand in front of a teller, when naturally you have a conversation about getting your money out.</para><para>We have the greatest proportion of aged care people in Australia in my electorate. We do not have the big money Moran group coming down to Tasmania, because you cannot make any money, like you cannot make money in child care, so all our nursing homes and hostels are serviced by not-for-profit providers. They are having real problems financing infrastructure and development of increased facilities for nursing homes and beds for hostels. I have been 10 years in this place; three years in government and seven years in opposition. I know which years I enjoyed the most. Despite the doom and gloom, I have great faith in the Australian people; they are pretty resilient. I am not a native-born Tasmanian; I have only been there since 1961. They are a wonderful group of people; I have a wonderful electorate. I am proud to have been their federal member for four terms. It was a bit of a change because, prior to me wandering into this place, they had a Liberal member, Bruce Goodluck, who was here for 17 years. He is a bit of a character.</para><para>What makes Tasmania's House of Representatives members rather unique is the fact that each has to be a little different, a bit of an oddball, because Tasmania has a uniqueness about it. But with only 470,000 people, we do need looking after. We have to have a realisation from Canberra that there are some unique areas of Australia—like, I guess, the electorate of the member for Kalgoorlie—that do need special consideration. It is okay as legislators to form legislation to cover, theoretically, 100 per cent of Australia's population, but there are areas of special need, of special interest and with special character. As I said, we have a population of 470,000—the honourable member for Sydney is here; she probably has that population in some of her suburbs—but we are spread over an island; we are an island state. We do have uniqueness and we do deserve consideration. Our child care, aged care and educational opportunities do need some special assistance. I address this to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, as a former veterans' affairs minister: we do need consideration.</para><para>I urge the ministers who look after Tasmania, through the various agencies that they represent, to come down and see us. We will make you very welcome. Ten years is a long time. Today is a very decisive day in our nation's history. As other members have said in this debate, it is a time of uncertainty. We are not too sure what will happen. We are about to open Pandora's box. I think we need to look at where and how we spend our moneys and at the priorities. To my mind, Australian families should be the focus when looking at what we do and how we do it, and we need to develop a bipartisan approach to something that is at the centre of our existence.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>13200</page.no><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PLIBERSEK</name><name.id>83M</name.id><electorate>Sydney</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a significant and terrible day in Australia's history. We all anticipate that we will be officially at war by this afternoon, and many of us have heavy hearts in that respect. Yesterday in the chamber, I spoke about the reasons for my opposition to the war on Iraq. I do not propose to do so again today other than to say that it is with heavy hearts that we think about our soldiers overseas and about the Iraqi civilians who are facing massive bombardment and attacks on all the infrastructure they need just to survive. It is difficult, of course, to move to other issues in that context. However, one of the great tragedies of war is that things are overlooked when our attention is diverted overseas. As representatives, we also have a responsibility to continue to focus on the living standards of people in Australia, particularly the poor and most vulnerable, and to continue to protect and defend those standards. I am certainly doing my very best to focus on the industrial relations legislation that the minister has introduced into the parliament, which will affect collective bargaining for the poorest workers in Australia. I am also doing my best to focus on the decline in bulk-billing and on any number of other issues, including higher education, which I address in this debate today on <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>We have seen the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, engaging in a number of reviews, some of which he has commissioned and then held onto for months at a time. He has not wanted to share them with his parliamentary colleagues, probably because of what those reviews find, because those reviews indicate that there is indeed a serious problem in higher education in this country. It seems strange to call something a crisis when we are facing this conflict in Iraq, but we have a very pressing decline in standards and in spending in higher education. We, therefore, have a shift in the number of students who are able to go to university and in the types of students who are able to afford it. That concerns me greatly. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee revealed that 53,925 qualified Australian students could not get a university place in 2002. That is a very substantial 33 per cent increase in one year in unmet demand for university places since 2001.</para><para>The most recent OECD study found that, amongst young adult Australians, the number of bachelor degree recipients in 1999 was 27 per cent. On the cost of educating those students, under the Howard government, the real value of university operating funds from the Commonwealth, including the HECS contribution, has fallen from $13,013 per subsidised student in 1996 to $11,840 in 2001—a cut in spending of $1,173 per student. If you take the HECS out and look at the government's contribution, it has fallen by $2,325 per student—from $11,687 in 1996 to $9,362 in 2001.</para><para>We know the tales of overcrowded lecture theatres. The ratio of staff to students between 1993 and 2001 rose from 14½ students per teaching staff member to 19.9 students per teaching staff member. That places the most enormous workload on those members of teaching staff and of course affects their ability to deliver an appropriate education to their students. It means handing out marks instead of genuinely engaging in the work that students are producing. It is clear that students are suffering from that. Those comments ignore the strain that is placed on the physical infrastructure of universities that we also hear so much about—students sitting on the stairs of lecture theatres or turned away from lectures because courses have been overenrolled. It is true also that university libraries have had to cut the purchase of books and periodicals, in part because of the fall of the value of the Australian dollar, which meant that overseas periodicals and books were much more expensive to publish—but that is not the only reason. The main reason is the significant loss of funding that they are faced with.</para><para>Australian students make amongst the highest level in the OECD of personal contributions to the cost of their education. Students now directly contribute a far greater share of the total of overall university revenue. They are contributing 30 per cent, which is made up of 18 per cent through the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, two per cent through postgraduate fees and 10 per cent from international students. In US public universities, students contribute about 19 per cent of university revenue. In the US not-for-profit universities, that figure is still lower than the Australian figure, although only slightly lower. But that is in their private universities, the ones that we have come to think of as so expensive and so unaffordable for students—and they are doing slightly better than we are in Australia.</para><para>We have, by international comparisons, high student fees and low comparative graduate benefits. We are always told that students get a personal benefit from their university education, and indeed they do—there is no question of that. They are likely to earn higher wages over their lifetimes in general. But when you compare this to the OECD average, university graduates earn 60 per cent more on average than non-university graduates. In Australia, those with university qualifications earn 36 per cent more than those with just secondary school qualifications. While there is of course a private benefit, the earning potential of a person over their lifetime is obviously enhanced. It is not as much enhanced as in countries where students pay a smaller proportion of their own cost of their education. These high costs mean that people from low socioeconomic status backgrounds, people from regional and isolated areas and people from Indigenous communities are still suffering significant educational disadvantage. It does not take a brain surgeon to work out that as university degrees become more expensive people who come from poorer backgrounds feel that they are less able to afford them.</para><para>Many of the proposals that Minister Nelson has floated—some of them through leaks, some of them through sounding out his parliamentary colleagues and some of them in parliament—are extremely concerning. I think the whole university sector anticipates that there will be a deregulation of university fees, allowing universities to increase their fees by up to 25 per cent. The gap between the marks needed to get into full fee paying courses and HECS funded courses is already significant. It is up to 25 marks in some degrees; it is commonly around seven to nine marks.</para><para>As those full fee paying degrees become more expensive and people can afford them less, people with lower marks will obviously be able to get into those courses. It is a significant problem for the universities that people who are not able to qualify to get in the normal way are able to buy their way into a university course, perhaps without the skills to complete the degree properly. It is possible that students will be able to get a loan to pay the deregulated fees; students will be graduating with $100,000-plus debt at a time when they may be thinking about buying a house or starting a family. It makes their life choices much more difficult and delays their choices to have children and set up a home. Will the loans to pay those fees be subject to commercial interest rates? Who knows. They are in New Zealand, and the New Zealand model demonstrates that there has been a significant effect on the life choices of students. Students are delaying child-bearing and establishing businesses and are not paying for private health insurance—one of the big enthusiasms of this government—purchasing homes or making provision for retirement or superannuation.</para><para>As I said, there is the likelihood of the expansion of domestic full fee paying student places, and I have outlined why I think that that is a problem for the educational outcomes that universities are able to provide. Regional universities are facing significant problems as well. The proposed policy changes create a situation where the metropolitan universities—and I have several campuses in my electorate—will become elite universities. Sydney University was probably very happy with this proposal, and it is a very good university. However, the effect on regional universities may be quite disastrous as they become second-class universities with second-class funding. The proposals for specialisation and rationalisation of courses on a state basis or even a national basis will lead to course closures at small and regional campuses. There may be some cases where increased specialisation will be beneficial, but if regional universities become undergraduate universities only, with no research and no postgraduate work, that really will contract options for regional students.</para><para>The possible introduction of HECS fees for some TAFE students concerns me greatly as well. We have a number of significant skills shortages in this country at the moment. We have a TAFE system that is in many places very good but that would certainly benefit from increased funding. The minister is saying to students and parents that TAFE is not a second-class option. All of this is true and yet the government wants to make it more difficult for students to go to TAFE, not easier—less attractive instead of more attractive. This comes on top of a continued move by the federal government against student unions and teaching staff unions in universities. I cannot believe that we are once again going to have to battle about voluntary student unionism.</para><para>That reminds me that I had a phone call from one of my constituents yesterday who told me she was not going to pay the proportion of her tax dollar that was spent on defence because she did not think it was right that she had to pay for that when she was so opposed to the war. I sympathise with her predicament. However, it is a concern when we start saying that people can opt in and opt out of paying for services which they use—which is the case with student unions; they provide services for the most part, as well as representation for students—and we do it for such base ideological reasons as have been advanced by the government in the past about not training students to become unionists. We have to question the priorities of a government that is prepared to go to war with student unions when we have so many more important things on the domestic agenda and when student unions and tertiary teaching unions do such a good job. In both instances, their aim is to improve the quality of the education that students receive. Both teaching staff unions and student unions are well motivated and provide good services and yet this government, for ideological reasons, has to go after them.</para><para>In the final few minutes I have I want to speak about some comments that were made by Australian Democrats Senator Brian Greig a couple of weeks ago in the lead-up to the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Senator Greig was fortunate enough to be in Sydney that weekend and attended the Mardi Gras. He called New South Wales the `antigay state'. Representing the electorate I do, in the middle of metropolitan Sydney, I have got to say that we are probably the most diverse electorate in the country when you are talking about people of different sexualities. The idea that we are antigay is absurd. The idea that the New South Wales Labor government is antigay is absolutely absurd, and any look at our record proves that. </para><para>New South Wales was the first state to amend antidiscrimination laws in 1982 to cover homosexuality. We legalised male homosexual sex in 1984. We funded the first government service for transgender and transsexual persons in 1984. We funded the 2010 youth refuge, the first gay and lesbian housing service for young people, in the 1980s. New South Wales Labor was the first government to assist in funding an AIDS council and to consult on HIV-AIDS in the 1980s. We voted for antivillification legislation in the 1990s. We established the police gay and lesbian liaison unit and funded the antiviolence project in the 1990s. In 1996 we amended a raft of laws to protect transgender persons from discrimination. In 1990 Labor passed the property relationships amendment act to ensure that same sex relationships and same sex carers enjoyed the same rights as heterosexual de factos. Same sex partners can now participate in decisions about a partner's treatment if they are ill, say goodbye to a partner who is dying, claim compensation if a partner dies in an accident, transfer property into joint ownership without having to pay stamp duty, automatically inherit a partner's assets if they die without a will, deal with bail applications, and be notified of a partner's mental illness. </para><para>In 2001 Labor granted same sex superannuation rights to the extent possible under state legislation. Of course, the Commonwealth still refuses to address this issue. Anthony Albanese has had a private member's bill before the parliament for three or four years now about this issue and the Commonwealth still refuses to act. I have got a private member's bill that the government has shelved as well about ending discrimination against same sex partners when it comes to receiving Australian citizenship. In 2002 the New South Wales government introduced the missing pieces legislation, which amends 27 laws where discrimination against lesbians, gay men and transgender persons existed. </para><para>Federal Labor governments funded HIV-AIDS treatment under Medicare and lifted the ban on gays and lesbians in the Defence Force. They were the first government in the world to pass sexual privacy laws through the human rights sexual conduct bill. I think you would remember that debate, Mr Deputy Speaker, as I do. I remember listening to it; of course, I was not elected at that time. We campaigned against the Tasmanian government's refusal to legalise consenting homosexual sex between adults and introduced immigration laws to allow gay men and lesbians to apply for permanent residency in the same way as heterosexual de facto couples. I think that Senator Greig's attack on the New South Wales government a couple of weeks ago really shows, basically, what is wrong with the Democrats. It is a cheap shot—having a whinge before the Mardi Gras, hoping to get a bid of media coverage—instead of developing a track record like the Labor Party has in reforming this important area of human rights and equality.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>13204</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>. As one of the last speakers on these bills, I want to bring the attention of the parliament to a particularly fine environmental and commercial operation that is coming together in my electorate of Hinkler. The fisheries of the world are finite. Edible fish products will run out if they are not protected, enhanced and harvested carefully over coming generations. As Third World countries become more focused on better lifestyles, the pressure on our edible sea stocks will become even greater. This makes the particular project I want to talk about today, Queensland Sea Scallops Ltd, a very attractive one. It is a consortium of 20 trawler owners and fish processors who have come together to build a scallop hatchery and a breeding, processing and marketing chain to enhance and market Australian fish products. Why is it good environmentally? It is good environmentally because it envisages that we will put a new resource into the waters off Australia. How will this be done? The company envisages that it will harvest brood stock from the wild. There will be no genetic modification. The scallop spat will be bred in captivity in a special hatchery, which will be located at Port Bundaberg. It will then be taken to sea in special tanks and placed on the sea floor. It grows to maturity—that is, to a 90-millimetre scallop—in nine months.</para></talk.start><para>The Queensland government have approved two trial areas: one in Platypus Bay, in the centre of the western side of Fraser Island; and the other off Woodgate, which is the seaside resort for the township of Childers in my electorate. This project will give us 9,000 tonnes of scallop meat per year. That is extraordinary. If you want to look at it another way, it means that we will breed 72 million scallops a year. They will be put back into the environment and, as I said, they will be in no way genetically modified, coming as they do from wild brood stock. This is the right way to do it. The areas are going to be carefully monitored by the Queensland government to make sure that the placement is correct and that the environment of the water impoundment of Hervey Bay is kept in as near as possible to pristine condition.</para><para>Who put this project together? A number of people have claimed credit for it but my understanding is that Mr Sid McKeown of FishMak, a Bundaberg fish processing works, who is a man with a great deal of expertise in fishing, in marketing and, in earlier days, in the Department of Primary Industries, suggested this to a meeting in Bundaberg some years ago. It has since been taken up by this consortium of Queensland Sea Scallops Ltd, in which there are 20 participants. They then went looking for suitable sites in which to carry out their land based activities, generally in the southern part of central Queensland, eventually settling on a choice between Port Bundaberg and Urangan at Hervey Bay. A few weeks ago the company decided that they would locate the processing works at Port Bundaberg.</para><para>This is a great tribute not only to Ted Whittingham, the Chairman of Queensland Sea Scallops, and his partners but also to the Bundaberg Port Authority, which has shown considerable enterprise in this venture. The Bundaberg Port Authority is not a big port authority as port authorities go. Up until recent years, its main products were sugar, molasses, petroleum products and timber. But in the last 10 or 12 years it has spread its wings in the ample land it has in Port Bundaberg and has developed a three-stage marina. Its third stage, which will be completed in the near future, will contain 230 moorings with facilities for 70 to 80 trawlers. It is sad to say, with the member for Dawson here, that it has recently pipped Mackay as the second-highest customs and clearance port in Queensland. It is quite extraordinary that in such a short time it has gone on to become the second major landfall for international yachting tourists. </para><para>But it goes beyond that. In that environment, there is a restaurant and a chandlery. It is also the embarkation point for the MV<inline font-style="italic"> Lady Musgrave</inline>, which goes to the southern Great Barrier Reef; the <inline font-style="italic">Spirit of Musgrave</inline>, which takes whale watchers to the waters of Hervey Bay to see the extraordinary event of the whales' northern migration; and the <inline font-style="italic">Bundy Belle</inline>, which is a magnificently restored riverboat that brings people from Bundaberg to Port Bundaberg for dinner. In addition to that, there are three major fish processing works and a tertiary marine campus, the TAFE Queensland Marine Training Centre. These are all situated in this environment of Port Bundaberg.</para><para>It is little wonder, then, that on a competitive basis this environment was very attractive to Queensland Sea Scallops Ltd. Yes, there was intensive bidding for this particular project, and I am delighted that the Bundaberg Port Authority was the successful bidder. It has been subjected to some unfair criticism. One accusation was that it used $500,000 to attract this project, which is not true. What it is doing is building a common user infrastructure—an ocean pipeline—which this new firm and existing firms will use in their fish processing and for which they will be paying commercial rates. </para><para>It has been said that the port authority has used a lot of strongarm influence. That is also not true. I am very close to that port authority, and it won this project largely on the quality of its submission—its sensitivity to the needs of this rather unique fish breeding, hatchery and harvesting arrangement. Not only that but it put the submission together with its own resources. It was open to any of the other bidders to bring in consultants if they wanted to and put their submissions together. It is a tribute to the port authority that it was able to put this together in-house and respond positively and sensitively to the needs of this enterprise. The enterprise, as I told you, will produce 9,000 tonnes of scallop meat a year over a period of eight years, or 72 million scallop shells. The total project will cost $126 million, at its peak it will employ 1,500 people and it will return $75 million to the wage structure of the Hervey Bay-Bundaberg environment.</para><para>As I said in my opening remarks, sea stocks are finite. We need to do a number of things in marketing our seafood. We must ensure that it is there for future generations, and projects like this—using natural non-genetically modified sea stocks and breeding them—will ensure that that happens. It will ensure that the Australian domestic market is always supplied with high-quality scallop meat. In addition to that, it will mean that Australia will have a top product to market internationally. The stage of this particular project that I have not talked about is the marketing. The whole idea, after having bred the spat, laid it on the seabed and harvested the meat, is to then have a vertically integrated marketing scheme. The trawlers and the fish processing works currently based in places like Gladstone or Hervey Bay will be able to take these scallops to their respective processing works or they can have them processed at the Bundaberg works. Regardless of where they are processed, they will be marketed as a top-quality, state-of-the-art Queensland product into the international market. The Queensland sea scallop, as the member for Dawson will readily know because she has a scalloping area off her port, is in high demand, especially in the Asian market. This vertical integration—from breeding tanks to the ocean floor to the processing works to an international marketing regime—will ensure that we value add at the highest level. </para><para>I would particularly like to compliment Ted Whittingham, the Chairman of Directors of Queensland Sea Scallops, for his leadership and for his vision and the vision of the other 19 partners who brought this thing together. I am sure it is pleasing to environment and primary industries ministers to see the quality of leadership that this group has shown. The Bundaberg Port Authority, as I said, is not a big port authority in the greater scheme of things but it is a very focused one. It remits 95 per cent of its profit to the Queensland government, so it does not have a lot to play with. It has made it a truly fine marine environment and it is little wonder that Queensland Sea Scallops were drawn to this environment. I compliment the chairman of the board, Glen Toll, his fellow directors and particularly his chief executive officer, Phil Mumford, who carried the strain of putting this project together. </para><para>We need to look at areas like Wide Bay—I am talking generically about Wide Bay, not about the electorate, because the Wide Bay area contains the electorates of Wide Bay, Hinkler and a little of Blair—because it has one of the highest unemployment rates in Australia. We are generally in the worst three. It is not through any particular fault of this government or the previous one; it is an ingrained problem that will be solved only by government and private infrastructure. This is the sort of private infrastructure that needs to take place.</para><para>There has been a little spatting—I was going to use the word `spat', but it is hardly appropriate—at the margins on this issue, with the suggestion that some of the Hervey Bay processors might form a competitive consortium. That is their perfect right and I respect their right to do that. I think it is more important in this day and age to present the Wide Bay area as a corporately sound entity where people can invest with confidence and with deliberation. It is wrong to divide our forces when an opportunity such as this—a $126 million opportunity—is on our doorstep. It will benefit not only Queensland Sea Scallops but also the small fishing community of Burnett Heads, which is the adjoining community to Bundaberg; the Bundaberg district considerably, where there will be a lot of jobs available; the Wide Bay area; and Queensland, through the marketing of a superior product. I commend to the House this product and the people who have put it together.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>13207</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—There has been a long and very substantial debate with contributions made by members from both sides of the House on these two additional estimates appropriation bills, <inline ref="R1729">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003</inline> and <inline ref="R1724">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003</inline>. The additional estimates bills request a total of $1,454.7 million—that is, $1,191 million in expenses; $69.4 million in payments to the states, primarily under the First Home Owners Scheme; and $194.3 million in capital injections, of which $124 million is required by the Department of Defence primarily for the purpose of acquisitions for operations. This additional funding is to meet the increased cost of inventory and specialist equipment purchases. The cost of the operation in Iraq will be dealt with in the current budget processes.</para></talk.start><para>These bills embody the continuing commitment of the Howard government to sound economic and financial management. The bills seek funding for ongoing Commonwealth activities, including the alleviation of the hardship being experienced by those affected by the drought, sugar industry reform measures and enhancements of the physical security at Australia's overseas posts. It is regrettable that I do not have sufficient time to deal with all of the individual matters raised by honourable members on both sides of the House. But I do, in the time available to me, wish to comment on some of the matters raised by members opposite to set the record straight. </para><para>The honourable member for Fraser claimed that, despite strong economic growth, the Howard government has left the economy extremely vulnerable. This is simply not true. Rather than being extremely vulnerable, Australia is one of the leading OECD economies. The OECD states that Australia's current and recent economic record places it amongst the top performers in the OECD. The OECD also expects the Australian economy to remain one of the top performers, projecting growth for Australia of 3.3 per cent in 2003 and 3.8 per cent in 2004. The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics business indicator survey reported a 2.5 per cent increase in nominal gross operating profits of companies in the December quarter 2002. Notwithstanding some high-profile corporate failures during the past couple of years, the Reserve Bank of Australia has indicated that businesses in aggregate are carrying low levels of debt, have strong internal funding and have generally avoided the mistakes of overinvestment that have characterised past business cycles. In terms of the labour market, there have been 1.23 million net jobs created since March 1996, when the government was elected. Employment is growing at an average annual rate of three per cent over the 12 months to February 2003, compared with a 10-year average of 2¼ per cent. The unemployment rate is six per cent, compared with the unemployment rate of 8.2 per cent when the government was elected. This snapshot of some of the more important economic indicators suggests that the Australian economy is far from vulnerable.</para><para>The honourable member for Fraser also mused about the government's view on balanced fiscal policy. Let me just say that the government's primary fiscal objective is to maintain budget balance on average over the course of the economic cycle. This is derived from the broader principles of sound fiscal management laid down in the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998. This approach is intended to ensure that fiscal policy is formulated within a sustainable, medium-term framework. According to the OECD, the Commonwealth's:</para><quote><para>... medium-term fiscal policy framework safeguards the sustainability of public finances over time ... (and) ... allows policy to react to short-term fluctuations to support growth.</para></quote><para>The member for Fraser also accused the government of failing to keep the budget in surplus after a decade of strong economic growth. The government has had a good record in terms of achieving major cash surpluses. In 1997-98 it was $1.2 billion; in 1998-99, $4.2 billion; in 1999-2000, $12.7 billion; and in 2000-01, $5.7 billion. The government estimates that the cash surplus in 2002-03 will be $2.1 billion and surpluses in the order of $5 billion per year are reported in the forward estimates. In 2001-02 the recorded cash deficit was $1.1 billion. The deficit reflects the impact of high priority expenditure to support defence operations in Afghanistan, upgrading of domestic security and the protection of Australia's borders against people attempting to arrive in our country without authorisation. I might also remind honourable members that there was a strong demand for the first home owners grant and a decline in taxation collections in early 2002.</para><para>A few honourable members opposite have claimed that this government has imposed the highest level ever of income tax. The historical cash taxation revenue statistics allow an accurate comparison of changes in the Commonwealth's tax burden over time, as equivalent accrual taxation revenue statistics are not available. The decline in Commonwealth general government sector cash taxation revenue, from 23.5 per cent of GDP in 1996-97 to an estimated 20.9 per cent in 2002-03, is a direct comparison of the Commonwealth's tax burden over time. In 2002-03 and the forward years, the Commonwealth's tax share as a proportion of GDP is projected to remain below the minimum level reached in the five years preceding the introduction of the new tax system.</para><para>Honourable members opposite have also claimed that this government is responsible for the introduction of the biggest new tax in Australia's history, namely the goods and services tax. However, under the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations, GST revenue is paid directly to the states and territories. GST revenue is not available for expenditure by the Commonwealth. Consequently, the government considers the GST to be a state tax with the Commonwealth acting as a collection agent for the states.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable members interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name></talker><para>—It is misleading to simply add GST to Commonwealth tax revenue from 2000-01 onwards and compare that with Commonwealth tax levels over time. The members opposite ought not to interject, because we inherited a failed tax system that was unfair and outdated. If the GST were to be added to Commonwealth tax revenue, then all of the state taxes it replaces should also be subtracted in calculating the overall tax share.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The member for Fraser also raised concerns about superannuation being taxed four times and about record high levels of debt. Let me start by saying that research undertaken by the Treasury supports the view that superannuation is a tax preferred investment over a working lifetime for persons in all marginal tax brackets. The government provides substantial tax concessions to superannuation savings to encourage individuals to save for their own retirement, and the 2002 tax expenditure statement estimates the aggregate size of the tax expenditure for superannuation at $10.6 billion in 2002-03. The recent OECD report into Australia has found that although superannuation is taxed at three stages—that is, at contributions, earnings and benefits—it provides a similar result as a system which only taxes end benefits. This is consistent with the findings of World Bank research that Australian superannuation taxes over a working lifetime, while applying at three stages, are not high by world standards.</para><para>In terms of debt, at the end of the 2002 December quarter Australia's net foreign debt was $354 billion, or 48.9 per cent of GDP. However, I should point out that the vast majority of this debt is owed by the private sector—at 95.8 per cent, or $333.1 billion, in the September quarter 2002. Since this government has come to office, general government foreign debt has continued to decline significantly. The general government share of net foreign debt has fallen from 17.2 per cent in the March quarter 1996 to its current level of four per cent in the September quarter 2002.</para><para>As a proportion of GDP, government foreign debt has fallen from around 50 per cent upon our election to office in March 1996, following the peak of 54 per cent in September 1995, to approximately 8 per cent in September 2002. Additionally, Australia's ability to service its external liabilities is as strong as it has been for some time. The debt servicing ratio—the amount of exports required to pay the interest on net foreign debt—was 8.7 per cent in the December quarter and is well below the peak of 20 per cent recorded in the September quarter 1990 and 11.3 per cent in March 1996. A recent Treasury <inline font-style="italic">Economic Roundup</inline>, released on 31 January 2003, reported Australian net private wealth at market value grew by 10.9 per cent in real terms through the year to 30 June 2002. The growth rate in real net private sector wealth during the year to June 2002 was the highest for more than a decade. Therefore, despite increasing debt in the private sector, the value of private sector wealth is growing faster. Combined with low interest rates, this gives the private sector an increased capacity to borrow without increasing their debt-servicing burden.</para><para>The honourable members for Fraser, Shortland, Hasluck, Greenway and Braddon—to name a few—all made claims that, despite record high revenues, services are declining and the government is not investing in the future. This allegation has absolutely no foundation. The government is forward-looking. It produced Australia's first ever Intergenerational Report, which identified the fiscal implications of demographic change and other pressures over the next 40 years. The government is currently examining policies to address this issue, including measures to increase workforce participation—raising workforce participation builds human capital for the future.</para><para>The government has implemented several initiatives to improve labour market efficiency and productivity: Australians Working Together, Job Network and Backing Australia's Ability. Through these initiatives the government has allowed welfare recipients to keep more of their income support payments when they take up work, has enhanced labour market efficiency and has launched a $3 billion science and innovation strategy over five years, outlining increased investment in human capital.</para><para>Over the next three years, there will be an additional 6,000 university places, an additional $624 million for competitive research grants, $429 million in project specific and general research infrastructure grants to universities and approximately $230 million for new cooperative research centres. Measures such as the prestigious Federation Fellowships and the establishment of fifteen new major national research facilities are encouraging researchers to stay in Australia. In addition, the government has committed additional resources to increasing regional university places. Further, the government has had great success in improving vocational education and training opportunities for all Australians and the literacy and numeracy of Australian schoolchildren since 1996. In the remainder of this term, the government will focus primarily on initiatives in the area of higher education, which is crucial to Australia's future in a global economy. The government will shortly announce the first set of national research priorities, which will integrate Australia's science and research effort more closely with the community's economic, social and environmental goals and help to address the long term policy issues facing Australia.</para><para>The implementation of Australia's ambitious and comprehensive national competition policy over the past seven years has made a substantial contribution to the recent improvement in labour and multifactor productivity and economic growth. The Productivity Commission estimates that Australia's GDP is now about 2½ per cent higher than it otherwise would have been, and Australian households' annual incomes are on average around $7,000 higher as a result of competition policy.</para><para>Notwithstanding the member for Fraser's criticisms of the current measures of budget performance, I would like to state that following the successful introduction of accrual accounting in the 1999-2000 budget, the Department of Finance and Administration now compiles and disseminates budget information on both cash and accruals bases. Presenting dual measures of budget performance, the underlying cash balance as well as the accruals based fiscal balance provides a fuller picture of budget performance.</para><para>The member for Chifley has claimed that the government is reducing defence expenditure by $1 billion. This is simply not correct. Quite on the contrary, the budgeted statement of financial performance of the Defence portfolio additional estimates statement 2002-03 shows appropriations from the government rising over the next two years, from $18.2 billion at the 2002-03 budget to $19.3 billion in 2004-05. In the white paper the government provided an additional $27.6 million over the 10 years from 2000-01. There are also suggestions from the honourable member for Lingiari that there has been a reduction in funding for Indigenous Education Direct Assistance. Those opposite may be interested to know that there have been no cuts to this program for the Northern Territory. Indeed, the Commonwealth has actually increased the allocation for the Northern Territory by $1.163 million from last financial year. This is an overall increase in funding under the program of more than 14 per cent.</para><para>The economic record of this government is one of our proudest achievements. Since 1996, when the Howard government came to office, the Australian economy has embarked on a long term of strong growth with an average annual economic growth of around 3¾ per cent. The OECD gives Australia strong endorsement of its macroeconomic management and notes that the economy's impressive growth performance is the result of sound medium-term macroeconomic policy framework and economic reforms. The OECD notes that structural reforms across a broad front have assisted in making the economy notably resilient to both internal and external shocks. Accordingly, the OECD holds up Australia's commitment to reform, willingness to commission and accept expert advice, and capacity to adopt innovative approaches and build constituencies that support further reforms as things that other countries could learn from.</para><para>During this long expansion, inflation has been kept low, the unemployment rate has been reduced and interest rates have fallen to historic lows. The unemployment rate has fallen from 8.2 per cent in 1996, when the government was elected, to six per cent in January 2003. Around 1.23 million jobs have been created since March 1996. Official interest rates have fallen from 7.5 per cent in 1996 to 4.75 per cent. The last change in interest rates was up 25 basis points in June 2002, a far cry from the peak of over 18 per cent under the previous Labor government. Interest rates in Australia are around the lowest in 30 years. Despite the drought and the subdued world economy, Australia's economic outlook remains solid. Following growth of 3.9 per cent in 2001-02, the economy is expected to grow by three per cent in 2002-03, supported by robust growth in consumer spending, continued strength in residential construction and strong business investment growth. The GDP grew by 0.4 per cent in the December quarter 2002 and by three per cent over 2002. This outcome is consistent with the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook of around three per cent growth in 2002-03.</para><para>Australia is in the midst of the worst drought in 100 years. Farm output is expected to fall by 17 per cent in 2002-03, and this will detract around three-quarters of a percentage point from overall GDP, giving GDP growth of three per cent. In the December quarter 2002, farm output fell by 15 per cent. It fell by 27 per cent over 2002. Non-farm GDP, however, is expected to remain robust and grow by around 3¾ per cent in 2002-03, driven by strong growth in domestic demand. Non-farm GDP grew by 3.9 per cent over the year to December 2002. A return to strong growth is forecast in 2003-04, assuming the end of the drought and a return to normal seasonal conditions. The recent rainfalls are positive signs of an increasing likelihood that there will be a timely end to the drought.</para><para>In his contribution to the debate the honourable member for Fraser moved an amendment to the second reading motion on this bill. I have already spoken to most of the issues raised in the amendment, so I do not wish to refer to each component. However, I do want to state that the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003, together with the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003, continues the government's fiscally responsible management. Honourable members will not be at all surprised to know that the opposition amendment is not supported by the government. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 supports the government's prudent response to difficult times in the world economy and world security. Together with Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003, it provides funds which are needed in order to maintain government activities and to contribute to the strong performance of the Australian economy. I do thank honourable members for their contributions to this debate and I commend both bills to the chamber.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Mossfield)</inline>—The question is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Original question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para><para>Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.</para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 4) 2002-2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13211</page.no><id.no>R1724</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>13211</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 11 December 2002, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slipper</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para><para>Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>13212</page.no></debateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slipper</inline>) proposed:</para><motion><para>That the Main Committee do now adjourn.</para></motion><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Terrorism</title><page.no>13212</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>13212</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I want to take the opportunity provided by the adjournment debate to present an important message with regard to the Prime Minister kits that have  been returned to my electorate office.

I did not expect that I would be receiving them. Many people wanted to return the kits directly to the Prime Minister, but unfortunately we will never know exactly how many because Australia Post have been shredding the returned documents—and we are not sure whether they have been directed to do so or have done it of their own accord.

We are still not screening a large proportion of containers as they come into the country. There is no screening at some of our airports. The member who represents Burnie airport has certainly made his voice heard in the parliament on this. It is very important that we spend money on upgrading our security and not on just sending out documents—documents which many people in my electorate did not think were worth while.

Bob Carr revealed that, if re-elected at the election on Saturday, Labor in New South Wales will lock up the country into 15 new national parks, state conservation areas or state forest reserves. This decision is of great concern. It will mean the loss of 1,400 jobs directly, and the social and economic flow-on effects on families and communities in the region will be devastating to a countless number of people. This decision has been born of Labor's cynical political opportunism in the heat of a general election.</para></talk.start><para>Premier Bob Carr has sought to make a grab for green votes. Premier Carr has tried to show himself as a great environmentalist, but in my view he has demonstrated Labor's contempt for the intelligence of the electors of New South Wales. Labor's plan is a cheap and opportunistic political stunt. It has been grossly ill conceived. It will cost 1,400 jobs and it will achieve nothing for the environment. The demand for the timber that was being supplied from these areas will still be met, but it will be met from other sources—probably overseas—at great economic and social cost. I want to place on the record my dismay at Labor's plan.</para><para>New South Wales Labor has a pitiful record when it comes to managing the protected forest areas already in its care. Tens of thousands of hectares were burnt in the recent bushfires. That was a tragedy. More importantly, environmental habitat and other areas were lost. Private property was lost and homes were destroyed. The tragedy is compounded when you examine the Labor government's fire hazard reduction and management performance in New South Wales forests. It is an appalling thought that much of the devastation would not have occurred if proper hazard management techniques had been employed. In March 2000, Premier Carr signed the north-east regional forest agreement with the Prime Minister. However, this new announcement was entered into without consulting the Commonwealth, and I believe that the effect of this plan will be that New South Wales will be in breach of the RFA.</para><para>I would like to place on record my thanks to Senator Ian Macdonald, the federal Minister for Forestry and Conservation. Senator Macdonald made a special visit to the region on Monday, 10 March to meet with me, Andrew Fraser, who is the state member for Coffs Harbour, members of the timber industry, the farming community and affected landowners. Senator Macdonald has been genuinely concerned for the region's 1,400 timber workers who might lose their jobs because of this announcement and for their families. At our meeting, Douglas Head, who is the managing director of Solar Timbers in Kempsey, made the point that the state Labor forestry minister, Kim Yeadon, had not been willing to make any comment on or commitment to the future of the New South Wales timber industry. It appears that he has been gagged by Bob Carr. It is very frustrating for the participants in this industry not to be able to get any commitments from or clarification out of Carr or his Labor government. The crux of the RFA agreement was to provide some security over the next 20 years. Now those goalposts have been moved again by Labor. </para><para>What is Bob Carr's signature on the RFA worth? It appears to be worth very little indeed. Under Labor's plan, Pine Creek Forest is to be locked up. One revealing point was that much of the lockup is of plantation timber. For instance, Gympie messmate from Queensland is grown there. Many of these forest areas are occupied by trees that are not native to the area. The whole plan by Carr has very poorly conceived environmental benefits indeed. The original RFA process looked at the conservation values of land in New South Wales, with a view to balancing resource requirements and conservation. The forests which have been the subject of this declaration were previously rejected as not being of significant conservation value. This is a cheap political ploy by Bob Carr and Labor to secure Green preferences without regard for jobs, without regard for economic security, without regard for commerce and without regard for communities in regional and rural Australia. It is very frustrating when we have a government in New South Wales that cannot give the forest industry, the businesses and the workers, any solid commitment that can be relied on.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Social Welfare: Pensions</title><title>Telstra: Bill Assistance Program</title><page.no>13215</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Bill Assistance Program</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>13215</page.no><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name><name.id>HH4</name.id><electorate>Scullin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Whilst the fog of war hangs over much of the debate in this building this week and, regrettably, may cover much of the debate in the next several weeks, there is still a host of domestic issues that we really need to turn our attention to. Recently, an old age pensioner contacted my office and asked me whether I really understood what it was like to live on the amount of money that he gets on the pension. Of course, the direct answer is that no-one can ever know unless they are in that situation. But over time I have learnt that the inadequacy of benefits makes living very tight for the people who receive them, when you take into account the types of utility expenses required to keep a household going and living expenses and things like that. It is very important that we understand the difficulties of people on benefits. </para></talk.start><para>This is reflected in a number of comments that I have made over the years about the inadequacy of benefits, which can lead people to rely on emergency relief. I have had the argument put to me that, in a perfect world, there would be no need for emergency relief. But, regrettably, over the past few years a number of the policy changes made by the present government have led to a greater reliance and a continuing reliance on emergency relief. Breaches under the present social security regime of Centrelink have forced a number of people onto that merry-go-round of having to front up for emergency relief. So I think that we need to look at the pressures that are on people—without going into it in great detail, because that is not the purpose of this contribution—and, of course, the inadequacy of the compensatory aspects of the GST package also have to be taken into account. That is probably one of the things that we need to review, to see whether there is not more that we can do for those who are on a fixed income such as a benefit.</para><para>One thing that has been brought to my attention is the scheme that Telstra have put in place entitled the Telstra Bill Assistance Program. Under this scheme Telstra have, in a way, contracted out the relief given to people who are having trouble with their telephone accounts, and entered into agreements with a number of non-government agencies to administer this fund. It has been put to me that, regrettably, what has in fact happened is that, despite the additional amount given to the non-government agencies, the types of accountability processes required under this scheme are onerous. They overly involve the agencies in a lot of paperwork, and one of the real problems is that the very tight and discrete targeting that Telstra require of this money is making the whole scheme less than worth while. It was put to me on Monday of this week that one agency in my electorate involved in the scheme has had recourse to very little of the money, because it cannot be used in the generalist support of people requiring emergency relief but has to be very tightly targeted and specific to the problems that people might be having with their phone accounts.</para><para>I suggest that Telstra would be better placed as a corporate citizen if they were to bite the bullet and allow their scheme to be part of an overall contribution that can be left in the hands of those who are involved in the distribution of emergency relief—whether it be the government scheme, whether it be amounts that are made available through charitable schemes or whether it be through state and territory schemes. I think those people who have some expertise in the way in which this money should be distributed take an in toto view of a family's accounts and financial difficulties, and the contribution of this Telstra Bill Assistance Program would be better placed if it could become part of this overall pool. I think Telstra would be better placed in reinvestigating their scheme, making the accountability aspects less onerous—although I understand the need for accountability—and perhaps releasing some of these funds for wider purposes to help families in need. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>New South Wales Election</title><page.no>13216</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>13216</page.no><name role="metadata">Nairn, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NAIRN</name><name.id>OK6</name.id><electorate>Eden-Monaro</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you and many others would know that this Saturday an election is taking place in New South Wales. One of the seats in New South Wales that falls within my federal electorate of Eden-Monaro, the seat of Monaro, is certainly a seat that many people will watch. Peter Webb, the sitting member, has been working extremely hard over the last four years in representing that region. Preferences are obviously very important, particularly in a system that has optional preferential voting. Preferences are clearly important in those close seats. The Greens announced a couple of weeks ago that they would preference some seats and not other seats. Two of the seats that they said they would not preference are in fact the two seats within my federal electorate—that of Monaro and that of Bega. That was backed up by a candidates' meeting in Cooma. An article in today's <inline font-style="italic">Cooma-Monaro Express</inline> states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>At the candidates' forum in Cooma on March 11, Mr Whan—</para></quote><para>who is the Labor candidate—</para><quote><para>said there would be no deal with the Greens because he had `already printed the How to Vote cards'.</para></quote><para>The article goes on:</para><quote><para>However, one week later, the Labor Party has agreed to certain conditions with the Greens to attract preferences from candidate Catherine Moore.</para></quote><para>In actual fact, I received a copy of the letter from Catherine Moore to the Labor Party saying that the hierarchy of the Greens had said that they would not preference but that they would give the Labor Party one last chance. They said to the local Labor people, `If you'll agree that no New South Wales native forest will be used for charcoal production or biomass burning, if you agree to an immediate moratorium on logging in many parts of the region, if you agree to a commitment to turn these areas into national parks within 12 months and if you agree to recognise that woodchipping of native forests is both economically and environmentally unsustainable, we'll give you the preferences.'</para><para>We did not hear anything for a number of days, but finally the announcement came that, yes, the Greens would be preferencing the Labor Party in the seat of Monaro. So, clearly, the Labor Party have agreed to all of those demands. Those demands will totally destroy the regional forest agreement that was signed between the state government and the federal government. I think $48 million was spent on doing all the science for this regional forest agreement, but this sort of deal will just throw that out the window. I suspect the Labor Party have agreed to the deal just to win the votes of the Greens, then they will possibly do something else. This is an outrageous situation.</para><para>The link to my seat in Bega is the same, even though they say they are not issuing preferences down there. Our candidate there, Andrew Constance, has worked very hard with all the groups involved. Destroying the RFA will destroy businesses and jobs right across our region. These are the sorts of political games that you expect from the ALP, particularly where they have got a candidate who has done nothing in his life but be a political candidate. This is his fourth attempt at gaining office and his third jurisdiction. He was born and bred in Canberra and, after losing in the ACT election in 1995, he moved across the border and stood against me in 1998 and again in 2001, losing on both occasions. He said after the 1998 loss that he would not stand for the state seat in 1999 because, philosophically, he did not believe in state governments: `How, in all conscience, could I stand for a state seat if I don't believe in state governments?' He lost again in the federal election in 2001. So now, all of a sudden, he believes in state governments; for the fourth time in the third jurisdiction he is trying to win office. </para><para>The Labor Party have poured huge amounts of dough into this campaign. I reckon that, in the four times this guy has stood, the ALP have probably invested close to $2 million. I guess that, if you spend enough money often enough, eventually—somehow or other—something might happen. They were running ads yesterday on radio in which they said that the Liberal Party only thought about the city. When they talked about the seat of Monaro, the city based voiceover, which was probably produced in Sussex Street, kept mispronouncing `Monaro'. They cannot even pronounce the name of the country seat that they are trying to win. </para><para>Labor's record on the environment has been atrocious. I do not know why the Greens give them the votes. Half of the state seat of Monaro is black from fires because of Labor's policies on the environment. I think people need to stick with the hardworking Peter Webb on Saturday. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Stirling Electorate: Young People</title><page.no>13217</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>13217</page.no><name role="metadata">McFarlane, Jann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JANN McFARLANE</name><name.id>83C</name.id><electorate>Stirling</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I want to talk about young people in my electorate of Stirling. Too often young people are the victims of stereotyping. At many of my community forums I hear complaints from adults about young people. Why is this so? I think that the media has a lot to answer for in this respect, as it tends to concentrate on the one per cent of young people who are in trouble. If you watch the news or current affairs shows on television, the stories on young people are, on the whole, not very positive. People tend to get their perceptions of issues through the media, and these types of stories create a very negative stereotype of what our young people are about. I would like to draw to the attention of the chamber this week's front page and editorial in <inline font-style="italic">The Stirling Times</inline> community newspaper. I know that I have just accused the media of creating stereotypes, but this local newspaper under its editor, Tom Winterbourn, has made a real, positive contribution to highlighting youth issues. I will read to the chamber some of the editorial:</para></talk.start><quote><para>What an excellent idea. A group of switched on young people have come up with a formula for a Stirling youth card, which aims to alert young people to the inherent dangers of living in today's society—and particularly the prevention of youth suicide. Life today isn't what it used to be in our grand parents day with drugs, breakdowns and sexual behaviour at a young age relatively new threats in our society. There are also the perennials of drugs and smokes and the negatives that can be derived from these. The high number of youth suicides today, particularly among young men is particularly disturbing. The youth card, which can fit into wallets and purses in much the same way as a credit card, will contain contact details of people and agencies who can offer help in times of crisis. Prime mover behind this welcome initiative is Federal Stirling MP Jann McFarlane who sold the idea to the City of Stirling. Deputy Mayor Bill Stewart and youth services coordinator Trudi Rossingh then set about getting it off the ground by inviting the four Stirling high schools to provide student representatives for a youth forum. </para><para>...						...						...</para><para>And the really significant factor is that the card has been basically developed for young people by young people—those who really know what's going on out there in that age group. </para></quote><para>More of this type of coverage is needed in our community. We all need to make an effort to understand and listen to our young people. What are young people about? What are their needs? To be honest, I am really not too sure. Too often I think we take young people for granted and are not receptive to their ideas. This is why I approached Councillor Bill Stewart and the City of Stirling to hold a youth forum. One of the concepts I took into the forum was for young people to contribute ideas to the development of a youth card which listed all the services that were important to them. I will produce the youth card and distribute it through schools and community groups in the Stirling electorate.</para><para>Listening to the participants of the forum, I was impressed by the ideas they came up with. There were representatives from the local youth advisory council, St Mary's Anglican Community School, Balga Senior High School, Balcatta Senior High School, Mirrabooka Senior High School, the Edmund Rice Centre and the local African community. The young people who attended gave me invaluable ideas and opinions. The simple truth is that issues concerning young people are best solved by young people. They identified the services they felt they needed the most, with particular emphasis placed on access to information. By this they meant having a direct connection to agencies that are exclusively concerned with youth issues. The representatives were particularly enthusiastic about organisations that have 24-hour phone contacts, such as Lifeline and the Kids Help Line.</para><para>As well as commenting on the services that already exist, the representatives provided dozens of ideas for new services that would be of use to Australian young people. These included ideas such as legal information centres exclusively for youth, so that young people were not made to feel intimidated by the Australian legal system. Beyond this, advocacy was a common theme of the day, as the representatives felt that their status as youth may hinder their ability to represent themselves. This included government agencies like Centrelink. The young people who attended the forum suggested a youth advocacy service within Centrelink to ensure that young people have an appropriate level of service from the organisation.</para><para>I was personally amazed at just how much these young people knew about what they wanted. The forum members considered the youth card and the important road map to the services already available to youth, but the strongest message from the day was that more needs to be done. By getting young people involved in the issues that directly affect them, we as policy makers can deliver them the greatest possible results. I would like to thank the participants and people who organised the forum: Councillor Bill Stewart, who astounds me with the sheer volume of work he does for our local community; Trudi Rossingh, the youth services coordinator from the City of Stirling; and youth advisory council members Clark Maul and Emiline Gaske for their hard work in facilitating the forum. The next step is to get the card produced and distributed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>New South Wales: Election</title><page.no>13218</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>13218</page.no><name role="metadata">Kelly, Jackie, MP</name><name role="display">Miss JACKIE KELLY</name><name.id>GK6</name.id><electorate>Lindsay</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to support the local state candidate in my area, Mr Jim Aitken, who is running for the state seat of Penrith in the New South Wales election. Jim Aitken has been in the area for a considerable amount of time. He started life as an apprentice. He went on to become a butcher and ran a number of butcher shops in the Nepean region. Subsequent to that he was a cab owner and driver. He then went on to have his own garbage collection business and currently he is in real estate. He is a very successful business leader. More importantly, he has taken his business success and delivered it into the community as a community leader and has demonstrated, in his eight years on the council, his extreme leadership on a number of issues that affect the local citizens of my area. He has been a former director of the Family Advancement Resource Co-op, a former president of the South Penrith Rotary Club, district chairman of the Rotary program for the aged and, as I mentioned before, a Penrith city councillor for eight years. It was this sense of public service that saw Jim awarded the OAM. He certainly was deserving of that, receiving a number of commendations from fellow citizens of the Nepean region.</para></talk.start><para>Unlike his Labor counterparts, Jim understands the importance of crime, safety, health, roads and transport to the people of our area. He has been very active in establishing a number of community groups to turn the tide on youth gangs that are operating in the Emu Plains, Emu Heights and Leonay area. He is active in the Bendigo Bank, which is delivering services into the Emu Plains area where banks have closed down and a number of elderly people have been left without basic services.</para><para>He is a tireless worker. He has been involved, in his time on council, in establishing a number of community precincts, such as fencing of the Leonay Oval and other Penrith council sporting areas. He has quite extensively subsidised numerous sporting clubs in our region—Little Athletics, AFL et cetera—with his very successful and popular barbecue trailers with refrigeration. They are very popular for a number of sporting events, and he very freely loans these vehicles to whoever is doing a fundraiser to help the various community projects that are under way.</para><para>This weekend the citizens of New South Wales, especially in our area, have a very clear choice to make. That choice is between Jim Aitken—who is dedicated to the area, who is living in the area and who I expect will die in the area, hopefully in the distant future, and who has a tremendous amount of service to offer—and Bob Carr, who came to government on an M4 tollway promise. I remember the very good member we had, Anne Cohen, who lost the seat of Mulgoa by a mere 60-odd votes based on that promise. That delivered Bob Carr government. Since then he has made a prolific number of promises and really has not kept many of them. Many of the schools in our area are still without halls, without air-conditioning and without even permanent teachers well after the school term has started. The Nepean Hospital still has 2½-year waiting lists. Crime in our area is on the rise—not break and enters, but petty crime, which costs people.</para><para>The citizens of Penrith know that Jim will do something about it and that he will do it at the grassroots level. He will certainly deliver on anything that he undertakes to do. Bob Carr has been the recipient of excessive amounts of stamp duty from our area and yet has allowed excessive amounts of development to go ahead. Instead of enhancing the value of the homes in our area by the utilisation of that stamp duty revenue, he has basically packed houses in, causing a great amount of concern in terms of the shape and character of our town into the future. I know that Jim is committed to the character and lifestyle that we have in Western Sydney, and he will do his utmost in parliament to ensure that remains. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><title>Roads: Ipswich Motorway</title><page.no>13220</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Ipswich Motorway</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>13220</page.no><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name><name.id>83E</name.id><electorate>Oxley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is pretty hard to start any speech in this place this week without mentioning war, because this government have committed Australia and Australian troops to war. They have committed us to a wrong war, and the only arguments that they can put forward are that 12 years is too long, we have got to go in, we have to be part of this action and so forth. What I want to do here today is not so much talk about war, because I actually want to talk about domestic issues in my electorate. But I want to make one thing very clear: although this government talks about sending the wrong message to other rogue states, it has just now been complicit in sending the ultimate wrong message. The message to states like North Korea is: `If you don't toe the line, we're going to come and get you.' It is the axis of evil speech. So what is North Korea doing in reaction to that? It is arming itself to the teeth; it is ensuring it has weapons of mass destruction; it is ensuring that it has nuclear weapons; and it is ensuring that, in the event that it is next, it will strike first. That concerns me more than anything else. It is something that this government should be concerned about and which they refuse to talk about. Because while they plan for war and do not plan for peace, they also do not plan for what will happen after this war.</para></talk.start><para>That leads me to mentioning a number of domestic issues in my electorate. One is the great concern that the constituents of Oxley have in relation to this war. I can say that the great majority of them are against war. Again, they are against it on the simple basis that they believe it is wrong. People are hurting on all sorts of fronts. While the government so eagerly trumpets how great the economy is and how low interest rates are, why aren't the people sharing in the economy? Why aren't ordinary people actually benefiting from this great, strong economy? It is because it is doing well for some—the elite two, three, four or five per cent—but it is not doing well for the rest of Australia, for ordinary Australians, for the Howard battlers that this government has now forgotten.</para><para>The other issue I want to raise is the Ipswich motorway. The Ipswich motorway is an absolute tragedy—and not only for the constituents of Oxley but also for the constituents of Blair, the Liberal seat next to mine, and every other electorate that either uses or has to commute through it. It is a disaster not waiting to happen but happening every day. Every day there are traffic jams. Every day there is an accident. Every day something tragic occurs on that road. There is one thing this government cannot run away from or hide from, and that is a federally funded road. </para><para>A little while ago this government attempted to go down the path of fixing this road. It gave the Queensland state government $2 million—thank you very much—to put in place a master plan to study what the Ipswich road should look like under an upgrade. It was one of the best consultation processes we have ever seen. It was a fantastic outcome and a great plan—in fact, so good that it spooked the federal government. The federal government now has a very good upgrade plan for the Ipswich motorway, but will not pay for it because it is not committed to fixing it. I have been pursuing the minister for transport and anybody who will listen to me as to why this government will not make a commitment to the people of Queensland, to people in its own electorate of Blair, the people who drive through to Warwick and Toowoomba—the people everywhere in that region who need to use that road. </para><para>The best evidence I have, as at today, of the government's lack of commitment to fixing this road was from Minister Tuckey, when he was acting in the role of minister for transport and replied to my letter. He said this:</para><quote><para>The federal government has some reservations as to the viability of the Queensland government's preferred solution, the widening of the Ipswich Motorway along its current alignment. I believe that there may be better options which have already been raised and need to be more fully explored. </para></quote><para>Anybody who reads that will understand the jargon. When the government talks about `better options', it is saying, `We are not committed to this road. We will look at every other potential option, no matter what the cost, but we are not committed to fixing the Ipswich motorway. That is what this government keeps telling the people of Blair and Oxley. That is what it keeps telling the people of Queensland. The government cannot turn its back and say, `It is a state issue'—it is a federally funded road. This government refuses to make a commitment to fix that road. It refuses to make a commitment to the Ipswich community and the people of Ipswich. The road is not only dangerous, causing the destruction of property and taking away people's lives, but also affects our economy. Our economy in Ipswich is suffering greatly because we do not have a good solid transport system, a backbone through the area. </para><para>While members in other seats get federal road funding to fix their roads, none is coming to Queensland. None is coming to the electorates that need it. It is about time this government stopped shirking its responsibility and turning its back on the people of Oxley, and made a commitment to fund the road.

He was instrumental in establishing the Jimboomba support group. Dave is also a Vietnam vet. He has assisted many Vietnam veterans and other military members of all services in obtaining recognition for their war and peace action medical problems. Dave has been a real inspiration to those people and nothing has ever been too much trouble for him.

Prior to moving to Queensland, Dave was the State Emergency Controller in Port Macquarie and Campbelltown. He attended the Kempsey bus crash, the Granville train disaster and Cyclone Tracy in Darwin. Dave has worked with the New South Wales Corrective Services and was promoted to officer status. He also received a Correctional Service medal. Dave is a special man and I have witnessed first-hand the tremendous support that he gives to ensure that the lives of our veterans are made easier.

St Kilda and Middle Park are areas within my electorate. Captain Jackson's branch of the Liberal Party has also passed a motion condemning the war and calling on Mr Howard to bring Australian troops home. This may be a desperate attempt by Captain Jackson to attract business.

Protests against the war should be directed at the government, not at Australian troops.</para><para>I want to give a bit more detail on this extraordinary activity by the president of the Liberal Party in my electorate. He apparently changed the message on his answering machine at the bed and breakfast to say, `Due to strained relations in the Middle East and Iraq, we cannot accept for the time being US or Israeli citizens.' When he was asked questions about this by the Equal Opportunity Commissioner, he conceded that turning away two nationalities was discriminatory, but he said, `I really couldn't care less. It is discrimination but it is for political reasons.' Apparently his break out from the government's policy is to be discussed at the Liberal Party's state council next week and he will urge the federal government to freeze all military involvement in Iraq. The federal government's commitment to the war, he said, would hurt the Liberal Party and the coalition at the polls.

All he wanted to know was where the Sydney Institute money comes from. That is a fair question about an organisation that tries to influence public life and public policy in this country. She did everything she could to avoid the truth and everything she could to avoid mentioning the funding they received from Rodney Adler—one of Australia's most notorious figures in the corporate world. This is the Sydney Institute pattern—no annual report, no financial returns lodged with ASIC and no honesty in dealing with public requests for information. </para><para>The truth is that we need some new laws in this country. If it is good enough for politicians to declare our pecuniary interests and where our election donations come from and if it is good enough for journalists to declare their financial interests, then what about think-tanks? Surely, as they have an important role in public life seeking to influence opinion and mould public policy, they should declare where the money comes from. They should be more open and transparent than the deception of the Sydney Institute. That institute is to be condemned and we need some laws to force them to declare their funding sources. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</title><page.no>13225</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>13225</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was interested to see some remarks by the Minister for Small Business and Tourism published today. Yesterday at the National Press Club, the minister said that what had eventually persuaded him to join in support of the coalition of the willing were the prospects it provided for a solution to the problem of peace in the Middle East. It was also his view that it created the renewed potential for the achievement of a Palestinian state. It is true that one of the issues cited as a reason for the invasion of Iraq is the support for terrorism by the Iraqi administration. The most indisputable proof of that support is Saddam Hussein's famously self-publicised support of $US25,000 cash for the families of suicide bombers in Palestine.</para></talk.start><para>I want to say as the chair of the Australia-Palestine parliamentary group that I have a profound sympathy with the cause of the Palestinian people, yet I have no instinctive hostility to the cause and the legitimate aspirations of the Jewish people in Israel. Clearly though, one of the outstanding tasks for this generation of public leaders around the world is to achieve a resolution to this problem. There can be no doubt that the seething sense of injustice that the failure to resolve the Palestinian question has caused, throughout the Middle East in particular but in other places around the world, blows wind into the sails of those who are tempted by the route of political terror. For all of us who would aspire to the title of humanitarian, however well or poorly we meet that aspiration, we have to dedicate our creativity, our resources and our energy to finding a resolution to this problem.</para><para>Can I express my deep disappointment that the Sharon government seems to be walking further and further away from the table of negotiation and from the path of genuine movement towards peace. There has been an apparently unilateral decision to reject any road map to peace that may come from the US administration. On the Israeli side, there has apparently been a stepping back from the idea of a sovereign state for the Palestinians as the objective of a peace process to something less. At the same time, we have had conciliatory moves from the Palestinians including, for the first time, a voluntary initiative towards greater power sharing by the senior leadership of the Palestinian cause—which has certainly been welcomed by the international community. While I am supporting my government's commitment to the so-called coalition of the willing, I want to make it clear that it represents no diminution of our commitment to the satisfaction of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to a secure homeland—in fact, it represents an increase in our commitment. It is possible that the establishment of a democratic government, besides Israel, in the Middle East, will actually strengthen the hand of the Palestinians. That is certainly my hope.</para><para>Finally, the most demoralising aspect for me of the performance by the Israeli government has been the support for continued housing settlements in the occupied territories. If there is to be peace in the Middle East, it will be based on the creation of a viable Palestinian state. If that state is to be viable, it cannot be honeycombed by Jewish settlements throughout the Palestinian territories. I urge the government of Israel to communicate a message of hope to the world by taking a much more constructive and proactive approach towards the road map to peace by withdrawing the settlements and by restoring the objective of a sovereign Palestinian state as the goal of the peace process.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Greenway Electorate: Mary Immaculate Primary School</title><page.no>13226</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>13226</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This afternoon I would like to speak about peace. I invite honourable members to come to my parliamentary office at R2.95 to see a magnificent display of doves that have been cut out and written on by students from a school in my electorate, the Mary Immaculate Primary School at Quakers Hill. These were presented to me last week quite unexpectedly. They show the strength of the feeling out there in the community to the war in Iraq. I would like to demonstrate to the Main Committee the efforts that the children at this particular school have gone to just to get the message through that they are very strongly in favour of peace and, of course, against the war. To emphasise the strength of their argument, each one of these doves that have been cut out has a message on it. In most cases it is a prayer, and the name of the student who has written the prayer is on the back of the dove. I think it is a great indication that the general public out there, particularly the children, feel very strongly about this issue. They realise that once a war starts in Iraq the children of Iraq, in particular, will suffer.</para></talk.start><para>I am very proud of the fact that, as I said, quite unexpectedly when I went out to present some badges at the Mary Immaculate Primary School at Quakers Hill last week, the students presented me with this quite large box of doves.

I would certainly like the opportunity, maybe next week when the pressure eases a little, to be able to present these doves directly to the Prime Minister. In the meantime, as I indicated when I commenced my speech, I would certainly be very happy if any honourable members would like to come to my parliamentary office at R2.95 to see the magnificent display of these indications of peace by students from the Mary Immaculate Primary School at Quakers Hill.

The Board of the TIO has also made a decision to amend the TIO's constitution to re-affirm its jurisdiction in debt recovery practices.  This will ensure that the telecommunications company will remain responsible to its customers and to the TIO in relation to debt recovery complaints, notwithstanding that the debt may have been sold to a debt recovery company.     </para><para>If the TIO upholds a complaint, the TIO can make a binding determination on the telecommunications company requiring payment of compensation.  If the TIO considers that there are systemic complaints about the debt recovery practices of any telecommunications company, the TIO can refer the matter to the Australian Communications Authority (ACA) or the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).  </para><para>(2)	No.  See answer to part (1).  It is also relevant that paragraph 113(3)(i) under Part 6 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 states that an industry code may be developed to deal with debt collection practices.  The existing Credit Management code developed under the auspices of the Australian Communications Industry Forum sets out minimum practices that must be observed by providers in this area.  The code has been registered with the ACA, and the ACA may direct any non-compliant telecommunications company to comply with the code.  The code is currently being revised following a public consultation process, prior to being submitted to the ACA for registration.  The practice of revising industry codes every two years ensures that they address ongoing community concerns.</para><para>(3)	The TIO has advised that, as debt recovery agencies are not required to be members of the TIO scheme, data on complaints about these debt recovery agencies is not collected.  When the TIO receives a complaint regarding the conduct of a debt recovery agency, it is recorded and taken up with the telecommunications company on whose behalf that the agency is acting.  It is important to note that the figures given in (a) and (b) below relate to complaints against telecommunications companies, not debt recovery agencies. </para><para>The TIO also advised that changes were made to its complaint-handling database and corresponding complaint categories at the beginning of the 2001-02 financial year.  Data for credit control debt related complaints in 2000-01 and 2001-02 is not directly comparable, as data for 2000-01 covers all credit control debt related complaints, whereas data for 2001-02 relates to credit control complaints about debt recovery only. </para><para>	(a)	In 2000-01, the TIO has advised that 3,720 credit control debt related complaints were made against telecommunications companies.  </para><para>	(b)	In 2001-02, the TIO has advised that 1,468 debt recovery credit control complaints were made against telecommunications companies.
