I did make a comment to the member for Parramatta in relation to payment, because the record says so. But, indeed, the very point made was that the member's representations were rejected by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, and I asked what changed apart from the money. All I am saying is: if the member for Parramatta takes offence, I withdraw the remark. But I make the point that my objection was not to him making representations—which the minister rejected—on behalf of his constituent. The whole allegation yesterday was not that the member for Parramatta was doing wrong; we wanted to know the motives of the minister.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I will pick up on the point made by the Leader of the Opposition from the chair's perspective. The Leader of the Opposition indicated—understandably, in the heat of the moment—that he had not made a comment to the member for Parramatta. In fact, he had. That was the matter I sought to have clarified. Clearly, the contents of that remark were deemed, not unreasonably, by the Leader of the House to have been offensive to the member for Parramatta in the context in which they are contained in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.

I said:</para></talk.start></continue><para>Mr Speaker, I made no comment directed to the member for Parramatta in relation to payment.</para><para>Clearly, that was wrong; I did. But if you read the rest of the comments you will see that what I was saying to the member for Parramatta effectively implied that he had made representations which were ineffective, and he was trying to do the right thing as a good local member. My complaint was directed at the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs for not having followed the representations of the member but for then, we believe, subsequently being influenced by another factor. Time will tell in relation to that. That has been the subject of questions in the parliament.

The Leader of the Opposition has volunteered to do so. In that context, I believe the matter is closed. The concern for the chair at the time was that the Leader of the Opposition genuinely believed he had not made a comment directed to the member for Parramatta, and he has subsequently indicated this morning that, if that was the case, it was an error of judgment on his part.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EZ5</name.id><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Abbott</name></talker><para>—It was the case.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—It was the case, and he has indicated that it was an error of judgment on his part.

The phase-out threshold for the low income tax offset will also be increased from 1 July 2003 to $21,600.</para><para>As a result of these changes, a more generous low income tax offset will be available to more taxpayers. The maximum amount of the low income tax offset of $235 will be available to taxpayers on incomes up to $21,600, with some tax offset able to be claimed by taxpayers with annual incomes of up to $27,475. Taxpayers will also be able to have an annual income of up to $7,382 without paying tax, up from the current $6,882.</para><para>Secondly, for all other taxpayers, from 1 July 2003 the income tax thresholds will be lifted. The upper income limit for the 17 per cent rate will be raised from $20,000 to $21,600, the upper income limit of the 30 per cent rate will be raised from $50,000 to $52,000, and the upper income limit of the 42 per cent rate will be raised from $60,000 to $62,500.</para><para>By providing tax cuts through changes to the thresholds and through a more generous low income tax offset, the largest proportional reductions in income tax are provided to low income earners. A taxpayer with an annual income of $10,000 will pay 16 per cent less tax. Some taxpayers with annual incomes between $20,000 and $27,475 will have their tax cut by $329 per year, or 10.7 per cent. This is a much higher percentage reduction in tax than that provided to higher income earners. For example, those with annual incomes of $85,000 will have a 2.0 per cent reduction in their tax.</para><para>Senior Australians will also benefit from this proposal. The increase in the low income tax offset will mean that recipients of the senior Australians tax offset will be able to earn up to an additional $500 annual income before they have an income tax liability. This means that these senior Australians will pay no tax on annual incomes up to $20,500 for singles compared with $20,000 currently and up to $33,612 for couples compared with $32,612 currently. The Medicare levy thresholds for senior Australians will also be increased to ensure that they do not pay the Medicare levy until they begin to incur an income tax liability.</para><para>These changes mean that Australian taxpayers can keep a higher proportion of the earnings they receive after tax, providing improved incentives to pursue work, advancement and higher skills.</para><para>The tax cuts in the 2003-04 budget provide a responsible balance between the government's key goals. The government is meeting the higher costs of defence and security and is financing other priority programs such as education and health. The budget remains in surplus allowing for debt levels to be further reduced. After providing for the government's legitimate spending proposals, this government is able to return the benefits of good economic management and growth as tax cuts for all Australian taxpayers. </para><para>Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>I commend the bill and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Edwards</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN LAW REFORM COMMISSION</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>15387</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>15387</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>15387</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McGAURAN</name><name.id>XH4</name.id><electorate>Gippsland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Science</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—For the information of honourable members I present volumes 1 and 2 of the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Australian Health Ethics Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council's report on the protection of human genetic information in Australia entitled <inline font-style="italic">Essentially yours</inline><inline font-style="italic">: the Protection of Human Genetic Information in Australia</inline>.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>15387</page.no><id.no>R1809</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>15387</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Vaile</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>15387</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>15387</page.no><name role="metadata">Vaile, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr VAILE</name><name.id>SU5</name.id><electorate>Lyne</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Trade</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The <inline ref="R1809">Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2003</inline> will refocus the EMDG scheme to further assist small and medium business, and in doing so better support the government's goal of doubling the number of exporters by 2006.</para><para>Each year this government invests $150.4 million in the EMDG scheme to support eligible export promotion activities of small and medium Australian businesses by partially reimbursing their eligible expenses.</para><para>The EMDG scheme has been regularly reviewed and is consistently hailed as a benchmark of effectiveness in terms of government industry support programs. In 1999-2000, following extensive econometric analysis of the scheme, Professor Bewley of the University of NSW found that an additional $12 in exports was generated as a result of every grant dollar spent.</para><para>Last year around 3,100 small and medium exporters received grants through the scheme. These businesses generated approximately $5 billion in export revenue and employed over 60,000 Australians to fill their export orders.</para><para>Support was provided to small and medium enterprises across virtually all industries and in all parts of Australia. Importantly, 21 per cent of grant recipients were located in rural and regional Australia.</para><para>Demand for grants has grown considerably in recent years, demonstrating the continued success of the scheme. Austrade informs me that it has received over 4,000 applications for the 2001-02 grant year, an increase of 23 per cent by number on the previous year. Over 1,500 businesses applied for a grant for the first time.</para><para>Small business is one of the fastest growing sectors of the export community and is the key to doubling the number of Australian exporters. Austrade estimates that 97 per cent of all Australian exporting firms are SMEs—these are the businesses that need to be nurtured.</para><para>Accordingly, since 1996 we have made a number of changes to make the EMDG scheme much more attractive and accessible to small business. These include:</para><para>·	Reducing the minimum expenditure required to access the scheme from $30,000 to $15,000;</para><para>·	Doubling the grant rate available to the tourism industry;</para><para>·	Improving access for family businesses;</para><para>·	Reducing red tape and documentation requirements;</para><para>·	Introducing a $5,000 minimum grant; and</para><para>·	Broadening the range of eligible export promotion expenditure.</para><para>The government has also taken steps to improve access of small businesses in rural and regional Australia to the scheme by ensuring that related domestic costs are included in the EMDG Overseas Visits Allowance.</para><para>The changes proposed in the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2003 will further simplify the scheme and put greater focus on assisting small and emerging exporters—that is, those businesses that most need assistance.</para><para>The proposed amendments include:</para><para>·	Reducing the income ceiling for applicants from $50 million to $30 million;</para><para>·	Reducing the maximum grant amount from $200,000 to $150,000;</para><para>·	Reducing the maximum number of grants from 8 to 7;</para><para>·	Removing the $25 million export earnings ceiling; and</para><para>·	Removing the provision for additional grants for entering new markets.</para><para>The proposed changes are to take effect for EMDG claims from the 2003-04 EMDG grant year onwards—in other words, to applications received and grants paid from 1 July 2004 onwards.</para><para>The total budget for the scheme will not be affected by the changes. Funding will remain at $150.4 million—a decision that reflects both the government's firm commitment to the scheme and its strong fiscal stance at a time when there are significant demands on the federal budget. The proposed amendments will, in fact, ensure that a greater number of claimants from the scheme's target group—that is, small business—receive a grant.</para><para>The EMDG scheme is but one important element of our government's comprehensive strategy to double the number of Australian exporters by 2006. Last year for instance, we committed $21.5 million to expanding the TradeStart program over four years. TradeStart is designed to assist small businesses break into potentially lucrative overseas markets through an extensive network of specialist export advisers in 51 locations across metropolitan, rural and regional Australia. It also puts the international market expertise of Austrade's global network across 58 countries at the fingertips of small business.</para><para>And the early signs are encouraging. In 2000-01, the base year for the doubling target, the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated there were approximately 25,000 exporting companies in Australia. Last financial year that number increased by almost 6,500 firms, or over 25 per cent.</para><para>But there is still an enormous amount of work to be done. In considering this bill it is important to keep in mind that the EMDG scheme is all about assisting small businesses to become sustainable exporters.</para><para>One such business is Queensland company Aleis International. Since humble beginnings in 1987, Aleis now provides its electronic livestock identification products to most major properties, saleyards and abattoirs across Australia. In the last few years the company has looked at expanding into overseas markets and recently won a tender (the biggest of its type) to provide electronic identification equipment for the entire cattle herd in Botswana. In 2002 Aleis received its first grant under the EMDG scheme enabling it to defray some of the costs associated with marketing its products around the globe.</para><para>Aleis and thousands of small companies like it are the unsung heroes of Australia's continued economic success. This bill will ensure that EMDG funding is focused on cultivating small and emerging exporters such as Aleis, and in turn contribute to the long-term strength of the Australian economy.</para><para>In conclusion, I would like to reinforce the point that the government is better targeting the EMDG scheme at a time when there are significant demands on the budget. We believe that the proposed changes, as outlined in the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2003, will ensure the program continues to assist those businesses in most need—small and medium exporters.

Following recommendations from the review of cultural agencies within the Communications, Information Technology and the Arts portfolio, the government has decided that ScreenSound Australia—the National Screen and Sound Archive—and the Australian Film Commission (AFC) should be integrated into a single statutory agency.</para><para>In taking this decision the government has taken into account the implications for the cultural objectives of the agencies, the need for appropriate governance arrangements and relationships with key stakeholders. Accordingly, the government considers that integrating the AFC and ScreenSound Australia, a current program of the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, will provide real benefits and opportunities for both organisations and the combined constituencies that they represent and serve.</para><para>The AFC is the Commonwealth's primary agency for supporting film, television and interactive media production and distribution and their creators. The AFC also supports activities and events that provide the wider Australian community, including regional Australians, with access to Australian audiovisual product. ScreenSound Australia is the national institution responsible for preserving, documenting and interpreting the Australian experience in audiovisual media.</para><para>The proposed amendments will, for the first time, give clear recognition in Commonwealth legislation to the important work of collecting and preserving the nation's sound and visual heritage. Specifically, the amendments will articulate a broader cultural role for the AFC by conferring on it express functions and powers in relation to the development, maintenance and exhibition of a collection of film and/or sound recordings, supporting documentation such as scripts and artefacts such as original film posters.</para><para>This bill amends the Australian Film Commission Act 1975 to enable the transfer of administrative responsibility for ScreenSound Australia to the AFC. It will ensure that the AFC has the functions and powers that will enable it to properly manage, maintain and exhibit the national screen and sound collection and it facilitates the transfer of relevant Commonwealth assets, liabilities, contractual rights and obligations, and records to the AFC. ScreenSound Australia staff are currently employed under the Public Service Act 1999. To ensure no disadvantage to staff, the bill also provides the AFC with the power to employ staff under the Public Service Act. This bill establishes a chief executive officer position within the AFC to support these arrangements.</para><para>The synergies created by combining the resources of ScreenSound Australia and the AFC will expand the scope and focus of national screen culture activities and enhance coordination. Links between Australian audiovisual heritage resources and the broader sound, film and television industry will be improved as will educational and exhibition activities. Combining ScreenSound's extensive collection of screen and sound material with the AFC's ability to support national exhibition programs will ensure that more Australians than ever, particularly in regional areas, are able to enjoy the unique audiovisual resources in ScreenSound's collection. The combined agency will therefore be in a stronger position to provide national leadership in enhancing access to, and understanding of, audiovisual culture.</para><para>As a former arts minister with responsibility for the Australian Film Commission and ScreenSound Australia, I strongly endorse this very forward-looking reform which will benefit not just the two institutions and the people who constitute them but also the wider cultural sector and especially film, television and radio. I wish to congratulate one person in particular, Mr Peter Rush, who headed the cultural review of agencies and institutions within the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. I have experience with Mr Rush, who was a former departmental liaison officer in my office. It was a difficult task that he and his colleagues within the department embraced with enthusiasm and imagination.</para><para>One of the results has been the transfer of Questacon, the National Science and Technology Centre, to my Department of Education, Science and Training. The review looked at the proper purpose of our valued and important cultural institutions and sought to reshape them in such a way that they will continue to better serve their objectives. Questacon's transfer to the Department of Education, Science and Training makes perfect sense because Questacon's major objective is to promote and educate on science and technology; it is not a collecting institution. </para><para>I wish to thank everybody within the department and within the AFC and ScreenSound for their cooperation with and input into the cultural review within the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. The review has led to what I believe will be a consolidation and an enhancement of the AFC and ScreenSound well into the future to the benefit of Australia's artistic and cultural objectives.

Schedule 1 also increases the Medicare levy low-income threshold for pensioners below age pension age to ensure that where these pensioners do not have a tax liability they will not also have a Medicare levy liability.</para><para>The amendment to the Medicare levy low-income thresholds will apply to the 2002-03 year of income and later years of income.</para><para>Schedule 2 to this bill will modify the general value shifting regime so that, as a transitional measure, the consequences arising from operating under this regime do not apply to most indirect value shifts involving services. This measure will help to reduce compliance costs for business during the transition to consolidation.</para><para>Schedules 3 to 8 further refine the consolidation regime.</para><para>Schedule 3 will limit the extent to which a linked asset tax cost can change when it comes into a consolidated group, minimising possible distortions in asset values.</para><para>Schedule 4 modifies the cost setting rules to ensure they apply appropriately to a partner's interest in a partnership as well as partnerships that enter consolidated groups.</para><para>Schedules 5 to 7 align the membership rules for multiple entry consolidated groups with the current membership rules for consolidated groups where subsidiaries are held through an interposed non-resident entity. Broadly, only those multiple entry consolidated groups that consolidate before 1 July 2004 will be eligible to have non-resident entities interposed between members of the group.</para><para>Schedule 8 makes some minor technical amendments. These refinements to the consolidation regime will apply from 1 July 2002, which is the commencement date of the consolidation regime.</para><para>Schedule 9 streamlines the procedures under which an individual taxpayer can be released from a tax liability where payment of the liability would entail serious hardship. The existing authority to grant release will be transferred from tax relief boards to the Commissioner of Taxation. Consistent with contemporary review practices, the amendments will also introduce a new right to have tax relief decisions reviewed internally under the Australian Taxation Office objections process, and externally by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal sitting as the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal. Also, the scope of the release arrangements will be expanded to cover instalments of pay-as-you-go and fringe benefits tax under A New Tax System.</para><para>Schedule 10 will amend the imputation rules to allow New Zealand companies to choose to enter the Australian imputation system. A New Zealand company will be able to maintain the Australian franking account and attach Australian franking credits to dividends.</para><para>This measure will enable Australian shareholders of New Zealand companies deriving income in Australia to receive franking credits, and consequently a tax offset, for Australian tax paid on that income.</para><para>This measure fulfils Australia's commitment to the reform of triangular taxation. It reflects the commitment of this government to the continued strengthening of the Closer Economic Relations Agreement between Australia and New Zealand and the promotion of trans-Tasman business.</para><para>Schedule 11 amends the GST Act and the GST Transition Act to apply the GST insurance provisions to payments and supplies made in settlement of claims arising under a compulsory third-party scheme. The GST insurance provisions are also extended to apply to transactions undertaken by insurers, pursuant to an agreement to share the cost of settlements made under a compulsory third-party scheme.</para><para>Lastly, Schedule 12 to this bill provides for the establishment of a new category of deductible gift recipient, namely, a register of harm prevention charities.

in international terrorism.</para><para>And they marked the beginning of what has become known as the war against terrorism.</para><para>Just 13 months later, the terrible reality of this war was brought home to Australia with a bomb attack on Bali, a favourite destination of Australian holiday-makers.</para><para>Recent bomb blasts in Saudi Arabia and Morocco have killed an estimated 66 people, including at least one Australian.</para><para>Another Australian was killed by a suicide bomber in Iraq.</para><para>Terrorism is clearly not an abstract phenomenon, and not one from which any country is isolated.</para><para>In recent months we have witnessed major developments in the war against terrorism.</para><para>Key al-Qaeda figures have been captured, the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein has been dismantled and the criminal proceedings against those alleged to be responsible for the bombings in Bali have commenced.</para><para>But there is no doubt that the war against terrorism is ongoing.</para><para>Australia did not ask for this war.</para><para>We did not ask for Australians to get caught up in terrorist attacks in the United States, in Bali, in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere.</para><para>But they were.</para><para>Australians have been killed and others have been seriously injured in terrorist attacks.</para><para>Terrorism is a very real threat to world peace and it is a real threat to Australia's national security.</para><para>The safety and security of the Australian community and Australian interests is a top priority of the government.</para><para>It is a responsibility this government takes very seriously.</para><para>Our response to the threat of terrorism has been comprehensive and wide ranging.</para><para>And it is a task that is ongoing.</para><para>In the current environment, complacency is not an option.</para><para>As part of our comprehensive approach to the new security environment, the government developed a package of strong counter-terrorism legislation, the bulk of which was passed by the parliament in July last year.</para><para>Included in that legislation were amendments to the criminal code allowing the listing of terrorist organisations, subject to certain strict conditions, including the requirement that the terrorist organisation be identified as such by the United Nations Security Council.</para><para>The requirement that Australia wait for the UN Security Council to agree with our own assessment of what constitutes a threat to Australians and Australian interests before we can act was an amendment insisted upon by the opposition.</para><para>The government argued at the time that this potentially created problems where Australia identifies threats by terrorist organisations that do not interest members of the UN Security Council.</para><para>UN lists are limited to organisations with links to al-Qaeda and the Taliban.</para><para>Australia is currently in the unsatisfactory position that we cannot act independently of the United Nations to list a terrorist organisation posing a threat to Australia and Australian interests.</para><para>Other countries can decide for themselves which terrorist organisations pose a threat to their citizens and to their interests and act accordingly.</para><para>In fact we know of no other country whose power to list terrorist organisations is linked to the United Nations.</para><para>But, thanks to the opposition, Australia cannot act independently of the United Nations Security Council.</para><para>We cannot list the terrorist wing of Hezbollah because it has not been formally identified as a terrorist organisation by the UN Security Council.</para><para>Yet we have advice from ASIO that there is evidence that this organisation engages in terrorist activity and has the capacity to do so globally.</para><para>Indeed the US, the UK and Canada have all listed the terrorist wing of Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation under their laws.</para><para>The government has moved quickly to list the terrorist organisations under our laws.</para><para>However, the Security Council has only ever operated as a mechanism for identifying terrorist organisations linked to the Taliban and al-Qaeda, under resolutions 1267 and 1333.</para><para>As is the case with the terrorist wing of Hezbollah, we cannot list a terrorist organisation that has not been formally identified as a terrorist organisation by the UN Security Council.</para><para>Of course, where there is a connection to al-Qaeda we can approach the United Nations to identify an organisation as a terrorist organisation.</para><para>We did this in the case of Jemaah Islamiah.</para><para>Beyond that, our current legislative arrangements constrain our ability to act in our national interest and to independently list a terrorist organisation, thereby attracting the full weight of the criminal law.</para><para>The current mechanism has proved to be unworkable.</para><para>This is particularly anomalous given that the Hezbollah External Security Organisation has been listed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs under the Charter of the United Nations Act as a terrorist entity, the assets of which must be frozen in Australia.</para><para>It is clear that we must have the capacity to independently assess and act on threats to Australians and Australian interests without waiting to see if the rest of the world agrees.</para><para>The <inline ref="R1808">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill</inline> will amend part 5.3 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 by removing the requirement for there to be a relevant Security Council decision in place before we can list organisations as terrorist organisations for the purpose of our domestic criminal law.</para><para>The bill gives to us independence to make our own decisions about our national security and the application of our criminal laws.</para><para>It allows us to list terrorist organisations based on the advice of our intelligence agencies and an assessment of our national interest and security needs.</para><para>And it allows us to de-list organisations that cease to meet the definition of a terrorist organisation.</para><para>The bill retains a number of important safeguards on the exercise of the listing power.</para><para>Importantly, to list an organisation as a terrorist organisation in regulations, the Attorney-General must make a deliberate and reasoned decision that an organisation is engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act before listing that organisation as a terrorist organisation.</para><para>That decision will be subject to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, which provides an important safeguard on the exercise of this discretion.</para><para>And any regulation is subject to disallowance by parliament.</para><para>Further, the bill preserves the requirement that the regulations listing a terrorist organisation cease to have effect on the second anniversary of the day on which they take effect.</para><para>This is in addition to the obligation imposed on the Attorney-General to de-list organisations when he or she is no longer satisfied that the organisation meets the criteria for defining a terrorist organisation.</para><para>If passed, this bill will allow us to move quickly to list those organisations that, notwithstanding the absence of a Security Council decision, should be appropriately identified as terrorist organisations under Australian law.</para><para>This bill is further evidence of the government's continuing commitment to taking all appropriate action to ensure that terrorist threats are dealt with effectively and expeditiously.</para><para>And it is clear that Australia needs to have this independence.</para><para>But the opposition has indicated that it will not support the first bill.</para><para>In such circumstances, the government is introducing a second bill, the Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Bill 2003 that will allow the terrorist wing of Hezbollah to be listed in regulations, provided the statutory criteria for listing are met.</para><para>We are introducing this second bill because we recognise the need to take swift action—that is why we proposed the amendments to the opposition and the states and territories some two months ago.</para><para>The simple fact is that we cannot wait for the opposition to wake up to the problems they created and support our first bill.</para><para>As a result of the second bill, the Hezbollah terrorist wing will be listed as a terrorist organisation for the purpose of the Criminal Code provided that the Attorney-General is satisfied that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act, whether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur.</para><para>If the Attorney-General is so satisfied, a public statement to that effect will be issued.</para><para>Appropriate regulations will be made and gazetted with effect from the date of that announcement.</para><para>Any such announcement will be widely publicised in both print and electronic media.</para><para>And that announcement will only be made after consideration of available, relevant intelligence that satisfies the Attorney-General that the criteria for listing an organisation as a terrorist organisation have been met.</para><para>The opposition has admitted that their UN listing process is flawed by acknowledging the inability to list the terrorist wing of Hezbollah.</para><para>However, the opposition has also indicated that it will not support a move to make us independent of the United Nations Security Council processes.</para><para>In an attempt to cover up its mistake, the Leader of the Opposition has announced his intention to introduce legislation specifically listing Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation directly in the legislation.</para><para>This is despite knowing that their so-called solution is constitutionally uncertain.</para><para>As I informed the House yesterday, our legal advice is that the opposition's proposal gives rise to constitutional uncertainty.</para><para>That should clearly be avoided in such important legislation.</para><para>Singling out organisations by name in legislation, without mechanisms to overcome constitutional concerns, could invite challenges to validity on potentially wider grounds than simply lack of power.</para><para>This constitutional uncertainty could undermine future prosecutions of terrorists and that is something the government simply will not accept.</para><para>Our legal advice is to the effect that our second bill will not give rise to the same constitutional uncertainties that plague the opposition's proposal.</para><para>This bill is intended to be complementary, not an alternative, to the first bill.</para><para>Together, they create a legislative framework that deals with the immediate issue of the security threat represented by the terrorist wing of Hezbollah, and the longer term issue of how Australia can act independently of the Security Council in relation to our domestic criminal laws.</para><para>While we welcome the opposition's indication that it will support the government's Hezbollah specific bill, the opposition has indicated that it will continue to obstruct passage of our first bill.</para><para>The government intend to vigorously pursue passage of our first bill.</para><para>The opposition's position on our first bill ignores the longer term problem that we will not be able to act quickly or effectively if other terrorist organisations come to light that pose a potential threat to Australia but have not been listed by the United Nations Security Council.</para><para>It does not solve the longer term problem created by the opposition's UN linked listing provisions.</para><para>That is why we are forced to proceed with two bills.</para><para>This is a serious matter of national security.</para><para>The government will not allow the opposition's obstinance to paralyse us and prevent what must be done to ensure the safety and security of Australia and Australia's interests.</para><para>We trust that

The government's sandwich and milkshake tax cuts of just $4 a week will be wiped out many times over by the introduction of a $20 up-front fee for visiting GPs and a 30 per cent surcharge on HECS. Yet again, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, has failed to stand up and fight for the working families of my electorate. The parliament is entitled to ask: why is it that budget after budget, year after year, the Treasurer refuses to stand up and fight? The truth is that the Treasurer will not stand up and fight for himself, let alone for the hardworking families of middle Australia. This is one of the golden rules of public life: if a politician will not stand up and fight for himself, there is no way he will stand up and fight for his constituents. Indeed, the Treasurer has a bad record, a lifelong record, of dogging a serious fight. As I said yesterday in question time, if you opened up that chest of his, all you would find is a heart the size of a split pea.</para></talk.start><para>The Treasurer has a very bad history of dogging it. He dogged it when he moved from Young Labor to the Liberal Party; he dogged it when he moved from the Baptist Church to the Anglican Church. How do you start your time in politics as a Young Labor Baptist and end up a Liberal Party Anglican? I have heard about the road to Damascus, but this is ridiculous—he started as a Young Labor Baptist and ended up as a Liberal Party Anglican. Indeed, in this place we have had some very bad rats over the years: names like Billy Hughes and Joe Lyons come to mind. But the Treasurer, Mr Costello, is the first member of the House of Representatives to have changed both his political party and his religion. What a daily double: the transfer of political party affiliation plus religion.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84S</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'Byrne</name></talker><para>—How does he go in the footy?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name></talker><para>—If you were at the Essendon Football Club, as the member for Bass points out, you would be very worried about that.

He has got a bad record, a lifelong record, of dogging a serious fight.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I refer the House to Shaun Carney's biography of the Treasurer, produced in recent times. At page 64 he records an incident in the politics of Monash University, when the Treasurer was confronted by one of his student colleagues, Red Bingham. Mr Shaun Carney writes that Red Bingham:</para><para>... confronted Costello in the MAS office, challenged him about refusing to fund <inline font-style="italic">Piranha </inline>and then belted him. Costello's cries of `Red, Red, stop hitting me' became the stuff of legend on the left; a sign that Costello talked tough but was really just a cream puff.</para><para>There you have it. He dogged a fight; he would not stand up and fight for himself. He was lying on his back like a mangy dog, saying, `Red, Red, stop hitting me'. It is the stuff of legend at Monash, and it is now the stuff of a disappointing budget in this House of Representatives. Carney goes on to say that in a subsequent newspaper article in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> Mr Costello was quoted as describing his political stance as `moderate ALP'. He has come a long way in terms of his political shift of allegiance, but that style, that refusal to stand up and fight for himself, is still evident. He is still the same Peter Costello who refuses to stand up and fight for himself. How can anyone who will not fight for themself in public life ever fight for the hardworking families of middle Australia?</para><para>We have many great sayings in Australian politics: Malcolm Fraser, `Life wasn't meant to be easy'; Gough Whitlam, `Nothing will save the Governor-General'; little Richo, `Whatever it takes'; and now we have Peter Costello saying, `Don't hit me, Red.' That was his lasting memory and testament at Monash University. The Treasurer will not stand up and fight for himself; he will not stand up and fight for the working families of this country and so, too, he will not stand up and fight for the truth on the economic record of this nation. </para><para>We heard in question time following the budget that the Treasurer was claiming there had been a smaller tax cut than his own $4 a week. Four dollars a week is not much; as Senator Vanstone said, it will not buy you a sandwich and a milkshake. Mr Costello was trying to claim that there had, in fact, been smaller tax cuts, and he referred to the l-a-w tax cuts of the Keating government. He is playing fast and loose with the truth because the l-a-w tax cuts were paid in the 1993-94 budget. They were paid from 15 November 1993—eight months before they were planned—at a full-year cost to the budget of $3.45 billion. These figures are revealed in table 2 of the revenue measures on page 4.5 of statement 2 of the 1993 budget papers. These tax cuts were paid in advance, eight months before planned, and were much larger than the tax cuts that are now before the House. In fact, the Treasurer misled the House two weeks ago in telling us that these tax cuts—and he was talking about the l-a-w tax cuts—did not pay $1 to one person for one day when, in fact, the average level of tax relief in 1993 was $8 per week. The Treasurer should now apologise to the House for wilfully misleading it. In fact, the Treasurer himself is the culprit of any problem with the 1993 tax cuts.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Order!

The Treasurer was the culprit because in the 1996 election campaign, along with the Prime Minister, he promised to keep the second half of the l-a-w tax cuts. The first half were paid in full in advance, and the Treasurer and the Prime Minister promised to keep the second half, to be paid as a three per cent superannuation co-contribution, at a full-year cost to the budget of $4.34 billion. So the breach of the l-a-w tax cuts in fact was from the Treasurer himself, Mr Costello. He presents himself in this House day after day as the gamekeeper when in fact he is the poacher. He is the poacher; he is the one who, after the 1996 election campaign, broke his promise to pay the second half of the tax cuts in the form of a three per cent superannuation co-contribution.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Having put those matters on the public record, having explained to the House how the Treasurer never stands up to fight for himself—so do not expect him to fight for the families of middle Australia—let me explain the ways in which he has let down and disappointed the hardworking families in my constituency in the south-west of Sydney. This is a very bad budget for the people of my electorate. It attacks working families and it attacks the essential community services on which they rely. It attacks Medicare and bulk-billing. Yesterday in the House during the debate on health funding legislation, I explained the way in which my electorate has the most to lose out of the government's attack on bulk-billing and how, in the south-west of Sydney, we are known as the `children's capital' of Australia and also as the `bulk-billing capital of the nation' with 95 per cent of doctors offering a bulk-billing service to their patients. People know that these changes are bad and that, in the south-west of Sydney, we have the most to lose as the government winds back the provision of bulk-billing around the country. In the electorate of Werriwa, we have the most to lose. I strongly oppose the dismantling of Medicare; I strongly oppose the dismantling of bulk-billing. I will stand up as forcefully as I can for the principles of universal health care in my electorate.</para><para>So, too, the government is making it tougher for families in my electorate with its 30 per cent increase in higher education fees. In particular, this punishes our local hero, the University of Western Sydney. The historic role of the university is to ensure that many students, the first generation and their families, go on to have a higher education. But, unhappily, under the Howard government the University of Western Sydney has faced nothing but funding cuts and higher fee charges. Since 1996, the university has lost $270 million of federal funding and has lost 3,700 government funded student places. This reduction in capital funding is a savage blow to the University of Western Sydney. The university is now being forced to use licensed club facilities, such as sporting and RSL clubs, to hold its lectures and tutorials. It has not got enough teaching space on campus to make provision for the many students in Western Sydney who need and demand a higher education. It is having to conduct its classes in licensed clubs. It makes you wonder, in a civilised society where education is the great hope for young families, what it has come to when we are using licensed sporting clubs to conduct tutorials and lectures. It is not a good situation for the University of Western Sydney, but it has been forced into it because of the savage funding cuts of the Howard government.</para><para>So, too, the 30 per cent increase in HECS debt is a savage blow to the working families in my electorate. There is only so much debt that low- to middle-income families can carry before they turn their backs on a university education. I know this from my own experience; I know this from growing up in a public housing estate. There is only so much debt that low-income families can carry before they are forced to turn their backs on a higher education. I reject some of the assertions that have been made and some of the barracking that has been going on in the media about the government's changes. I noticed in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of 21 May that Paul Kelly was quoting Bruce Chapman. He said:</para><para>The way poor people view a HECS loan and debt is similar to the way that rich people view them.</para><para>What absolute nonsense! Let them live in a family where the parents argue about debt; let them live in a family where low-income people have disputes about the family budget; let them grow up in a family where the parents argue about debt, and then try and tell me that people from that sort of background have the same views and attitudes to debt as rich people. That is just absolute nonsense. There is a cultural and attitudinal change, not surprisingly, that can make low-income people averse to the carriage of high levels of debt, and that is why these HECS changes are so damaging. Why should a bright student who works hard at school and gets good results be forced away from a higher education because of their aversion to debt? Why, in a fair and decent society, should that happen? I say it should not happen. I think we should have special consideration for the circumstances of low-income families and their particular attitude to debt and we should have a system that is affordable and accessible for all—universal public subsidy of higher education.  </para><para>I know the minister for education, Dr Nelson, is not opposed to the idea of universality in education. Yesterday in the House he gave an answer to a question about private school funding. He said that the Howard government is proud to ensure that all schools in Australia, and non-government schools in particular, have a level of public subsidy and, although the level of subsidy varies from school to school, the government has a system of universal public subsidisation of non-government schools. Why then does it require some Australian students to pay the full fee for their higher education, with absolutely no public subsidy? Why is it that the government supports universal non-government school funding but will not support universal higher education provision in this country? It is a shocking piece of hypocrisy—a shocking contradiction that should not be supported by this parliament.</para><para>I know from my own background—and from my own electorate—that, back in 1978 or 1979, had I been forced to consider high levels of HECS debt, I could not have gone on to a higher education. I am worried that there are many hundreds, if not thousands, of young students in south-western Sydney who are working hard—working their guts out at school and getting good results—and who will find that they are in a similar situation: that, if they have to contemplate high levels of debt at an early stage of their lives, they will turn their backs on a higher education. Effectively, they will have to turn their backs on their very best opportunity in life. I find that disgusting.</para><para>The member for Parramatta talked about the things that make him sick. I feel sick to the stomach at the idea of hardworking students from public housing estates in my electorate thinking: `I can't carry all that debt. I can't carry a 30 per cent increase in debt at an early stage in life. I've heard what has been said about our family budget in the home. I've heard some of the disputes. I'm going to turn my back on education. I'll have to go and look for a job. I won't be able to undertake a university education and do good things for the future.' I find that absolutely sickening and quite barbaric.</para><para>For the Liberal members who do not come across these things—who do not have public housing estates in their electorates, who do not see this part of life and do not see the other side of the track—let me tell you that it exists. I want to do everything I can to ensure there is public universality in the education system so that every single student who works hard and gets good results at school can go on and get a higher education, the thing that so many people in this parliament take for granted. I am very fortunate; I was a beneficiary of the Whitlam education reforms. Higher education at that time was relatively inexpensive, but today it is a different situation. So many students in south-western Sydney will be forced away from their best opportunity in life.</para><para>The minister for education, Dr Nelson, often makes the point that 70 per cent of Australian families do not see the inside of a university. I know one certainty, particularly in my part of the world: 100 per cent of parents hope and pray that their children will see the inside of an Australian university, and they are quite happy to contribute to that system. One hundred per cent of parents hope and pray that their child is successful enough at school to go on to a university education. In a civilised society, where our taxes buy us a slice of civilisation, we should support those parents and ensure that the public subsidies are there to provide the opportunities for bright and hardworking students to go through to a higher education. We should back their aspirations. We should be backing an ambitious Australia, where there is plenty of aspiration for a higher education and plenty of government support for that legitimate ideal.</para><para>The other source of disadvantage in my electorate is the funding cut to the University of Western Sydney and the fact that this university is not classified as a regional university. It will not receive any additional funding from the government. The government funding package has some money for regional universities, but the University of Western Sydney is not classified as a regional institution. This is typical of the Howard government. It has jumped straight from the inner city to pork-barrelling in National Party electorates, jumping straight over the outer suburbs. It has failed to classify UWS as a regional university, thus denying it the extra funding its needs to provide a decent higher education for students in my electorate.</para><para>There are other sources of neglect in this budget. For instance, many parts of my electorate have missed out on being provided with high-speed broadband access—ADSL access—by Telstra. The new suburbs of Cecil Hills, West Hoxton, Greenway Park, Horningsea Park and the western areas of Liverpool have no high-speed broadband access. The government has jumped over the outer suburbs, sent all the Telstra privatisation money to National Party electorates and neglected outer metropolitan areas. The absence of ADSL Internet provision by Telstra is bad for the education of our children. Why shouldn't hardworking students with a computer in their home in Western Sydney have access to high-speed Internet? It is also bad for small business. The whole struggle for 20 or 30 years in my electorate has been to move the jobs, the industry and the investment to where the people have moved in such large numbers. The absence of ADSL access is very bad for small businesses that might want to work out of their home and create new investment and employment opportunities in south-west Sydney. I urge Telstra and the federal government to roll out high-speed broadband access to all parts of metropolitan Sydney, not just the inner city, and to not just pork-barrel National Party electorates. How about doing something? How about looking after the outer suburbs instead of jumping straight over them and neglecting their needs?</para><para>Another source of neglect in this budget is the absence of initiatives for law and order. I believe this is an important issue. We need safe and secure suburbs and streets. The public want solutions. They do not particularly care where law and order solutions come from—whether it is local, state or federal government—they just want a solution. But all the Howard government does is buck-pass the problem on to the states. I support, and Labor supports, the establishment of community safety zones to tackle the social causes of crime. There is recognition that there is a social and community dimension to the crime problem. Areas such as Campbelltown and Liverpool should be targeted for particular remedies. For instance, there is a serious graffiti problem in the Ingleburn township. The chamber of commerce, the local community and some of the local police have been working hard to try to resolve that issue, but they lack the resources to tackle this particular community problem. It is one of the problems that would be targeted by a community safety zone, with additional federal resources to work with the community and the chamber of commerce to get a lasting solution.</para><para>So too is this a government that neglects serious issues of urban environment and urban sprawl in Western Sydney. In our region, we are a very successful multicultural community but we also need to recognise that there has been too much population growth in south-west Sydney and that there is too much population growth planned for the future both through internal and external migration. Labor, of course, has a population policy approach to influence the locational decisions of new arrivals to this country. It is a good approach. It recognises that those regions that want more population growth—such as South Australia, Tasmania and other parts of regional Australia—need and deserve extra migration arrivals. But in south-west Sydney, we need to recognise a population limit. There is only so much growth that our region can accommodate, particularly in terms of the fragile urban environment and particularly in terms of air and water quality problems.</para><para>I strongly oppose the Bringelly development, for instance—the construction of a new city of 300,000 people to the west of Liverpool, carrying a huge volume of cars and extra congestion into our region. The truth is that the existing roads—Cowpasture Road, Camden Valley Way, Campbelltown Road, Kurrajong Road, Bernera Road—cannot cope with the existing suburbs and traffic volume. We do not need a new city in the south-west of Sydney; we need a population limit, good urban planning and, most of all, some provision by the federal government for essential infrastructure. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>15406</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The parliament has before it the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>, the <inline ref="R1796">Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R1797">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>. I am honoured to be a member of the coalition government, which in this budget is handing down its sixth consecutive budget surplus. The performance of the Australian economy has been outstanding against a backdrop of slow world economic growth and the drought. This economic performance is due in no small part to strong economic management by this government. Despite the additional expenditure required for the war on terror, greater demands on home security and the huge cost to government of the drought, this government has again delivered a budget surplus. A surplus has been delivered by Treasurer Costello, along with modest tax cuts, at a time of increased spending on defence and security. </para></talk.start><para>This budget includes very important announcements with respect to higher education and is particularly significant for regional universities. These are far-reaching reforms to the Australian system of higher education. I believe these reforms are balanced and highly focused. Through strengthening our universities, including specific measures for regional universities, the changes introduced in this budget set a framework for the higher education sector and individual institutions to deliver high-quality education for students and to conduct high-quality research. These aims will be accomplished through the $1.5 billion increase in funding to be allocated to higher education over the next four years. The Treasurer told the House that these reforms will be fully in place by 2010, and there will be an increase of 17 per cent over 10 years in real terms.</para><para>Universities will be encouraged, through incentives, to improve their internal governance and workplace relations. Such reforms are due, and they are appropriate. They recognise that universities are tasked with delivering higher education to their students, and they must be efficient and highly focused in that objective. Under the proposed reforms, universities are to be given flexibility in relation to fee-setting. These announcements are designed to produce better outcomes for students, but students will also receive other direct benefits, such as assistance through the new Higher Education Loan Program to help with the payment of fees. The HECS repayment threshold will be raised from $24,365 a year to $30,000, directly alleviating some of the current financial pressures on thousands of graduates and, of course, assisting countless students into the future.</para><para>The HECS system is something which occasionally comes under fire from various quarters, but I have been reading with a great deal of interest some of the commentary in the media over this issue and the budget's higher education reforms. It is interesting to note media reports which have been generally supportive of the proposed reforms. I note comments in an article by Paul Kelly in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of 21 May, which quoted the Australian National University's Bruce Chapman—a former Keating adviser, I might add—and highlighted the point that:</para><para>... the Whitlam government's abolition of fees “had no discernible effects on the socio-economic composition of higher education students”.</para><para>That is an interesting point: there were no discernible effects on the socioeconomic composition of the student population. Most notably, it did not lead to a greater proportion of poor students going to university. The article goes on to state that the overall distribution effect was `from poor to better-off', since there is a greater proportion of better-off students at university. Chapman describes the free university system as `unquestionably regressive'. Kelly makes the important observation that HECS, introduced by Labor with the support of the coalition, `had no detrimental effect on access to university', and that, in a recent paper by Chapman and Chris Ryan, they found that:</para><para> “those from less privileged backgrounds were no more discouraged from attending university in 1999 than they had been in 1988” (when HECS started).</para><para>They formed the view that:</para><para>“There's nothing in a HECS system that disadvantages the poor.”</para><para>The carping, mindless opposition across the chamber should take note of these important points. In fact, HECS is a scheme founded in equity. Under HECS, both students and the government contribute to the cost of education, and the students' contribution is deferred. In fact, the only up-front payment faced by students is the compulsory union fee, and we want to abolish that—unlike Labor and the Democrats. It is important to note that the student contribution to the cost of a degree is deferred, and it is a partial contribution at that. The student actually pays only 27 per cent of the cost of the university education, with the government contributing the other 73 per cent by virtue of many taxpayers who have never seen the inside of a university. As I said earlier, the reforms will also increase the threshold of HECS to $30,000 before repayments start. This scheme is sound, it is fair, it is equitable and it ensures that public higher education is affordable, progressive and sustainable.</para><para>Financially disadvantaged students will be assisted by three new scholarship programs costing $162 million over four years. The package of measures also puts an extra $113 million over four years into quality assurance and promoting Australian education and training to overseas markets—a market which brings in $5 billion in export earnings each year.</para><para>However, I particularly congratulate the government on the specific measures for regional universities in this announcement. One of the cornerstones of the higher education reform package is the proposal to boost regional universities by providing an injection of an additional $122.6 million. It is to the credit of the minister for education that he has recognised the importance of universities in regional Australia and the additional costs and difficulties faced by them as a result of their location. Additional funds will be incorporated into the new Commonwealth grants scheme<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>and will particularly benefit the Coffs Harbour campus of Southern Cross University in my electorate of Cowper. The funds are to be allocated on the basis of regionality, which is to be determined from the size of the campus and its distance from a mainland capital city. I am pleased the Southern Cross University's Coffs Harbour campus will receive the second-highest level of loading allocation in Australia, 7½ per cent, under this measure. This will be a significant and welcome injection of funds into the university and into the Coffs Harbour campus itself. It will benefit the students at the campus and also the wider region, and I thank the minister for education for his work in bringing about these measures which are so beneficial to regional universities and, particularly, the Coffs Harbour campus.</para><para>Professor John Rickard, Vice-Chancellor of Southern Cross University, reacted to this announcement by saying that the budget recognises the situation often faced by universities in regional areas and that they are, in fact, at a disadvantage. He also noted the important contribution that regional universities make. He said that the extra funding coming under this budget could be put into offering components of courses for the first time at the Coffs Harbour campus and also into expanding those programs already in place.</para><para>The Treasurer announced last Tuesday that the budget is setting aside some $161 million for teaching, nursing and other priority courses, and there are to be at least 574 extra places in nursing by 2007. This is a highly commendable measure and it will also be welcomed in the Cowper electorate. I might mention to the House that there are moves afoot at Southern Cross University to establish a course in aged care nursing at Coffs Harbour. This is a particularly relevant and important area for the community in a region which has an ageing demographic. I am hopeful that such a course will be created at the Coffs Harbour campus and that it will become a recognised centre of excellence in this field. It will certainly be something that brings great opportunity for young people and others wishing to enter this expanding vocation.</para><para>A vital part of improving university education for students is the abolition of compulsory union fees. I believe in freedom of association, as opposed to forced association and the compulsory membership of student unions. The abolition of compulsory union fees for students would be welcomed by many students in my electorate. Offering choice is a very important factor, I believe. How can the Labor Party stand for equity when they support compulsory union fees? They do not stand for freedom of association, and that is why they oppose the government's moves to abolish compulsory union fees. I call on those opposite to support the lifting of what is an up-front cash fee on students going to universities. You cannot claim to stand for the rights and interests of students if you cannot stand up for freedom of association.</para><para>This budget has been delivered in a period when the dangers of international terrorism are rising and our national security is at the forefront of our considerations. In the last year there has been considerable cost involved in Australia's commitment to the international coalition against terrorism and, in particular, our endeavours to fight this threat and liberate the Iraqi people from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein and his regime. That is an issue on which I have spoken on a number of occasions in this House. The Treasurer reports that the cost of these commitments to the budget is $645 million, which includes some rehabilitation, reconstruction and humanitarian expenditure. A further $100 million has been committed for urgent humanitarian relief for the Iraqi people.</para><para>There is a continuing commitment of our troops in East Timor at a cost to the budget of some $500 million. The Treasurer announced $2.1 billion over five years in new defence spending, bringing total defence spending up to $15 billion in the coming fiscal year. This is an absolutely necessary area of expenditure. The world is not the place it once was, and we must protect our nation. This government delivers on its commitment to the Australian people to do all it can to ensure that our country is protected from the threats against it. It also delivers on a duty to those who serve on the front line—our Defence Force personnel, our emergency services personnel and so on—to have money there to back them up so that they have the resources they need to do their jobs well.</para><para>The recent announcement of a special operations command in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is a welcome one. It will enable a coordinated approach between federal and state agencies. Through this package, which enhances Australian security arrangements, an additional $152 million will be put into vital intelligence services to add to their counter-terrorism capabilities. I am particularly moved by the budget measure allocating $10.5 million to fund a new intensive care centre for the Sanglah Hospital, in Denpasar, in commemoration of the Australian victims of the 2002 Bali bombing and in recognition of the assistance provided by the Balinese to Australians in a time of need.</para><para>The disability employment assistance area is another key area which will receive a boost in this budget. This $160 million measure will offer assistance to 90,000 people with disabilities across Australia, including hundreds within my electorate of Cowper. This government has been reforming this policy area since 1996 towards a focus on the individual needs of job seekers. The announcements in this budget recognise that different barriers are faced by different supported job seekers, and it puts in place measures which address that fact. I give the following as an example of how these new measures would work. A person with a high support need in rural Australia might decide they want to undertake an IT traineeship. With the funding assistance announced in this budget, the employment service would receive up to $16,660 to help and support the client in ongoing work, up to $7,000 to provide work based personal care, up to $5,000 in travel assistance and another $660 for getting the client the traineeship. This compares with the total of $7,000 in assistance which would currently be available. There is also practical help for businesses employing supported employees, including a $25.4 million package. As I have said, these measures will be of assistance to many thousands of Australians.</para><para>I welcome the regional partnerships announcement<inline font-weight="bold">, </inline>which integrates a number of initiatives for regional Australia into one. It effectively extends the Regional Solutions Program, which was due to expire at the end of the coming fiscal year. The Regional Solutions Program has been a highly successful initiative for regional communities. By way of example, the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Minister Tuckey, recently announced a $52,000 Regional Solutions Program<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>grant for the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol<inline font-weight="bold"> headquarters and communications</inline><inline font-weight="bold"></inline>facility in Coffs Harbour. Not only is this a program which, importantly, injects funds into regional economies like Coffs Harbour, but it helps local communities with projects such as this one, which will immediately enhance communication and search and rescue services provided by the coastal patrol for the many seagoers in the region.</para><para>The Regional Solutions Program is also providing $137,500 in Woolgoolga for a senior citizens centre. A $222,000 grant under the Rural Transaction Centres initiative has established an RTC in Bowraville, which I recently had the pleasure of opening. The RTC program, which will also be rolled into new regional partnerships, provides funds to help small communities such as Bowraville to provide access to services. Those services can include areas such as financial services; postal services; phone, fax and internet services; Medicare Easyclaim; Centrelink; facilities for visiting professionals; printing and secretarial services; insurance and taxation services; and a variety of other state and federal services. These services are vital to regional locations like Bowraville, which are effectively isolated by virtue of low levels of car ownership and a disadvantaged community that exists in that area.</para><para>Whilst the federal government's role in the provision of public health care is limited, with jurisdiction primarily being held by the states and territories, the Commonwealth does play an important role in ensuring access to health care through Medicare and in providing funding assistance to the states and territories for hospitals. This budget includes and builds on some vitally important announcements which have been recently made in relation to Australia's health system.</para><para>The Prime Minister recently announced a range of changes to Medicare at a cost of some $917 million. These changes are designed to increase affordable access to primary health care. There is a particular focus in the package on increasing the availability of general practitioner services to the general public and bulk-billing services to low-income earners, pensioners and others in need. There will be around 234 more places a year for medical courses and an additional 150 GP training places. Importantly, the additional medical school places will be bonded to areas of doctor shortage and the additional training places targeted at rural areas.</para><para>New incentives to encourage doctors to bulk-bill pensioners and holders of Commonwealth concession cards will be put in place. General practitioners who agree to bulk-bill pensioners and Commonwealth concession card holders will receive extra incentive payments. In the electorate of Cowper, that will amount to $5.30 per consultation. They will also receive expedited payment of the Medicare rebate. The new scheme will eliminate the need for patients seeing participating doctors to attend Medicare offices to receive their rebate, which will be received electronically at the surgery.</para><para>Safety nets will be put in place to protect against high out-of-pocket medical costs. Firstly, a new government funded scheme will help pensioners and Commonwealth concession card holders with $500 or more in out-of-pocket costs for out-of-hospital medical services in any year. Secondly, private health insurance cover will be available for out-of-pocket expenses for out-of-hospital services exceeding $1,000 in any year for other patients. The new private health insurance cover will attract the government's 30 per cent rebate.</para><para>Under the Australian health care agreements, the Commonwealth assists states and territories with funding for public hospitals. Negotiations are currently under way for an agreement for the period 2003-08. The Commonwealth has offered the state and territory governments up to an additional $10 billion to help run public hospitals, an increase of 17 per cent in real terms. The total amount to be provided by the federal government is in the order of $42 billion over the next five years.</para><para>This commitment is very important for public health care. I am concerned, however, that the figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare indicate that growth in public hospital funding provided by state and territory governments as a whole has not kept pace with the growth in funding provided by the Commonwealth. The total state and territory share of funding has fallen from 47.2 per cent in 1977-98 to 43.4 per cent in 2001-01, whilst the Commonwealth share has risen from 45.2 per cent to 48.1 per cent over the same period. I am hopeful that this discrepancy in state government funding will be addressed by the Commonwealth's offer under the new Australian health care agreement by committing the states to match federal increases in funding for their hospitals.</para><para>Finally, the government delivers in this budget a personal income tax cut for nine million Australians and, unlike the l-a-w law tax cuts, they will be delivered in full. The size of this tax cut has come under fire from some quarters, including the Australian Labor Party. It is important to note that the Australian Labor Party is a party without any economic or budget credentials whatsoever. The Treasurer has delivered, to his credit, the sixth budget surplus of this government. Members will note that the Labor Party delivered nine deficits in its most recent 13 years of government—plus the budget black hole the party left when it was removed from office in 1996. I might add that this debt was incurred at the same time the party was conducting asset sales. So the Labor Party could not even balance the budget while selling off the family silver.</para><para>Compare that with the coalition and the Treasurer, who in this package delivers a $2.2 billion budget surplus at a time of continuing global economic uncertainty and heavily increased demands on the budget in defence and other areas. On top of that surplus, the Treasurer delivers a tax cut. There have been some ill-informed remarks about the size of the tax cuts. Let us look at those tax cuts. Firstly, it is a reduction in tax for nine million Australians. Secondly, it is a tax cut which amounts to $2.4 billion in the coming fiscal year and $10.7 billion across the period of the forward estimates. That is a $2.4 billion injection into the economy, giving money back to the Australian people. This tax cut, in my view, is significant. It displays our position on these matters and it distinguishes us from the Labor Party—in that this government will return the money of the people wherever possible. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>15411</page.no><name role="metadata">Crosio, Janice, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs CROSIO</name><name.id>7T4</name.id><electorate>Prospect</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>. The budget papers tabled by the Treasurer provide the Australian public with a stark choice—a government driven by an ideological obsession to move service provision away from the state and into the private sector, or the Labor Party, which is committed to providing what we regard as essential services to our community. And no two areas are more important for the wellbeing of our society than health and education. The government has decided that these two areas of public policy require reform. I cannot argue with that. After seven years of dwindling funding from the government, they obviously do. However, it has decided that individuals and families will have to take it upon themselves to fund their own health and education needs.</para></talk.start><para>Ironically, even though the government has decided that it intends to reduce its role as a service provider, it is increasing its intake of revenue from the community. Full of irony, isn't it? Taxing the life out of the battlers so it can get its spin doctors to crow about a budget surplus. It is great for the financial markets but cruel to ordinary families. The tactical wizards decided, `Wouldn't it be smart to cut services but introduce tax cuts. Brilliant! The punters will go for that one, just like they did with the kids overboard story.' So the message went to Treasury to find a way to provide tax cuts and still keep the surplus intact. The government's great plan: $4 a week for the average family and an $11 tax cut for those who did not really need it.</para><para>The amount provided in the tax cuts shows that, even though revenue is pouring in and services are being cut to the bone, there really was not much room for cuts of significance. So why is it all so tight? The answer: largesse. This government is quite flippant about spending inordinate amounts of money on consultants, advisers, subcontractors and glossy PR brochures to extol the virtues of its benevolence, but it cringes at the thought of spending anything on the battlers who put its members on the Treasury benches. It was quite okay to pay for two occupants at Yarralumla, on full pay, but it was not okay to make it easier for a smart kid from Western Sydney to study medicine, law or accounting at our universities.</para><para>I now turn to the government's so-called Medicare reform package. As I stated earlier, I have no gripes about reforming the Medicare system, but the government is using the term to mask its ultimate aim—destruction. Since 1996, this Howard government's neglect of Medicare has cost ordinary Australian families $123 million extra a year. This is before the so-called reforms. We can only imagine what the impost will be on families if the Prime Minister's reforms are passed.</para><para>At the present time, my electorate does not have a problem with bulk-billing. The doctors in Fairfield, St Clair and Greystanes overwhelmingly bulk-bill their patients. They know that their patients are not that well off. Many are pensioners and concession card holders, so they will be fine in the short term. But the vast majority are young families. What will happen to them? I can remember the days before Medibank when you really had to hope that you had a charitable doctor who, when you had to make an emergency visit with a sick child, would kindly forgo the fee because you just did not have the money at that moment.</para><para>So, again, this Prime Minister is trying to force on us a scheme that suits his ideal world of the 1950s. This Prime Minister is convinced that the world would be a better place without all families having access to adequate health care. He would rather see the already extremely stretched public hospital system take on the even greater load which will undoubtedly result from the Howard changes. People in this civilised society are not just going to lie down and die. They will use whatever avenues they can afford to seek assistance for themselves and their children.</para><para>However, what has the government done? It has moved $918 million over five years from the Australian health care agreements, which help fund our public hospital system, to pay for its Medicare package. What a creative piece of accounting and a disgraceful form of public policy. Populate or perish? Who would want to have kids when they have this impost imposed on them? The Hawke government introduced Medicare in 1984, and it took about 12 years to get bulk-billing to the level of 80 percent. It has taken only seven years for the Howard government to reduce bulk-billing by nearly 12 per cent, to 68.5 per cent nationally.</para><para>All the while, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing refuse to guarantee that the rate of bulk-billing will not continue to fall. So, if the Senate passes the government's proposals, we will see families who earn over $32,300 a year—the vast majority of my community—without access to bulk-billing as we know it today. Talk about means testing? This is mean spirited indeed. I have heard government members—and just now as well—state that all will be well, that doctors will not have to increase their fees because they will be reimbursed for bulk-billing pensioners and concession card holders. The AMA President, Kerryn Phelps, has publicly indicated that doctors will have to increase their fees. She said:</para><para>What will need to happen is that for doctors to continue to bulk bill their concession card holders, they're going to have to charge their non-concession card holders more.</para><para>So there you have it: the doctors admit that they will have to charge more. The doctors have also stated—and I am pleased to see it—that Labor's plan for Medicare is the better of the two. The difference is that we on this side of the House believe that the state has a vested interest in providing adequate health care services for its people. We believe that, in a civilised society, all people, regardless of their social standing and wealth, have the right to this service. We are not arguing over choice. We believe that people should have the right to choose which facilities and what type of care they require. However, the government's plans impinge upon the right of many families to choose.</para><para>Ordinary families will have no choice whatsoever. We in the Labor Party believe that everybody should have a choice. The Labor plan rewards doctors who continue bulk-billing. The incentives are there. Our plan will provide doctors in my electorate with an additional $7,500 a year for bulk-billing 80 percent or more of their patients. When we are in power, nearly all the doctors in my electorate and across Australia will receive this incentive payment. And they deserve it. Most of the doctors have tried to maintain a bulk-billing service, but the government's changes, I fear, will see this rate drop dramatically.</para><para>Added to the increased cost of seeing the doctor is the government's plan from the last budget to increase the cost of essential medicines. If the government got its way, we would see ordinary families not only paying more for walking through the doctor's door but, if they required medication, paying 30 percent more at the chemist. If the government signs its much feted free trade agreement with the United States—and the abolition of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is really part of the agreement—then the sky is the limit as to what people will be forced to pay for a range of medicines.</para><para>The picture so far: the government has given you $4 a week. This is an act of benevolence that we should all be grateful for, according to its acolytes. However, for this generous $4, we should sacrifice a few things. Firstly, do not in any circumstances get sick. If you do, there goes your $4. So make sure you stay perfectly well. Secondly, do not try to improve yourself by obtaining a higher education. If you do not have the money then take out a loan under the Nelson plan. The Minister for Education, Science and Training tells us that we can borrow $50,000 at 3½ per cent, plus CPI—over six per cent if you took a loan out today—and that will go only halfway toward covering the cost of some degrees.</para><para>This government's education policy is unapologetically geared to the top end of town. Since the Howard government took office, on average more than 20,000 qualified students have been turned away from our universities each year. These are intelligent young people thwarted not by their lack of effort or diligence but by the lack of funding by this government. Since 1996, the government has slashed university funding by $5 billion and, at the same time, more than doubled HECS fees and lowered the threshold. The one positive to come out of this package is that the government has recognised its folly from a few years ago and raised that threshold now to a more reasonable level of $30,000. However, as always with this government, there is a catch. Universities will be able to increase their HECS fees by 30 per cent. Over the last seven years, the top rate of HECS has increased from $2,442 to $8,355. So when you add the 30 per cent increase on the average HECS fee you are looking at an increased cost to students and their families of over $1,650 per year within the next two years. Break it down and you have that added cost of an extra $32 per week. Since 1996, the average HECS fee has more than doubled—up by 116 per cent.</para><para>The Department of Education, Science and Training has admitted that student debt is to rise to astronomical levels. By 2006-07, student debt will be $13.2 billion. And we are supposed to applaud that? There are young people out there improving themselves, and the benefit that will come to us as a society will be immense. What does this government do in its so-called wisdom? It punishes them by imposing upon them, before they begin their careers, a very significant level of debt. In essence, slowly but surely, we are seeing the Americanisation of our education system whereby parents, from the birth of their child—in other words, from the cradle—will have to save up for their child's higher education. Is that what the average Australian people want? I know my constituents are stridently against this.</para><para>I also note that in the budget papers there is not one extra cent to support TAFE, our technical and further education institutions, and no mention of any new training initiatives. The government tends to make great play of its New Apprenticeships scheme; however, this scheme has failed to address skills shortages in critical areas. Heather Ridout of the Australian Industry Group—AIG—has said there has been an `alarming fall in technical and engineering apprenticeships'. Since 1995, there has been a 35 per cent decline in engineering enrolments in TAFE colleges in NSW, not due to a lack of demand from employers for youngsters in those trades but due to the lack of serious funding from this government. The latest data indicate that there has been a decline in the number of people taking up traditional trades, including carpentry, panel beating, motor mechanics and plumbing—only 6,000 in the December quarter of 2002. That is the lowest in over four years.</para><para>One significant move in this budget, which shows a terrible lack of foresight, is the abolition of the Enterprise and Career Education Foundation, or ECEF as it is referred to. For the government it is a saving of a measly $4.1 million over four years, but for the students involved it is a severe setback. This program received strong praise from the business community for bringing students and industry together to assist the students in developing their skills and enhancing their career prospects. This is yet another policy area where Labor and the government are poles apart. We believe that the government should be proactive in devising strategies to assist business to rectify problem areas such as skills shortages, but the government believe that the market will sort it out. The market needs the skills but we are not providing them, so businesses have no option but to search offshore for labour or, even worse, to move offshore. The result is an increasing number of unemployed people who end up being chronically unemployed, with all its social consequences. All it requires is for the government to be proactive.</para><para>The government tends to have no shortage of money when it comes to funding private schools. We are talking about not small private schools but the large established institutions that have never had trouble raising funds. They tend to have no problem at all in raising their fees while putting their hands out for government funds. State schools get a pittance. The government will argue that they are the states' responsibility, but I thought private schools were as well. I presume there are different rules for different people. The hypocrisy shines brightly from this government.</para><para>What does this budget provide for the majority of Australian women? Absolutely nothing. The government have shown throughout their period in office that they take women for granted. They gladly take their votes but they provide little in return. If you are a young woman established in a career and then want to start a family, you have one choice: leave your job and stay at home. The failed baby bonus will look after you. Providing token financial assistance for women to stay at home is uncharitable in the extreme. This has been shown by the poor take-up rate for the baby bonus. The government should be looking at the economics of having children as a major part of their social policy. However, the government refuse to countenance a scheme of paid maternity leave which, as the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, has stated, would be of significant benefit for women and families. Most countries that are members of the OECD have some form of paid maternity leave—except for Australia and the United States. If Australia is serious about addressing the decline in the birthrate without a significant increase in the rate of immigration, then the whole of government needs to come up with a plan to examine this growing problem.</para><para>The other problem for working mothers is the ridiculously expensive cost of child care. A couple of months ago I asked the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs a question on notice regarding the number of child care places and the average cost of those places in my electorate, but he could not answer the part of the question on the average cost. `No data was available,' was the reply. No wonder the government has no idea what the struggle is like out there for women in the real world. Maybe it does not want to know how hard it is. I can inform the minister that people in my electorate are paying upwards of $10,000 per year for long day care. If you add this to the increased cost of going to the doctor, paying more for the kids' medicines and saving every spare cent you have from the rolling tax cuts the government promises to implement so as to pay for the children's higher education, it is no wonder women are beside themselves as to how they can properly take care of their families and themselves.</para><para>The government will claim that it is unable to afford to spend in these areas, but why not? Is this not the highest taxing government we have ever seen? The tax cuts that have been provided by the government are so small that they will not return any of the increases in revenue caused by inflation. The $4 a week for people on average incomes, earning between $30,000 and $50,000 a year, will in no way cover increased health, education and child care costs. It will not get anywhere it. People earning over $75,000 a year will receive almost three times the tax cut of ordinary workers and part-time workers, who will receive only a pittance of $1.63 a week. Many women work part time and, again, this government treats them with contempt.</para><para>Before the government introduced the goods and services tax, they promised they would abolish all so-called hidden taxes. Can the government look straight into the Australian people's eyes and swear that they have not introduced any new hidden taxes? The truth is they cannot—even though they call these taxes `levies'. There is the Ansett tax; the sugar tax; the dairy tax; the Sydney airport tax; and an increased excise on LPG, a clean fuel. If there is any new form of revenue taking they can think of, the government will implement it. The government will do anything to con the Australian people into believing that they are giving back more than they are taking.</para><para>The Treasurer stands proud at his honour of being the highest taxing treasurer in Australia's history. What an achievement! He has grabbed more than $3.3 billion from ordinary workers, just this year, in bracket creep. Has this been returned through these tax cuts? No. The government has a hide to extol its virtues. There has never been a government more reliant on income tax than this government, and there probably has never been a government more committed to cutting services to the Australian people.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply speech raised another issue that should be a paramount priority for any Commonwealth government, and that is the saving of the Murray River and tackling the problem of salinity. I do not believe that the importance of this environmental issue has been argued strongly enough yet to the Australian people. As the driest continent on earth, water is a precious resource. I think many people, particularly on the eastern seaboard, take for granted the amount of water we have at our disposal. Hopefully the drought has opened up some people's minds to the conservation of our water resources.</para><para>The saving of the Murray River is extremely important, and so is the end of land clearing. I must commend the government for getting close to an agreement with the Queensland government on the issue of land clearing. However, Labor's plan to create the Murray-Darling Riverbank is a great innovation to attempt to achieve and secure the large amounts of funding necessary and to create the climate of cooperation that is so desperately required between the Commonwealth, the states, local government and the private sector. I can testify to the almighty problems involved in trying to get cooperation over the conservation of the Murray-Darling network from my own experiences as the New South Wales Minister for Natural Resources in the 1980s.</para><para>With the recent downpour in Sydney the issue of flooding has come to a head again. As a long-term resident and representative of the Fairfield area, I have seen at first-hand the damage that serious floods can do to our community. While Minister for Natural Resources in 1984-85 in New South Wales, I introduced a funding arrangement for the state government to assist councils in flood mitigation works. A few years later, after lobbying the Hawke government, the Commonwealth then made a contribution which led to the 2:2:1 system—in other words, for every dollar spent by council you got $2 from the state and $2 from the Commonwealth.</para><para>This government abolished that system, reasoning that, in particular, metropolitan councils could raise the funds required for flood mitigation works. The people in the regions got upset, so the government implemented the Regional Flood Mitigation Program in 1999. A couple of years later, the government expanded the eligibility criteria to include outer metropolitan areas. The government stipulated that a rigid definition of what constitutes an inner or outer metropolitan area under the plan had not been set as many councils have significant demographic variations within their boundaries.</para><para>It would appear that the government has left that definition deliberately ambiguous—ambiguous enough for Parramatta City Council to be classified as outer metropolitan but Fairfield City Council is not. My geographic skills are not bad, and it would appear to me that parts of the Fairfield City area are substantially further west from the city and could be classified as semi-rural compared with Parramatta. As part of this scheme, Parramatta was allocated $950,000 for this financial year for voluntary purchase purposes; Fairfield got nothing. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>15417</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Reductions in personal income tax, enhancing our security and strengthening defence, investing in education and our health systems, funding boosts for disability services, and the greatest ever commitment of funds to tackle environmental degradation are features of the Howard government's 2003-04 federal budget, as outlined in <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>. </para></talk.start><para>Prudent financial management by the Howard government has enabled tax cuts to be delivered to all income earners after paying for the unexpected challenges of drought and Iraq, and after further reductions in the debt inherited from previous Labor governments. The budget delivered by Treasurer Costello maintains a respectable surplus and a climate conducive to improved employment opportunities and sustainable economic growth. The tax cuts will pay for the winter gas bill and amount to a return, in the coming years, of $2.4 billion from the taxes paid by income earners, above what is needed to fund federal works and programs. Tax cuts are the dividend paid to Australian taxpayers for sound fiscal and economic management and will be delivered without placing the economy, our nation's longer term national interests or the budget at risk.</para><para>Some, including the Labor Party, have been critical of the size of the tax cuts. It is interesting how those opposite can ignore the anticipated $1,800 impost on Victorian households and families under the hundreds of tax and levy increases implemented by the Bracks government in its budget a week earlier. Yet the opposition leader seems to have belatedly recognised that a tax cut is a tax cut—something that vividly contrasts with the form of Labor at state levels where, as I mentioned, dozens and dozens of taxes and charges are being increased at great expense to households.</para><para>The federal budget presents a sound triple bottom line approach for the Howard government to get on with the job at a time of great challenge and points to world-leading economic performance, increased social investment and new environmental spending. In economic terms the budget signals continued impressive outcomes. As William Pesek Jr recently canvassed in his column for <inline font-style="italic">Bloomberg News</inline>:</para><para>While most major economies are struggling, Australia's is thriving. In the U.S., Japan and Germany, it's stagnation and rising unemployment that folks worry about. Here, it's how to keep the good times going.</para><para>Chances are, Australia can do just that. The dismal state of the global economy is a clear and present risk to an economy Costello sees as expanding at 3 percent this year and 3.25 percent next year. But domestically, it's hard to see Australia as anything but a role model for the world's biggest economies.</para><para>He goes on to say:</para><para>Take the tax-cut plan Costello unveiled as part of his budget. It will lower taxes for 9 million Australians by A$10.7 billion over four years. That may not sound like much to politicians in Frankfurt, Tokyo or Washington, but it gets at a bigger point: Costello is in a position to trim taxes. He also has more ammunition to do so than his peers ... Compare that to what's happening in Washington. Australia's government expects to produce a A$2.2 billion surplus in the fiscal year starting July 1, its sixth in eight years. </para><para>He reflected on the Howard government's budget and concluded: </para><para>Australia isn't getting much credit domestically or internationally, and that's a shame ... Yet if you're looking for an example of an economy that's forging its own path, independent of the weakness slamming most, Australia is it. And if it's a haven from market volatility you're after, you could do worse than give Australia a look. </para><para>Pesek's piece emphasised how here in Australia we can expect continuing economic growth and modest inflation, accomplishments greatly admired by other developed countries who are facing a less prosperous future and the need to fund government activity on their national bank cards—a debt left for future generations to pay off. Historians will look back on this time and declare it a golden era in Australia's economic life. It will be contrasted with the neglect of opportunity and profligacy of the previous Labor government that produced debt, deficit and despair. Labor's approach stole from future generations and the Howard government have had to repair the damage we inherited, deal with the significant challenges of the day and build the foundations for a better future. </para><para>The budget includes new funding for further improvements to our border security, higher education and Medicare reforms, industry research and development, and a continuation and enhancement of the environmental commitments that have made the Howard government the greenest in our nation's history. Locally, the budget will help our regional economy and employment prospects by supporting continued strong building activity, home ownership, buoyant retail sales, expanding educational exports and continuing growth in the tourism, leisure and hospitality sector. </para><para>A significant proportion of our economy is interest rate sensitive. Fortunately, the interest rates in the early 1990s that crippled our region during Labor's `recession we had to have' are a dark but not too distant memory. The government's economic stewardship has steered the economy away from the horrors of 17 per cent home mortgage rates and even steeper business lending and overdraft rates. I remind those recent entrants into the home ownership market that they were the horrors that the Labor government gave home buyers not too long ago. Local home buyers and their families, Dunkley small businesses and those they employ, and all others associated with the discretionary expenditure segment of the economy can rejoice not only at the opportunities and the assistance the economic climate has offered under the Howard government but also at what has been avoided. </para><para>Speaking of avoidance, the Bracks government seems hell-bent on avoiding its obligations to construct the Scoresby Freeway. The single most significant and bold-faced deception of electors occurred during the last Victorian state election when the Bracks government promised to build the freeway without tolls. Labor lied. Labor still lies. Dunkley motorists intending to use the Scoresby Freeway to improve access to employment opportunities, educational institutions, family connections and leisure interests will now face a toll. Potential investors in our region now have to weigh the financial imposts of tolls, disadvantaging our region when compared with other investment designations. </para><para>The importance of the Scoresby Freeway to our community cannot be overstated. There is no single endeavour that will enhance the viability, vitality and living standards of our region more than this project, and the time has well and truly passed for local ALP representatives to stand up for our community. They have not been battling for this project but have been mere bystanders up until now. Worse still, they were briefed by Premier Bracks and supported the betrayal of their own promises and the interests of our local community. </para><para>Last Friday, at the quarterly elected representatives meeting hosted by Frankston City Council, all the local ALP state MPs could do was gloat—gloat about the effectiveness of their deception and crow about improved opinion polls and approval ratings, despite blatantly deceiving our citizens, misleading our community and placing their own pathetic self-interest above our community's needs. State Labor MPs sit in Spring Street on the back of an electoral fraud, knowingly deceiving the electors of the eastern and south-eastern suburbs into believing it was committed to the Scoresby Freeway. Scoresby has gone from a freeway for improved viability, vitality and living standards for our region—the Howard government vision—to a `boulevard of broken dreams' under the deception and indifference of the Bracks and Crean Labor team. </para><para>We will continue to honour in full our commitment to fund a toll-free Scoresby Freeway with the allocation of $445 million. We will need to join together as a community to demand that the Bracks government also honour its promise to the electorate and contractual obligations to the Common-wealth to partner the Howard government in building a freeway and not a tollway. </para><para>The reasons for the indecent haste with which Steve Bracks went to the polls can now be clearly explained. Premier Bracks knew he had squandered the surplus he had inherited from the Kennett government, that he could not possibly do all that he had promised and that his economic credentials and his own personal credibility and trustworthiness would be compromised as the evidence of his mismanagement and deception emerged in the public arena. </para><para>It is not uncommon for incoming governments to find their predecessors had cooked the books. We all remember that. That is what happened here, when the former federal Labor government, of which the now opposition leader was a key figure, claimed that the budget was in surplus in the lead-up to the 1996 election when we found it was really $10.5 billion in deficit. Tough choices and the difficult task of bringing the books back into the black were left behind by Labor for the incoming Howard government to address. </para><para>But this is not the story of Victorian Labor. The people in the government before and after the last state election were the same. The ALP had all the information about the budget situation before scurrying off to the polls. The Bracks betrayal was all his own work. The budget that we are discussing here today also buttresses the social fabric and builds a more able, fairer and well-supported future for our community. </para><para>I have heard some of the members opposite talk about Minister Nelson's higher education reforms. I compliment Ross Gittins for his article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> in which he said, `The opposition parties and interest groups have used several tricks to mislead us.' Do you see a pattern emerging here, Mr Deputy Speaker? Labor mislead and deceive. First, they have got people thinking that they are muddled between two separate schemes. Here we are hearing from the Labor Party the most outrageous, unrepresentative examples of what the implications of these changes would be. Gittins goes about dissecting the Labor lies again—the lies that seem to perpetuate under the Labor opposition. They attempt to do anything to frighten people into supporting their misguided causes. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name></talker><para>—Whatever it takes.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name></talker><para>—Whatever it takes. The minister at the table is absolutely right. The Nelson higher education reforms will commit an extra $1.5 billion to the university sector over the next four years, $870 million recurrent extra funding from 2007 and $10.6 billion additional investment in the first 10 years. What will that do? That will increase the number of undergraduates in Australian universities. There are currently 531,000 undergraduates in Australian universities—more than half a million. Of those, 98.3 per cent are in government subsidised HECS places. You do not hear the Labor Party talk about that fact. What they seek to talk about is the less than two per cent who are not in government funded places.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Yesterday, the minister outlined to the House why the opportunity for full fee paying, non-government funded places should be made available to Australian citizens. Why? Because it is available to everybody else. If you come from Jakarta you can get a full fee paying place, but if you come from Frankston you could not—before the Howard government was elected and introduced that change. Minister Nelson very effectively highlighted an example from a Frankston high school student, where being just one-tenth of one per cent below a TER score could deny a student the opportunity to study and pursue their particular career.</para><para>What is wrong with that person deciding to invest in their own future? Absolutely nothing, I would have thought. They are making a choice about their future and investing in it by pursuing something that hits their buttons and stimulates their future working life. What is wrong with that? Absolutely nothing, unless you are from the Labor Party. They would rather see that person occupy a HECS funded place that could be exactly what someone else is looking for. Because Labor is so hell-bent on denying people the chance to select their own pathways in life, Labor would like to tell them what is good for them; not allow the individual to make those choices—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name></talker><para>—They don't trust the people!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name></talker><para>—They do not trust the people; and they certainly do not trust young people making choices about their career type. You get somebody who may have just missed out by one-tenth of one per cent on a TER score to get into their preferred course being denied the opportunity to approach that university to argue that they are competent and capable of undertaking that course of study and to invest in their own future. Instead, under Labor, they are forced into a program that is not their preference and they displace someone from a HECS funded place who may actually desire to be in that program. Those people are perhaps not going to be stimulated by that program, which may explain why about 40 per cent of people who commence higher education do not finish.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What is wrong with encouraging people to pursue their own course and invest in their own future and, in doing so, strengthening the university sector, where you will see an increase in HECS funded places—not, as the Labor Party would deceive people into believing, a situation where someone has to go and save for those places? They are using fictitious examples to create a less than two per cent case study and then seeking to apply that across the entire university sector. As Ross Gittens has outlined, they should stand condemned for their tricks in misleading people and continuing to do what Labor do best; that is, attempt to scare people with their lies and false representations of government policy.</para><para>The additional support for carers of people with disabilities, those selfless individuals who give up so much of their own time and opportunity to care for a loved one, is welcomed in this budget. The disability employment services funding boost is also a positive social measure that recognises the selflessness of those people supporting disabled citizens. The record $2 billion committed to environmental repair and management programs in the 2003-04 budget exemplifies the Howard government's whole-of-government framework for environmental sustainability. It includes for the first time $40 million for a sustainable cities program, aimed at the impacts of city living and improving the environment, health and lifestyles of urban Australians. It includes a further increase in spending between the environment and agriculture portfolios, which jointly administer the landmark Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. That funding is going to be increased for environmental activities—a funding level that has more than doubled since 1996 to a record $957 million next financial year.</para><para>That is what good economic management offers: the chance to do something. As you see in the state of Victoria, poor economic management denies opportunities to do things. I spoke in this House about a $20 million subacute facility in Mornington hospital—unashamedly presented as an election sweetener for those people in the southern part of my electorate. That is not even in the forward estimates of the Bracks budget. That is what poor economic management does: it denies opportunities and it limits future potential of not only our communities but our nation.</para><para>Going further on the triple bottom line advantages of this budget, we can look at some of the less spectacular programs, which are equally important. I am particularly pleased that the retractable needle and syringe program I secured prior to the last budget has advanced to the stage where $17.5 million has been allocated to roll out the technology over the next three years. That is encouraging news. It is providing the proper public health support for injecting drug users, but not at the expense of the safety and wellbeing of regular citizens, who are fearful of coming into contact with recklessly discarded used syringes. That is a constructive, positive measure that I strongly support.</para><para>Before I close, I would like to talk about one other issue. For a long time, I have been a campaigner on the virtues of LPG. I think LPG is the new fuel. Sadly, its genesis was one of a dirty fuel; a waste product from petroleum refining. But we have come to realise that, as a fuel source, it is clean, it is kinder to the air quality and it is in abundance in our area. The government has announced that it is examining the question of fuel taxation through the fuel tax reform for the future package. I am encouraging people like me, who recognise the fuel security and self-sufficiency virtue of LPG and our capacity to meet those transport fuel requirements from our own reserves. There are values that LPG offers that should be reflected in the final determinations of the rates later this year. There are also the air quality benefits. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware of the particulates, the things that are compromising our efforts in improving air quality and would even make the gains we hope to make under the sustainable cities initiatives more difficult. LPG offers a pathway there: it is friendlier to the air quality, and that should also be recognised as another factor to influence the rate of excise that is applied to those fuels.</para><para>Finally, we have the greenhouse benefits. We know that the performance of LPG outstrips many other fuel types in the transport sector, and that also has a public policy value that should be taken into account as another factor that should influence the rates of excise applied to LPG. I encourage the LPG sector, with whom I have worked closely over the last four or five years, to get that information together. The opportunity is there. The government has stated that the energy content of the fuels will be the starting position. I have been assured that other factors will be taken into account. Let us assemble that information and put it to the government. Let us show how LPG is not only an attractive, self-reliant and environmentally friendly fuel that we should integrate more deeply into our economy but also a fuel where there is an existing distribution network. It is not a potential alternative fuel for the future: it is here now.</para><para>One in 17 cars in our national fleet are using LPG. We have secured the support, coordination and cooperation of the industry to promote and market LPG as the clean fuel. I have described it as a bit of an aspirin, in that people have sometimes discounted the virtue of LPG but, as time goes by, we will learn more about its positive characteristics. I encourage the sector that has worked so effectively to advance the interests of LPG to combine to get its information together and help support me to present the best possible case about the other factors that need to be taken into account beyond the energy content of LPG as the government moves to settle on that fuel type.</para><para>All four of the original equipment manufacturers of vehicles in Australia have been working on LPG cars. We are looking at European technology, which is primarily on two-litre engines, to see what needs to be adapted and changed to meet Euro 4 end of pipe emission standards for LPG. This is an exciting time. LPG is the fuel of the future and we should get behind it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>15422</page.no><name role="metadata">Irwin, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs IRWIN</name><name.id>83Z</name.id><electorate>Fowler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>. There is an old saying that if you drop a frog into a pot of boiling water it will jump back out, but if you put the frog into a pot of cold water and bring it to the boil, the frog will be slowly boiled alive. That is a strategy that the Prime Minister learned some years ago and that is the strategy being applied to the Australian people today. When you look back over the so-called reforms of the Howard government, you see changes to industrial relations, changes to the tax system, changes to child-care and health services, changes to education funding benefiting private schools at the expense of public education, changes to subsidised private health insurance and many other reforms. While each of these have alarmed some parts of the community, unless you take them all together you might not see how far they have washed away the foundations of Australian society.</para></talk.start><para>This package was presented by the now Prime Minister in 1987 and then in the Liberal Party's Fightback package in 1993. It was firmly rejected, rightly, by the Australian people. The Prime Minister realised that what he could not achieve by dropping the frog into the boiling water might be achieved if he took things slowly. So we had—and we remember—the `never ever' promise about the GST and the hand over the heart promise to preserve Medicare. We have now had eight budgets by the government with each one turning up the heat; each one breaking a never ever promise, each one making our society less fair.</para><para>Where do we stand today as we look at the 2003 budget and the associated plans to change bulk-billing and university fees? The water in the pot is getting very warm and the frog has its last chance to jump before it is too late. But you can understand how the frog feels. It is nice and warm there in the pot, it is feeling relaxed and comfortable, you might say, and it thinks it will know just when things have gone too far and it is time to jump. It also thinks that if the Howard government goes too far, it can always turn back the clock to rebuild Medicare—just like Labor did after Malcolm Fraser trashed Medibank. But that assumes that the government has not done the unthinkable: the Treasurer has put a lid on the pot. Even if the frog wanted to jump out it could not; it is left there to boil alive.</para><para>That is another part of the strategy: to make sure that what the government has undone cannot be put back together. What we have seen, and we can see it again in this budget, is the transfer of services such as public hospitals and schools to the states and subsidies of private services, such as private health insurance and private schools, supported by the Commonwealth. With limited financial resources, the states fund these publicly provided services while the Commonwealth hands out subsidies for private services. You can hardly be surprised that all state and territory governments are now Labor. You certainly could not trust the Liberals with such a responsibility—they would privatise the lot. But there is another part of the strategy: putting the lid on the pot. That is now clear for us all to see. By locking in subsidies for private health insurance, private schools and private universities, a large group of voters will scream like boiled frogs if you try to take the subsidy away.</para><para>Then there are those tax cuts: the fistful of dollars—or, more precisely, a couple of coins—in your purse. The effect which is intended is not to make taxpayers grateful for some tax relief but to ensure that a new government cannot restore what this government has taken away. It is putting the lid on the pot to stop the frogs jumping out. After all that, we still have the highest taxing government in recent history, only now we lose both ways: we have high taxes and we still have to pay for private services.</para><para>As most Australian families know only too well, their $4 a week tax cut will soon disappear in payments to doctors and, if the government gets its way, higher charges at the chemist. As this government knows only too well, you can cut back on benefits to the so-called undeserving poor, but you cannot touch government handouts to those who can afford private health insurance. The effect of this is best seen in one of the most disgraceful acts of this government. In his first budget, the Treasurer stopped the funding for pensioner dental services. The states have been left with the full cost of meeting this important treatment. But the 30 per cent Commonwealth subsidy for private health insurance covers ancillary treatment, such as dental services. So private dental services are subsidised by the Commonwealth but not services for pensioners or their dependents.</para><para>We had the Minister for Ageing in this House the other week saying that Labor would take away the dental care of children whose parents have private health insurance. But he said not a word about his government taking away dental services for aged pensioners. Let them eat soup—that was the message the Minister for Ageing gave to aged pensioners in dire need of dental care. We know how important dental care is for maintaining the general health of older people. But you will never hear the Minister for Ageing talk about dental care for aged pensioners. All we get are crocodile tears about kids needing braces, as if only the children of the 45 per cent of people with private health insurance have dental problems. That shows us where we are heading.</para><para>As a rough calculation, the government subsidises private dental care to the tune of $500 million dollars a year but does not give one cent for dental health care for pensioners. As they say about the good Lord, this government looks after those that look after themselves. But, as I see almost daily in my electorate office, there are many that this government will not help—like the pensioner forced to pay hundreds of dollars each year for the only drug which effectively treats his arthritis but is not covered under the PBS or the young mother wondering where she will get the $300 demanded by her doctor up-front before he will treat a precancerous condition. This government has sat on its hands while bulk-billing and, ultimately, Medicare are collapsing around us. Its measures will not save Medicare; they will create a two-tiered American-style health system which will leave more and more Australian families without full access to health care.</para><para>The other area of this budget that rolls forward the Howard agenda is education. In this budget it is not private schools but universities that are up for so-called reform. Can I say at the start that I do support the HECS scheme as introduced by the previous Labor government. I know that HECS payments are a burden on many individuals and young families. One of the problems with HECS has always been that it hits at a time when young graduates are starting out in life and have other costs to bear. When a young graduate seeks a home loan they must declare the $20,000 HECS debt and the $150 a month needed to repay the debt. Allowing fee increases of up to 30 per cent and providing for loan schemes for full cost places will have a dramatic effect as graduates face loan burdens of $100,000 in future years. There will be a great incentive to work overseas to avoid these debts—we are seeing this now. We will definitely suffer as a nation from the loss of this brilliant talent.</para><para>But what worries me is allowing universities to charge fees up to 30 per cent above the existing set fee. The predicted effect of this move will be that the so-called sandstone universities will be able to increase fees, and presumably be able to attract a larger number of full fee paying students, while outer suburban and regional universities will not. With the benefit of higher revenue, the sandstone universities will attract better staff and facilities and hence will be seen to provide a higher standard. This two-tier American-style university system will reflect the same differences as we see between public and private schools and with access to health care between privately insured hospital patients and those in the public system. The worst aspect of this will be that graduates of lower fee universities will be assumed to have lesser degrees.</para><para>What concerns me—and it is the main reason that I support the concept of HECS—is that, as the Minister for Education, Science and Training keeps telling us, only 30 per cent of students go on to university. That figure would be far lower for my electorate of Fowler. But what would be unfair for students from electorates like Fowler is that they are far less likely to have had an exclusive private school education and less likely to gain entry to a sandstone university. Their only choice, because their parents could not afford a full fee paying place, will be to take a place at one of the second-class universities created by this proposal. I do not agree that a graduate of an outer urban or regional university is second-class. But I am concerned that the employment market may see those graduates as second-class.</para><para>I am reminded of a report carried out in the early 1950s which led to the creation of one of the sandstone universities, the University of New South Wales. The report for the then New South Wales government looked at the engineering diploma courses at Sydney Technical College. The report concluded that the STC diploma course had better content and rigour than most university degree courses in Australia and, for that matter, in the UK and the USA. It was our cultural cringe that saw STC courses as being lesser than courses at sandstone universities. I am concerned that the proposed changes to fee structures will lead us back to the pre-Dawkins days of a two-tier university system, with dire consequences for some universities and their graduates.</para><para>Just as this budget shows a change in the accepted role of Australian government domestically, it also shows a change in our international position. This can be seen from the budget figures for official development assistance for countries in our region. At a time when we are told to be alert but not alarmed, our government should have noticed the situation in our region. On any assessment, we have a very volatile situation in Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands, and we also have what may lead to a civil war in the Aceh province of Indonesia. So we might expect the government to step up our aid program in the region but, instead, it has been cut back.</para><para>Compared to last year's budget, aid for Papua New Guinea and the Pacific has fallen from $516 million to $509 million. For East Asia, it has fallen from $497 million to $491 million. The figure for the rest of the world increases, but only through increased aid to Iraq. This year we will spend less than was budgeted on most countries except Iraq. In fact, you could say our aid contribution to Iraq was made at the expense of other countries which rely on Australian aid. We have robbed Peter to pay Paul, in the international aid sense. This comes on top of the $100 million in urgent humanitarian aid to Iraq that was mentioned by the Treasurer in his budget speech, and the aid component of the $645 million cost of Australia's deployment to the war on Iraq.</para><para>Only now can we begin to count the cost of our commitment as part of the coalition of the willing. Now that our flag is flying alongside the Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack over Baghdad, it is time to count the booty—all that oil revenue! But before we spend all those oil dollars, we need to look at what Iraq owes other countries and individuals. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Times</inline>, Iraq has external debt of at least $US350 billion. As our foreign minister would say, Iraq is a `busted-arse' country, and even with high oil revenue it could only service a fraction of its foreign debt. This debt was, after all, the reason for the invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and, with interest charges, it is now much higher than it was then. It reminds me of the Peter Sellers' movie called <inline font-style="italic">The mouse that</inline><inline font-style="italic"> r</inline><inline font-style="italic">oared</inline>. A busted-arse country, the Duchy of Grand Fenwick, declared war on the US to get some Marshall Plan style foreign aid. In the end, the US surrendered rather than pay out more aid. The US has called for much of Iraq's debt to be forgiven, but the US is owed only $2 billion, so it is easy to see why. The <inline font-style="italic">Financial Times</inline> said:</para><para>The motive appears to be concern about the costs of reconstructing Iraq and a desire to reduce contingent claims on US taxpayers.</para><para>It should also be clear why Australia has been so keen to avoid a role in the administration of Iraq. You might think that this odious debt should not be repaid. But that is not what the Paris Club demands of countries such as South Africa, Argentina and even Vietnam, which is responsible for the debts of the former Saigon regime. But much of Iraq's debt is owed to former Soviet and Eastern Bloc countries, which are held responsible for the odious debts of their former regimes. So there is little chance of Iraq being forgiven its odious debt.</para><para>Of course, Iraq still owes billions in compensation to Kuwaiti citizens. A recent US court decision holding Iraq responsible for the World Trade Center tragedy could add another $100 billion to the debt. With little more than 30 per cent of the United Nations' $2.2 billion emergency appeal for Iraq being promised by all nations, Australia's contribution has been a mere $10.2 million. This government was eager to be part of the `coalition of the killing' at a cost of more than $600 million. But when it comes to humanitarian aid to put Iraq back together, this government is not home when the appeal caller comes to the door. And even then, it gives away money that should have gone to countries in our region. Is it any wonder we need to spend more on defence and security when we spend less and less on promoting living conditions that can lead to peace in our region?</para><para>But what of the impact of the budget in my electorate of Fowler?  For a start, Fowler has the second-highest rate of bulk-billing, at over 98 per cent. So it should be clear that any changes to bulk-billing will have a direct impact. Many doctors are expected to charge a copayment of at least $5, and as much as $10, per visit. That alone will wipe out the $4 tax cut for some families. University students from Fowler are more likely to attend what this government will make second-class universities as a result of changes to fees. They will have less chance of attending full fee paying courses and less chance of reaching their full potential as they deserve.</para><para>In these and so many other ways, over this Treasurer's eight budgets the people of Fowler have been treated as second-class citizens. This was summed up in the budget papers by the government's offer to provide $445 million for a freeway in the Liberal-held seats in Melbourne's eastern suburbs—provided there is no toll—but only $62 million for the Western Sydney Orbital, making it necessary to charge a toll on a national highway. If that is this government's idea of fairness, no wonder frogs are an endangered species! <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>15426</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARTLETT</name><name.id>0K6</name.id><electorate>Macquarie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1540">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-2003</inline>. It is always enlightening to listen to those opposite comment on things to do with fiscal management and budgets. It is a pleasure to speak on a budget that is responsible, sensible and balanced. This budget does three essential things. Firstly, it addresses some very important areas of need through increased spending and reform. There are longer term reforms to tertiary education, which will strengthen our tertiary education sector. Medicare will be strengthened and more money will be spent on strengthening Australia's security. Secondly, this budget reduces income tax burdens on ordinary working Australians. Thirdly, this budget continues this government's proud record of strong economic management and continues to pay off the legacy of Labor's debt. After some extraordinary, unexpected items of expenditure—the longest drought in history and an escalation of the war against terror, with action in Iraq—we are still able to live within our means, and we can still deliver a budget surplus that pays another $2.2 billion off Labor's debt.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to address each of these areas in a little more detail. On the first essential area of spending, this budget allocates over the next five years another $2.1 billion to strengthen Australia's defence. We are strongly committed on this side of the House to building Australia's defence capability. This is in clear contrast with some of those on the left of the ALP. The extra commitment in this budget brings the total of new funding commitments to defence to $38 billion since this government came into office. Domestic security is a related area of need. This budget means enhanced domestic security. In the 2001 budget, we allocated another $1.4 billion over five years for domestic security measures. This budget allocates a further $411 million over the next five years for ports, airport security, Australian intelligence organisations and other essential areas of need. It is unfortunate that the world climate is such that this money has to be spent, but it is a prime priority of any government to secure the safety of its own citizens. This government is committed to doing that. In that regard, I have to express my disappointment that the Labor Party continues to obstruct the ASIO bill, which is part of this government's determination to protect the life and the safety of Australian citizens. Again, the government's measures are being obstructed by those opposite.</para><para>The second essential area of spending highlighted in this budget is education, including schools, higher education and vocational education and training. This budget delivers much needed reforms to higher education that will deliver greater flexibility, competitiveness, sustainability and equity and will raise the teaching standards in our university sector. This package of reforms has been developed by the minister after extensive consultation throughout the tertiary sector and with widespread support from the Vice-Chancellors Committee. The package has many features: an extra $1.5 billion over the next five years; an extra 1,400 places for nursing and teaching in our universities; 2,500 scholarships, which will start next year and will rise to 5,000 in three years time to assist disadvantaged students to get into university; an easing of the repayment threshold for HECS for students, which will rise from $24,000 to $30,000; and access to full fee paying places to give Australians who have the capacity and want to access a loan the same opportunity as overseas students. So, after the expanded number of HECS places are guaranteed and delivered, there is that other option as well.</para><para>These reforms are essential, sensible and equitable despite the nonsense we have been hearing from Labor on the other side. In the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> this week, Ross Gittins, who is pretty objective in his analysis of most things to do with economic policy, said this about the changes to university funding:</para><para>You take the people who are smart enough to attend the most intellectually high-powered institutions in the country—</para><para>that is, the universities—</para><para>mention a threat to their hip-pocket and all their powers of rational analysis goes out the window.</para><para>That could be said of those opposite as well. All their powers of rational analysis go out the window. Ross Gittins continued:</para><para>When you look at it coolly, and assemble all the facts, you find that the Howard Government's proposed changes to university fees are not as onerous as the critics claim and they're not unfair to students from poor families.</para><para>In fact, they greatly assist students from poor families, as there will be 2,500 scholarships next year, rising to 5,000, for students from poorer families.</para><para>The other point that is worth making is that this package of extra funding for higher education is roughly double the package that Labor offered in their much trumpeted Knowledge Nation. They went around the country saying how wonderful their Knowledge Nation package was, and that it was going to deliver all this funding for universities. The package that this government will deliver, and that is budgeted for in this bill, is twice that which the much trumpeted Knowledge Nation was going to deliver.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name></talker><para>—Noodle nation!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—They could never fund it. Now they are saying ours is not enough, yet it is double what they said they were going to deliver. I move on to other areas of education. There is continued and essential commitment by this government to vocational education and training. Remember that 70 per cent of students do not ever get inside a university. This government is committed to increasing, enhancing and expanding opportunities for those young people who were ignored by the Labor Party, which shamefully allowed apprenticeships to run down to their lowest level for 30 years. This government has proudly reversed that tragic decline. Apprenticeships in this country are now at record levels, more than double what they were when Labor were kicked out of office.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This package brings vocational training and education spending over the next four years to a record $8.5 billion. It is an area where it is much needed. I will illustrate that by reference to my own electorate. Under this government we have seen a strong increase in the number of young people in apprenticeships. Over the last two years, there has been an increase from 1,471 young people taking up new apprenticeships to 2,075—roughly a 50 per cent increase in people finding worthwhile careers in apprenticeships just in my own electorate in two years. They are beneficiaries of the strong and positive policies of this government.</para><para>In the area of education, there are measures in this budget to increase export education. It is an area of enormous potential—an area of $5 billion a year and growing. One of the outstanding institutions in my electorate, the Blue Mountains Hotel School, brings many students from overseas, puts export dollars into our local electorate and provides tremendous career opportunities for its graduates. In the area of school education, this budget delivers an extra 8.3 per cent to schools, bringing school funding to a record $6.9 billion. That includes a focus on really important areas such as literacy, which received $210 million. That has been a very important focus of the Howard government: raising standards of literacy and numeracy across this country. It has finally brought the state premiers and education ministers—sometimes kicking and screaming—to an agreement on the national benchmarking of literacy and numeracy to guarantee essential standards of literacy and numeracy in our schools. It has been very sad to hear the ideologically driven rhetoric of the other side about school funding, captivated as they are by the teachers unions and unwilling and unable to look at the realities of school funding.</para><para>I move to the third area of need addressed in this budget, the area of health spending. Addressing areas that really need to be addressed, this government is committing under this budget an extra $917 million to Medicare to ensure that Medicare is sustainable, accessible and affordable. As for the nonsense we hear from the other side about the government threatening Medicare, how could we be threatening it if we are putting an extra $917 million into it? We are committed to making it work better. Labor could never do that. In spite of all their nonsense over there, the best that bulk-billing rates ever got under the Labor Party was 80 per cent. They could never get it above 80 per cent, and now they are somehow pretending that, if they got into office, they would magically do what in 13 years they failed to do. It is a fraud and a sham.</para><para>Under the Howard government, spending on health has risen by 65 per cent in seven years. The other aspect of the budget is the Australian health care agreements with the state governments, agreements that will provide $42 billion—$42,000 million—over the next five years to assist the state governments to fund their state public hospitals. That is an increase of $10 billion, on top of an increase of 28 per cent in real terms for the five years before that. The last five-year health care agreement under the former Labor government was $24 billion; this one is $42 billion. That is an increase of 75 per cent in Commonwealth funding to assist the states with their public hospitals. </para><para>I could go on detailing other key areas of spending. There is $316 million over the next four years to continue this government's successful Tough on Drugs strategy. That strategy has led to greater seizures of illicit drugs and is tackling the importation, distribution and use of illicit drugs, which have brought so much misery to so many people. It is a program that has been successful. We have seen an encouraging decline in the number of heroin deaths and a dramatic rise in seizures of illicit drugs.</para><para>Turning to other areas, there is an extra $135 million over the next four years for the disability employment services, which do so much to focus on the abilities of people with disabilities and to use those abilities to get them into rewarding work. I have got some great disability employment providers in my electorate—Nova Employment, Active Employment, Syd-West Personnel, Eloura Industries and others—who do a great job. This extra $135 million will assist them.</para><para>The other area that is important in this budget is the income tax cuts. There is $2.4 billion in income tax cuts, but let us put that into context. These come on top of the income tax cuts that we delivered just three years ago in July 2000. Let us not forget that. The income tax cuts in July 2000 amounted to $12 billion—net tax cuts of $6 billion, after the whole new tax system package was brought in—but were opposed by the Labor Party. The Labor Party opposed income tax cuts of $12 billion to Australian workers. They opposed net tax cuts of $6 billion. Now they are over there saying that $2.4 billion in income tax cuts—extra tax cuts—is not enough; yet, when the opposition leader got up to deliver his budget response, we did not hear any other promises about extra tax cuts.</para><para>Compare this: what happened to Labor's last promised tax cuts, the l-a-w tax cuts? They disappeared magically after Labor got into office. Not only did those l-a-w tax cuts not materialise but they were replaced by an immediate slug of 2½ per cent on every sales tax rate around the country. The 10 per cent rate went to 12½ per cent; the 20 per cent rate went to 22½ per cent, and so on. The contrast is clear: the Labor Party stands for higher taxes; this government, the coalition, stands for tax cuts. There is $2.4 billion in tax cuts in this budget. The point is this: after delivering on those areas of need—increasing security for Australia, enhancing our education system and strengthening our health spending—we are committed, where we can and if we can still afford it, to giving back to taxpayers some of their hard-earned money by reducing income taxes.</para><para>This budget illustrates—and this is so important—that this government is committed to living within its means. This government is able to live within its means. This government is able to manage responsibly. Compare that with the record of the other side. This budget delivers another surplus, a surplus of $2.2 billion. This means that $2.2 billion more will be paid off the debt that we inherited from Labor. Let us go back and think about this. In the last five years of the Labor Party's time in office, they added almost $70 billion to government debt. They averaged deficits of almost $14 billion a year, year after year for five years, for a total of, I think, $68 billion. They left us with a debt of $96 billion when we came into office. Through this government's responsible management, we have been able to repay $63 billion of that $96 billion debt, reducing it to $33 billion.</para><para>The implications of this are obvious. Let me mention three of the important ones. Firstly, our children will not be saddled with the burden of having to pay for the profligacy of the drunken sailors opposite. Secondly, the annual interest bill that taxpayers have to meet has been substantially reduced. In 1995, $8 billion a year of taxpayers' money was going down the gurgler simply to pay interest on Labor's accumulated debt. To service Labor's debt, $8 billion a year of taxpayer's money was going down the drain. Because of this government's responsible management, that has been reduced to $3 billion. Now that they are not servicing the massive debt left by Labor, taxpayers are saving $5 billion a year in interest payments that can be spent on essential services such as health, education and defence and security for this country. Thirdly, the other effect of the high-deficit policies of Labor was to put upward pressure on interest rates. Who can forget the horrific interest rate burden that home buyers suffered under Labor?</para><para>When Labor left office, home loan interest rates were 10.5 per cent. They are now down to almost 6.5 per cent. Through saving almost four per cent a year on interest payments, even a home buyer who has a mortgage of $100,000 is saving almost $4,000 a year in post-tax dollars on their mortgage. That is roughly $330 a month. If you have a mortgage of $200,000, you are saving close to $660 a month on your mortgage. The high-debt, high-deficit policies of those opposite would push interest rates up again and rapidly raise that burden on Australian home buyers and owners.</para><para>The constant cries we have heard coming from the other side about us not spending enough on this, that and something else were repeated by the Leader of the Opposition in his response to the budget. The opposition want to spend but do not have a clue how to get the money to fulfil all their promises. This is a magic pudding approach from the other side that somehow pretends you can keep spending money. `It will materialise out of nowhere; someone will pay for it; we will worry about that later.' They have policies that would run up deficits and debt, policies that would push up interest rates and policies that would have to push up taxes.</para><para>The contrast could not be clearer. This government can deliver sound economic management that can reduce debt, reduce interest rates and reduce income taxes. The random policies of spending which are easy to promise but cannot be delivered on and the outrageous profligacy and extravagancy on the other side would raise interest rates, raise debt, raise deficits and raise taxation. This budget is responsible. It delivers on areas of need. It enhances Australia's security, it strengthens our education and health systems and it allows us to continue to manage this country properly in order to repay Labor's debt, keep interest rates down and improve living standards for the Australian people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>15430</page.no><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PLIBERSEK</name><name.id>83M</name.id><electorate>Sydney</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>. In 2002, the Prime Minister said to a joint meeting of the US Congress:</para></talk.start><para>Like you I see family life at the heart of a nation's existence. Not only does the family nurture and educate our children but it provides emotional anchorage for all of us as we travel through life. The strength of the family of course goes beyond the spiritual and the emotional. United, caring families are the best social welfare system mankind has ever devised.</para><para>Given that statement, you would have to ask why this government has brought in a budget that makes life so much more difficult for ordinary families in this country. Of course, it comes after many years of attacking families, and it should not surprise us. But the difference between the rhetoric of the government and what it is prepared to commit to when it comes to dollars in the budget still startles me.</para><para>We hear a lot of spin from the Howard government when it comes to committing valuable resources and budget dollars. This government is, at best, silent and, at worst, negligent. We know that Australian families are doing it tough, because they have faced the seven highest tax years in Australian history. Foreign debt has doubled to $354 billion. Credit card debt—and this is very significant for families—has tripled to $22 billion. Australian families owe nearly $600 million to the Commonwealth government in family tax benefit debts, with over 670,000 families now owing an average debt of $850 because of the inadequacy of the government in introducing this system of payment of family tax benefit.</para><para>Bank fees have doubled since 1997. Australians are saving just 3c in every dollar they earn, compared with 8c under Labor. Average monthly mortgage repayments are at a 13-year high. Members on the opposite side continually talk about interest rates and how frightened ordinary people are of interest rate rises. Of course they are. But the reality is that they are paying more now for their mortgages than they ever have in the past. It takes 8½ years wages to buy an average Australian home, which is 27 months more wages than it took just seven years ago. Of course, in my electorate the situation is much worse because of the high cost of housing.</para><para>This government's policies are hitting families hard, and the only response from the government is to give a measly $4 tax cut to people on average wages. If you look at a family earning $20,000 a year—and there are a lot of them around—they are receiving a tax cut of only $1.63 a week. Knowing what those families face in additional costs, we really have to ask ourselves what that $1.63 a week is going to buy them. Average families are being paid, in total, $725 million less in family tax benefits. That means that the average family will be receiving a benefit of $400 less than the government had previously promised.</para><para>When families get their $4, their $1.63 or whatever it is in their pay packets, it is hardly going to make up for the fact that they are paying more for essential medicines, more to see their GP and more to educate their children. The tax changes will still leave average families paying more than 60c in each additional dollar earned in tax and reduced benefits. You also have to remember that families are now faced with the prospect of starting to save $44 a week from the time of their child's birth to pay for the university education they hope to obtain for that child. Andrew McCallum of ACOSS said:</para><para>This is an upside down budget. It takes from the poor to pay for hand-outs to the well off ... Budget cuts will undermine the health and financial security of up to 3 million poor and vulnerable Australians, especially the disabled, the sick and the unemployed.</para><para>The Brotherhood of St Laurence responded to the budget by saying:</para><para>Changes to health and education in the 2003-2004 Federal Budget risk further entrenching the growing gap between rich and poor ... And changes to Medicare and higher education are likely to create a user-pays system that impacts most on those on low incomes.</para><para>If we look at health in greater detail, we see that there is indeed a crisis in our national health care system. The rates of bulk-billing have decreased by 11 percentage points over the last seven years, with only 69.9 per cent of GP services now being bulk-billed. It was 80 per cent under Labor. The member for Macquarie turns his nose up at a rate of 80 per cent, but I know that most Australians would be very happy to see a return to a rate of 80 per cent for bulk-billing.</para><para>More than 10 million fewer GP visits were bulk-billed this year compared with when John Howard first came to office. What a shocking figure that is. The average cost of seeing a doctor who does not bulk-bill is now $12.78, up five per cent since the Howard government came to office in 1996, and there are a great deal fewer doctors who do bulk-bill. Australian families are now paying $123 million a year more for visits to their local GPs since the Howard government came to office. AMA President, Kerryn Phelps, was very concerned about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and she said:</para><para>We're looking at massive cuts to the PBS of $2 billion which will hit the sickest and the poorest—people with chronic illnesses will be particularly affected as will people with young children who are often at the doctor's.</para><para>The Australian Division of General Practice applauded Labor's proposals in response to the government and said:</para><para>... a substantial increase in patient rebates and no requirement of the GPs `opt in' to an agreement about bulk billing are positive elements of the ALP's package.</para><para>There is an alternative to what the government has proposed. What is really interesting about the government's rhetoric on Medicare is the loud trumpeting of the $917 million rescue package for Medicare, as they like to call it, but not even a whisper of the $918 million that they have cut from public hospitals. Further incentives will encourage GPs to stop bulk-billing. In my electorate, I am very lucky that we still have very high bulk-billing rates. It is an inner city electorate, and there are high numbers of doctors who do bulk-bill. You have to admit that the government's proposal is an incentive to them to start charging copayments. Why wouldn't they when the government makes it so easy for them? The result of all this is to make Australian families pay three times for their medical attention. They pay once through their Medicare levy, once when they go to see a doctor and once through their private health insurance.</para><para>If you look at education in more detail, we know that over $5 billion has been gutted from universities and from student income support since 1996. Australian families are now paying $900 million more for the cost of educating their children at university than when the Howard government was first elected. There are 20,000 fewer publicly funded university places than in 1996. Student fees have increased 85 per cent since 1996. The Minister for Education, Science and Training carries on all the time about how elitist it is of us to complain about funding for university education. But, on his own figures yesterday, he admitted that almost half of all Australians see the inside of a university at some stage, either when they first leave school or, in many cases, later in life when they are retraining or studying for a new career.</para><para>Fewer than three per cent of Australian students see the inside of a category 1 private school, and there is no controversy about the fact that those private schools, in total, now receive more funding than universities. Students are now paying 40 per cent of the cost of their university education, not 25 per cent as the government continually claims. The NTEU says that contributions under backing Australia's future will increase to 44 per cent, and that, if these current budget measures are enacted, students will pay 56 per cent of their university education, which is the highest student contribution anywhere in the world. We are told that American universities are very expensive for students to get into. On average, Australian students pay more for their university education than American students or students anywhere in the developed world. Daniel Kyriacou from the National Union of Students said:</para><para>Proposals to expand the number of places for students who are able to jump the queue by paying full-fees of up to $90,000 sends the message that money is more important in accessing higher education than academic ability. Even the Government's proposed new HECS fees of up to $40,000 for some degrees will put a university education further out of reach for potential students from low and middle income Australian families.</para><para>So what has the government done? The government has increased HECS fees by up to 30 per cent and raised the repayment threshold to $30,000 after dramatically lowering it when they came into government. But remember that, under Labor's original proposal, the HECS repayment threshold in the years 2005-06 would have been $39,000. So the threshold will still be dramatically lower after these changes than it would have been if they had not tampered with it in the first place.</para><para>The minister is so fond of carrying on about vocational education and TAFE funding, but there is not one extra cent in this budget for TAFE. The incredible hypocrisy of a minister who talks all the time about how Labor does not care about kids and vocational education and TAFE is phenomenal when the government has not put a single extra cent into the budget for the technical and further education sector. This budget creates 444 places for doctors and nurses. That is terrific. We have heard a lot of fanfare about that. But it is well short of the 800 places that this government's own review into nursing said were necessary. It is, of course, prepared to commit $20 million towards creating a new bureaucracy to track students. You really have to ask about the priorities there.</para><para>We have heard a lot recently about child protection because of the former Governor-General's dramatic failures in this area. We heard the Prime Minister say in response to questions about a royal commission that he would rather take the $100 million to $140 million a royal commission would cost and instead spend it on child protection and early intervention. I actually looked forward to seeing something in this budget for child protection. I thought that, given the current environment, the government could not go past doing something for children in this country, given all the media focus and the unprecedented public attention on child abuse, but there is nothing. The $4 million for child protection is the same $4 million that the government underspent by $500,000 in last year's budget. I cannot understand how you could not spend a puny amount like $4 million on child protection, given what we know about the needs in this country, given that we know the large number of children that face physical or sexual abuse in their home or in some other institution.</para><para>It is the same with regard to domestic violence. This Commonwealth government has committed such a small amount of money to domestic violence—$16.5 million. That is a lot of money if you are an individual with $16.5 million sitting in your bank account. But, when you are talking about a nation of 20 million people, $16.5 million is not a lot of money to devote to an important area like domestic violence. This government is able to take $10.1 million out of that $16.5 million and spend it on the terrorism fridge magnet. How can it be that it cannot spend even the pathetic amount of money that is dedicated to these important areas?</para><para>Look at the baby bonus. That has been underspent as well. Why is that? Failure of advertising? It is certainly not that families do not need help when they are having babies. We have heard so much over the last few years and particularly over the last few months about paid maternity leave. Again, I thought this budget was an excellent opportunity for the government to introduce paid maternity leave. We know the government's own Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, has made a very strong recommendation in favour of paid maternity leave, yet there is nothing allocated to it in this budget. On AM radio in 2002, the Prime Minister said:</para><para>Paid maternity leave has a legitimate claim in the debate, there is merit in it and we're looking at it.</para><para>At a CEDA speech in November 2002, the Prime Minister said:</para><para>Our key policy goal in this area is to facilitate choice for families and not to mandate particular behaviour. We need to respect the different priorities that individual families have and the different choices they want to make.</para><para>You would think that that would be a terrific opening for paid maternity leave. You would think that that was softening up the community for a really good announcement on paid maternity leave—not a cent, not a priority for this government. We hear a lot of rhetoric as well about the welfare to work initiatives. Tony Abbott, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, said:</para><para>The government is committed to a simpler, fairer welfare system with built in incentives for people to find work ... as a counterpoint to the problems of the wider world, providing a fair go for struggling Australian families is more urgent than ever ...</para><para>Certainly it is. I agree that it is. I am sure everyone on this side of the chamber agrees that it is. We could have expected something in the budget to help families struggling from welfare to work—no, nothing. According to the Brotherhood of St Laurence, it appears that $135 million over four years announced by the Treasurer for disability employment services comes at the cost of moving 90,000 people over four years from the disability support pension to the Newstart allowance.</para><para>I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, that you would have experienced the same thing in your electorate office as I have in my electorate office with people coming in in an absolute flat panic about these proposed changes to disability support payments. People are absolutely terrified about what it means for their ability to make ends meet. Again, when you consider protections for the weakest members of our community, on top of all these changes for people on disability support pensions just look at what the government is proposing to do to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. It is going to absolutely gut the commission and make it impossible for the commission to appear in legal proceedings without the permission of the minister. So the minister will be the one to say, `Sure, we agree that you need to represent a client against the government.' It is absolutely fanciful to imagine that the excellent advocacy work that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has been able to do at times in the past will happen under these proposed changes. It cannot happen.</para><para>Look at the cuts to legal aid of 35 per cent since 1996. Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, you know the situation when people come to your electorate office because they cannot afford legal aid. Whole areas have been wiped out of legal aid, and these people are beside themselves. They are appearing in the court system unrepresented and wasting the time of the courts. In the end there is no saving, because the court system is so much slower, and the results people are getting are not fair.</para><para>Look at child care, where 30,000 children are unable to get child-care places outside school hours. This government is spending $800 less per child-care place than in 1996. How can we provide quality child care on those sorts of figures? Funds for children with special needs have been frozen. Look at the area of mental health. Unfortunately, we do not discuss mental health nearly enough in this parliament. We know that at least 25 per cent of health related disabilities in our society are mental health disorders. One in five people are affected by a mental illness at some time in their lives, yet we spend less than four per cent of our total Commonwealth health funding on mental health services. Australia spends far less on mental health services than New Zealand, Canada, the US, the UK and Ireland. For example, over eight per cent of Ireland's health spending is on mental health services.</para><para>The Mental Health Council of Australia released a national report last year called <inline font-style="italic">Out of Hospital, Out of Mind</inline>. The report pointed out the incredible needs in this area and how families are just left alone to cope as best they can when they have a family member who experiences a mental illness. The government could have responded in this budget to the calls in this report, but it has not done so. It has not earmarked any extra funding in this area. There is only so much that state governments can do. The federal government has to do more than pump out glossy brochures in this area.</para><para>On the issue of the environment, despite the Prime Minister's talk about salinity, in the year 2000 he committed an extra $1.4 billion to the national action plan on salinity but he has clawed it back. Spending on salinity and water quality is going to be cut by more than $60 million over the next two years, making a total of $287 million cut from the national action plan. Honestly, this is an area where there is a crying need. We have heard the Prime Minister speak about land clearing as well. He has promised at both elections to do something about land clearing, but he has done nothing. We are committed to halting large-scale land clearing, and we have said so in our budget reply. </para><para>On the matter of alternative fuels, this budget is also a disaster. And Senator Alston is also out there telling the community that, if the ABC do not act as the propaganda wing of the federal government, they are going to have their funding cut. This government has come up with a budget that is a disaster for the poorest people in our community and for the middle class. It passes more benefits to the wealthy than to any other part of the Australian community.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>15435</page.no><name role="metadata">Stone, Dr Sharman, MP</name><name role="display">Dr STONE</name><name.id>EM6</name.id><electorate>Murray</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>. The economy of this country is a consequence of the entrepreneurial spirit and work ethic of Australian men and women, and prudent and strong federal government leadership. These have produced a continuation of growth and expanding opportunity despite the internationally turb-ulent times and the crippling impact of drought on regional economies. Our econ-omic strength is one of the wonders of the developed world. The budget has delivered additional investments into national security, education, aged care, road funding, and environment and heritage protection. At the same time—despite the drought, the expend-iture incurred in liberating the Iraqis and the extra costs associated with national security issues—Treasurer Peter Costello was still able to deliver tax cuts of over $10.76 billion over four years and to retire more of Labor's legacy of debt.</para></talk.start><para>This week, as we focus on the continuing struggle of Indigenous communities as they recover from the impacts of the usurpation of their land, I want to say how pleased I am with the increase in funds in the budget for Indigenous programs that are delivering real change to the lives of our first Australians. The Indigenous Protected Area program, for example, funded under Natural Heritage Trust mark 2, now has a more secure funding stream and participants can better plan for the future. Seventeen IPAs have been voluntarily proclaimed so far, covering more than 13 million hectares of country owned or managed by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. This country now becomes part of the national reserve system. Much of the country now returned to Aboriginal ownership or control is in a seriously degraded condition, eaten out by feral species and overgrazing, invaded by weeds, with the soil eroded or compacted and with waterholes and waterways damaged, destroyed or polluted.</para><para>The IPA is a voluntary scheme which helps Indigenous land managers first to strategically plan and then to implement works to restore their country and to protect unique ecosystems and biodiversity. They are tackling the problems of goats, donkeys, camels, rabbits, cats, foxes, inappropriate fire regimes and weeds. Elders locate critically endangered native flora and fauna and work with scientists who can then better understand how to rescue those species. Some of our IPA participants are teaching their non-Indigenous neighbours how to bring back country that has been pushed to the limits. IPA participants develop work programs to maintain and sustain the country intergenerationally at the same time as they look to new ways to live off the land—for example, as providers of ecotourism or bush tucker enterprises, outdoor recreational specialists or providers of educational tours.</para><para>The IPA program is one of the many great success stories made possible by NHT funding, the biggest sum ever committed by any government to environmental sustainability works in this country. When combined with the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality and other environmental initiatives, it is clear that the John Howard led government has, in the year 2003-04, delivered the biggest ever injection of federal funds for sustaining and conserving our great country's natural resources. Natural resource protection, conservation and remediation are, we believe, the biggest challenges facing all Australians in this century. The scale of our budget commitment to the environment reflects this concern.</para><para>As the member from Murray, as well as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, I am sharply focused on the future of the Murray-Darling Basin, as are my constituents. Access to good quality water is the lifeblood of the region's economy, whether that be farming, manufacturing, urban consumption or tourism. Living and working amidst the natural beauty of the river land and forests, waking to the sounds of bird life and coexisting with the native fauna anchors and enriches the lives of communities and gives individuals' lives special meaning and purpose. We know the environment is in serious trouble. We understand that we must urgently take stock of all water consumption and management regimes that have left us with blue-green algal blooms poisoning the waters, feral fish supplanting native species and fouling wetlands, some 1,500 kilometres of red gum dying on the banks of the Murray from Euston downstream, houseboats blatantly fouling waters with fuel spills, grey water and human waste dumping and making noise and playing havoc with riverside habitat, and jet skis and speedboats eroding banks and frightening wildlife.</para><para>Tourism and recreation in the river lands is a significant activity, economically and culturally, but it must be better regulated and managed. We have to cut through the problem of cross-border anomalies where the mix of jurisdictions from New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia means regulations are not aligned. Critical areas—for example, regulating river use behaviour and the location and number of pumping outstations for houseboats—are left in the too-hard basket. </para><para>Right now, the states of the Murray-Darling Basin, the ACT and the Commonwealth are consulting on what environmental flows need to be returned in the future to sustain the Murray-Darling ecosystems. Regional communities can be assured that there is an acknowledgement that sustaining human community or human capital is equal in importance to sustaining natural capital, given that the latter depends on the former to invest in and manage the ecosystems sustainably. There is a close interdependency between human communities experiencing a life they consider worth leading for themselves and their children and their desire to invest in and protect and sustain the land and water that underpins their existence. </para><para>The development of models of ecosystem health indicators now being produced at the request of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission are hugely important in convincing basin communities that we have some idea about what volumes of additional environmental flows are needed to rescue the now threatened wetlands and flora and fauna and to improve water quality. We must be able to assure those who may have to relinquish some of their water rights—that is, the basis of their livelihood—that their sacrifice will deliver the outcome of a healthier river system. Nothing else will do.</para><para>I commend the John Howard government for its open-ended commitment to drought relief in this federal budget, with an expectation that at least $700 million will be expended in the next financial year. At the same time I want to condemn the Victorian Bracks led government, which has now withdrawn all drought aid to Victorian farmers—aid which was offered during its electoral campaign fervour in late 2002. The Victorian government package was announced months after similarly impacted farmers in New South Wales had been offered state funded support. The New South Wales measures included fodder subsidies. You can imagine the desperation of farmers in northern Victoria as they watched the transport convoys loaded with fodder crossing the rickety Murray River bridges and head for the subsidised dairy farms and livestock enterprises of New South Wales.</para><para>Some six months later, by the time the Victorian government noticed that it was electorally smart to offer some assistance to Victorian rural enterprises hit by the worst drought on record, it was too late. Any fodder was in critically short supply and way beyond the means of Victorian drought stricken farmers. A month or two ago rural communities were rocked by the announcement of the Victorian Minister for Agriculture, Bob Cameron, that all state drought aid to farmers was to be cancelled on 7 May. I hope the shadow spokesman for the environment, the member for Wills, is paying attention to this.</para><para>This drought has brought out the worst in political opportunism and callous disregard in the case of the Victorian government, but it has also given rise to the steady commitment of the federal government and to some extraordinary acts of kindness and generosity displayed by the wider community. For example, between 4 January and 11 January this year the farmers of King Island rallied to the call for fodder by donating 1,000 tonnes to Victorian drought relief. Farmers offered another 4,000 tonnes, but they could not afford to transport it to the mainland. There was a heartfelt plea to the Bracks government to cover the cost of the freight. Victoria's Deputy Premier, John Brumby, refused point-blank, stating that there should be plenty of fodder in Victoria. What a disgrace! Was he so out of touch or was it simply that he did not care about the crisis?</para><para>The Bracks government has also point-blank refused assistance to Goulburn-Murray Water—a state owned instrumentality—which is forced to charge drought devastated farmers for water it cannot deliver. Two hundred and eighty-eight farmers cannot pay and Goulburn-Murray Water cannot carry the debt. Due to the lack of water for sale over the last three years, and, despite raising prices by nearly 30 per cent, Goulburn-Murray Water is unable to fund essential major storage safety works—for example, at Eildon Reservoir. They need $12 million for that reservoir, which generates billions of dollars in farm gate value and tourism annually, underpinning the Victorian economy.</para><para>This is the first collapse of the irrigation system in 100 years. The Victorian economy has done very well out of the hard work and on-farm investment of irrigators, but in this hour of need it is simply walking away. Goulburn-Murray Water needs only $12 million to make Eildon Dam safe, but Premier Bracks of the Victorian Labor government says no. Instead, the Victorian government has provided $400 million for a new ticketing system for Melbourne's subsidised city commuter transport system, $27.8 million for a new footbridge over the Yarra, and $425 million for the redevelopment of the MCG northern stand. The Bracks government rejected a $77 million contribution from the Commonwealth government to assist with the MCG project because their union bosses told them not to touch the money.</para><para>So far, the Bracks government has received over $400 million in competition policy payments from the federal government, including for water law reform. Not a cent of these funds have found their way into the pockets of the water supply or farm sector. This is breathtakingly short-sighted. Clearly the Victorian state government does not understand or chooses to ignore the severity of this natural disaster. It has walked away.</para><para>Drought Force, an excellent federally funded government program introduced five months ago, may rescue at least some of our regional work force that is now looking at internal migration to capital seaboard cities. I commend the Commonwealth government for this extraordinarily far-sighted, humane and compassionate program. In my electorate of Murray some 55 individuals now do volunteer work on farms—they are paid a Newstart allowance under this program. Those who are monitoring the situation closely anticipate that at least 30 per cent of Murray electorate farmers may not be able to recover their losses sufficiently to re-establish herds and restart enterprises when the drought breaks. There is also a significant number of farm dependent businesses who have already lost too much equity in enterprises and who will struggle to continue.</para><para>This drought is a natural disaster. The next three months in particular will be the hardest of all. We are looking at less than 10 per cent of irrigation allocation at the opening of the season for the Goulburn system in August and possibly less than 30 per cent for the Murray system. I call on the Victorian Labor government members of the Senate and the House of Representatives to insist that their Labor colleagues in Spring Street, Melbourne revisit the decision to withdraw all drought aid to Victorian farmers. I do not know how members opposite can sit here with clear consciences if they do not demand the return of some drought aid to Victorian farmers. This is uncharted territory in terms of how we will survive. We need both state and Commonwealth support.</para><para>I commend the extraordinary efforts now being made in my community, with rural towns and small district communities undertaking family days and information sessions, trying to make do. The Shepparton Centrelink office has done an extraordinary job. With regard to primary producers' futures, however, the drought is just another blow in their struggle to farm sustainably. With regard to exported primary production, primary producers typically compete in corrupted, subsidised and managed markets, where any lowering of tariffs is often supplanted by non-tariff barriers aimed at protecting domestic producers. As well, exchange rate fluctuations can negatively or positively affect Australia's export earnings overnight, and the exporting competitors in these markets are often advantaged with home country subsidies, aid trade deals, and the like. It is an extremely tough world out there in agribusiness trade land.</para><para>Back home, there is no respite in domestic sales. In this country, a virtual duopoly dominates the food and beverage retail sector. This gives Woolworths and Coles-Myer, the two giants, the power to exert extraordinary downward pressure on the prices they pay to suppliers. And at the moment these two are particularly anxious to entrench their positions as they face a new era of the globalisation of retail food chains. Mr Roger Corbett, Chief Executive of Woolworths, spoke for his company and his rival when he said:</para><para>Instead of focusing on getting margins up in product categories, we are interested in getting our costs down. </para><para>This translates into: `We intend to keep prices down and we will do this by finding efficiencies and paying less to our suppliers.' Mr Corbett was hugely pleased to announce that $1 billion was sliced from Woolworths' costs over the last four years. He seemed particularly pleased to report that at least half of that came out of the pockets of dairy producers. </para><para>The big two can squeeze their suppliers because of their extraordinary purchasing power. Both use the cost reduction strategy of increasing the number of home brand products. Woolworths in particular is also pursuing the strategies of `Everyday low prices' and two-year tendering for suppliers with only one year of price agreement. Home brands deliver maximum returns to the retailer. They force the supplier to become a price taker, with their product vulnerable to substitution by any imported or domestic supplier who will accept a few cents less. Even suppliers of premium brands are being pressured to also supply so-called top quality home brands that will then compete directly with their own branded product. Woolworths `Everyday low price' strategy drops suppliers' prices and takes away their ability to initiate supermarket specials. Specials can move glutted stock for a processor or grower due to seasonal conditions, for example. Without this control over specials and advertising, suppliers lose their ability to optimally manage their stock. The supermarkets take total control. </para><para>In relation to the supermarkets' tendering system for suppliers, where five per cent can mean the difference in a farm product being undersupplied or oversupplied, and where there is virtually no alternative point of sale for the produce, there is invariably pressure on a supplier to submit a price near to or even below the costs of production. The supermarkets' pricing strategies and their use of their market power to push food and beverage suppliers' prices down has succeeded; in the case of Woolworths, they have succeeded in taking $500 million out of the pockets of dairy suppliers so far. Dairy prices in Victoria, for example, collapsed by 30 per cent over three months last year, just as the drought was beginning to bite. Another $500 million or so, Woolworths tell us, has been found through a combination of improved efficiencies and paying lower prices to a range of other primary producer suppliers. </para><para>So Australia's households will go on enjoying some of the cheapest and best food in the developed world, Woolworths and Coles-Myer shareholders will continue to see nice returns on their investments and the suppliers of those food and beverage products will be driven to survive on substantially less. Some commentators, including NGOs, wonder why some farmers are not fencing out their remnant vegetation, installing nutrient management systems, revegetating slopes, buying new and more efficient irrigation infrastructure, replacing lost nutrients, paying their workers more, reducing stocking rates, replacing introduced species with native pastures, restoring wetlands, tackling weed invasion, and exterminating feral animals. I suggest they go and talk to customers in the supermarkets. Australians need to understand that their cheap food is in fact costing the earth. </para><para>A range of farmers responded to a survey undertaken by Allen Consulting in 2001, the year before the major price collapse in the dairy industry. In a document called <inline font-style="italic">Repairing the country</inline> they quote the responses from land-holders who were asked to identify what factors prevented them from addressing environmental problems. Over 75 per cent cited a lack of funds. Another 67 per cent cited low commercial benefits. My farmer constituents put it this way: you cannot be green when you are in the red, and you cannot pull up your socks when you have none. In a classic `blaming the victim' statement, the Wentworth Group in their <inline font-style="italic">Blueprint for a living continent</inline> proclaimed: </para><para>We need to change our institutions to remove the hidden environmental subsidies to agriculture where farmers impose costs on other people or future generations. </para><para>They do somewhat redeem themselves in the next paragraph by saying:</para><para>These subsidies generally benefit consumers, not farmers, through lower prices, and often hurt farmers who are trying to be sustainable by making them compete with others who are not paying the full costs of their actions. </para><para>Farmers are simply not offered prices which cover the full cost, including the environmental externalities, in the production of food and fibre—and I have just been discussing why not. But it can and must be different. In a book soon to be published, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Agrifood Globalisation in Perspective</inline><inline font-style="italic">—Internal Restructuring in the Processing Tomato Industry</inline>, Associate Professor David Burch of Griffith University and Bill Pritchard, lecturer in economic geography at the University of Sydney, compare Australia's and Canada's systems of regulating manufacturer-supplier relationships so that the value to be derived from the sector is shared and the industry remains competitive and sustainable and even grows. </para><para>In Victoria some 10 years ago we dismantled what was a suboptimal but at least a working system of tomato industry supplier-buyer price negotiation and mediation. But it was replaced with the Commonwealth regulation which outlawed tomato growers' rights to even talk in the pub together about contract prices. While collective bargaining was lawful for workers in the labour market, more vulnerable micro-businesses like farmers were breaking the law if they sought to collaborate. </para><para>I commend the wisdom of the Dawson review of the Trade Practices Act, which identifies the inequities in the system. I also commend the initiative of the John Howard government in the establishment of the Grocery Ombudsman which, interestingly, has not been asked to deal with a single retailer-supplier dispute—due, I believe, to the huge potential for retaliation—but is now proving to be a godsend for those in supplier and wholesaler disputes. </para><para>We need to consider how other countries have dealt with the inevitable vulnerability of primary producers to be price squeezed and the consequences for them as managers of our natural resources when they are pushed to the brink of viability. It also has to be remembered that farmers are no longer necessarily in control of the decisions made about land use on their properties. They are, for example, often required to allow onto their properties contract harvesters employed by multinationals processors which are inappropriate for the best environmental protection of their soils. We have examples on Tasmanian vegetable farms of this. </para><para>We must find ways to transfer back the embedded subsidies in cheap food so it can be reinvested in environmental remediation and improvement of land and water management. It is essential that this be done if we are to protect the country which sustains the people and sustains our futures. Our supermarkets must and can behave ethically. They need to look to Sainsbury's and Tesco as two examples of supermarkets that have understood what is at stake if they simply push their suppliers to the brink. The development of crop and animal protocols which translate into higher price incentives for suppliers has been done elsewhere. Australians must look to those examples. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>15441</page.no><name role="metadata">McFarlane, Jann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JANN McFARLANE</name><name.id>83C</name.id><electorate>Stirling</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline> now before the House. In my time as the member for Stirling, I have experienced five budgets from the Howard government. I do not want to devote my time in this place to listing the many atrocities of Treasurer Costello's previous budgets, but I will say that this year's budget is no exception—again he treats the Australian people with contempt and again he fails to show the ability to have care and concern for justice and equity for all Australian people.</para></talk.start><para>If you listened to the Howard government rhetoric, health and education are two of their most important priorities. The Australian people are not that easily fooled, Prime Minister. This government has no real plans for health or education but, rather, ways to stop the everyday Australian from getting the access to the services that they deserve. Dismantling Medicare and the health system and increasing the burden on students, universities, TAFEs and colleges is not fair and equitable.</para><para>Allow me to start on the first of the Treasurer's supposed reforms of this year's budget: health. As part of my service to the electorate of Stirling, I produce a bulk-billing guide, listing all the bulk-billing surgeries in the area. The first edition of this guide, produced in late 2002, had 28 bulk-billing GPs on it. The list in latest edition, compiled in March of this year, has shrunk by more than 25 per cent, to be at 20 bulk-billing doctors for a population of approximately 90,000. On average, Australian patients go to a GP 6½ times per year. I trust that the government is able to do the maths.</para><para>Since the introduction of Medibank by the Whitlam government, Australia has been considered a world leader in government health provision for all in our community. However, the Howard government is slowly dismantling one of the most important government initiatives in Australian history and has left many Australians out in the cold when it comes to health care. What has this government given us as an alternative system? Not much. Private health insurance has been propped up by taxpayer money with questionable success—so now the whole population pays for rebates that go to the 44.1 per cent of people who are covered by private health insurance. Again, all of us pay the Medicare rebate yet, according to the government's private health insurance policy, only those not covered privately would actually use it.</para><para>Those Australians in private health insurance are not receiving the protection from fee hikes that the Prime Minister promised them so many times. Regularly, health insurance companies have raised their premiums well above CPI levels. Regularly, health insurance companies have ripped off their customers—and this government has sanctioned it. This government has never cared about health for low- and middle-income people and families, and this budget is no change of heart.</para><para>The shortage of doctors in this country is of growing concern. Particularly in rural centres, general practitioners are in short supply. Where is the Treasurer's commitment to fixing the problem? He will tell you it is in the $38.7 million dollars he has set aside for medical places. If he really cared about the number of doctors ordinary Australians had access to, the amount that universities could charge for these new spots would be fixed—naturally, it is not. There is a genuine shortage of doctors in this country, yet the Treasurer chooses to make a quick buck out of this through the universities rather than actually fixing the problem.</para><para>Prime Minister Howard says he is putting older Australians first by ensuring that pensioners have access to bulk-billing. My colleagues have outlined time and time again why the plan will not work—beyond that, even if it did work, this is still no real commitment to Australia's older people. Prime Minister Howard, if you cared about the health status of our pensioners you would do something about the crisis that is gripping aged care in this country. In the Stirling Electorate, bed licenses have been issued, but no new beds have been created since 1998, when I was elected. The fact that Australia has an ageing population seems to have escaped the government in putting together this budget.</para><para>I bring to the attention of the House the plight of one of my constituents, Mrs Athelle Thomas, herself 71 years old, having to pay the way of her 100-year-old mother because this government refuses to. Mrs Thomas is trying to find an aged care bed for her 100-year-old mother, so far without success. Mrs Thomas and her mother are not alone: hundreds of families in the Stirling electorate alone would be facing the aged care crisis daily—living with uncertainty for their own future and the future of their loved ones. If this government cared, the budget would have addressed the issue.</para><para>This government has got things upside down: health is clearly at the bottom of the list and one position above it is education. Treasurer Costello is striking at the heart of higher education in Australia with this budget. Australia has a worldwide reputation for educating its people. Treasurer Costello is trying his hardest to destroy that reputation. Gough Whitlam introduced a higher education system that ensured every Australian had the opportunity to go to university. When fees were introduced by the Hawke government, they were installed in such a way that, regardless of wealth, any Australian could still go to university. However, the Costello mentality is not about the most talented getting to university; it is about getting the richest to university. By giving universities 30 per cent freedom over their course fees, this government is creating a two-tiered system of education. If you are a student using HECS style repayments, you can expect to be in debt for the better part of your working life. For those families fortunate enough to be able to pay their sons, and daughters, fees up front, these positions will now cost anywhere up to $100,000.</para><para>I remember an Australia that, with the Whitlam government changes, became renowned for its creativity, ingenuity and skilful, intelligent citizens. This was the product of a time when Australians were admitted to universities on the basic of talent, not on how much they were prepared to pay. For the very small proportion of people out there with enough money to pay such high fees, there is some good news—the extremely wealthy minority will get into the top universities, regardless of talent, because they have a bank balance that meets the Treasurer's criteria.</para><para>The Treasurer talked about the value of education as an export. Granted, we should take advantage of our international reputation as an educator and open our universities to students from around the world. But this budget allows for up to 50 per cent of undergraduate places to be for full fee paying students, the majority of which would almost certainly be taken up by international students. Yes, let us make education an export; but let us not do that at the expense of young Australians, who have every right to a higher education within their own country.</para><para>Once, we were the clever country; but, under this government, we will soon become the class country once again. The measures in this budget in terms of education ensure that lower socioeconomic groups have no feasible access to higher education in this country. Australia's skilled work force makes up a high proportion of Australians because of the accessible education that Whitlam put in place three decades ago. Even past coalition governments have realised the importance of accessible higher education but, for the first time since the early 1970s, not every Australian will be able to go to university on the basis of merit. I am appalled. My constituents in Stirling are appalled. They are also fearful that their children and grandchildren will not get access to education.</para><para>Health and education should be the priorities of the budget, not the victims. But this government has enough disrespect for ordinary Australians to slash and burn through both areas of funding in the one budget. What compensation do the majority of Australians get for such poor policy? They get Treasurer Costello's tax cut—a very weak, very useless and very empty tax cut of $4 a week. Does that $4 compensate for the thousands of dollars extra that Australian families will pay to put a child through university? Does it compensate for the GP payments, and at times, poorer health of Australians? Does it compensate for the peace of mind it has taken away from middle Australia? No, it does not.</para><para>We, on this side of the House, take tax cuts very seriously. If the government did too, a tax cut would be introduced that managed to cover bracket creep or one that gave Australians more for their retirement. Instead, Australians are given a token cut—a cut that fails to confront bracket creep and is worth nothing. This empty tax cut should be measured up against the tax regime that the coalition has introduced during its time in government: for example, $4 a week compared against the Ansett levy, the milk tax and the sugar tax or $4 a week against a goods and services tax that was meant to simplify tax, but was really just another tax increase. The government, presumably, taxes Australians to fund public services. This government has ripped the most basic services—health and education—to shreds. Where is all this tax going, Treasurer Costello? Ordinary Australians, like the people of Stirling, deserve better. My colleagues and I are committed to serving the many, not the few.</para><para>The government is not only removing our basic services but failing to invest in our greatest strengths. Australia is held in high regard as a destination throughout the world. Tourism should be looked upon as a key industry for the growth of the Australian economy. The global tourist market is going through very tough times. Terrorism and a poor global economy are threatening thousands of Australian jobs. The industry is in a state of crisis, but this government has done literally nothing to nurture tourism while it is fragile. Airlines all over the world are collapsing and tourist destinations are going under every day, but the Prime Minister and Treasurer have twiddled their thumbs on this one, despite Australia's stronghold in the industry being threatened. I wonder if $4 a week will be enough to comfort those who lose their jobs because of government inaction.</para><para>This mentality can be seen especially in the electorate of Stirling. I have brought the issue of the Sunset Coast as a tourist destination to this place a number of times. This is one of hundreds of natural tourist destinations in Australia which receive no support from this government. In spite of the government not caring about Stirling's tourism—in spite of the lack of support—the Sunset Coast and the Stirling electorate have pressed on and continued to attract tourists. The City of Stirling has poured millions into developing the areas surrounding the beaches along our beautiful and pristine coast. However, this organisation should not have to act without the backing of the federal government. I am sure there are many councils throughout Australia being treated just as badly. Treasurer Costello, you do an injustice to our beautiful country by not supporting them. Recent publicity in the media points out that Australia is perceived overseas as one of the safe destinations. We should be doing everything possible to promote that safety, to promote our beautiful country and natural attractions and to attract tourists and the tourist dollar.</para><para>Neglect is a common theme in this budget. Health, education and tourism have all been comprehensively neglected by the powers that be. We can add Australian families to this list. The Howard government has, yet again, snubbed parents who need help balancing their work and parenting responsibilities. Nowhere in this budget is there anything for the average Australian family. It costs more to see a doctor and to get an education, particularly if they are a low- or middle-income family. These same families cannot go out and earn enough money to try to pay their way, because a large proportion of their pay packet goes toward child care. The government has left Australian families out in the cold yet again, with no paid maternity leave, no child-care relief and, clearly, no interest in making life easier for the Australian community, particularly working people.</para><para>The Howard government talks about the importance of work and family but there is little in this budget to give practical support and resources to Australian families. The only money that is going into the Family and Community Services budget this year is money to catch out Centrelink cheats. I agree that those who are cheating the system need to be caught but, if you look at the amount of money going into catching the minority and the amount of money going into helping the majority of genuine claims, there is a huge problem. This problem has existed throughout the Howard government's time in office and, year after year, it has washed its hands of family services and decided that it is a problem too hard to fix. I must also point out that, under the Family and Community Services portfolio, there seems to be a philosophy of funding pilot programs. Pilots run for a year or so and many have proved very successful, yet ongoing funding is not given to many of them. That sets up a situation of creating an expectation in communities that they have a service, but then suddenly the service disappears.</para><para>Judging by the measures taken in this budget, the federal government is eager to abandon you almost as soon as you leave Australian shores. Under the new budget, those on the majority of support payments will only continue to receive them for 13 weeks after leaving Australian borders. This means that those young Australians gaining an education overseas, like a growing number of Australian students, will be supported by their government for barely three months. I appreciate entirely that when someone leaves Australia they do so of their own accord, but this is just another way that the Treasurer has trimmed off the top in order to try and buy us all for $4 a head.</para><para>In the context of the Stirling electorate, the Treasurer and Prime Minister have starved the area of resources yet again. The people of Stirling are hardworking individuals from all walks of life. The treatment of the Stirling electorate in this budget is not unique; it repeats the treatment being given to many Australians: it ignores the needs of the everyday person. Stirling could easily be a tourism money-spinner for the federal government and the Treasury coffers. I challenge the government to find many other places in the world that have pristine beaches such as Scarborough, Trigg and North Beach located so close to a city centre. People throughout the world would pay to come and be a part of that—if the Howard government let them know. I cannot repeat this often enough.</para><para>But the neglect of Stirling is not only in terms of the tourism industry. The coastal suburbs within Stirling electorate have endured poor television reception for many years, due to the unique geography of the area. I have brought this matter to the attention of the government several times, with no success. It would seem that the people of Stirling do not deserve an adequate quality of television reception. This is despite the fact that barely half of the money allocated for fixing television black spots in the 2002-03 budget was spent. The Treasurer takes great pleasure in announcing his budget surplus, but this budget weighs down the people of Stirling, and many other Australians. An opportunity for Stirling people to get reasonable television reception was lost.</para><para>When people within the Stirling electorate are unable to get on aged care waiting lists because facilities are so overrun the lists have been closed, alarm bells should be ringing. Yet absolutely nothing is being done to give Australians the basic services they have earned through paying their taxes. Many people have said to me: `The problem with aged care beds not being built is due to the Howard government cancelling the capital grants program to build aged care beds in the cities. Why doesn't the Howard government use some commonsense and bring back the capital grants program for the cities?' Yes, Prime Minister and Treasurer, why don't you use commonsense and bring back the capital grants program for the cities and enable the many thousands of beds, for which licences have been issued, to be built?</para><para>The poor decision making and planning by the Howard government is affecting areas not covered by federal legislation. When the federal government keeps on passing the buck, someone has to take up the slack. In the case of Western Australia, it is the Labor state government. Health has been continually patched up by the state government. The system has been propped up with state funds earmarked for other important areas.</para><para>The Western Australian Minister for Health, Bob Kucera, told me recently that in Western Australian hospitals there are 260 aged people who should be in an aged care facility. This is an enormous drain on state government finances—money that should be going into providing health services to people using the public hospital system. As well, it is an enormous saving for the federal government budget. This is perhaps how Treasurer Costello has brought in his surplus. The state government is paying for the health provisions that the federal government should be paying for.</para><para>Budgets in the years gone by have, just like this one, resulted in degradation of services and less support for those in need. All of Treasurer Costello's budgets have robbed low-income and middle-income Australia of the service and support that previously made Australia a world example of social equity. As a mother and a grandmother and the member for Stirling, I am offended by what this budget is trying to do. I want my children and grandchildren to have reasonable access to health care. So do Stirling constituents. I want to know that I live in a country which looks after its young citizens. So do Stirling constituents. This is not just about their health; it is also about their education. It is a crime against our children and against Australians in general to starve a massive proportion of our population of higher education access. This budget neglects the things most important to me, and most important to ordinary Australians. We have been lucky enough to have had visionary leaders like Whitlam, Hawke and Keating, who saw the necessity of giving all Australians a strong infrastructure and resources. This budget is about tearing those basic resources away. It is poor economics, it is cheap politics and, sadly, it is an injustice against every Australian who believes in a fair go.</para><para>We on this side of the House simply want a fair go for every Australian. I am proud of Labor's resolve when it comes to health and education. I worry that the Treasurer has gotten so lost in undermining Labor's principles that he has forgotten what this place is about—representing Australians. This budget is no different from its predecessors, and I am appalled at the Howard government's approach to managing Australia's finances. You do not balance a budget through cutting essentials—you balance a budget through long-term investment and vision, something the Howard government has once again shown to be lacking. I call on the government to restore justice and equity and rethink its budget.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>15446</page.no><name role="metadata">McArthur, Stewart, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McARTHUR</name><name.id>VH4</name.id><electorate>Corangamite</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1540">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-2003</inline>. I am delighted to participate in this year's budget deliberations because of the strength of the Australian economy and the fundamentally sound basis on which the budget has been put forward to this parliament. As the Treasurer has said on a number of occasions publicly, we have a situation in Australia, unlike the United States and other countries around the world, where the budget has delivered a tax cut and is in surplus, yet we have been through a drought and we have been through the Iraq war. If you look at that scenario, you see that the presentation of this year's budget is a remarkable demonstration of the strength and fundamental soundness of the Australian economy.</para></talk.start><para>The growth rate projected in the budget is 3.25 per cent for the next financial year. This compares very favourably with other countries around the world and gives us a basis of confidence that we can move forward to fulfil the budget commitments and again, hopefully, provide a tax cut and bring in a surplus. The surplus of $2.2 billion compares very favourably with other countries. Those opposite should be fully aware of this budget as it compares to the Keating years, when deficit budgeting was the order of the day. In the USA, the Bush administration has produced a budget which is 4.2 per cent of GDP. My understanding is that if you convert that to Australian terms that would be a $30 billion deficit in the Australian budget. So we can see the relativity. In Japan, the budget deficit is eight per cent of GDP; again, a very big figure. The OECD budget deficit is 3.5 per cent of GDP and the EU budget deficit is about two per cent of GDP. So it can be seen that the Australian position is very good indeed, and that has not come about by any stroke of luck. It is because of sound economic management, taking the hard decisions and introducing policies that are for the benefit of all Australians.</para><para>Those opposite are always nagging around the edges, but unless we get the economy moving in the right direction, unless it is sound, everyone will suffer. If you look at the public debt position—again, something those opposite tend to overlook—the $96 billion debt that the Keating and Hawke governments ran up was something they glossed over year after year. The sum of $63 billion of that debt has now been paid off, leaving us with approximately $35 billion worth of government debt, which is four per cent of GDP. Again we can look at this total debt relative to other countries, and we see an interesting and stark figure. In Germany the public debt is 50 per cent of GDP, for the OECD it is about 50 per cent and for the EU it is about 55 per cent. A staggering 80 per cent of the GDP of Japan is held in government debt and in the USA it is about 45 per cent. Australia, according to the budget papers, is showing a trend to reduce its public indebtedness, whereas other developed countries are showing a trend towards increasing their public indebtedness. As everyone would be aware, that sustains an interest rate cost to governments and to the people of those countries.</para><para>Of course, the tax cuts are a showpiece of this particular budget. Whilst some commentators and those opposite and others have suggested that the tax cuts are not very great, let me say that by giving a tax cut the government is flagging its position that it is a low-taxing government and it wishes to keep the incentive for people to work and save, whereas most Labor governments around Australia have increased their taxes. In fact, in Victoria 300 items are now indexed so they will go up automatically without any decision or debate. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the new tax rates proposed by the government.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para>The personal income tax thresholds will be increased as follows:</para><table pgwide="1" border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><tgroup><tbody><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Current tax thresholds Income range ($)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>New tax thresholds Income range ($)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Tax rate (%)</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>0-6,000</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>0 - 6,000</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>0</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>6,001 - 20,000</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>6,001 - 21,600</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>17</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>20,001 - 50,000</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>21,601 - 52,000</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>30</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>50,001 - 60,000</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>52,001 - 62,500</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>42</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>60,001 +</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>62,501+</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>47</para></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><quote></quote><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McArthur, Stewart, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McARTHUR</name></talker><para>—I want to refer to the tax rates that I have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and the changes to the various thresholds. This is very important because of the way they affect individual tax payers. The threshold where people pay no tax is $6,000, and from $6,001 to $21,600 they will be taxed at a rate of 17 per cent. The next tax rate, the 30c tax rate, from $21,601 to $52,000, has gone up approximately $2,000. That is where a high number of Australian taxpayers are incorporated, paying the 30c in the dollar tax rate. The next threshold, which is the 42c tax rate, has been raised about $2,000, covering income from $52,001 to $62,500. Of course, the highest tax rate is for income over $62,500. The income threshold for the 47c tax rate has moved up from $60,001 to $62,501. Obviously here in Australia, as people's incomes rise, thresholds and tax rates are a major problem; the 47 c tax rate plus the Medicare levy coming in at $62,501 is starting to affect a higher number of Australians. I encourage opposition members and senators to support the government's suggested change to a $70,000 tax rate, which was rejected by the Senate last year.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There we have it: a change in the thresholds and a reduction in tax. This is a very great thing from the government, that they are prepared to return hard won money back to individual taxpayers rather than spending it on grandiose programs. Whilst commentators and those opposite have been saying the tax reductions to individuals are very small, the trend is right and the cost to revenue is $10.7 billion over four years. So it is very significant, and that demonstrates a problem—that any tax reduction can be quite difficult for the Treasurer and budget estimates.</para><para>If we look at world economic conditions we see Australia's very good position. We have a growth rate projected at 3¼ per cent relative to the projected world growth rate, which has got a few problems, of about three per cent. Look at some of our trading partners: Japan for instance has got almost a zero projected growth rate, and six major banks are facing bankruptcy yet again and are being bailed out by the central government; the Middle East has got some difficulties; and the SARS epidemic has had a major impact on airlines. This is just another factor of world economics. As everyone would be aware, the American economy dominates world economic situation with some 25 per cent of the world's economic activity. However, the Bush administration has seen fit to run a deficit budget and the position of the American economy is a major concern to me and to Australia. US interest rates are at a 40-year low. Again there are possibilities of deflation taking place in the USA. A number of commentators are now worrying about the distinct possibility that the US may enter a deflationary stage rather than fighting the bogey of inflation. There is a problem with Germany as they need structural change in their labour force and their banking system. You have the UK, which has only 1.8 per cent growth rates. If you look at that you see that Australia has done well, that the Howard-Costello economic management has been one of responsibility, one of setting the right policy for the benefit of all Australians in the longer term rather than short-term political advantage.</para><para>There are several issues that are incorporated in the budget, but one that is not actually in the budget is the GST. Now the states are receiving some $28 billion—I think that is the latest figure sourced to their revenue—and a couple of them are ahead of the allocation that would they would be receiving from the Commonwealth. This is a growth tax. The premiers are reluctant to acknowledge the political courage of the Commonwealth in instituting this tax. I notice that even Premier Bracks, Premier Beattie and others were never critical of the fact that they would be receiving the GST but they were happy to go on the ALP bandwagon in their opposition to the GST. I notice there is no roll-back. The GST is here and there is no roll-back from the shadow minister at the table, Ms Gillard; even she is not going to roll-back the GST, if she ever gets to government. We do not hear much policy alternative from those opposite about the GST. Every other country around the world has got a similar tax. Those opposite have got many big spending proposals but they have not got any genuine revenue proposals to seek the revenue for their big-spending operations.</para><para>I put it on the record that the courage of Treasurer Peter Costello and his detailed proposals put to the Australian people are very important policies which will be of benefit to the states in the longer term. I predict better relationships between the Commonwealth and the states because they genuinely now have a growth tax, they have revenue that comes their way and they will not be resorting to some of those other minor taxes which have been so much an irritant to the population of those states.</para><para>I will move on to the drought. Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, you, I and other rural members have been greatly concerned about the drought as it impacts on all rural Australians. There has been a lot of comment about exceptional circumstances, and I again say to the states: you are very quick to blame the Commonwealth about the arrangements for drought aid and the criteria for exceptional circumstances. The Commonwealth is providing some $740 million over the total drought package. There has been some debate about this, but the Commonwealth has come good with the money while the states have spent most of their time complaining and not contributing to the drought effort. I condemn them for their attitude and lack of performance. The lack of water throughout the eastern states is a major worry, and it is my hope that we get a good general rain before the winter sets in.</para><para>In terms of health, this budget provides a $42 billion, five-year health agreement for the states for 2003-07. It is a 70 per cent real growth rate, and I think the argument that the states should contribute in similar terms is quite valid and sensible. That should be agreed to by the states, rather than having the argument at election times about how they are going to be better health providers than their opponents and that it is the Commonwealth's problem all the time. In terms of the PBS scheme, I again support the Treasurer's comments last year that this scheme will be unsustainable—it now costs $5.7 billion, and will move to $7 billion in the year 2006-07—unless there are a considerable number of copayments. Very small though they are, they do help to contain the scheme. This is a very important scheme for all Australians, especially older Australians, and it should be maintained at a more sensible economic level.</para><para>The 30 per cent private health insurance rebate is also a matter of some debate by those opposite. They will not quite say whether they are going to take it away, but they are looking at the $2 billion that has been contributed by this government to individual private health insurance holders. There was only 30 per cent of our population in private health funds in January 1999—and there was 44 per cent in December 2002. This helps to sustain the system. Even Senator Richardson said that we needed a private health system to ensure the long-term possibilities of health in Australia. The provision of private health insurance ensures that there is an alternative and that more funds will be injected into the total health system in the longer term.</para><para>I will now refer to some of the policy debates that are incorporated in Budget Paper No. 4 and a speech given by Dr Ken Henry, Treasury secretary, to the Australian Business Economists on May 30. I will quote from that, because he covers the issues in Budget Paper No. 4. In that paper, he talks about long-term wealth production in Australia and the importance of the population of working age. He talks about participation; that is, the number of hours worked by those participants in the work force, and productivity; that is, the GDP generated per hour. There is a fair bit of discussion about those matters in terms of what is involved and how those parameters make Australia a better and wealthier nation. Those matters are canvassed quite extensively in Budget Paper No. 4 and, fundamentally, one of the key tenets of that is the importance of Australia maintaining its population both in sheer numbers and in terms of the spread of age groups.</para><para>As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, Japan has a problem with an ageing population. That problem that has hit Japan before it will hit Australia. This trend is something that we need to be concerned about. Mr Henry makes the comment in his paper that this will not be such a major problem in America. He says:</para><quote><para>As the Economist magazine noted in a recent essay on America's demographic exceptionalism—</para></quote><para>he is saying that America has a breadth of population and working population and will be a driver for economic activity—</para><quote><para>“... anyone who assumes that the United States is now at the zenith of its economic or political power is making a big mistake. There are plenty of other ways in which America could weaken itself economically or politically, but demography we will offer a fine basis for future growth, and strength.”</para></quote><para>There we have it. In America, they have not only their fundamental strength now but—because of the range of ages in their population, their birth rate and their diversity—they will continue to be a nation of strength.</para><para>Budget Paper No. 4 has a number of policy options which I personally have been interested in over the years in this parliament, which the Howard government have adopted and which have been the underpinning basis of our increasing wealth here in Australia. Mr Henry said that Budget Paper No. 4 contains OECD findings into the linkages between policy settings, participation and productivity performance. The OECD said:</para><quote><para>Anti-competitive ... market regulation worsens labour market performance.</para><para>Labour market regulation affects product market performance.</para><para>... 	... 	...</para><para>Job security cannot be bought with anti-competitive product market regulation.</para><para>Product market deregulation does not lead to permanent increases in earnings inequality.</para></quote><para>That is from the OECD. That is a bit of jargon. But Mr Henry goes on to note some of the important policy settings that have taken place here in Australia:</para><quote><para>First, policies directed at improving education and training.</para></quote><para>That is the first one. So the higher education reforms that Minister Brendan Nelson has brought forward are very much in line with international best practice.</para><quote><para>Second, policies to enhance labour market flexibility; permitting the evolution of markets that facilitate the deployment of new technologies, the engagement of older workers and the upgrading of skills.</para></quote><para>When the industrial relations acts were changed in 1996, it brought about flexibility on the waterfront and through the whole Australian work force.</para><quote><para>Third, taxation policies that recognise the disincentive effects of high marginal rates; developing a tax system that encourages participation rather than early retirement ...</para></quote><para>There we have it again—taxation rates need to be reduced, especially marginal tax.</para><quote><para>Fourth, health and welfare policies—including the interaction of the tax and social security systems—that encourage labour market participation.</para></quote><para>Again, we need to get the mix between welfare and those going on to welfare, and certainly the McClure report addressed those issues.</para><quote><para>And fifth, a pro-competition reform agenda, encompassing the areas of energy, water and transport ...</para></quote><para>I note that Mr Graeme Samuel, who has done a remarkable job in this area, has now been appointed to the position that Dr Fels has held. I note on the record the remarkable contribution that Graeme Samuel has made in competition policy. Mr Henry's final important comment is that demographic change will be a key driver of economic activity. Of course, the Intergenerational Report tabled last year highlighted the problem facing Australia in the future. I commend the budget. I commend the Treasurer and the Prime Minister for a most responsible document and forward-thinking policy setting.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>15451</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>. I want to concentrate this reply to the budget on the higher education reforms. The Labor platform in 1973 could afford to say that all education should be free. But by introducing HECS the Hawke government recognised that, in fact, free education was subsidising the better off. Professor Bruce Chapman, the architect of HECS, says frankly that free tertiary education was regressive and unfair. He says that, before HECS, there was a clear relationship between enrolment in higher education and measures of family wealth.</para></talk.start><para>When I entered tertiary education in 1964, 20 to 25 per cent of students paid fees, but the vast majority had teachers college or Commonwealth scholarships. However, by the early 1980s, with more and more seeking university education, a funding crisis was looming. The Hawke government introduced the Higher Education Contributions Scheme in 1989 with an $1,800 fee for all undergraduates across all courses. In 1996 the cost of a HECS education increased by 20 per cent as the coalition government introduced a three-tier fee structure, based on not only the cost of the course but the income expectations from high-HECS courses like law. </para><para>The HECS scheme is supposed to be a balance between the private benefit that accrues to university graduates and the public benefit of training doctors, nurses, teachers, engineers, scientists and—some might say `unfortunately'—lawyers. Until the changes introduced in this budget, the evidence from Professor Bruce Chapman shows that HECS has had no or a negligible impact on the demand for higher education or access by the poor. I agree. At the moment the balance between student contribution and taxpayer contribution is just about right. The affordability is just about right. The need for a fair input to pay for the privilege of a university degree and later opportunities that accrue is just about right.</para><para>With the emergence of a growing user-pay-policy, there has been a steep and steady decline in federal funding to universities over the past 20 years. The struggle of universities to make ends meet despite HECS is stark. There has been a 25 per cent decline in professorial and lecturer salaries since the early 1980s, corresponding with diminished government support. With more and more research skewed to market outcomes, there has been a loss of truly academic study and pursuit of learning. One uni cut out literature and another removed languages, while humanities departments have been downgraded or gutted. With salaries at 75 per cent of university costs, government operating grants by 2001 were half a billion dollars behind the growth in average earnings. Staff-student ratios have increased dramatically over the past decade.</para><para>Enter the Nelson reforms as manifested in the budget. They came after a thorough consultation process, for which the minister must be commended. The big universities—based in the capital cities and close to the pool of prospective students and the high incomes of full fee paying locals or foreign students—were always likely to be the winners in this reform. The regional universities, like Charles Sturt, Bathurst, Wagga and Albury, were the ones likely to miss out—by dint of their distance from their student pool and the comparative advantage of size and prestige embodied in the big eight campuses which had been established on the back of so much public funding over the many years. </para><para>By allowing universities to increase their HECS charges by 30 per cent, the government, I believe, is laying the groundwork for a two-tier university system. But it can be rectified. Universities say they will not be automatically increasing fees and, in CSU's case, after discussing it with them I can understand their wish to constrain fees in the interests of their students' socioeconomic profile and hope that it will be met. But one would have to be a supreme optimist to believe that there will not be an inexorable per cent by per cent increase in fees over the next five to 10 years, heading towards that 30 per cent. It is a bit like the Medicare reforms we are seeing.</para><para>Some universities, recognising their dominance in high-demand courses, will not worry about the niceties of gradual increases. Universities will apply a surcharge equal to what the market will bear. The law school at Melbourne University or vet science at Sydney could, if they choose, push their charge to the maximum rate overnight, such is the demand for their degrees. Indeed, recognising this inevitability, the Vice-Chancellor of Melbourne University, Alan Gilbert, this morning is calling for not only a lift in the threshold of average earnings at which students repay their HECS but also an increase in the loans cap and 15,000 more Commonwealth scholarships. He also believes that there needs to be a variation in HECS fees within a course for poorer students. I would suggest more liberal guidelines for independent youth allowance would be a greater help than lower repayments after a degree and a salary have been obtained.</para><para>For a student, doing uni study and surviving is the greatest financial challenge, particularly for students from relatively poorer rural communities who have to go away to study. While it is good to see Melbourne's vice-chancellor talking about equity issues in this package, this system will allow high-status sandstone universities to pay higher salaries and attract better staff. That may be all very well, but I cannot see any outcome other than a two-tier system developing. I would suggest that the regional loadings on offer for places like Charles Sturt are just not enough. This area of the package needs serious review, with at least a 10 per cent loading needed instead of the current 2½ per cent to five per cent on offer.</para><para>Despite a new grants scheme, the government is largely transferring the problem of indexing grants from the Commonwealth to the student. Let us not forget that, for all the talk about a $6 billion injection of government money into the university sector, when you transfer more of the cost of education to the student, the taxpayer is going to get it back in the long run through the tax system as students repay their HECS and their loans. So, really, it is a clever cost-shift and not a long-term investment in infrastructure, particularly of our tertiary education sector.</para><para>The doubling of the full-fee payer cap from 25 to 50 per cent and the introduction of the loans scheme are designed both to increase revenue for universities and to broaden access to lower-income background students. But they also increase the number of students there by dint of capacity to pay rather than pure academic merit. Is this an investment in excellence? The loans scheme might be seen as an improvement in equity of access for those failing to gain HECS places and wanting to do degrees in the lower fee range, but there are major problems with the high-fee courses. How can a person from a disadvantaged background hope to do law or medicine by accessing a $50,000 loan when the full fee is around $140,000? Will these loans be enlarged or extended and at what ultimate cost to the repayer? The loans scheme for this classification of student—the poorer ones seeking a higher income outcome—is a Clayton's option for those from low-income backgrounds trying to access the more expensive degrees and unable to get a HECS place. They are faced with the full fee less the loan. How do they fund the $94,000 which is the difference? They simply will not be able to afford it. Those who are able to pay under the current circumstances can also get a loan, it seems. The scheme seems to me to be a handy source of windfall funding for the well-off, but it offers little or no advantage to the poorer to afford a meal ticket to a high-paid career.</para><para>While poorer students may be able to lower their income sights and do an arts degree covered by loan, it looks like the high-paying careers will be reserved in the main for the higher paying students from affluent backgrounds—apart, of course, from those recipients of HECS places. The question remains: why are we allowing universities to trade off half their places to full fee payers—whether they pay for it up front or by loan? The simple answer is: the system needs the bucks. But is it fair and equitable and in the best long-term interests of this nation? There is certainly more money in the system at the end of the day, but are the right people in the classes? Have we maximised our intellectual and creative capital? I think not. Do we risk a tick and flick environment, such as noted economist Clive Hamilton reports, where 11 out of 13 students receive first-class honours in economics at one campus when you would be lucky to find one student deserving enough 20 years ago? </para><para>The Nelson package has offered a carrot of $404 million dollars in additional Commonwealth course contributions from 2005, perhaps in recognition of the half-a-billion-dollar funding black hole that has developed since 1995. However, in typical style, it is tied to the provision that a university must adhere to the new national governance protocols and comply with Commonwealth workplace relations policy, including the specification that enterprise agreements between staff and the university do not preclude Australian workplace agreements—individual agreements between the employer and employee determining wages and conditions. The National Tertiary Education Union said in March that any measures to force or even encourage AWAs would be strongly opposed. Having spoken with people in the sector, it seems to me to be an unnecessary battle that common-law contracts could avoid. It seems more like it is the Abbott ideological injection into the education reform process. I am informed by what I believe are objective university contacts that an AWA is an unwieldy instrument—particularly, for example, where a revision of an agreement is sought by either party—in contrast to what can be achieved through the common-law contract route.</para><para>I believe this package is going to need adjustments along the lines I have outlined if it is to be acceptable to universities, students, families and the taxpaying public. While some countries still do place a high value on universal free university education, I think we have other funding crises and, therefore, priorities in this country—like TAFE, our public school system and health care. These changes—extreme as they have been painted in some quarters—will in fact mean students pay only about a third of the cost of their education. I believe there must be a balance between user pays and public pays in education, but I believe this package shifts the pendulum too far to the user, with the major beneficiaries the sandstone unis and the well-off. As a sign of true commitment to our education future, the government—and, indeed, the alternative one—should build a system of taxation allowances into its policy to encourage and reward long-term savings by families for their children's education.</para><para>Public funding for higher education in this country accounts for just 0.6 percent of GDP. That is down from 0.9 per cent in 1996, and the budget papers show it will actually fall to 0.5 per cent in 2004-05. Only three OECD countries are behind us in terms of public spending on higher education. What is the point of having one Australian university in the world's top 100—whatever that means—if many of the other 36, particularly regional universities, might well be struggling to attract top teachers and top students while locked into a discount price degree competition with other smaller universities? The danger—or one of them—in this package is not the underlying fund generation process but the incentives within it that favour the large over the small and the failure to properly recognise the disadvantage of rural campuses and their need for significantly more capital funding.</para><para>The big loser in tertiary education in this budget is TAFE. There is no recognition by way of significantly increased funding for the sector that it is more and more taking on the job of training young Australians. There has been an increase of 68.5 per cent in the number of vocational education and training students since 1992. There are half a million TAFE students in NSW alone, with 36,000 at the Western Institute of TAFE based in Orange. With a far greater proportion of students attending TAFE than university, TAFE receives about one-third of the funding received by universities per equivalent full-time student.</para><para>At the very least the government, when negotiating the new ANTA agreement with the states, should ensure the 16 per cent cut in funds to TAFE during its period of 20 per cent growth over the past five years is restored and that pre-apprenticeship training is reintroduced. If the argument is used that the GST revenues should be used to fill in those gaps, let us have the explanation why and let us have the states step up to the mark to ensure that that growth gap and those pre-apprenticeship training options are reintroduced in a spirit of federation cooperation. It is no good talking of a synergy between high school, TAFE and university if these, too, remain grossly under-funded poor cousins.</para><para>Before leaving education let me comment on anomalies in the scholarship system. While Commonwealth learning, education cost and accommodation scholarships are welcome, there is a real problem in their treatment as income. They are regarded as income for independent youth allowance but are not regarded as income for the purposes of establishing independent status to qualify for youth allowance. That situation is a nonsense and should be attended to.</para><para>As well, the budget papers acknowledge the significant burden for parents of accommodation charges and point out around 10,000 students from rural and isolated areas—many from low socioeconomic backgrounds—move away from home each year for higher education. While welcome, 1,500 scholarships will not go far to overcome the enormous disadvantages rural students face compared with those living at home in the city.</para><para>While it is possible to amend this education package to make it fairer—for rural campuses in particular—I do not see any salvation for Medicare under the proposed reforms planned in this budget. The carrot of almost a billion dollars worth of incentives to encourage bulk-billing of the poorest and concession card holders is really a slush fund to dismantle Medicare as we know it. The Productivity Commission says $50 is a reasonable charge for a GP consultation. Instead of subsidising private health cover and offering tax cuts to the well off, this largesse could be used to encourage bulk-billing across the board.</para><para>Everywhere I have gone in my electorate in recent weeks people ask me why the government or the opposition do not suggest an increase in the Medicare levy. We want universal health cover for the most basic of health services—a visit to the doctor—so we need to find the resources to pay for it. That is not me speaking; that is what people are saying to me. They do not believe people on $30,000 to $50,000—in particular, many single income families with two or three or more kids—should now be faced with the certainty of a $25 dollar upfront fee for seeing a doctor, whether it happens tomorrow or the week after next.</para><para>They know their GP is not ripping them off; they know some specialists are. But they know if the Medicare rebate offered to doctors was increased to about $33—that seems to be a fee that both doctors and the public recognise when they stop and think about it—then doctors could afford to bulk-bill and would not be forced to seek the full $25 differential between the current rebate and the Productivity Commission's $50 figure. And, quite frankly, the Labor Party's suggestion of $3 has been treated with near contempt out there as far as I can see. Families earning this $30,000 to $50,000 range stand to gain just $208 from tax breaks but this will be eaten up by eight family visits to the doctor.</para><para>These changes will cost shift more and more medical care from the Commonwealth to the states as those lower income families seek assistance at state hospitals. This is user-pays ideology gone mad. People will pay: with their health. Like the mean-minded abolition of dental health funding, the system will somewhere have to carry the cost of a sicker society down the track.</para><para>I have conducted an informal survey of doctors in my electorate on the Medicare changes. The overwhelming majority want a public inquiry into Medicare. Only two of the doctors believe the incentives on offer would help cover the costs of bulk-billing. Most saw it as a transfer of administration from Medicare offices straight to the doctor's surgery.</para><para>Dr Michel Guerin from Molong says it will cost him twice as much a year to administer the changes as he will receive for the privilege of helping to run Medicare. With 60 per cent of his patients concession card holders he will be forced to opt into this scheme; he will have no choice. He also offers bulk-billing to some farmers, farm workers and others affected by the drought for instance. `What happens to them now?' he asks. They will have to cop the extra $15 now and probably $20 to $25 down the track. Dr Guerin says its good to see the budget incentives to try and attract doctors to the bush, but why would they come to Molong when they can earn a far more comfortable life in the city?</para><para>Three-quarters of those surveyed said they expect low and middle-income earners to now seek basic health care at a hospital. Only one doctor seemed to back the philosophy that I believe is behind the government's long-term agenda. `Bulk-billing and the Medicare system,' he says, `should be done away with in its entirety.' I will reserve my other comments on the other portfolios until the committee discussion stages.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>15456</page.no><name role="metadata">Pearce, Christopher, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PEARCE</name><name.id>A8W</name.id><electorate>Aston</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline>. Australia's economy is in good shape and continues to outperform other like nations throughout the world. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development—the OECD—Australia's armour-plated economy is leading the world and is better equipped than ever to withstand financial crises at home or abroad.</para></talk.start><para>Let me start by taking the House back 10 years to the fiscal year 1993-94. Under the then Keating government, Australia recorded the following key economic conditions for our country: the budget was in deficit in the order of $17.1 billion, unemployment was at a rate of 10.2 per cent, government debt was a staggering $70.2 billion or 15.7 per cent of GDP and home loan interest rates were approximately nine per cent.</para><para>Let me move forward to this fiscal year and contrast those days with the current performance of Australia's economy after just seven years under the coalition government. The budget is in surplus by about $2.2 billion. Unemployment is low and is forecast to average six per cent. Government debt has fallen drastically. It has been reduced by $63 billion to $33 billion, representing around four per cent of GDP—one of the lowest levels of general government debt in the OECD. Home loan interest rates are around six per cent.</para><para>This budget is about protecting, securing and building Australia's future by taking responsible action. In the past year Australia has had to deal with unexpected pressures like the Bali atrocity, the war in Iraq, the worst drought on record and the unstable world economic environment. Despite these pressures, the coalition has been able to deliver in this budget a responsible plan that further strengthens certainty and stability for families not only in my electorate of Aston but right across Australia.</para><para>This plan not only protects and secures Australia in the immediate future but also, just as importantly, provides the stability and certainty needed to build Australia in the long term. The coalition is committed to keeping Australia's economy strong. Keeping the economy strong is good news for Australian families and small businesses which benefit from jobs growth, lower interest rates and the security of a stable economic future.</para><para>Most developed economies of the world are experiencing downturns and are deeply in deficit. In this very difficult international environment the Australian economy has shown remarkable resilience. Our economy has continued to grow solidly, outperforming most other developed economies. Investment has surged, employment has grown strongly and inflation has remained moderate. Looking forward, despite continuing global economic weakness the prospects for the Australian economy remain solid. Economic growth in the coming budgetary year is forecast to be 3¼ per cent. The unemployment rate is expected to remain steady and inflation is expected to be within the target band.</para><para>This has not come about by accident. It has come about by hard work and taking the tough decisions that have been necessary. The dividend for Australians is clear. Good economic management by the coalition has allowed for responsible extra spending on Medicare, universities and defence, as well as income tax cuts. In contrast to world trends, the budget remains in surplus, taking pressure off interest rates and keeping them low. This budget, in fact, represents the government's sixth surplus.</para><para>Let me talk about taxation. All Australians have contributed to our strong economy and now all tax-paying Australians will receive personal income tax cuts. From 1 July Australian taxpayers will share in personal income tax cuts worth $10.7 billion over the next four years. These tax cuts reflect the coalition's belief that whenever it can responsibly cut taxes and return money to Australian families it should do so. The government has a strong belief that any money left over in the budget—after providing for the important things like defence, health, education, support for those who need it most and paying back debt—should be returned to the Australian people. After all, it is rightly theirs.</para><para>In regard to health, the coalition is committed to improving access for all Australians to quality health care and preserving Medicare. This year the government expects to spend more than $30 billion on health care, which represents approximately one-fifth of total government spending. In the coming financial year the government will have increased health spending by around 65 per cent since the coalition came to office. The government remains committed to ensuring that Australians have choice in their health care. The government's 30 per cent private health insurance rebate and Lifetime Health Cover have helped increase private health insurance coverage to 44 per cent by December 2002.</para><para>Over the next five years the federal government will provide the states and territories with up to $42 billion to support the provision of free public hospital services. This represents a 17 per cent real increase in federal funding. But it is important that the onus of growing funding for hospitals be shared. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare the state and territory share of total funding has fallen from 47.2 per cent in 1997-98 to 43.4 per cent in 2000-01, while in contrast the Commonwealth share has risen from 45.2 per cent to 48.1 per cent over exactly the same period.</para><para>The government's A Fairer Medicare package, an investment of $916.7 million, protects the rights of all Australians to affordable health care. This budget strengthens Medicare by further integrating prevention, health promotion and disease management within the health system—making prevention a fundamental part of Medicare. New measures increase the government's total commitment to the Tough on Drugs strategy, to over $1 billion for this very important area.</para><para>Let me now talk about education. Improving higher education is important to the future of this country. No Australian university has ever been listed among the world's top 100 universities. Australian universities need to be competitive, not only in Australia but also in the global community. They need to offer a world class education for the future of our country's youth. The government has committed to additional funding and the structural reform which is necessary for building the future of our universities and Australia.</para><para>Education creates opportunities for all Australians to improve their standard of living. The government will introduce wide-ranging reforms to ensure that the higher education system provides greater access to a high quality of education for all Australians. The government will invest an additional $1.5 billion in the system over the next four years to make this a reality. The features of the government's higher education reforms are many. They include a $775 million increase over three years from 2005 in base funding for universities, directly benefiting around 400,000 students; and $211 million from 2006 in further incentives to strengthen the quality of teaching and encourage diversity in the education system. People's education sets the foundation for their participation in the community and assists them in reaching their goals and aspirations.</para><para>I turn to the area of defence. Our nation's security is a key priority of the coalition. The government has provided additional funds to further improve the Australian Defence Force's capacity to protect Australia and our national interests. Funding has been committed to maintain critical defence equipment, support Australia's objectives in the war against terrorism, enhance our domestic security capability and boost personnel numbers. In this budget the government has increased spending on defence by $2.1 billion over the five years from the current financial year to enhance the protection afforded to Australia and its interests at home and abroad.</para><para>This increase includes many new elements, including an extra $156 million over four years to establish a new Special Operations Command that will enhance Australia's ability to respond to terrorist threats and boost Special Forces personnel by about 330. This budget will meet the increased needs of the Australian Defence Force in relation to their new strategic challenges and increased operational tempo. It reflects the government's determination to do its job of ensuring the safety of our troops by making sure they are capable and well-equipped to respond to new global security threats.</para><para>I turn to national security. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, safeguarding our community from terrorist threats is a top priority for the government. That is why we are allocating significant new funding to domestic security initiatives to protect critical infrastructure and enhance our intelligence and protective security services.</para><para>Following the terrorist attacks of September 11 and the Bali bombings, the government provided additional funding of $1.4 billion over five years to upgrade security within Australia. This included enhancements to Australia's aviation security arrangements as well as new funding for defence, intelligence and law enforcement agencies. The budget builds on this commitment by implementing the government's Safer Australia package of $411 million over five years.</para><para>I would now like to move to an aspect of the budget that is particularly relevant to my electorate. In this budget the federal government has reaffirmed its total commitment of $445 million to the construction of the Scoresby Freeway—the most vital infrastructure project in Aston and the outer east of Melbourne. This commitment of $445 million consists of money already allocated plus $419.7 million over the next five years. It stands in stark contrast to the Victorian government which, only weeks ago in its most recent budget, again failed to provide any funding for the Scoresby Freeway.</para><para>I have been concerned for some time about the Victorian government's lack of commitment to the Scoresby Freeway, which has been shown by the ongoing delays I have highlighted in this House. My deepest fears have come to fruition with the Victorian government's appalling backflip over funding for the Scoresby Freeway and their decision to impose tolls on all vehicles. This was in spite of promising the people of Victoria at the last state election that they would not impose tolls. I join with the community in rejecting the imposition of tolls on the Scoresby. The Victorian government's attempt to divert funding from the Scoresby Freeway short-changes not just the local community but all the people who live in the outer eastern and south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne.</para><para>I understand the importance of the Scoresby Freeway project to the people of Aston. We need it built now. Residents have spoken to me about their dismay at the Victorian Labor government's decision. That is why I have been working as hard as I can to get that decision reversed. It is disappointing that the Scoresby Freeway did not even make an appearance in the recent Victorian state budget. As I said, this contrasts remarkably with the federal budget which, again, identified the full funding commitment of $445 million. We in the Scoresby Corridor have already endured a long journey on the road to the development of the Scoresby Freeway. Sadly, it appears that we still have some way to go—at least, that is if the Victorian government have their way.</para><para>Budgets are important. They are important not in themselves but because they enable the government to deliver practical measures as part of its agenda of national priorities. Late last year the Prime Minister outlined the government's key whole-of-government strategic priorities as we move forward in this term. In the area of national security and defence the budget demonstrates the government's commitment to confronting the threats of rising international terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. To support Australian families to better balance their work and home life, the budget takes pressure off the family budget by cutting income taxes for every Australian taxpayer. Embracing the challenges of our ageing population, the government is continuing to deliver quality assistance for older Australians by supporting increased health and ageing services, boosting Medicare and introducing tax cuts.</para><para>The government places a high value on science and innovation and, in this budget, continues its investment through measures such as increased funding for the CSIRO. This funding will support research, and advance new ideas and technology. The budget invests a record $15.8 billion in education, science and training as part of the government's efforts to provide Australia with a world-class education sector, which will help build strong economic and social future for Australia. The government's recognition of the importance of restoring, protecting and sustainably managing our unique environment and heritage is also demonstrated in the budget through initiatives such as the Envirofund and the Sustainable Cities package.</para><para>As part of the government's energy reforms the budget introduces new fuel excise arrangements that will promote long-term sustainability. Additional incentives will encourage the further production and use of cleaner fuels. With drought widespread, and in the aftermath of devastating bushfires, the government has strengthened its commitment to the growth and prosperity of Australia's rural and regional areas through measures like increased access to GP services. Finally, this budget provides additional funding to improve Australia's road system.</para><para>In short, this budget is part of the government's work in getting on with the job and delivering practical and responsible government in our national interest for the benefit of all Australians. Indeed, as the Treasurer said in his budget speech, this budget is a further step on the journey to securing Australia's future. That future has looked much better since the coalition came to government in 1996.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Platforms can be valued at cost. That put a value on platforms at $31.5 billion and showed a net worth under AAS31 of minus $49-odd billion in 2002-03. The government, in addition to doing net worth on a AAS31 basis, also does it on a GFS basis. On a GFS basis, the valuation of Telstra would be at market value, with Defence platforms valued at zero. That produces an estimate of net worth in 2002-03 of minus $47-odd billion. Both of these are huge estimations. For example, valuing the whole of Australia's Defence platforms at zero—that is, the Collins class submarines, frigates, F111s and Hornets at zero—is obviously very wide of their actual value. Indeed, much of the Commonwealth land-holding is not valued at true market rent. We do not attempt to value Defence lands, such as North Head or South Head, at full market value or, indeed, the buildings around Parliament House.</para></talk.start></continue><para>These are very, very general estimations and they vary according to the particular values that one puts on them. Senator Minchin has this afternoon released a different valuation, a 90-day valuation in relation to GFS standard this afternoon, which does it on an additional basis. So it can be done on every single basis you like—AAS31, GFS, GFS on 90-day market average—but these are still estimations. The important point is that this does not affect the budget, it does not affect the cash position, it does not affect the fiscal position and it does not affect the operating position. This is a statement in relation to net worth, which the Commonwealth has been putting in budget papers only since 1999-2000. These are very general estimates. The government will be reporting on all of the different bases so that they are there for the historic record, but it makes no difference whatsoever to the underlying budget position as reported in the budget on last Tuesday night fortnight.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Security: Terrorism</title><page.no>15460</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>15460</page.no><name role="metadata">Thompson, Cameron, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CAMERON THOMPSON</name><name.id>84C</name.id><electorate>Blair</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

It is clear that Australia has been an al-Qaeda target since at least November 2001. We know this because on 3 November 2001 Osama bin Laden first made specific reference to Australia when he criticised Australian troops in East Timor, who were there under UN auspices, as a `crusader force'. Bin Laden specifically mentioned Australia on two subsequent occasions, most recently following the Bali attacks. A recent statement on 21 May by bin Laden's spiritual mentor and deputy al-Zawahira confirmed that Australia remains a terrorist target. I can now inform the House that new information has come to light very recently indicating that al-Qaeda explored possible targets in Australia in 2000 or 2001. These reports indicate that al-Qaeda's interest in mounting attacks in Australia actually predated the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York and Washington.</para></talk.start><para>Al-Qaeda's targeting of Australia does not derive from our military involvement in Afghanistan or Iraq. Rather, al-Qaeda's interest in attacking Australia derives from the fact that we are a Western nation with Western values that are abhorrent to the militant theology which is at the heart of al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda has a transparent self-interest in trying to attract support for its terrorist cause by seeking to present its inhumane attacks as a response to specific events such as East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq. This new information of course relates to past planning and past events.</para><para>I want to reassure the House that it has not resulted in a change to current threat levels either in Australia or for Australian interests abroad. No specific or other intelligence has been received indicating any current plan for an attack in Australia by al-Qaeda or any other group that might warrant a change in the assessed terrorist threat level within our country. The government remains committed to doing everything possible to protect the safety of Australians from terrorism. If any information were to come to light which caused the government to change the assessed terrorism threat to Australia, the public would be advised without delay.</para><para>Finally, I inform the House that at my request the Leader of the Opposition was specifically briefed on this new information on 26 May by the Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Budget: Telstra</title><page.no>15461</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>15461</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Fraser</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Treasurer.

It is an attempt to try and get to the net worth of the Commonwealth, which the Commonwealth has variously estimated under different measures. It could be negative $46 billion or negative $50 billion, depending on the kind of price that you want to put on defence platforms.

I can inform the House that total new capital expenditure in the March quarter, whilst showing a 5.3 per cent decline, showed that over the course of the year capital expenditure had risen by 18.2 per cent. The reason for the decline in the March quarter is that it was coming off an artificially high December quarter, which had increased by 13.7 per cent, led particularly by the importation by Qantas of civil aircraft of around $1.7 billion. You had an abnormally high build-up in the December quarter and you had a correction in March; but once you take those lumpy figures out, over the course of the year capital expenditure rose by 18.2 per cent.</para></talk.start><para>In addition to that, we have released today the sixth estimate for capital spending in 2002-03, which was 16.7 per cent stronger than the equivalent estimate for 2001-02. Again, the intention for the whole of this year is a very large rise on the outcome for the previous year. This shows that there is very strong capital expenditure going on in the Australian economy. In part, this is reflected in today's trade figures, which show that imports were up, being much higher in April than previous months, whilst exports were down—and no doubt the trade minister will have something to say about that in a moment. But statistics on the international trade in goods and services for the month of April, which we have already released today, tell a story of a strong domestic Australian economy, notwithstanding a very weak international economy. In addition, of course, drought affects some of Australia's exports, particularly in the rural areas. </para><para>Coming back to capital expenditure: as I was saying yesterday, confirming the `construction work done' figures, capital expenditure has been very strong in the course of this year, both in construction and in equipment. This is continuing to drive a strong underlying Australian economy. It is supported by low interest rates. In addition, it is supported by the fact that the government has taken taxes off inputs. As I said yesterday, in the residential sector it is supported by a strong First Home Owners Scheme, which has given young Australians a chance to get a home. I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question, and I can inform him that today's figures confirm strong underlying capital expenditure going on in the Australian economy.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Deficit</title><page.no>15462</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>15462</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Trade.

If the Australian Labor Party had its way, we would not have achieved those targets, because we would not have been able to reform the economy and make it efficient and competitive in the way we have done.</para></talk.start><para>Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the trade figures for April. Those trade figures are, as the Treasurer has indicated, the result of a very strong domestic economy and a very weak global economy. Although the increase in imports reflects the strength of the Australian economy—and I do not think that is disputed at all—our exports have been hit by a triple whammy of SARS, the drought and a sluggish world economy. There is no question about that.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SU5</name.id><name role="display">Mr VAILE</name></talker><para>—We can add the Labor Party and make it a quadruple whammy. These factors have combined to deliver a trade deficit of $3.1 billion. Nobody is saying it is good news, but there are good reasons for it. We need to be realistic about these reasons. I have outlined the impacts on exports. We are just starting to realise the dramatic impact that SARS has had on exports throughout the region and on the tourism industry and visitation to Australia. Seasonally adjusted, short-term visitation arrivals for April are the lowest for five years. Remember that tourism is our largest export earner. Some merchandise exports into the East-Asian region have also declined as a result of SARS and lowering economic activity in the region. Of course, the Labor Party will not recognise the impact of the drought. The drought is still with us in Australia. It has rained in some parts of Australia, but the drought is still affecting our export effort as far as the rural economy is concerned. The sluggish global economy is having a dramatic impact on our markets. The continuing poor performance of our major trading partners has contributed to a fall in our exports of non-rural and other goods. Australia is not alone in facing a difficult export environment. Exports from other regional economies—for example, New Zealand, Singapore and Thailand—have also been negatively affected.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Despite the tough times that we are facing, Australia's robust economic fundamentals mean that we are well placed to meet these challenges. We have to be prepared to meet these challenges. I have been saying for the last couple of months that the international exporting environment this year will be competitive and tough, and we need to meet those challenges. We are able to do that because we have a budget that is in surplus, and we have an economy that has delivered low unemployment, low interest rates, low inflation and low public sector debt. That means our economy is performing strongly, and that is reflected in these statistics today. While our strong economy obviously impacts on our trade performance, the government are not about to pursue the types of policies that we have seen from previous Labor governments in similar circumstances, policies which killed off both import and export growth and led to unemployment of over 10 per cent and the highest interest rates that this country has ever suffered.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Kelvin Thomson</name></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

Would the minister update the House on recent revelations regarding gross human rights abuse by Saddam Hussein's regime, including recent discoveries of mass grave sites?</para></talk.start><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name></talker><para>—I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. As the House knows, the casus belli for action in Iraq remains as it has always been, and that is the need to eliminate the threat of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. The release overnight of a CIA-DIA report on the discovery of mobile biological weapons laboratories illustrates that headway is being made in uncovering the full story about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction capability. As that report notes, the findings are the strongest evidence to date that Iraq was hiding a biological warfare program.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is also true that the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime has brought to an end one of the cruellest chapters in modern history. The true scale of the regime's horrors is only now being revealed by a people free from intimidation and fear. When I was in Iraq, this was patently obvious. Most chilling are the numerous mass grave sites that have been unearthed by coalition forces with the help of information provided by the local Iraqi population.</para><para>Recently, two significant mass graves, reported to contain up to 15,000 bodies, were discovered near a military base. These sites and others like them at Kirkuk, Muhammad Sakran, Basra and Abu al-Khassib contain remains buried en masse rather than in individual plots, signifying the deaths were the result of mass atrocities. The thousands of bodies uncovered in these sites are just a fraction of what Human Rights Watch estimates are 290,000 Iraqis who have disappeared during the reign of Saddam Hussein. Human Rights Watch was able to locate one survivor of a mass execution and burial, and his account provided important evidence about the manner in which mass execution campaigns and burials were conducted. In 1991, a 12-year-old boy and several family members were accused by soldiers of being looters and detained with many other Iraqis. After a few days, these detained Iraqis, including the small boy, were taken by a bus to a location and thrown in a pre-dug pit, machine-gunned and then buried with a bulldozer. The young boy's mother and other relatives were executed and buried, but the boy miraculously survived to tell his tale.</para><para>The coalition is doing what it can to ensure that the remains are treated with respect and with dignity, although clearly the sheer scale of what is being discovered makes it difficult to secure all of these sites. Obviously this is a highly emotional issue for those Iraqis who are only now discovering the final fate of their missing relatives. The gruesome discovery of mass grave sites and heartbreaking accounts of personal tragedy and survival are a stark reminder that the lives of the Iraqi people will be vastly better without Saddam Hussein. I think it is fair to say that we are proud of the role we have played in securing the freedom of the long-suffering Iraqi people.</para></question></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Visa Approvals</title><page.no>15465</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>15465</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.

I am referring to the cases of spouses of Australians, particularly where they have children. One of the reasons why we have so many interventions today in that particular area is the provisions in the act that put in place a bar to further applications. They have been seen as appropriate provisions to remain in the system to discourage people from coming to Australia in expectation that they will have a hunting licence to go out and find a spouse, enter into a relationship and expect to be accommodated onshore. That is the reason for the bar, which was put in by a former government.

The Commonwealth has moved to provide significant and comprehensive financial support for farmers during these difficult times. We have moved where states have failed to act. We are providing a range of assistance measures, many of which have never been offered in a drought situation before. We are also processing applications much faster than ever before. Indeed, as soon as a prima facie case has been established, farmers are eligible to receive interim assistance while their case is under consideration. We are taking about one-third as long as occurred in the past to consider the detailed applications. This has already meant that significant assistance is flowing to Australian farm communities.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the applications already before and agreed to by the federal government, we have committed expenditure of around $950 million over three years. Indeed, no federal government in any drought in our history has made a contribution anything like that amount. We have recognised the severity of the situation and, whilst those numbers sound big when they are all added together—and they are indeed a very significant contribution from the Commonwealth—we know that each application is dealing with a personal tragedy and that a personal situation of great difficulty is confronting an Australian farm family. We have been prepared to stand by them and to offer as much assistance as we possibly can.</para><para>In addition, there has been substantial revenue forgone under the Farm Management Deposits scheme. Since 1997, we have provided around $800 million under the AAA Farm Innovation Program—which provides support for farm training—for the Farm Family Restart Scheme and for rural financial counsellors, who have been especially in demand over recent times. If you compare that commitment with what has been offered by the states during this arguably worst drought in our nation's history, the comparisons are light and dark. Compared with our almost $1 billion already committed to relief assistance in this drought, the states between them have managed something less than $60 million. It is really a pathetic effort.</para><para>In states like Victoria and Western Australia, the assistance is actually cut off as soon as Commonwealth assistance is available under the exceptional circumstances program. Around 50 EC applications have either been lodged or are projected, and some of those applications are being lodged by states that have made absolutely no financial assistance available to farmers in the region. They demand Commonwealth help while they are prepared to do nothing themselves. Many of these applications have covered huge areas, areas that have meant that it has been very difficult for the independent arbiter, the National Rural Advisory Council, to make a decision about whether or not the area qualifies. They cover such a range of industry areas and geographical circumstances that some areas may qualify and others may not.</para><para>When an application is declined because the state case has not been strong enough, we have state ministers actually going out and criticising the Commonwealth government because their application has failed. They would be far better off putting their time and energy into providing meaningful practical assistance at the local level and developing applications that are likely to meet the criteria—criteria which they signed off on four or five years ago and which they were party to the development of. It is important that there is cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states in developing the applications and in then considering the appropriate method of assistance to be provided in cases where there is severe drought.</para><para>I want to emphasis that, unfortunately, because of the nature of the cases that have been presented or the circumstances in certain areas, some of the applications have not been successful. But in every instance the Commonwealth and the National Rural Advisory Council has recommended that we review the case in the months ahead. So there will be a constant review of the circumstances of people in areas where applications have not been accepted, and as soon as it is clear that an area meets the criteria we will be willing to reconsider and to make that kind of declaration. The states have a role in providing up-to-date information to ensure that those matters can be considered promptly. Instead of criticism and empty words from the states, we certainly need a bit of performance—a bit of caring about the needs of farmers and a desire to actually ensure that benefits flow as quickly as possible.</para><para>Finally, the Commonwealth is aware of the fact that the current EC arrangements leave a lot to be desired. We have been trying to reform them now for more than two years and getting no cooperation from any of the states. What is important is that there is a spirit of cooperation and a willingness to try to provide benefits in the most effective way. States have never done less in a drought—never talked more, but never done less—but we have not been prepared to have farmers suffer just because they have uncaring state governments. We have been prepared to move in and provide realistic assistance, and we will do that until the drought is over.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Visa Approvals</title><page.no>15471</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>15471</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.

I also take this opportunity to thank him for representing me recently when launching the excellent book on Australian grasses which has been produced by the Australian biological resources survey. Australia is very vulnerable to climate change. This is why the government shares international concern about climate change and the challenge that it poses to our natural environment and to our economy. This government established the first greenhouse specific agency in the world, the Australian Greenhouse Office, and, through a mixture of mandatory and voluntary incentives and grants, has encouraged action which has meant that Australia has been a leader in greenhouse gas abatement. In fact, the measures that the government has taken so far are estimated to deliver some 60 million tonnes per annum of CO2 equivalent abatement each year until 2010. That is equivalent to taking all Australia's passenger cars off the roads. Through the impact of new technology and improved standards, Australia is now successfully decoupling its economic growth from greenhouse emissions growth. Emissions per dollar of GDP were 24 per cent lower in 2000 than they were in 1990.</para></talk.start><para>Today I announced that applications are now being sought for round 3 of the $400 million Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program. As a result of the first two application rounds, 15 projects have already been offered a total of almost $145 million to abate more than 27 million tonnes of greenhouse gas from 2008 to 2012. Examples of these projects include funding of up to $26 million for combined heat and power cogeneration facilities to abate 3.25 million tonnes of greenhouse gases and funding of more than $40 million for several projects in New South Wales and Queensland to capture and use waste coalmine gas to abate over seven million tonnes of greenhouse gases. This government is committed to meeting the target that we negotiated at Kyoto of 108 per cent of 1990 levels. We are also developing a climate change forward agenda to cover the next 20 to 30 years that will lead a strong contribution to global climate control without sacrificing the competitive advantages that we have as a resource-rich nation.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Visa Approvals</title><page.no>15473</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>15473</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.

So the person who was so persuasive, so telling, who turned the minister around—who was far more influential, allegedly, than the member for Parramatta—is out there today putting out facts about the case which indicate he knows nothing whatsoever about the case. He said that the person was a member of the SLA when he was not. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The minister yesterday came in here and said that he and another minister had no recollection at this fundraising function that any money changed hands. They just, for fun, went to Parramatta, sat around talking about the weather and basically went home. Overnight the member for Parramatta has clarified to the minister that $22,000 was actually collected. We have Mr Kisrwani today out there in the media confirming that $22,000 was collected for the member for Parramatta and of course trying to put forward an argument that the person who was assisted could not in a million years have provided any money because he allegedly had five children and was poverty stricken.</para><para>The fact is that the person concerned has three children, is a very effective, fully employed cement renderer who owns his own house and drives around in a Range Rover. There we have the confederates of the minister attempting to besmirch the credibility of those raising this case. The reality is that large numbers of people are rejected every day of the week on the same grounds that this person now remains in Australia. The essential grounds are that there are Syrian forces in Lebanon and many Maronites, Melkites and Orthodox believers allege they are harassed and victimised. These are the grounds that the minister's department rejects every day of the week.</para><para>If you look at RRT cases, they are very unfavourable to this type of case. The person that the minister has allowed into Australia was found by the Federal Court to be extremely unconvincing—a very poor witness. The minister comes in here today and says, `Despite my rejection to the member for Parramatta, despite the RRT, despite the Federal Court and despite internal processing by DIMIA, I'm letting him stay in Australia because he has three sisters.' Let's get real. If that were the basis for ministerial discretion and intervention, there would be about 4,000 a year coming under the criteria. That is the reality. Basically, we do not let people in under normal family reunion provisions just because they have three sisters here. This person, who has been found to have no substantial refugee or humanitarian claim whatsoever, is allowed to remain permanently because the minister allegedly found out for the first time that he had three sisters here.</para><para>It was interesting that, in yesterday's coverage of the issue, the minister recounted every single part of this person's life story; every single detail was there. But there was no mention of the sisters yesterday—the three sisters did not get a run yesterday. Here is this case that so impacted upon him, and the letter from the bishop that so turned him around, that he could not even remember the reasons yesterday. One has to doubt how substantial that factor really was. What has happened here is that a few `community leaders'—in other words, Mr Karim Kisrwani, a very close long-term associate of the minister—obviously rang the minister up after this function and said, `Philip, I want this let through to the keeper.'</para><para>That is the community representation that occurred here. The donation made at the function by Mr Kisrwani, on behalf of Mr Hbeiche, is a fact of life. The ministers opposite want us to believe, as of yesterday, that they went to this fundraising function and did not see any money being raised—they just walked around, there was no money received and nothing happened. Let's get real. As I indicated, I was attempting earlier to get the minister to guarantee that no money had changed hands. Quite frankly, we had procedural points and other efforts made so that the minister did not have to stand by his statement yesterday when he said he did not know about money.</para><para>The use of ministerial discretion is a very serious matter. At various stages, some ministers have actually abolished it because they thought it was open to distortion, to political influence peddling and to the pleasing of ethnic communities—they thought there was a possibility of corruption there. There are ministers in the past who abolished this because they were concerned about the way it was utilised and the way it may be perceived. The minister said that he has allowed over 1,000 people into this country on the basis of a ministerial discretion that is untested and not transparent to the Australian public.</para><para>No-one knows why these cases are decided. There is often a good reason—for instance, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's papers that it put to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs may be somewhat hostile, or favourable, to a particular regime overseas and the minister may, correctly, come in and say, `I think the DFAT position is too hardline,' or that it is too soft in another case. There are other cases where there are very compelling family reasons why people should remain in Australia. Obviously, if people have a young child who is an Australian citizen, that can be a very real factor. We are not saying that a person should be deported when they do have very close family here. But to say that somebody with such an atrocious case—recognised as such by the Federal Court as well as the RRT—should remain simply because he has three sisters is preposterous.</para><para>The minister would realise that he would reject similar cases week after week. This is not a novel, unusual proposal. This man would not have been the first claimant in this country who has been rejected, gone to ministerial discretion and been rejected and sent home—having three, four, five, six, seven or eight siblings. There is nothing unusual in this case. To say that all the processes in this department, all the integrity of our immigration system, all the Public Service effort and all the people we appoint to tribunals should all be thrown out because somebody has three sisters in the country is preposterous—and it is not the real reason this case was decided in this fashion by the minister. The reality is that a function was attended, donations were made and a person who was instrumental in those donations then went to the minister and asked him to do him a favour in this case. The Federal Court decision, FCA 70 (1998), absolutely demolishes the witness as a credible person in any way whatsoever. Justice O'Connor went very deeply into the integrity of the person. He referred to tribunal comments:</para><quote><para>The tribunal did not accept the claim, made for the first time at the tribunal hearing, that a cousin with a high-ranking position with the Department of State Security renewed the applicant's passport.</para></quote><para>Furthermore, with respect to the 1996 incident—the crucial reason for the refugee claim—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>MP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Baird</name></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

They are saying that this person is a totally disreputable witness. They are saying that he has no refugee humanitarian case whatsoever. They are saying that he should not be allowed to come into this country with the limited number of people—approximately 12,000 a year—that we take out of the 25 million refugees around the world. This person is so privileged. Twelve thousand people get in here a year, at most, out of 25 million people who are homeless, exiled from their countries and facing torture and persecution, and the minister comes in here and says, `I am letting this person be amongst that privileged 12,000 this year, because he has three sisters in the country.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is a government—such as we experienced last year with the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>—that demolishes people and besmirches their image.

As the minister knows, it is non-compellable. All that the Australian people know about these cases is how many are approved each year, how many were approved the previous year, what proportion were accepted and rejected et cetera. There are no details of the countries they stem from and there is no ability to test whether there is a pattern of influence peddling amongst particular ethnic communities. There is no possibility of the Australian electorate knowing that these people who are supposedly refugees are really entering the country because there might be this person in a particular electorate who is close to the party and might be able to deliver an electoral vote. There is no way the Australian electorate can examine that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have had a point-blank refusal by the minister today to table the reason for this grant. We had him at the last minute today, after some overnight consideration I gather, saying it was about these three sisters. There was no mention of that yesterday—nothing at all, yet he recounted every single facet of the bloke's life. The next thing we will know is whether he had 10 dinars in his pocket or not. That was the level of detail he recounted yesterday. Yesterday we heard about everything that had happened in the past and everything that the tribunal knew about. He tried to imply this was the new evidence and because the rest of Australia has not got the file they might believe that what he said yesterday was the end of the matter—all these pressing arguments. These, in fact, are the pressing arguments that were rejected by the system. He did not come up with any new reasons yesterday and that is why, quite rightly, the opposition has had to press him again today to try to find out the specifics of this decision.</para><para>The situation is that this particular community is very close to the minister and he has a very strong following in it. I dare say that if one were to analyse decision making under this ministerial discretion one would find a pattern. Not only do I want the minister to come forward and detail the whole file to see whether there is really anything more convincing than three sisters; I want him to stand by yesterday's statement that no donations were made to the Liberal Party at that function; that no donations were made on behalf of Mr Hbeiche. It was not a very crowded function, so I do not think the activity got lost in the mist. Romeo's, as the minister for workplace relations would know from his visit there that night, is not an expansive operation where thousands of people are present. I do not think that the minister missed that detail. He confirmed with his colleague that they were not aware of any money being raised that night.

This is processing that this minister trenchantly supports. This minister is so strong on repeat applications for discretion that his office says, `From now on if a person is coming to us for a second consideration by the minister, we can still seek to deport that person while the minister is considering it.' He is so strong in guarding against abuse of second, third and fourth repeat applications for his discretion that he is actually saying that in the future, because people were exploiting it before to remain in Australia for lengthy times, `I'm going to have them deported, possibly in the time when they are being considered.' In his 1999 guidelines he says that a public servant will look at the less relevant, unimpressive, totally fraudulent cases and not even bring them to his attention. He says, `Just send off a letter to the member for Parramatta or whoever it is saying that I don't even need to see that.' That is how bad the case was; the public servant did not even show it to him, apparently. The minister, because the system was being abused, is saying, `I don't want to see second and third approaches to me. I want to use the discretion once and once only, essentially, because it is being abused.' Yet here today we have a situation where an approach was made and somebody was allowed into the country.</para><para>People over there on that side of the House do not think this is serious. I think that the abuse of the immigration system through the refugee humanitarian sector is a very serious matter. It is a thing that many members deal with daily. If people start to believe that all you have to do is know the right person, in the right community, in the right party, at the right functions then, quite frankly, it is a very sad day in immigration processing in this country. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83L</name.id><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Gillard</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>15480</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Let me deal with these issues in a comprehensive way. It is the case that people can have different views about the way in which a particular matter might be addressed. The discretion that I have is one that I treat with very considerable care. The parliament has recognised that occasions could arise where it would be in the public interest to grant a visa even though a person did not meet normal criteria for a grant. It is for this reason that the legislation gives me the personal power to substitute, where I consider it to be in the public interest, for a decision of the RRT or the MRT a decision more favourable to the applicant. Individuals do make requests to me. Many members of parliament make requests to me. As I said earlier, I am free to exercise that power where I consider it to be in the public interest, irrespective of whether a person has in fact made a request. It is also the case that I can decline to intervene.</para></talk.start><para>The fact that I decline to intervene is not a decision to reject, and there is no restriction on people coming back and seeking to raise matters with me. As I indicated, some 80 decisions have been made which were on second requests. I indicated that five of them were in response to requests made by the honourable member for Reid. That is the point I made. One request was made by the Leader of the Opposition. The point I do make in relation to these matters is that I exercise that responsibility with a great deal of care, but I am not going to suggest that a decision that I take would be replicated in every case in exactly the same way by somebody else bringing their own mind to bear.</para><para>In relation to this matter, I did spell out yesterday in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>at the end of the day the basis upon which I made this decision. I am surprised that the member for Reid is suggesting that what I said today is substantially different in any way to what I said yesterday. I will quote fully to the honourable member, and it will become clear to all members when they hear it. In this particular case I put the same information yesterday that I put today. On page 14,804, I had this to say:</para><quote><para>The point I make is that the RRT accepted that the applicant had been detained and mistreated by the Syrians. In addition, the man had substantial Australian connections. In other words, he had a number of relatives who were permanent residents and citizens of Australia.

The fact is that I did not say that the relatives were three sisters but I made it clear that he had a number of relatives who were permanent residents and citizens of Australia. That was a different factor that was not known to me before and which was coupled with the concern I had about the finding of the tribunal. I repeated that, in respect of the 1993 incident, the tribunal accepted that the applicant had been detained by the Syrians and mistreated in Tripoli. Those matters were the subject of an adverse finding because they did not constitute a conventional reason. There were other matters raised about that matter, on which the tribunal did not make positive findings. That in no way derogates from the fact that—unlike most cases I see, where the tribunal says, `I do not believe the individual. He has no credibility and I do not accept any of the claims that he has made'—there was a very specific finding in respect of the 1993 incident, which the tribunal accepted. It was on that basis that I elected in this particular case to intervene.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There were only three other points of substance raised by the member for Reid which I see fit to deal with. The first is in relation to Bishop Darwish's comments in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>. What I know is that the newspapers yesterday had the member for Reid issuing a press release which contained a background information sheet on ministerial discretion under section 417. Besides the fact that the member evidences some abysmal knowledge about what actually happened, what he was putting into the minds of the journalists was that in some way decisions taken by me under 417 were related to the South Lebanese Army. In fact, at paragraph 3 he says that there was public concern when the minister used 417 to allow into Australia 200 Lebanese people who were either associated with or members of the Israeli backed South Lebanese Army, and that some of those members had tortured and murdered Palestinians and so on.</para><para>Let me say that section 417 was never used for that purpose; they were allowed in under the Special Humanitarian Program. They had to meet character assessments; and it meant that, amongst a large number of people who applied, a very significant proportion were unable to access those visas under the Special Humanitarian Program.</para><para>I would not be surprised if Bishop Darwish were rung up by a journalist and asked, `Was this man in some way linked with forces in Lebanon?' Then the journalist would verbal him and say, `That's the South Lebanese Army.' That would not surprise me. I certainly know the difference between the South Lebanese Army and the Lebanese Forces, who were a Christian militia in Lebanon. The fact is that they are quite different; they fought in very different theatres and they are quite distinctive. I suspect that it was more likely to have been a journalist not dealing with those issues fully, particularly when the argument had been advanced by the member for Reid, who was hawking this around the press gallery yesterday, that this issue in some way had some relationship to the South Lebanese Army.</para><para>Let me deal with the other imputation that the member raised about the nature of my decision making. I did actually have the department take out advice for me on my recent decision making about intervention requests under sections 345, 351 and 417 from July 2000 until December 2002. The largest number of interventions, 123, were on behalf of Fijians. Lebanese were next at 105; Indonesians at 72; Sri Lankans at 65; and Filipinos at 65. What you have to look at in relation to that decision making—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Minister!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>—is that the decisions I take are based upon a case by case determination. The numbers will obviously vary from time to time, and you do have areas where interventions are more likely because of the extent to which people have entered Australia from particular cohorts, have overstayed those visas and, over a period of time, have entered into relationships, which are likely to prompt an intervention request.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Finally, I do not know whether the Labor Party has a fundraising code, but our party does. The fact is that, under that fundraising code, members of parliament are at arm's length from the process. I remain at arm's length from that process—I always have. I do not make inquiries in relation to donations; I do not make inquiries in relation to outcomes. Occasionally, I might see people paying to go into a function. I might see a raffle—that can happen. But let me say what I said yesterday in relation to this matter, because I do not resile from it at all. I said:</para><quote><para>... I have no knowledge. I do not remember every case that has been raised with me, and I think it would be unreasonable to expect that I would, in view of the fact that you are asserting that it is probably more than 1,000. I will look at the background to it and assess what the situation was. Finally, let me say that I attend many functions which people pay to enter and where people are involved in fundraising activities. I have no knowledge of the nature of those fundraising activities, I never seek to inquire, and I certainly have no knowledge of the sorts of claims that are being made by the honourable member.</para></quote><para>That situation remains, and it was the answer I gave yesterday.

They denigrated and vilified genuine refugees to manipulate public opinion, and now we learn—after that election, after the `children overboard' affair, after SIEVX—that they have turned the integrity of our immigration system into their own political and financial plaything.

An interested Liberal member of parliament, presumably held in some esteem because he is a parliamentary secretary, writes twice and it gets knocked back both times.

The only answer that has been given to that relates to protecting the privacy of this protection visa applicant. We already have in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the person's name and the DIMIA file number. What more is there to protect? Minister Ruddock, if you want to give us that file, with the name scrubbed out wherever it appears, we will take it and look for when the bishop first contacted you.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us assume that the version the minister has put is the correct version. Since when did a bishop matter? As the shadow minister for immigration, my office is littered with correspondence from bishops, priests, nuns and rabbis, none of which has made a difference in section 417 matters. I asked the staff to grab the first three, and they have come back with these. I will see your bishop and raise you an archbishop! We have an archbishop in Adelaide who has personally intervened on behalf of an Iranian detainee—I think he is in the Baxter detention centre, but he is certainly detained. The request involved using section 417 of the act, but Minister Ruddock did not say: `Oh dear me, an archbishop. I'd better just put the tick here, because that is what I always do when I see a bishop making an application.' Instead, he wrote back and said: `Your request for the exercise of my power was referred to me. However, I have decided not to consider exercising my power under section 417 of the act.' Somehow a bishop was the difference in the minister's case, but an archbishop does not make any difference in this case.</para><para>Then, as honourable members on this side know, there are the East Timorese. There are more bishops involved in the East Timorese matter than there are on a chessboard. It is completely absurd to say that, if you responded to the interventions of church figures, you would not have already made a positive indication in relation to the East Timorese. Every Catholic bishop in Australia—and I note that Minister Abbott is nodding his head; he probably knows a bit about the Catholic Church—has made representations on behalf of the East Timorese. I can guarantee, through this debate, that there will be visas for 1,650 East Timorese, because you would look fools if you did not do that now!</para><para>On the issue of intervention by church figures, the stance of the Coalition for the Protection of Asylum Seekers is for no deportations. Bishop George Browning; the spokesperson for the Federation of Islamic Councils; a nun, Sister Aileen Crowe; another Uniting Church figure, Frances Milne; Sister Janet Mead, an advocate for asylum seekers; and a rabbi have made interventions but none of them has had positive results. Since when has the intervention of a bishop made a difference? I reckon that, if we could get some public transparency on your non-reviewable, non-compellable discretion, we would find that a church figure intervenes in most of them and that it is not the difference between your saying yes or no. I will go through all the correspondence in my office that relates to these church figures. I will write back to them with the suggestion that next time, instead of sending a letter, they ought to go to a Liberal Party fundraiser because it gets better results. Presumably we would get a discount for the East Timorese in bulk. If we get together $200,000 or $300,000 we should be right, because that, and not the intervention of the bishop, was the difference in this case.</para><para>The other thing that the minister says makes a difference is having Australian family. He then contended that somehow this only came to his attention on the third 417 matter—not the first one, not the second one but the third one. If that version is right, the member for Parramatta is the most incompetent member that the House of Representatives has ever seen. Who would put together a letter and go to the minister for immigration—so interested that he went twice—without having interviewed the people involved and marshalled every fact in their favour, including Australian family? Minister, members on this side represent very multicultural electorates, and many of them do write to you and seek to see you about these sorts of matters. When they do, they make sure that they have every fact. If the member for Parramatta is that incompetent, you can prove it today by tabling the file. If what you are saying is that—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Member for Lalor!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83L</name.id><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name></talker><para>—the member for Parramatta could not be bothered putting in the details of people's family circumstances, and DIMIA, the RRT, the Federal Court and the lawyers acting for this bloke never worked it out and used it as a fact—which would be truly extraordinary—then prove it by the production of the file. The fact that you have not put the file before this parliament can only lead us inexorably to the conclusion that the file does not support the case that the bishop was the difference—a contention that we know from other files is clearly absurd—that it does not support the case that you only came to know about the family when you looked at this matter for the third time, and that it must support the case that you knew about these things earlier.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me make an additional point on the issue of competency. There is an old saying in Australia: the money or the box. I think this motion should be the money or the incompetence, because if the minister is truly saying it took until the third 417 for him to become apprised of the basic facts of this matter, then he is saying to the Australian community that he weighs in his hands matters that could go to life and death—because that is what can happen if people are returned in bad circumstances overseas—without having taken the opportunity to inform himself of the simplest facts that relate to them.</para><para>If that is really the case—the money or the incompetence—I am still barracking for the money. But the only alternative case is gross incompetence—incompetence by the member for Parramatta and by you—because why would you be dealing with a matter as serious as whether a person who has claimed persecution can stay in this country without having got every fact before you and having weighed it? You stand condemned either way, and this censure should be carried.</para><para>As I say, I am still barracking for the money. Why am I still barracking for the money? Because we know there was a fundraiser; that has not been denied. We know Minister Ruddock was at the fundraiser; that has not been denied. He has clearly conferred with a ministerial colleague about the fundraiser—we suspect that to be Minister Abbott—so Minister Abbott was there. We understand that there were other members of parliament, or at least one other member of parliament, there. We know $22,000 was raised. Mr Speaker, I presume you are above fundraising because of the high office you hold, but those of us who engage in fundraising know that $22,000 is not a bad haul on a night for a fundraiser at a Lebanese restaurant called Romeo's. I will have a quiz night in my electorate tomorrow night and, let me tell you, I will be lucky to walk away with $2,200, not $22,000. That is the way that political party fundraising goes when you have got a dinner here, a plate of dips there and a raffle to follow. We all know that is how it goes. </para><para>There was $22,000 raised at a night at Romeo's restaurant. That is not denied. At no point has the minister actually come in here and said, `I guarantee that no money was donated to the Liberal Party on behalf of this protection visa applicant.

After all, we have got this censure motion because the government actually thought it was all a good idea at the time. If it was all a good idea at the time, I know what I would have wanted if I were minister for immigration. I would have wanted a file that I could table that completely exculpated me from every allegation made, and I would have wanted to walk in here and say, `I guarantee 100 per cent that no money was donated to the Liberal Party on behalf of this visa applicant.'

On that basis, yesterday we raised matters properly going to the integrity of the visa allocation system and queuejumping. They were related to a Liberal Party fundraiser. The minister involved and the member involved, whose fundraiser it was, have had overnight to confer.

Amongst many other things, the code of conduct says that members of parliament should not solicit donations and should not handle donations. It is a very good code of conduct, and I commend it to members opposite. I suggest to members opposite that they should not think that ministers in this government and coalition members of parliament act by the same sorts of standards which are obviously only too common in the Labor Party—a party which regularly asks people to spend $1,500 or more to come to dinners so that they might get to know `ministers'. This is an absurd suggestion that members opposite are trying to make.</para><para>Let us again review what the member for Reid has been saying. He has been saying that the gentleman in question, the visa applicant, was at the fundraiser in question. He has presented no evidence whatsoever. He has said that a donation was made by this gentleman or by someone else on behalf of this gentleman. No evidence has been presented. Is there a stat dec anywhere from anyone? Is there a report anywhere about this? There is no evidence whatsoever; it is just a disgusting, dirty, grubby fishing expedition by the member for Reid, who should know better. Finally, the member for Reid has alleged that a corrupt decision was made. Again, not one shred, not one skerrick, not one scrap of evidence has been produced to justify this grubby, dirty, unworthy, disgusting smear on a good minister.</para><para>Let us consider the censure motion that the member for Reid put before the House. He moved:</para><motion><para>That this House censures the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs for failing to adequately explain to the House the alleged new information that he relied upon to approve the visa application ...</para></motion><para>That is almost embarrassingly weak, Mr Speaker. He has no evidence that the gentleman in question was there, he has no evidence that the friend of the gentleman in question was there, he has no evidence that a donation was made, he has no evidence that conditions were placed on a donation—because no such donation would ever be accepted—and he has no evidence that a corrupt decision was made. So he is reduced to coming into this house and censuring the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs for failing to adequately explain himself. This is one of the worst and weakest censure motions that have been moved in this House for a very long time. The member for Reid has fallen into the trap that we laid for him, because we on this side knew that there was nothing whatsoever to justify the outrageous smears and imputations that the member for Reid, egged on by the Leader of the Opposition, was making.</para><para>What, in the end, is the crime of the minister for immigration? His first crime is that he listens to representations. Why shouldn't the minister for immigration listen to representations? He is a member of parliament, so why shouldn't he listen to other members of parliament? Let us face it: he gets representations. In this case, he got representations from, amongst other people, the member for Kingsford-Smith. Why shouldn't he have listened to those representations, and why shouldn't he have listened to the representations finally made by the bishop in question? The other crime of the minister for immigration is that he is close to a community. He is the minister for immigration; he is the minister for multicultural and ethnic affairs. Why shouldn't he be close to a community? In fact, it would be a tragedy if a minister of the Crown in this country were not able to get close to important communities.</para><para>Nothing whatsoever has been done wrong by this minister. More importantly, members opposite have demonstrated nothing whatsoever that this minister has done wrong. I will say to the House that there has, at times, been corruption in the administration of the immigration system, and a colleague of members opposite is now in jail because of that.

The position of members opposite appears to be that, just because some representations are refused, all representations are refused and that, if some representations are refused, any representation that is not refused is somehow corrupt.

It is clear that this is a grubby fishing expedition. It is clear that they have no evidence. In the end, all they could say was that the minister for immigration should have known about something before he finally did know about it. But it is not the minister for immigration's fault if people who are making representations on behalf of someone do not initially, or even subsequently, produce all the evidence that they might be able to to justify that case. When they finally did produce the evidence, the minister acted as he should. Then the member for Lalor suggested that, unless the minister for immigration was prepared to produce the file, that would prove that there was a confidential file dealing with people's lives and that somehow there would be proof of corruption. The suggestion that every decision should be justified to a feral opposition by the production of the complete file is absolutely, utterly and completely absurd.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is pretty clear that what we have seen over the last couple of days is a sad and unworthy exercise in mudslinging, designed to prop up the failing leadership of the Leader of the Opposition.

He tried the member for Lilley, but the member for Lilley, a man of some honour, had some standards that he would not transgress, so he said, `Okay, let's bring in the member for Werriwa; let's have a muscle-up strategy.' And that is exactly what we have seen. The words might be the member for Reid's; the words might be the Leader of the Opposition's, but the ideas and the grubby gutter tactics are nothing.

I for one have been following the future of the hydrogen economy in a global context for roughly two decades now. I have long felt that the hydrogen economy at a global level has a very significant future mainly for Western economies, in the first instance, but ultimately for the planet as a whole.</para></talk.start><para>Many members may be unfamiliar with the hydrogen economy, but the reality is that over the next three or four decades—and it will take that long—as we find the pressure increasingly placed not only on the environment but also on petroleum products and the availability at a reasonable price of those petroleum products, we will need to look to alternative fuel sources and alternative ways of using fuels. Of course, air pollution and greenhouse gases are an issue. Hydrogen is not only the No. 1 element on the periodic table and the lightest element but also a very significant store of energy. Hydrogen is perhaps one of the highest value stores of energy that we have available to us in the form of a fuel which we can readily transport around not only in gaseous form but also in liquid form. Hydrogen can also be burnt in internal combustion engines adapted for that purpose. It can also be burnt in an engine in the form of a fuel cell. The fuel cell can therefore generate electricity and power electric vehicles or other forms of stationary electric motors.</para><para>Hydrogen not only can be transported readily in a liquid or gaseous form but also, given enough further research, can be absorbed by solids in the form of hydrides and possibly other solid forms. When it is burnt in this context, either in an internal combustion engine or in a fuel cell, it gives off no other pollution than simply water vapour. It does not emit any carbon dioxide and it does not emit any other pollutants such as nitrous oxides or sulphur dioxides. Therefore, it is the ultimate fuel in that context.</para><para>The real difficult which was identified in the original discussions on the hydrogen economy and further identified at the recent conference—which, I might say, was particularly successful—is the issue of the economics of deriving hydrogen. We can readily obtain fuel from the LNG deposits which we have off our coast on the North West Shelf and at other locations and from the massive coal deposits which Australia and other countries have. Unfortunately, while we can effectively mine our fossil fuels, we cannot mine hydrogen. There are no available sources of hydrogen on the planet other than those we derive by converting fossil fuels into hydrogen—but of course then we have CO2 to deal with. Alternatively, we can obtain hydrogen by the electrolysis of water. That requires substantial amounts of energy, which can only be obtained from fossil fuels, nuclear fuels or solar or wind energy. Of course, the costs of those remain quite high, except in special cases, such as in Tasmania where competitively priced products are available.</para><para>Research is yet to be undertaken in those significant areas. This conference was about the future—the short-term future, the medium-term future and long-term future. I think we should see the hydrogen economy in all of those contexts. Hydrogen is a long-term future prospect and we should take it seriously.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Fuel: Hydrogen</title><page.no>15493</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>15493</page.no><name role="metadata">Haase, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAASE</name><name.id>84T</name.id><electorate>Kalgoorlie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It gives me a great deal of pleasure to rise this evening and, surprisingly, continue in a similar vein to my colleague the member for Bonython. The conference he referred to which took place in Broome last week, in my electorate of Kalgoorlie, was truly a historic step in what I believe will be a move by this government and future governments of Australia to adopt hydrogen as the basis of their economy rather than continue with an economy, as it stands today, based on fossil fuels.</para></talk.start><para>The process of converting water to hydrogen and oxygen simply requires electricity. That electricity can be produced by a number of means. One of the ways of producing electricity is to burn a fossil fuel. The result of that is the further contamination of the atmosphere with what we refer to today as greenhouse gases. Another way of producing electricity is to use tidal energy—and in the Kimberley the tides run to 11.8 metres—and to harness those tides in such a way that electricity is produced. That electricity can then be used to produce hydrogen by converting water to both hydrogen and oxygen.</para><para>The release of oxygen into the atmosphere further enhances the atmosphere of this planet, but the hydrogen produced can be dealt with thereafter in many, many ways. It can be liquefied and shipped by land or sea in a compressed state. It can be put into a pipeline under compression and reticulated around Australia. Perhaps members would be interested to know that there already exists in this country a reticulation of gas pipelines that, with minimal additions, could transport hydrogen that is produced in the Kimberley, in the north-west of Western Australia, to south-eastern Australia where the majority of industry is based and the majority of the population live. </para><para>Hydrogen, if it is produced with nonpolluting renewable energy, becomes truly the fuel of mobility for the future of this planet. It is truly nonpolluting at the point of manufacture and creation, and it is also nonpolluting at its end use in motor vehicles. If motor vehicles utilise hydrogen as an energy source and convert that hydrogen through fuel cells into electricity to drive motors within the vehicle to give mobility, that process creates no deleterious by-products at all. It produces only water. Just as you put electricity into water to produce oxygen and hydrogen, when you combine hydrogen and oxygen from the atmosphere you produce electricity and water. It is truly a breakthrough. </para><para>It is not then a question of if we can adopt hydrogen as a fuel of mobility for the future and in fact base our economy on hydrogen; it is simply a question of when. Jules Verne referred to hydrogen as an energy source for mobility all those decades ago in his futuristic writings. It is not surprising that we will move to a hydrogen economy and that we will take up the opportunity to use hydrogen as a fuel of mobility, because it is nonpolluting and we need to exist on a planet that does not have a polluted atmosphere. I am so proud to be associated with a government that took the initiative to hold a conference on hydrogen so that we can now take the first step towards an economy based on that fuel of mobility of the future. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: University of Ballarat</title><page.no>15494</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>15494</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In this adjournment debate I wish to add my voice to those of the Ballarat arts community and students and staff of the University of Ballarat in protesting the university council's decision to close the theatre production course. This course is one of only two theatre production degree courses in Victoria and the only one in regional Victoria. It is a course whose students enjoy a high employment rate on graduation. Well-trained production teams are the backbone of the performing arts. The students are not just part of the University of Ballarat; they are part of the arts community throughout the whole of Ballarat. They assist not only in University of Ballarat productions but also in the theatre productions staged by the many theatre companies that exist in Ballarat. They also participate in the staging of the Begonia Festival that we hold each year. </para></talk.start><para>The closure of the course is somewhat ironic, given that the Minister for Education, Science and Training only opened the brand-new campus at which the course was run in 2002. The minister at the time of the opening rightly pointed out the importance of all the arts to the Ballarat community. The Camp Street precinct on which the theatre production course is sited was created especially for the thriving performing and visual arts in my community. The university received generous funding from the state and federal governments and the local council, as well as donations from many local business communities, in order to build a high standard theatre production centre and theatre precinct for the community. </para><para>The major reason given for the course closure was lack of funding for perceived low enrolment figures on the course. Ironically, the number of students entering the course has been steadily rising. The new arts academy was to attract more students internationally, regionally and from around Australia. Is this simply the first of many courses to be rationalised as the incentives and numbers for fee paying students grow? The university, one would think, would take a proactive approach to the advertising and promotion of the course; perhaps this is one of the reasons that the course has had a decline in its numbers in recent times. </para><para>The university commissioned a confidential report—despite there having been a review of the arts faculty, there currently being no head of the arts faculty and the fact that that position was also currently being advertised. I think that the new head of the arts faculty would probably like to have had some input into any decisions regarding course closures. The report was, I understand, finalised in February—some 2½ months ago—and the decision to actually close the course took 2½ months. It was taken in camera. The university council announced that decision on 5 May. No input to this report was sought from the university's students or staff, the local community or the union. No consultation with staff, students, the local community or the union was undertaken in the period of time between the report being made available and the decision. </para><para>On Thursday, 8 May the university engaged the services of six security guards to assist the faculty and university management in `counselling' students and staff about the phasing out of the course. If this is an example of the type of industrial relations the minister for education thinks is appropriate and wishes to encourage through his new university package, frankly, he can stick it. Ballarat University has had to engage in overenrolments in order to survive the savage cuts of this government. The University of Melbourne may have the luxury of charging $150,000 for a degree under the minister's new higher education package, but the University of Ballarat will not have such a luxury. In order for it to be on a firm financial footing, it will not be able to charge the high fees that the minister seems to think are appropriate. </para><para>The university, in defending its decision, has stated that the course was underenrolled and that current students will be accommodated. It fails to understand that it is not just about current students; it is about future students and the role they play in participating in the arts community in Ballarat.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Fuel: Hydrogen</title><page.no>15495</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>15495</page.no><name role="metadata">Washer, Dr Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Dr WASHER</name><name.id>84F</name.id><electorate>Moore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Like my friends the member for Bonython and the member for Kalgoorlie, I also attended the Hydrogen Economy Conference. Hydrogen can be produced from plant material that is biomass, from fossil fuels and from water by electrolysis. Biomass and fossil fuel production of hydrogen produces carbon as a by-product which requires sequestration. Using renewable non-polluting energy to produce hydrogen from water economically would solve our problem of carbon production. Hydrogen can be used in liquid form in fuel combustion engines such as BMW's new hybrid motor engines, where both petrol and hydrogen can be used.</para></talk.start><para>As WA has fuel cell buses to be delivered next year—which are partly federally funded—I would like to focus on hydrogen fuel cells. The first fuel cell demonstration was by lawyer cum inventor William Grove in 1839. Water was electrolysed into hydrogen and oxygen with an electric current. He proved that when electrolysis was reversed, the hydrogen and oxygen recombined and produced an electric current—hence our ability to store and release electricity when required. This original fuel cell was based around an acid electrolyte with a cathode and anode. At the anode, the hydrogen gas ionises, releasing electrons and creating H+ ions, or protons. At the cathode, oxygen reacts with electrons taken from the anode and hydrogen ions from the acid electrolyte to form water, the residue of the process. The electrolyte must only allow the hydrogen ions, or protons, to pass through it and not the electrons, which are needed to travel through an external circuit to power an electric motor with a direct current of electron flow.</para><para>There are many different fuel cell types with different electrolytes. All result in an exothermic—heat releasing—reaction. The two main problems, leaving aside cost, is the slow reaction rate in the fuel cell leading to low currents and power and the fact that hydrogen is not readily and cheaply available. The proton exchange membrane, or PEM, fuel cell was used in the first manned spacecraft. The alkaline fuel cell was used on the Apollo and shuttle Orbiter crafts. A trial of three hydrogen powered fuel cell buses will be commissioned in Perth in 2004. The hydrogen gas will be supplied by BP and the buses are Daimler-Chrysler and powered by Ballard power systems. Murdoch University will carry out evaluation on the project. The 250 kilowatt fuel cell powered buses deliver approximately 200 kilowatt net of shaft power. They will have approximately 200 kilometres of range and up to 80 kilometres per hour speed. These are PEM fuel cells.</para><para>A spokesperson at the hydrogen energy conference gave an estimate that by continuing our reliance on coal, petroleum and natural gas, as much as $US7 trillion in damage per annum may be caused in environmental degradation as well as defence costs securing the supply of these fuels. This may help in understanding the need to continue the vital research in the area of the hydrogen economy. Already in Western Australia, Hydrogen Technology Ltd has registered patents in major countries for our first multifunctional welding and cutting system using this hydrogen patented electrolysis fuel cell.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>OK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Nairn, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Nairn</name></talker><para>—That's brilliant.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84F</name.id><name role="metadata">Washer, Dr Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Dr WASHER</name></talker><para>—Yes, it is.

This is a facility jointly operated by Australia Post, AQIS and Customs. It is a facility that deals with very large volumes of overseas mail items—packages and the like. Given the new emphasis that we as a society need to give to issues such as security and safety from imported products that will not be to the welfare of the Australian community, it is clear that this is a very vital function indeed. I have to say, having visited the facility, it is simply inadequate for the task that it carries out: it is overcrowded and there are difficult working conditions. Frankly, it is only by the goodwill of the work force there that it continues to operate. The claim is made that it successfully screens 100 per cent of items presently coming through, but that is simply not sustainable into the future.</para></talk.start><para>By way of illustration of the sorts of items that come through periodically, I am told that over the last month there have been two incidents where explosives have been detected and a live grenade was detected. There are situations where fake—fortunately—anthrax comes through the system. I am told around two such items a month are detected these days, but there were somewhat more in the past. There is a range of items like spiders, millipedes and snakes that are periodically detected.</para><para>The working environment, as I said, is extremely difficult. A purpose-built facility is required where a threat, having been identified, can be sealed off and properly dealt with. That does not exist at the present time. In the current situation staff are crowded into a relatively small area where there is continuous conflict between vehicles—particularly trucks and forklifts—moving in and around the facility, people and dogs. A hazardous waste bin sits at the door. I believe there are serious animal welfare issues because the dogs, which are such an important part of the AQIS and Customs services, are housed in extremely cramped conditions in the back of a van or are put in a kennel outside where they are exposed to all the elements. The fact that this facility is offsite from Melbourne airport is a problem, because it means potentially dangerous items have to be transported through a residential area in order to get them to the screening facility for testing.</para><para>Why is it that this situation is allowed to continue in an environment where we, as a society, are all much more security aware and much more aware of safety issues? The federal government has, in fact, announced and made provision in budgets for funds to create a purpose-built facility on the Melbourne airport site itself to handle the large volumes of items that are coming into Melbourne. However, the process is being derailed by the ideological zealotry of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. The minister apparently claims that the preferred company to construct the purpose-built facility has a building agreement that does not comply with the national code of building practice. Apparently, the sin of the building agreement that the minister objects to is that it makes adequate provision for allowances, superannuation, redundancy and safety for building workers. The minister obviously does not like that, because he is prepared to put in jeopardy the safety and security of Australians, at this difficult time, by refusing to allow work to proceed on a purpose-built facility to address these problems. Frankly, as I said, the facility is at the moment inadequate: it is crowded and it is inefficient because items need to be double handled. The minister ought to wake up to himself and put the interests of Australians first rather than his own ideological crusade.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I have sought the leave of the duty minister, the member for McEwen, and with the permission therefore of the House I will recognise the member for Shortland.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS</title><type>Personal Explanations</type><page.no>15497</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>15497</page.no><name role="metadata">Ms HALL,MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ms HALL,MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name></talker><para>—Yes.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Please proceed.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ms HALL,MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name></talker><para>—I claim to have been misrepresented on three occasions last night in this House by the member for Dobell in an adjournment speech.

Seeing the minister has reminded me that today is the anniversary of the Sandakan death march in 1945 where a number of allied prisoners of war perished under Japanese control. I think it is very worth while remembering some of the things that Australians have done for our freedom.</para></talk.start><para>Of the subject of our hydrogen economy, I, like the members for Bonython, Kalgoorlie and Moore, attended the Hydrogen Economy Conference in Broome, in the beautiful north-west of Western Australia—and a very wonderful conference it was too. The thing that struck me most was the correlation between energy production and population. The more energy the world produces, the less the population grows; in fact, the population reduces. We do not notice it so much in Australia, but population blow-outs are a major problem for the rest of the world. I think anything that can be done to control population and create surety for the long-term stability of the human race is a good thing.</para><para>It was very enlightening to be informed about what can be done with hydrogen to produce energy. As the members who spoke before me have said, hydrogen can be produced in a number of ways. I note that the high tides that they have in north-west Western Australia is one thing that is being looked at. I come from a resource rich part of the world. Recently, Minister Downer signed off on the Timor Sea gas treaty. Very close to the north of the area that I come from are some large gas reserves. Gas is also a way of producing hydrogen. Of course, gas gives off greenhouse emissions but these are sequestered into the ground, crystallise and stay there for centuries. In this regard, I see that not only is hydrogen a renewable energy but it could extend the lifetime of our gas resources and provide security for the Australian energy reserves that we have for much longer down the track. I do not see that they are a competing energy source; I see them as being very complementary. I endorse the sentiments expressed by the members for Bonython, Moore and Kalgoorlie, and I support the efforts of this country to embark on creating a hydrogen economy.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Of all the days that we as Australians set aside to remember and to honour the sacrifice of our sons and daughters in the service of our nation, this day stands alone. Today marks an anniversary unlike any other in our wartime history. Throughout the year, Australians gather in the spirit of remembrance on days that mark victories and defeats, significant battles and days of peace. But this day stands alone. On this day in 1945 about 530 Australian and British prisoners of war left Sandakan prisoner-of-war camp in Borneo on a forced march to Ranau. They were the second group of prisoners to be moved—another 455 had marched out in January as the Japanese emptied the camp ahead of the expected allied landing on Borneo.</para></talk.start><para>Weak, malnourished and sick, the prisoners of war were in no shape for the march, but they moved out as ordered, leaving behind more than 200 fellow prisoners who were too weak to walk. History records that most of them did not get very far. Many died of starvation and illness. Others were killed simply because they could not keep up. Prisoners who had stuck together for up to three years after being captured were left with no choice but to leave their mates behind. Of the 530 men who left Sandakan, 142 Australians and 41 British POWs reached Ranau.</para><para>But there was worse to come. The survivors of the march found only six men left of the 455 who had been sent to Ranau four months earlier. The POWs were put to work carrying firewood, building huts and hauling water for their captors. They died at the rate of seven a day. Beatings and executions continued daily. Back at Sandakan, the camp was burned to the ground and the remaining prisoners were killed or left to die. The last prisoner at Sandakan was executed on 15 August 1945—the day that Japan surrendered. Evidence to war crimes investigators shows that the last Australians at Ranau were killed 12 days after the war had ended. Only six Australians survived the death marches, all of them by escaping. But more than 2,000 Australian and British prisoners of war held at Sandakan had died.</para><para>On this anniversary, on this day, we remember them all. We grieve for the memory of fathers, sons, brothers, husbands and mates—of young men taken from their families to share the darkest chapter of our wartime history. We remember the courage shown by that handful of men who defied their captors, who escaped and who ultimately carried home the news of what had taken place. It has taken many decades for the story of Sandakan to be told. Even now, we can only try to imagine the suffering and the utter inhumanity that they endured, the horrific conditions and the insane cruelty under which they lived and died. However, thanks to those who escaped, we can also find some measure of comfort in the memory of the irrepressible Aussie spirit shown by the prisoners of Sandakan.</para><para>Today we remember the tales of selflessness and of the tenacity of Aussie mateship—the endurance of men who put aside their own suffering to try and ease the pain or the passing of a friend. We should remember the courage shown in the face of death, and the deep and powerful emotion of mates who simply shook hands in silent goodbye to wish each other the best, when they each knew what would happen next. Most of all, we make a promise to those fallen Australian servicemen and their families—and, above all, to ourselves—that we will remember the men of Sandakan and try to be the very best Australians we can be. We owe it to them to tell their story, so that new generations will come to understand the courage, the endurance, the mateship and the sacrifice shown by these men in the service of our nation, and the price paid for the freedoms and the democracy that we enjoy because of them every day. This day stands alone.

The Inner Western Region Migrant Resource Centre that has operated for 22 years in the inner west of Melbourne has been put into voluntary administration. This is a serious issue for our electorate. People who are familiar with my electorate would know that it has a large number of people who are born overseas—37 per cent. Of those people, a large proportion are new migrants and refugees. Many are in great need, requiring settlement and support services and much more. </para></talk.start><para>The migrant resource centre for 22 years has provided a fabulous service in our region. It has been fundamental for many of the new and emerging communities. The centre and its voluntary management committees have been staffed by some fantastic people who are leaders in the community, committed to making sure that new arrivals in our community were welcomed and settled and could be active participants in the community. Some of the people involved actively with the migrant resource centre would put to shame many of us who have lived here all of our lives with the activism they have shown in making our community something we can all be proud of. For many years this migrant resource centre has had a proud record and been the envy of other services across the country. My concern is that we must all work together now to ensure that our first priority is given to resurrecting these services in the region and making sure that refugees and migrants in need of assistance have these vital services available to them.</para><para>The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs has assured the migrant resource centre and me that the overall funding for settlement services in the region will not be reduced as a result of these events. But I want to place on the record that I am incredibly concerned that we are at risk of losing the expertise, knowledge and contacts built up over 22 years—although not all of the staff have been there for that length of time. We do not want to lose that experience to the community. The services which those people with that experience can provide are not the same as the services that anyone else in the community can provide. So we must act quickly. I will be seeking discussions with the minister, the department and the administrator and will be working closely with the local community to make sure that we have these services available to refugees and migrants in our community. </para><para>I am also extremely concerned that the cause of these difficulties stems from questions that must be asked about whether the government provides sufficient funding for the types of services that are needed in these areas where there is high demand for them. So I will be asking questions about that as well.

It is widely regarded as one of the shining examples of the best that Australia has to offer. I often say to members—and I mean it quite sincerely—that in my view, the great thing about representing the Gold Coast is not its beaches, its high-rises or the rainforests that lie in its hinterland; it is the ethos of the people. In particular, it is their entrepreneurship—the fact that Gold Coast people are willing to get in and give something a go.</para></talk.start><para>Recently I had the opportunity, over the weekend of 9 to 11 May, to participate in the inaugural Gold Coast International Small Business Show. This small business show was held at the Parklands Exhibition Centre and provided a great opportunity for me, through the stall that I took at the show over the weekend, to interact with local Gold Coast small businesses.</para><para>On a per capita basis, the Gold Coast has the highest concentration of small businesses in the entire country. The small business show provided the ideal outlet for small businesses to speak with me and also, importantly, for me to talk with many small business operators in my electorate. It coincided with Telstra's launch of its Country Wide service on the Gold Coast. Telstra Country Wide came on board as a major sponsor of the small business show. As a result of Telstra Country Wide now being present on the Gold Coast, they have also rolled out their ADSL services across the board and digitised a number of exchanges, thereby enabling Gold Coast small businesses to get on with doing business with the benefit of broadband. </para><para>It is a great pleasure to represent an area that has some 16,000 home based businesses and some 50,000 small businesses, all located within the Gold Coast city area. I remain a strong advocate of the great ethos that exists on the Gold Coast. Many thousands of people in small business on the Gold Coast are willing to make a contribution and recognise that small business is the engine room not only of the Gold Coast economy but of the Australian economy. On  that basis, I am pleased to draw it to the attention of this chamber.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Jagajaga Electorate: Eltham Lacrosse Club</title><page.no>15505</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>15505</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is my great pleasure to tell the House about a magnificent sporting club in my electorate, the Eltham Lacrosse Club. This wonderful club is celebrating its 40th  anniversary as a member of the Victorian Lacrosse Association. It traces its history back to 1963 when Dr Graham Webb, an innovative teacher at Eltham High School, introduced the game to his students. Bob Russell and Fred Durham joined Dr Webb in forming the club in the following year, and they can both still be seen around the club. Both have junior club teams named after them. Bob Russell has also been honoured with membership of the Victorian Lacrosse Association for his services to the game as both a player and an administrator.</para></talk.start><para>Eltham has grown into one of the largest Lacrosse clubs in the world, fielding teams in men's, women's and junior competitions with great success. Over those 40 years Eltham Lacrosse Club has provided many opportunities for its members, and not just on the sporting field. It is a great family club. Every week families come together to socialise, share a meal and talk about the events of the week, including the all-important match reports. </para><para>The club regularly has representatives in junior and senior state and national teams. Just this month three members of the club—Martin Cobern, Daniel Hall and Tim Fry—represented Australia at the inaugural World Indoor Lacrosse Championships in Canada at which Australia finished a very creditable fifth. In June two members of the club—Jason Brammall and Jonathan Reedyk—will compete in the Australian team at the World Under 19 Lacrosse Championships in Maryland. At a state level, Liam Sedgwick and Caleb Hall have been selected to represent Victoria at the Under 17 Australian Championships in Melbourne in July. </para><para>The Eltham Lacrosse Club also regularly organises junior touring teams to visit the United States and Canada. One of these groups is due to leave in June on a three-week tour of North America, playing against several well-known United States and Canadian teams. The club also hosts visiting teams from the US, Canada, England and Japan. I wish this year's touring teams the very best of luck for successful and enjoyable trips. I congratulate the Eltham Lacrosse Club on the contribution it makes to our community and wish it every success for its 40th season and many more seasons to come.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</title><page.no>15506</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>15506</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I recall that, in the context of the leadership tussle with Bob Hawke, Paul Keating said that leadership is not about tripping over television cables in shopping centres but about being willing to tackle your own constituency. In the context of my current remarks on the improved prospects for a peace settlement in Palestine and Israel, I recall that Yitzhak Rabin, the assassinated former Israeli leader, once remarked that you do not make peace with your friends. Clearly, what is required in this two-generation-long conflict is for key figures to step out of their areas of comfort, out of traditional patterns of rhetoric, and be willing to take on their own constituencies.</para></talk.start><para>I could not allow this occasion to pass without congratulating Ariel Sharon. He produced a statement this week which would have to be described as in the character of taking on your own constituency when he told the Likud Party that Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories cannot go on indefinitely. He said that holding 3.5 million Palestinians is a bad thing for Israel, a bad thing for the Palestinians and a bad thing for the Israeli economy. He said, `You may not like the word “occupation” but that is in fact what is taking place.' He received outraged responses from elements of the right in Israel and in the Diaspora around the world but I thought it was a very gutsy call.</para><para>In the same way, I was pleased to see Mahmoud Abbas appointed as Prime Minister in the Palestinian Authority and the move that that reflected towards a genuine commitment to the peace process. The President of the United States has now launched his so-called road map to peace with its three elements and indicated that he is looking forward to a meeting between Mahmoud Abbas and Ariel Sharon in the relatively near future.</para><para>I note the presence in the chamber of the member for Melbourne Ports, the deputy chair of the Australia-Israel committee, and am encouraged as Chair of the Palestinian Friendship Group by the fact that he and I would be absolutely of one mind on this issue. This is a pregnant moment of opportunity. We need peace in Israel and an independent state of Palestine for peace throughout the rest of the Middle East and the world.

This week the Hunter Institute held an annual awards event. I wish to add my congratulations to Damien O'Neill, who participated in the Certificate 1 Access to Work and Educational Opportunities course and is the winner of the student achievement award. I also congratulate the 12 recipients of staff excellence awards and thank them for their dedication to their students, their profession and the wider community. The industry partnership award winner, Crowne Plaza Newcastle, has made a major contribution to the development and enhancement of education and training at the Hunter Institute. I congratulate the management and staff, well known to me, for their effective partnership with the Hunter Institute in vocational education and training.</para></talk.start><para>This week I was also visited in the House, as many other members were, by organisers from the NSW Teachers Federation, who outlined the many pressures TAFE teachers face today as they are called on to provide flexible models in education and training for students and are also required to service the entrepreneurial and vocational partnerships that reflect a constantly changing work culture. I wish them well with their current campaign to enhance staff conditions and pay.</para><para>I would be remiss, though, if I did not remind the House that, in spite of the ever-increasing demand for places in a greater variety of new courses, this government gave no increase at all in the current budget for the TAFE system. Similarly, at a time of high levels of skill shortages in this country, particularly in traditional trade areas, the government failed to initiate much needed reforms to the New Apprenticeship schemes. Newcastle, as a manufacturing centre located in a region where unemployment remains high, is particularly aware of the need for those reforms in apprenticeships. This is a regrettable situation and the people of Newcastle—students, workers and employers—will be the losers.</para><para>In concluding, I congratulate the TAFE award winners who set the standards high and acknowledge the outstanding contribution that Hunter Institute of TAFE makes to my electorate and to the entire Hunter region.

I remember when we had power shortages and skyrocketing electricity prices under a previous Labor government in New South Wales. They then panicked and built an excess supply of power generators at a huge cost to the taxpayers of that state. Unfortunately, I think we are in for a repeat of that power mismanagement.</para></talk.start><para>The biggest market in Australia is New South Wales, with more than a third of customers and consumption. The question has to be asked whether the state government is asleep at the wheel in terms of power supply. The consumption of electricity in New South Wales has risen by 7½ per cent in the last four years. In this time generation capacity has actually gone backwards. At 12,147 megawatts in 2002, it was actually 30 megawatts lower than in 1998. What is more, the average age of New South Wales power plants is among the highest in the country—more than 21 years, as against 23 years in Victoria and 16 years in Queensland. Where are the plans to build more power generation plants in New South Wales? In Queensland there have been more than 3,400 megawatts of new capacity added since 1998, in South Australia 1,100 megawatts and in Victoria only 500 megawatts, but the New South Wales capacity has gone backwards while demand rises. Consumption in Queensland has risen 7,300 gigawatt hours since 1998 and there is an added 3,400 megawatts of capacity. At present its production is meeting 12 per cent of New South Wales demand via the QNI high-voltage interconnector. </para><para>Consumption in New South Wales has risen 4,400 gigawatts since 1998 and generating capacity has fallen. If Central Queensland gets the new industries it is pursuing, how much capacity will be available to flow south? If New South Wales gets any of the new industries it is pursuing, how will it meet this demand? Building a big coal-fired power station in New South Wales will take up to six years, including dealing with all the approval processes. There are many firms and jobs in my electorate, let alone residents, that rely on the availability of power and cannot have their livelihood threatened because New South Wales has not done its job on future power needs. Meeting the generation need from gas-fired power is technically and commercially feasible, but where is the gas to come from? ABN Amro says all of the south-eastern Australian petroleum gas reserves are committed. Does New South Wales face a rerun of earlier problems of power shortages and the price shocks it encountered in the late 1970s? The state government is not running this. We must have a long-term future. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Essentially, the bill seeks to amend the intellectual property laws by some technical amendments which really bring about a refinement of some changes that were made not too long ago through the 2001 amending law. </para></talk.start><para>There are two key areas that the bill addresses. One is identifying that an extension of time is justified for applicants where contractors and providers of services to those applicants have failed to deliver on what they promised. Members would be aware that there are certain timetable requirements under the law for getting patent applications and supporting material in to IP Australia. But, if by chance the courier or someone is detained or there is a blockage in the Citylink tunnel in Melbourne and they miss that deadline, there is no provision under the current law to provide for an extension. There is an extension available if the Commissioner of Patents is the cause of the delay. That is neat, that is handy, but there are other factors that can bring about delays in the timely provision of information in support of an application. That is one area of the law that is being addressed by a technical amendment.</para><para>Another area relates to the disclosure of information. As part of the Backing Australia's Ability policy initiatives the government was committed to refining and in some cases expanding the scope of searches carried out in support of patent applications. The idea behind that was to make sure that patents granted in Australia were robust and reliable and had addressed all reasonably available information.</para><para>One of the issues that arose from the patent profession shortly after the introduction of that amendment was that it was not as sharply defined and as clear as some would have liked it to be. The result of seeking to sharpen the focus of the information that had to be provided in support of patent applications was not an amending law being put in place. Applicants holding potentially useful and valuable information they had uncovered through their own searches—often through overseas patent offices and patent search companies—that could be and should be provided to the Commissioner of Patents did not have to provide that information under the law as it stood. So it had probably gone a little too far in being as specific as it could be about the information that needed to be provided. Questions were asked. If an applicant had this material at their fingertips, why not provide it? Why not share that with the Commissioner of Patents to make sure that our patents system in Australia is as robust and as well informed as it can be and that the relevant information that is available is in the hands of the commissioner?</para><para>Essentially, the Patents Act, the Trade Marks Act and the Designs Act provide that a person needs to be granted an extension of time if the time period has not been complied with because of an error or omission by the commissioner, the Registrar of Trade Marks, the Registrar of Designs or an employee of IP Australia. IP Australia often uses the services of independent contractors or consultants during the processing of applications—such as couriers, to use the example I provided earlier—to transport documents from a state office to the central office in Canberra. There is a concern that the extension of time provisions that currently exist may not encompass errors or omissions on the part of these parties. I have given you an example of how that would work. That amendment clarifies the capacity for time extensions to be granted where errors or omissions occur as a result of someone working on behalf of the process—that is, someone who is supposed to be helpful in facilitating the lodgment of that material—for some reason not delivering their side of the bargain.</para><para>I will explain further the issues around the provision of information. The patent attorneys themselves have had something to say about the way the earlier amendments in the 2001 act have been operating. It has become apparent to both the government and the IP profession that those initial amendments lack some clarity and do not fully implement the government's policy objectives. The amendments in this bill will require that only the results of searches conducted by or on behalf of foreign patent officers are required. This should not significantly reduce the amount of relevant information that is disclosed and is a much clearer requirement.</para><para>Although these amendments will not commence retrospectively, they will have a retrospective effect because they will apply to standard patent applications that have been accepted prior to 1 April 2002 and to innovation patents for which examination had not begun before that date. In this way the new disclosure regime will completely replace the old one and give the clarity and focus that the industry and the government through its Backing Australia's Ability policy were looking for. Through that regime and the transitional arrangements, no applicants or patentees should be disadvantaged by the provisions that are being introduced.</para><para>I guess the key thing is that patents are not a precise science. In fact, they seek to identify art. You will see that patent laws and journals that address intellectual property ask: `What is the art? What is the contribution? What is the creativity that has gone into the innovation someone is seeking to claim ownership of?' It is dealing with an art, and making sure that the art is done well is also a bit of an art! Here the question is: how do you get clarity and certainty if someone is claiming ownership of an idea yet at the same time not impose an unreasonable burden on those applicants? Narrowing the scope of the information that is covered by these provisions but ensuring that they are effective in their disclosure function should reduce the burden on applicants and patentees while ensuring that the system is robust and reliable.</para><para>When we look at what this means for the average person on the ground, the key driver is: what is the burden on the applicants, and how can we relieve that burden and not weaken the system? The burden is on the applicant to discover all searches that are made within their organisation—whether or not these are known to the inventor. For example, where a university is a patent applicant and the inventor is a staff member, the university is obliged to disclose all searches made by the inventor and by the organisation; and, where they are not known to the inventor, there is onus on those who are working with the inventor to contribute to that disclosure information.</para><para>The Australian Academy of Science has observed that it is sometimes difficult for a university to organise and fund search activity that will satisfy that provision. It is hard to know about all the work that is going on right around the globe, and it is sometimes difficult to identify what level of search needs to be undertaken. Do you simply contact the relevant departments at other universities around the globe? Do you go through your own collaborative networks? Are you sure you are even asking the right people? It is a difficult task. So where there is that lack of clarity, the scope of the searches becomes unclear. Searches are normally conducted on the invention, whereas the application may contain other information that is also the subject of searches. Wording of the amendment as it was originally prepared in 2001 left open the possibility that irrelevant information may be disclosed and quite relevant information may not be provided.</para><para>John Hearn is a man whom I deeply respect and admire—he is the vice-chancellor of research and innovation at the ANU. He is very supportive of the bill and his point is a simple one. He said: </para><quote><para>Anything that simplifies the disclosure process is good so long as the integrity of the process is maintained. </para><para>It is also important that Australia preserves the integrity of the disclosure process and insists that America do the same. Currently the US don't have to provide disclosure but can claim ideas by showing scribbles on notebooks indicating that they had thought about an idea. </para><para>Another big issue is instances where large American companies fund any work undertaken, they will insist on having all the intellectual property on the work carried out.</para><para>I emphasise the importance in protecting Australia from the US—</para></quote><para>a trading partner and friend—</para><quote><para>claiming prior knowledge just because they have some notes on an idea and insisting that where a US organisation funds an idea, disclosure is claimed. </para></quote><para>These kinds of issues are the unspoken questions behind trade. If you and I were in the United States and we stumbled over half an idea, we could actually get some patent protection for a limited time—usually 12 months—while we fleshed out the idea. That is not a feature that is available in many other countries. The idea of notes—scribbles, in fact; ponderings, doodles—as evidence that you had actually thought about an idea is, I think, a bit of a head start that US corporations and US inventors have over many other countries. I think we need to keep an eye on that. We need to make sure that we do not lose sight of this in matters of creativity, trademarks and the like—just as in other areas of commercial law—where we have some harmonisation going on with the United States. This is a huge trade advantage.</para><para>I remember talking with a leading expert on this subject at Stanford University a few years ago. I said, `What do you make of this?' and he said, `Yes, it is unfair. It gives the US an unfair advantage over other innovative nations, individuals and corporations around the world.' I said, `What do you think should happen about that?' His view was, `Nothing will happen in the US. Congress will not touch it, because it is an advantage for their corporations.' His concern was that others might seek to embrace this less rigorous, less onerous way of evidencing ideas and that you would then have a gradual unwinding of the rigour and robustness of the patents system. I would hate to see that happen. I do not think we should turn our back, just because it is difficult, on what is a competition issue with a major trading partner; that is, sometimes their ideas—unfulfilled, unconcluded and incomplete—actually get a legal status that would not wash in our country. I do not think that is really the way to go.</para><para>Another issue I would like to talk about before wrapping up—and one which I have spoken about three times in the parliament since I was elected in 1996—is the efforts at claiming ownership of genes and gene sequences. There are some examples of corporations that have sought to protect their investment in unravelling the genetic mysteries that make up us humans. Where they have stumbled over something, they have sought to claim ownership of it. I find that a troubling idea, and I think that we need to be open to a better way of addressing that direction. In previous speeches I have given some examples of where I think inappropriate patents have been issued. I will give you another example. If you and I were walking through your farm property, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, and we kicked a cow pad out of the road and found some shiny gold metal there, we would say, `Gee, that is interesting. I wonder what that is? It's gold. We found it first, so we own all the gold around the country.' We know that is obvious nonsense, but in genetics that is partly what is going on. If someone finds something first, having added no value, having shown—to use the legal term—no art, no creativity, no value-add and no input, they are claiming some ownership over it just because they found it first.</para><para>I do not mind those people claiming ownership of the technology and the technique they used to discover that genetic sequence or that insight. I do have a problem, though, where someone seeks to claim something that is simply a discovery and not a creation; where they seek ownership over something that naturally exists. Because we have not had the technology in the past to locate it, that does not mean that the first person to locate it should own it. I think this is a worrying area in patent law where the huge investments of research and development funds are sought to be recovered by ownership of what is discovered. Discovery is not creation. Finding something first is not an art, and it should not be owned. </para><para>How we find a balance between the funds needed to do the research and development in the first place and not giving away ownership of naturally occurring phenomena is a difficult issue. It is an issue that I am pleased the government is at least open to addressing. The Democrats—and I have some sympathy for what they were trying to do in 2001—were seeking to prevent the patenting of naturally occurring genes and gene sequences and their descriptions of base sequences. That proposition was not embraced at that time, mainly because people did not quite know what it meant. It was accepted that the issue of patenting of genetic material was an important one that needed proper and careful consideration.</para><para>The issue of patenting of genes was debated extensively in December last year. During that debate Senator Patterson announced that the Prime Minister had agreed to an inquiry by the Australian Law Reform Commission into intellectual property issues associated with genes and genetic technologies, with a focus on health issues. That was a welcome announcement, and the Attorney-General and Senator Patterson formally announced the inquiry and released its terms of reference on 17 December 2002.</para><para>The government does recognise that the patenting of genetic material is a sensitive and important issue, raising fundamental concerns that include moral and ethical issues, the impact on freedom of research in Australia and ensuring that Australia has the latest technology. The inquiry by the Australian Law Reform Commission will be headed by Professor David Weisbrot. It will examine the impact of current patenting laws and practices on the conduct of genetic research and its subsequent application and commercialisation. It will also examine the effect of these laws and practices on the Australian biotechnology sector and the cost-effective provision of health care in Australia. We can expect that the inquiry will be completed by 30 June 2004. </para><para>This bill should simplify the process by targeting and streamlining the supporting information requirement, without jeopardising the integrity of Australia's disclosure process. The changes have been proposed following research into the existing system. Our experiences have identified some shortcomings, and that is what is being addressed here. It will reduce the burden on applicants and patentees, but it will ensure that, if those applicants and patentees have some information that is useful, relevant and informative, it is made available to the commissioner. It will help to clarify and streamline the existing process. It should reduce the financial cost on applicants and should maintain and reinforce Australia's strong patent system. For all those reasons I think we should support the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>15512</page.no><name role="metadata">McFarlane, Jann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JANN McFARLANE</name><name.id>83C</name.id><electorate>Stirling</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to discuss the <inline ref="R1599">Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 2002</inline>. This bill effectively plugs leaks left by the mishap that was the Patents Amendment Bill 2001. As so often has been the case with the Howard government's innovation policy, this bill created several problems, and national research and development was further stifled because of it. </para></talk.start><para>The Patents Amendment Bill was implemented in an attempt to better the amount of information on prior works available to patent examiners. The motivation for such a policy change, quite legitimately, came in response to recommendations from the Intellectual Property and Competitive Review Committee and the Advisory Council on Intellectual Property. To this extent, the matter was handled well and the groundwork laid for a credible bill in 2001. However, the Howard government felt the need to rush proceedings and to introduce a bill that was untested, and the relevant industry groups were left out in the cold. We on this side of the House were deeply concerned by the reckless passage of that particular bill. On 28 June 2001, Carmen Lawrence, then shadow minister for innovation, said: </para><quote><para>Because of our concern about the current state of innovation in Australia and our concern, too, about this legislation potentially placing Australian inventors at a further disadvantage in the international market, we will, as I say, be attempting to have these matters further examined in the Senate.</para></quote><para>Labor's concern over that bill, as time has shown, was justified. Because of the wording of the 2001 law, the patent community has been placed in situations of great uncertainty and was concerned about being susceptible to strategic and frivolous challenges to patent applications.</para><para>I would like to dwell for a moment on what the term `patent applicant' means. I suspect that when the Howard government hears this term it thinks of research departments and think tanks in big corporations. While this description is valid, I would like to take this opportunity to remind the government about the other meaning for this term. Many of our most important ideas have come from Australian universities, young postgraduates struggling to make ends meet but still nourishing a strong creativity and sense of innovation, and Australian people striving to put something new out into the world—the very sort of ingenuity that Australia was once renowned for. I am sorry to say that it is in large part this government's inconsistent approach to innovation policy which sees us firmly behind the eight ball when compared to OECD nations.</para><para>There are great numbers of brilliant Australians out there trying to create something new. I would like to draw the attention of the chamber to the web site &lt;www.trimed.com.au&gt;. There you will see the work and developments of two great innovators: Dr Barry J. Marshall and Dr Robin Warren. These scientists pioneered research into gastric and duodenal ulcers and identified Helicobacter pylori as the cause. They came up with the first effective treatment of ulcers—rather than the treatment of the symptoms—in the world.</para><para>The small business these innovators developed in the Stirling electorate in Osborne Park—TRI-MED Distributors Pty Ltd—is managed and operated by medical professionals and scientists with over 20 years experience with Helicobacter pylori. From a starting point in Western Australia, TRI-MED now has offices in Melbourne and Thailand. TRI-MED is committed to discovering and commercially developing novel and innovative diagnostic products. It is not only producing its goods locally but also earning export dollars for Australia. Should the government continue to get innovation policy wrong, brilliant minds like Dr Marshall and Dr Warren will go to waste or will be lost overseas.</para><para>Australian innovators and thinkers are already disadvantaged by not being in the knowledge hotspots of the United States and Europe. We must make their passage as patentees as seamless as possible. The 2001 attempt at this by the Howard government clearly has not delivered. While the government has, hopefully, created an effective piece of legislation with this bill, the patent community still faces the other roadblocks put in front of them by the Howard government—but I suppose this is nothing new.</para><para>In the eight budgets that this government has handed down, we have seen a mentality of little faith and quick rewards. It would seem that, if something does not make a dollar in the first financial year of operation, this government does not consider it to be worth investing in. Innovation, be it through higher education, research grants, resource expansion or any other strategy, is a long-term investment. Unfortunately for those Australians involved with innovation, foresight is not something this government has had a lot of.</para><para>In 2000, the current Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, the Hon. Ian Macfarlane, MP, said he looked forward to Australia's tertiary institutions leading the world. I find this hard to believe. The Howard government has made a sport of making life tougher for our students and aspiring academics, and innovation has been caught firmly in the crossfire. In this light, I mention the latest higher education measures undertaken by the Treasurer. The latest budget will ensure that the quality of education Australians get is dependent upon how much they are prepared to spend or how much of their life they want to spend repaying their university loans. It is education for the wealthy, not for the talented. We on this side of the House believe that encouraging innovation means allowing our developers the freedom to take risks. Increasing the financial obligation these people have does not encourage innovation. What it does is increase this government's pool of money to spend on industrial development at the big end of town.</para><para>I have had several constituents come to my office wanting assistance with their patent applications. This is because the system is patchy and inconsistent and this government has, until now, decided it was too much effort to fix. I quote the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, the Hon. Warren Entsch. He said upon presenting the 2001 legislation:</para><quote><para>The bill reflects the government's commitment to encouraging innovation and providing Australia with a strong intellectual property system that meets the needs of Australians.</para></quote><para>The parliamentary secretary is nodding at those wonderful, wise words.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Entsch, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Entsch</name></talker><para>—It is marvellous to have such support.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83C</name.id><name role="metadata">McFarlane, Jann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JANN McFARLANE</name></talker><para>—That is right. In response to this, I ask the honourable member: how many Australians outside his own staff did he actually discuss the bill with? The results since the enacting of the act suggests the total to be somewhere near zero. I hope that the Howard government takes two messages away from this experience. The first is that patent issues are of fundamental importance to Australia, and they deserve to be treated accordingly. It seems clear to me that the 2001 bill was treated with an indifference of grand proportions. As a result, we are back in this place plugging leaks and devoting time and money to something that should have already been resolved. Let us get serious about policy in this area. The innovators of this country deserve a supportive and clear-cut policy behind them.</para></talk.start></continue><para>My second message for the Howard government can be applied to the innovation portfolio and in far more general terms. Take a long, hard look at how you make your policy and take the time to consult the people most knowledgeable and affected. I guess the shorthand version of this is to listen to the people of this industry and of this country. Labor considers intellectual property and innovation policy in general to be of the highest priority. In Stirling—the electorate that I represent—a great many academics and students are putting every effort into furthering collective knowledge and forging something new. I hope that when I return to Stirling in the near future I will be able to tell these people in the academic and business communities that Australia has a patent framework for intellectual property that is worth while and, above all, working. It is in this spirit that Labor would like to see the passage of the 2002 bill. I genuinely hope that the government has taken something out of the mistakes evident in the 2001 process. Let us get this right for the innovators of Australia. They deserve no less, but time and time again this government has given them just that. I commend this bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>15514</page.no><name role="metadata">Entsch, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ENTSCH</name><name.id>7K6</name.id><electorate>Leichhardt</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—In summing up on the second reading debate on the <inline ref="R1599">Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 2002,</inline> I would like to thank those members who contributed to the debate on this bill. I would particularly like to thank the member for Dunkley for his comments in support of the bill and, in particular, his comments on the patenting of genetic material. The government is certainly looking forward to the ALRC report due to be completed next year. I would also like to thank the members for Rankin, Blaxland and Stirling, who have supported this bill and spoken about innovation and industry policy. I take this opportunity to respond to some of the statements made by the speakers from the opposition and to highlight some of the government's more significant achievements in the areas of industry, innovation and intellectual property policy.</para></talk.start><para> `Science and innovation' is one of the government's nine strategic priorities. Industry and innovation policy are an area in which this government has been particularly active—notably, under our five-year, $3 billion innovation statement, Backing Australia's Ability. In that statement, we announced the fund managers for the $78.7 million competitive pre-seed fund for the commercialisation of public sector research, which will encourage universities in the public sector and research agencies to further develop their discoveries and create new business opportunities. We will be providing R&amp;D Start with further funding of over $520 million until 2006 to encourage companies to undertake R&amp;D and its commercialisation.</para><para>We will be establishing two centres, costing $130 million over five years, in information technology, communication and stem cell research. We announced funding for 30 cooperative research centres and committed an additional $227 million to the CRC program, topping up the pre-existing funding of approximately $145 million per annum. Also, we established 125 Australian Research Council Federation fellowships, each worth over $1.1 million, to retain Australia's leading researchers and to attract outstanding international researchers to work in Australia.</para><para>We also provided funding for up to an additional 2,000 university places each year, with the priority given to information and communications technology, mathematics and science. By the end of 2003-04, the federal government will have spent 41 per cent of the total $3 billion committed, not the 20 per cent, or one-fifth, claimed by the member for Rankin. The remaining 59 per cent is allocated for the final two years of the program.</para><para>The government's continuing commitment to the creation of new knowledge and innovation is reflected in the record allocation of $5.4 billion in the 2003-04 budget. Of that, $644 million is allocated for 2003-04, which represents an increase of around $217 million on the 2002-03 budget commitment. Labor's knee-jerk response to increasing expenditure on R&amp;D is to increase the R&amp;D tax concession to 150 per cent or even 200 per cent. The Productivity Commission study in 1997 indicated that the government's current tax concession does generate net economic benefits, especially at the 125 per cent rate. Contrary to what the member for Rankin has said, business investment in R&amp;D jumped 18 per cent in 2000-01, and, given the record number of registrations for the R&amp;D tax concession for 2001-02, it is expected to increase even further.</para><para>I also point out that there have been no cuts to the R&amp;D Start program. On the contrary, R&amp;D Start, the government's flagship innovation program, has been extended to June 2007, with an additional $41 million. The R&amp;D Start program has assisted more than 1,000 innovative Australian companies to increase their R&amp;D levels and the commercialisation of outcomes since 1996. More than 90 per cent of the grant recipients under this program are small and medium enterprises. Because of the unprecedented demand for R&amp;D Start funding, it was necessary to inject an additional $40 million from uncommitted R&amp;D Start funds in outyears into the program to meet an unexpected call on funds in the 2002-03 financial year. As a consequence of the high take-up rate, it was also necessary to suspend the consideration of new applications for a short time until uncommitted funds became available.</para><para>Under Backing Australia's Ability, we have also announced two significant reforms of the intellectual property system. A bill for the new Designs Act was introduced into the parliament on 11 December 2002. The <inline ref="R1700">Designs Bill 2002</inline> provides for stricter eligibility and infringement tests, a more streamlined registration system and a better enforcement and dispute resolutions process.</para><para>The Patents Amendment Act 2001 strengthened Australia's patentability standards to more closely align them with international standards. This act implemented the key recommendations from the Advisory Council on Intellectual Property's review of enforcement of industrial property rights and the Intellectual Property and Competition Review Committee's review of intellectual property legislation under the Competition Principles Agreement. We have established the Intellectual Property Research Institute of Australia at the University of Melbourne. The institute will provide high-quality research to improve policy advice to government, the use of IP by Australian organisations and the debate about IP issues in the Australian community.</para><para>We have implemented a range of initiatives aimed at increasing awareness of IP in both the public and private sectors, with particular focus on tertiary education and research industries. Clearly, this government has implemented very vigorously an extensive array of well-targeted and effective measures in the areas of industry, innovation and intellectual property policy. These measures will provide an essential underpinning for a truly innovative economy that will deliver huge benefits to the Australian people.</para><para>The amendments in the <inline ref="R1599">Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 2002</inline> will be of benefit to applicants for patent, trademark and design protection because they will ensure that valuable rights are not put at risk due to the error or omission of a third party. In addition, we have acted to ensure that the disclosure regime for patents provides an appropriate balance between the needs of applicants and those of the patent office. The new requirements are clearer and reduce the burden on the applicant without significantly diminishing the amount of relevant information that is to be disclosed to the patent office. These amendments have been arrived at in consultation with key interest groups, and I am confident that the new system will ensure that the patent office has the information it requires to ensure the granting of high-quality patents. I would particularly like to thank the Institute of Patent and Trade Mark Attorneys and the FICPI—the International Federation of Intellectual Property Attorneys—for their assistance in this matter.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para><para>Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MARITIME LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PREVENTION OF POLLUTION FROM SHIPS) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>15516</page.no><id.no>R1760</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>15516</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 25 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tuckey</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>15517</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to put the opposition's views on the <inline ref="R1760">Maritime Legislation Amendment (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Bill 2003</inline>.

Previous bills implemented annexes dealing with the prevention of pollution by the discharge of oil, chemicals, harmful package substances and garbage from ships.</para></talk.start><para>Prima facie, the provision in this bill that reduces the minimum distance from shore for dumping commuted and treated sewage could be seen as a reduction in environmental protection. Initially, this was of concern to Labor, but further research has allayed our concerns. It became clear that, until the convention gained enough support, none of its provisions would come into effect. The four nautical miles limit was one barrier to that necessary level of support from other nations. So, while it is a reduction, it is only a nominal one. Australia was prepared to accept the tighter standard, but not enough other countries were.</para><para>At the end of the day, the revised provision is also consistent with other international laws and boundaries. On this basis Labor's concerns are mitigated. State governments also concurred with our view that this provision is acceptable. The other matters in this bill are largely technical issues related to definitions and delegations.</para><para>Labor supports the bill but, in so doing, I will be moving a second reading amendment. The bill provides a valuable opportunity to bring attention yet again to the shipping policy paralysis of the Howard government. The amendment circulated in my name calls on the Howard government to level the playing field for the Australian shipping industry.</para><para>Labor says again, `Enough is enough.' This is a welcome action but it is a sad indictment of the current minister that two previous transport ministers from opposite sides of the chamber, John Sharp and Peter Morris, have had to come in and stitch together a survival plan for the industry.</para><para>Why is a survival plan needed? A survival plan is needed because absolutely nothing has happened to develop an Australian shipping policy under the watch of the Deputy Prime Minister. The last federal Labor government set the industry on a course of constructive reform. The negotiations around the sale of ANL set that course, on top of an intensive period of constructive waterfront reform under Labor.</para><para>To his credit, the incoming coalition Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, kept the constructive dialogue going. But then along came Reith. Busting the MUA became the only shipping policy of the Howard government. Shipping was taken from the transport department and put into the industrial relations portfolio. Along came the balaclava and Rottweiler approach to industrial reform.</para><para>The Deputy Prime Minister has been fumbling shipping policy since it was returned to the transport portfolio. The problem with the Deputy Prime Minister is that he only listens to one part of the industry. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services is only interested in shipping through the prism of low shipping costs at any cost. He is not involving everyone in this process—only those who are interested in driving costs down. The low-cost shipping industry at any cost strategy has a high price.</para><para>This debate has always gone beyond industrial relations. This is a debate about our environment. It is a debate about having a skilled merchant marine and defence readiness. It is a debate about maritime and port security and mitigating the threats of terrorism. It is also a debate about domestic transport policy, the importance of fair competition and the load shipping can carry in a domestic transport task. Unfortunately, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services is not engaging in that debate.</para><para>We learned this week in estimates hearings that shipping is not the only important issue the minister has been disengaged from. Shamefully, he has also had his eye off the budget in his own department. He overcommitted on his election promises and projects and landed his department in a terrible financial mess. The minister has a record of passing the buck. He tried to do it again this week in relation to his department's finances. Remember, he did it two years ago when he sacked two of his staff to take the fall for his own incompetence in breaching the legislation he is charged with administering on behalf of Australians.</para><para>Many Australians are interested in the future of the Australian shipping industry. The Australian public have a keen interest in this. We are an island nation and Australians are acutely aware of that. I am pleased to say that it is not only those on the Labor side of politics who are interested in this debate and the future of Australian shipping. But the key person who must develop an interest is the person who is actually charged with the responsibility to deliver: the Minister for Transport and Regional Services.</para><para>I am pleased to say that John Sharp and Peter Morris have answered the calls from industry and the unions to take on this debate. We have also had a valuable contribution to the debate from the Western Australian transport minister, Alannah MacTiernan. Western Australians know how important shipping is to their state. Minister MacTiernan took a paper to the Australian Transport Council meeting of all Australian transport ministers last week. Again, this is Labor showing leadership on this critical issue. The ATC meeting acknowledged that Minister MacTiernan's paper had correctly identified that more could be done to enhance the competitiveness of Australia's shipping industry. I await with interest the standing committee on transport's analysis of the report to be presented to the next ATC meeting.</para><para>The minister's paper indicates that a recent study commissioned by the Australian Maritime Group addresses a key concern that Labor has had for some time: that the future of the Australian shipping industry is bleak. The minister should table that report so we can see the detail of these concerns. The study indicates that the present policy constraints facing the shipping industry could be the very thing that brings it undone. I contend that the Howard government can no longer ignore this fact.</para><para>As Minister MacTiernan correctly points out, shipping is essential to our international trade. At the same time, it has the potential to play a much more significant role in domestic freight movements. As the minister for transport continually reminds us, Australia's freight transport task is set to double in the next 20 years. He has set in train a plan that he says will provide a comprehensive blueprint for an integrated approach to transport planning and funding.</para><para>But the plan is flawed before it even gets out of the blocks, with the minister refusing to consider or accommodate the Australian shipping industry as part of his national land transport plan. It is clear that the minister believes that the transport task stops at the water's edge. I say that the Howard government and the minister for transport lack the vision and will to surrender their bias against the local shipping industry and to actually engage them in helping to address this freight transport task.</para><para>The Howard government's anti-Australian shipping policy has led to a serious decline in our nation's merchant fleet. The number of Australian flag vessels stood at just 54 in 2003, a decline of 31 per cent over the last decade. Investment in Australian shipping has also dropped over the past six years to an average of just $44 million, down from the average $222 million under the previous Labor government.</para><para>We have come to the point where significant investment decisions will have to be made soon by Australian shipowners but a question must be asked: what indication is there that investment would be worth while? Under the present policy of the Howard government there is little, if any, motivation for local shipowners to make significant investments in their fleets.</para><para>This should not be the case and does not have to be. Government policy should encourage local investment in local industry, not inhibit it as is the case with the Australian shipping industry. Labor—at federal, state and territory level—have expressed serious concerns about the misuse of the cabotage system and its effect on the local industry. As we all understand, the Commonwealth Navigation Act prescribes that Australian coastal trade should be reserved for licensed Australian vessels and that licences to foreign vessels are to be issued only in the event of local vessels being unavailable.</para><para>Yet time and time again under the Howard government's `cheap shipping at any cost' policy, the act is flouted. Permits are granted to substandard foreign vessels at the expense of Australian flag vessels and the increase in the issue of these permits under the Howard government is particularly concerning. Seven-hundred and fifty-one permits were issued to foreign vessels in 2001-02. That is a 270 per cent increase on the number of permits issued a decade earlier. Over the same period, freight carried under permit rose by 782 per cent.</para><para>What is obvious, but what is clearly not acknowledged by this government, is that their policy is driving the Australian shipping industry into the ground. Licensed vessel operators are faced with a financial and legislative regime that supports their competitors, who are given free rein on our coastlines. I say this is not a level playing field.</para><para>How can the Australian industry be expected to compete fairly with foreign shippers who so easily undercut local operators? Despite competing directly in the same domestic markets as Australian shippers, foreign shippers are not required to pay Australian wages or taxes and they are not required to provide regulated workplace standards for employees. This all happens under government sanction, through a manipulation of the cabotage system.</para><para>Put simply, the Australian shipping industry is fighting an uphill battle if it is to return to being a viable, efficient and effective national industry. The industry needs to have the ability to supply cost-effective shipping services. That is the first key factor. The opportunity to be an effective competitor in terms of freight movement goes the first part of the way to restoring Australia's once vibrant coastal shipping industry. The industry also needs a fair deal in relation to the regulatory frameworks it must operate under. The rapid chipping away of the domestic shipping industry that has occurred under the Howard government shipping policy must be addressed now through proper adherence to the cabotage provisions of the Commonwealth Navigation Act. Safety in shipping practices and the higher standards of training will also ensure the professionalism of our merchant industry. We must insist that the ships operating in our waters are structurally safe and are crewed by professionals who have regard for our environment. This goes to the heart of the legislation we are discussing today. Our coastal environment is too precious and too sensitive to be an afterthought in shipping policy considerations.</para><para>The Australian shipping industry does not need or want a handout; it just wants a fair go and a government that is interested in its future. The minister for transport quite obviously is not interested in the future of the Australian shipping industry. It is time for fundamental change. The problem for the Australian shipping industry is that the Howard government do not care who owns or operates the ship at the dock. Their interests stops there. This simply cannot continue. I look forward to the release of the Morris-Sharp report into the Australian shipping industry for the ability it has to refocus our attention on this valuable but entirely underutilised and rapidly degrading industry. The Australian Transport Council ministers realise this and, through the efforts of the Western Australian minister, the issue of the Australian shipping industry is firmly on the national agenda. We may not all agree with the determinations of Morris and Sharp. The point is that we cannot afford to ignore the Australian shipping industry any longer. Labor will approach their findings and recommendations with an open mind and with good intent, just as Labor has always approached industry reform.

In December of last year, I spoke in this place on the introduction of the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill, which itself produced a further important reform relating to marine pollution with respect to plastic bags and other materials discharged from ships—materials which might otherwise pollute the environment or harm marine life. The proposal which is now before the House deals with the issue of sewage emanating from ships of certain sizes. I am pleased to hear that the opposition supports the amendments.</para></talk.start><para>I will not go into the proposed legislation in great detail, but it is worth recording that MARPOL, the marine pollution convention, underpins the legislation—the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 and the Navigation Act 1912—which needs to be amended. The proposals now before the House are significant indeed. Annex IV, which contains the ship based sewage convention, was originally proposed in a slightly different form in 1986 but, for reasons involving the failure of the IMO to obtain international consent from a sufficient number of supporting nations, was not put into effect. However, in March 2000, the IMO did reach agreement on changes to annex IV that resulted in sufficient countries ratifying it, and it will come into force in September 2003. That has the result that the sewage convention which governs the discharging of sewage from certain ships will operate with respect to new vessels greater than 400 gross tonnes or vessels of less than 400 gross tonnes so long as they are certified to carry more than 15 persons on board. Those ships will now be governed by the sewage limits contained in annex IV of the MARPOL convention.</para><para>There are three requirements in relation to international voyages for these vessels. One is that untreated sewage may be discharged only at a distance of more than 12 nautical miles from the nearest land, so long as the vessel does not have holding tanks for sewage and is proceeding at a moderate speed—that is, at not less than four knots. Another requirement is that disinfected sewage may be discharged at a distance of not less than three nautical miles from land, subject to meeting certain technical standards set by the IMO. The final requirement is that effluent from an IMO approved sewage treatment plant may be discharged at any location, so long as certain limits relating to solids and the discolouration of surrounding water are complied with.</para><para>This bill establishes consistent national standards for international trading ships. It permits the Australian authorities—and, in particular, AMSA and departmental authorities—to enforce measures available under the MARPOL conventions contained in the statute, including regular inspections to ensure compliance on board and, indeed, the boarding of vessels in the event of feared violations. One of the important aspects of the legislation as amended is that it imposes a general obligation on the Australian authorities to ensure adequate port facilities to meet the demand for the reception and disposal of sewage from such ships. It is true to say that major Australian trading ports and most smaller Australian ports are very well catered for in this regard, and private contractors, generally speaking, do deal through their shipping agents to ensure that both sewage treated on board vessels and untreated sewage can be disposed of through shore facilities. Australia has done well both through the commercial community and through government regulation in dealing with this important problem of disposal of onboard sewage.</para><para>Linked to the proposed amendments to the legislation, which I welcome, are a number of provisions which have the effect of conferring or transferring power to AMSA—the Australian Maritime Safety Authority—with respect to the regulation of the MARPOL convention, especially with respect to annex IV and sewage type matters, including the issuing of international sewage pollution prevention certificates and their cancellation or surrender in the event that ships fail to comply with the relevant standards. As I have said, this legislation is part of an ongoing program put in place by the government, which last December saw further amendments dealing with, amongst other things, the banning of the disposal at sea of plastics, incinerator ashes from plastic products and other toxic or heavy metal residues that might emanate from ships or from rubbish disposal.</para><para>In that context, it is also significant that on and from 1 November this year, 2003, following the earlier legislation introduced in 2002, the civil liability convention and the fund convention compensation limits will be significantly increased so that they are updated and anybody who is injured or damaged in their property or otherwise through pollution will be properly compensated. These measures illustrate—and I do not wish to go back any further than the two most recent pieces of legislation in this regard—that the government is completely committed to ensuring that our coastal environment is cleaned up and is maintained at an environmental standard insofar as the marine environment is concerned, which is one of the best in the world.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WF6</name.id><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Mossfield)</inline>—Is the honourable member seeking to ask a question?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WF6</name.id><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Danby</name></talker><para>—I am.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Will the honourable member for Wentworth allow the question?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name></talker><para>—I will allow a question under rule 84A for Mr Danby—in his case, with some pleasure.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WF6</name.id><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Danby</name></talker><para>—I thank the member for Wentworth. I wonder what you think about Labor's proposed amendment and other amendments from the Labor Party dealing with matters of environmental pollution and concern arising more out of foreign ships and the dramatic increase in the single-voyage permits of some of these ships that have been described as ships of shame and the environmental problems that may arise from them.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name></talker><para>—I am very glad that the member for Melbourne Ports asked that question, because that gives me an opportunity to say a few words about the proposed amendment put forward by the member for McMillan. From the look of it, it seems to have been drafted in a hurry and seems to suggest that the member for McMillan, if he did draft it himself—unless someone from the leader's office gave it to him—really did not know what he was doing. That is typical of the opposition in relation to matters of shipping policy in this country.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The first paragraph of the opposition's proposed amendment suggests that the House should be `of the opinion that Australia needs an efficient, viable and effective fleet to reduce the risk of our marine environment' et cetera. I suspect what was really being proposed was that steps need to be taken to ensure that risks to our marine environment need to be addressed by proper measures. But that is not what the proposal says in its terms—indeed, it is almost nonsensical. I suspect that what the opposition was really aiming at was to suggest that Australia does not have a proper shipping policy—that there is, as the member for McMillan suggested, a balaclava approach to Australia's shipping policy, a bias against local industry and a paralysis.</para><para>The first suggestion made by the member for McMillan in that regard was that the system of cabotage, which he inferred had been introduced by this government, was in some way responsible for this shipping paralysis. Nothing could be further from the truth. The coastal licence provisions contained in part VI of the Navigation Act 1912 provide an appropriate balance between the interests of ship operators and shippers and have remained unchanged for the past 25 years. They were put in place during Labor's term of government. For the member for McMillan to suggest that this in some way has led to a policy paralysis in relation to shipping is complete nonsense.</para><para>What has happened is that the provisions that were put in place and operated as such by Labor have continued to be operated by the minister. That is done in a way which ensures that foreign ships are permitted to carry coastal cargoes only in circumstances where Australian licensed vessels are not available. It is the usual practice for foreign vessels to carry coastal cargo as part of an international cargo. There are some circumstances where foreign ships remain on the coast for an extended period under a single or continuing voyage permit, but they do so only in instances where Australian operators of licensed vessels have indicated that their vessels are not available to carry the cargoes. It really is nonsense for the member for McMillan to assert, as he did, that there is some sort of policy vacuum when the policy underpinning the legislation was introduced and supported by the Labor Party when it was last in government.</para><para>So far as the environment is concerned, Australia has a rigorous ship inspection program aimed at ensuring that all vessels visiting Australian ports meet international standards of ship safety and environmental protection. Indeed, AMSA requires all foreign flag vessels to be eligible for inspection under port state control arrangements. I have had some experience with port state control arrangements, and they are an important protection for our marine environment.</para><para>With respect to shipping standards, we have heard about Mr Peter Morris and Mr John Sharp coming up with a report about the future of the Australian shipping industry. Let me say this about shipping standards. When Mr Morris wrote his report <inline font-style="italic">Ships of shame</inline>, it is true that detention rates for ships coming into Australia were in the region of 8.5 per cent—or 248 of some 2,900 ships—in those years. But that is not the case now. In 2001 only 127 vessels were detained under the ship detention regime in respect of substandard vessels. In other words, the standard of foreign vessels visiting Australia has significantly increased as a result of the policies of the government and the more rigorous inspection regimes that have been put in place. I suspect that what the member for McMillan is really talking about is an agenda that has been fostered by the MUA, which he comes into this place to put before the parliament as a comprehensive and appropriate legislative program. It is nothing of the sort. It is the direct interest program of the MUA.</para><para>What I suggest to people such as Mr Morris and others who have a direct and proper interest in a healthy shipping industry in this country is that they move on from the <inline font-style="italic">Ships of shame</inline> report. It is time that the tired clichés and abject criticisms of the international shipping industry were put behind us by those commentators and by the union. It is time that they started working with the international industry. It is time Australia became truly competitive with international industry, as it is in other areas. Since the Howard government came to office in 1996, this country has embraced change through globalisation. The one area where industry has not embraced it, but has rather sought to go around it, is the shipping industry.</para><para>I will be saying something about that later this year at an important conference: the Ausmarine East conference. It is being organised by the Asia-Pacific office of Baird Publications and will be held in Brisbane at the convention centre on 28 October this year. I would encourage anybody interested in the shipping industry and the future of that industry in this country to attend that convention. As those who have attended the Ausmarine West conference and other conferences of that type in the past know, they really do set a very high standard. Ship operators, shipowners and others interested in good outcomes from the shipping industry in this country realise and understand that this conference will be a highly informative event for everybody involved.</para><para>Subject to that little announcement and promotion of the shipping industry, and taking into account the totally misguided comments of the member for McMillan and his inappropriately worded proposal, I would endorse the amendments that have been put before the House. I would say to the House and to those in the shipping industry who are interested in these matters that this legislation is yet further evidence that the government is committed to a clean marine environment in this country. It is an important consideration, but the government is also committed to a strong shipping industry. We have to work with the shipping industry, we have to work with the unions and we have to work with owners and operators. In that way, we will ensure that Australia's contribution to the broader economy—especially the economy in invisibles in the area of shipping—remains strong and indeed returns to the halcyon days of the 19th century, when the Australian home-grown industry was one of the strongest in the world with regard to the size of the economy. I support the legislation and endorse the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>15524</page.no><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GRIERSON</name><name.id>00AMP</name.id><electorate>Newcastle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in support of the <inline ref="R1760">Maritime Legislation Amendment (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Bill 2003</inline>. This bill seeks to amend two Commonwealth acts, the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 and the Navigation Act 1912. The purpose of this bill is to align Australia's legislation for the prevention and management of pollution from ships with the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, commonly referred to as MARPOL. Australia is a party to the international convention, the MARPOL convention. As is too often the case, MARPOL was an international agreement that arose from a major disaster. The real challenge for governments is to put in place proactive legislation that prevents disasters from occurring. With MARPOL, the disastrous event was the grounding of the <inline font-style="italic">Torrey Canyon </inline>oil tanker in the English Channel in the late 1960s. That accident resulted in the spillage of her entire cargo, 120,000 tons of crude oil, into the sea, causing massive environmental damage. </para></talk.start><para>MARPOL was developed by the International Maritime Organisation, of which Australia is a founding member, and it includes six technical annexes, each dealing with a different form of marine pollution. Australia has already implemented annexes of the convention dealing with the prevention of pollution by the discharge of oil, chemicals, harmful packaged substances and garbage from ships. This current bill relates to annex IV, which deals with ship-based sewage. In March 2000, the IMO reached agreement on changes to annex IV that have resulted in a sufficient number of countries ratifying this particular annex, which will come into force internationally in September 2003. Under the changes, annex IV now applies only to ships of certain tonnages travelling on international voyages. Specifically, it applies to new ships of 400 gross tonnage and above, and new ships of less than 400 gross tonnage certified to carry more than 15 persons. For existing ships within these limits, it will apply five years after the date of the annex's international entry into force—not until September 2008. </para><para>Over 3,000 international trading ships visited Australian ports in 1999-2000. These range from large cruise liners that can discharge approximately 100,000 litres of sewage per day, to bulk carrier vessels such as the coal ships that dominate shipping in my electorate of Newcastle, which might only discharge approximately 300 litres per day. As is understood by most seaside communities, such sewage, if discharged too near to land, can have a major impact on coastal water quality. Sewage released into the sea promotes elevated levels of nutrients which contribute to algal blooms, blocking light from the ocean floor and affecting the growth of natural seagrasses. Oxygen depletion from sewage breakdown also removes the oxygen required by fish and other marine life to breathe and flourish.  </para><para>If you asked east coast dwellers who frequent our beaches if algal bloom seems to be increasing, they would tell you they do have that impression. In my own case, the beaches of Newcastle and Port Stephens have been leisure spots for me and my family for many decades. I note some real concerns as development and population increase along our beaches and as shipping vessels become larger and more frequent visitors. </para><para>Under annex IV, the discharges of sewage from ships on international voyages will be restricted so that untreated sewage may only be discharged at a distance of more than 12 nautical miles from the nearest land, provided that sewage held in holding tanks is not discharged instantaneously but at a moderate rate when the ship is proceeding at a speed of not less than four knots. It will be restricted so that disinfected sewage may only be discharged at a distance of more than three nautical miles from the nearest land, provided that the system meets technical standards set by the IMO. Also, effluent from an IMO approved sewage treatment plant may be now discharged under this legislation at any location, provided that the effluent does not produce visible floating solids nor cause discolouration of the surrounding water.</para><para>The bill will also allow Australia to implement the full range of enforcement measures available under MARPOL, including regular inspections to ensure compliance and boarding of suspect vessels to obtain evidence of possible violations. Annex IV also places an obligation on Australia to ensure that ports provide facilities adequate to meet the demand for the reception of sewage from international trading vessels if they cannot properly discharge it at sea within the restrictions mentioned above. In almost all Australian ports where there is a demand for such facilities, this obligation is met through the use of private contractors dealing directly with ships through shipping agents. The bill also removes the need for ministerial approval in some operational matters such as the issuing of an International Sewage Pollution Certificate and gives this power to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.</para><para>The main interest of this bill to ordinary Australians is its significance in protecting Australia's marine environment and the effectiveness of this government in enforcing such legislation in regard to ships visiting our shores and ports. Given the Howard government's anti-Australian shipping policies, any legislation regarding shipping has to effectively cover the worst flag of convenience ships and the ships of shame that are still found on the Australian shipping scene; so the assessment and application of this bill must be rigorous. My interest in this bill on behalf of the people of my electorate in Newcastle is to ensure that these measures give sufficient protection to our port and to those living on the coast.</para><para>We are an island nation and we very much depend on our shipping industry. That cannot be any more strongly felt than in the port of Newcastle, where we have known incidents in which pollution has fouled our waters. In September 1997 a mysterious oil slick blackened hundreds of metres of the beach in front of the township of Stockton. It was said to be highly likely that the slick came from an oil tanker well out to sea cleaning its tanks while travelling. Fortunately, following that spill, plans aiming to provide an effective system for reporting, assessing and responding to marine pollution spills and to ensure that district and state resources are integrated in a way that minimises impacts and confusion were implemented by the New South Wales state government.</para><para>The Newcastle Port Corporation now retains responsibility for the assessment of, and response to, marine oil spills along the entire mid-North Coast but it also plays an important role with regard to other pollution from ships. Under the Port Safety Operating Licence, the port corporation has to facilitate the removal of wastes, fuel, sewage and any other discharge from shipping from the Queensland border to Catherine Hill Bay south of Newcastle. This usually involves the ship hiring a contractor who brings a pump-out truck to the ship. The port corporation then does an inspection and issues a permit, and audits also occur.</para><para>This is particularly relevant to us because, over the past year, the port of Newcastle has hosted two cruise ships as well as several naval vessels in addition to the daily coal fleet. This legislation supports the measures that the port corporation are taking and strengthens the powers of our local Australian Maritime Safety Authority to enforce and regulate pollution management and prevention. I am pleased to report to the chamber the excellent performance of the port corporation in this regard and draw attention to the exemplary cooperation that exists with AMSA, and indeed all port users in the port of Newcastle. This was the situation when the cruise ships I spoke about were in the port of Newcastle and it is the situation for the berthing of naval and merchant ships.</para><para>I take this opportunity to acknowledge the Cruise Hunter project, which is coordinated by the Hunter Economic Development Corporation. The Hunter Area Consultative Committee and the HEDC funded a study into our region identifying infrastructure and tourism needs to target cruise and Navy ships. It has been a very successful venture so far. The MV <inline font-style="italic">Europa</inline>, the world's most luxurious cruise ship, visited the port of Newcastle on Friday, 24 January this year. The captain, Hagen Damaschke, stated, `The Hunter welcome was unbelievable and this is the best port we have ever visited.' At the time, thousands of residents lined the foreshore to greet the ship, which was carrying 170 passengers and 300 crew. Those passengers then took part in shore excursions across the region, and the <inline font-style="italic">Europa </inline>captain recommended that the cruise operator include Newcastle in future itineraries for its other ships.</para><para>A similar result was achieved in relation to the recent visit of the cruise ship the<inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">World</inline> to the port of Newcastle. I register my appreciation to the Honeysuckle Development Corporation, the Newcastle Port Corporation and Newcastle City Council, as well as 40 volunteers from the community, who assisted these very successful visits. In the port of Newcastle we have also recently hosted visits by two warships, one American and one Australian. These visits were a major boost for the local economy. More than half a million dollars is estimated to have flowed into the local economy over the five days of the simultaneous visits, with restaurants, hotels and all manner of retail and accommodation providers benefiting.</para><para>The benefits of visits like this demonstrate the value of the tourist niche market open to Newcastle, where we have a deepwater port, a fun and exciting city, and a range of attractions to suit many tastes. The Cruise Hunter project is supported by Newcastle City Council and the Hunter Economic Development Corporation, and has also received funding from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and some facilitation by the Hunter Area Consultative Committee. The Cruise Hunter project is aiming for at least five visits a year, representing many millions to local tourist operators. I congratulate them on this initiative and encourage the Honeysuckle Development Corporation to take the success of this venture into account when planning further harbourside developments.</para><para>Obviously, legislation like that before the chamber today is important to ports like Newcastle taking on new ventures and initiatives to attract more cruise ships and naval vessels. Fortunately, in the port of Newcastle we are proactive with regard to the monitoring and regulation of maritime safety and preventing pollution from ships. Striving for high standards is fine, as long as the government departments and minister responsible have the same desire for high standards. But I remind the chamber of the 1992 <inline font-style="italic">Ships of shame</inline> report and its sequel of 1995, which drew attention to the lack of statistical safety data collection in Australia. The reports reinforce concerns held by me and my opposition colleagues that the government's failure to protect the Australian shipping industry puts our ports and those who work in them at risk. I praise the continuing and determined efforts of the Maritime Union of Australia and the International Transport Workers Federation to keep our ports safe.</para><para>The <inline ref="R1760">Maritime Legislation Amendment (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Bill 2003</inline> will need to be enforced. Having visited a flag of convenience ship in my port, I have serious concerns about the willingness of some operators and that of the officers of some ships to fully commit to international or Australian safety and pollution laws. Flags of convenience ships are notorious for being unsafe. Crews are often untrained and are put to work in the most hostile of environments on ships that frequently are in very poor condition. There is no doubt that flags of convenience ships are the scourge of the international maritime industry. At a time when the USA is moving towards outlawing them, it is alarming that the Australian government has adopted the opposite agenda—driven, perhaps, by its obsessive determination to destroy the maritime unions.</para><para>The battle is ongoing to save our Australian shipping industry, which is not helped by the destructive policies of this government. Therefore, I condemn the Minister for Transport and Regional Services for failing to protect or promote the Australian shipping industry. The Australian people are also becoming very concerned about the ability of government regulators to get it right. I cite the HIH and One.Tel collapses and the Pan Pharmaceuticals fiasco. So, whilst the legislation before us seems straightforward, it can only be as effective as the government's attention and the resources it makes available to regulators to enforce and implement it. With those points made, I support the amendments to the motion for the second reading that were moved by the member for McMillan. They began:</para><quote><para>Whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:</para><para>(1) is of the opinion that Australia needs an efficient, viable and effective fleet to reduce the risk of our marine environment, defence readiness, maritime and port security.</para></quote><para>That amendment also condemns the government for its total lack of interest in the future of the Australian shipping industry and calls on the government to develop policy to level the playing field for the Australian industry to ensure it can be saved as an efficient, viable and effective fleet. Newcastle has a proud history of shipbuilding, and the industry is at serious risk at the moment. Fortunately, though, the safety record of our port—managed by the Newcastle Port Corporation in excellent cooperation with port users and workers and unions—is outstanding. This is not matched by the safety record of the shipping industry in Australia. I support the <inline ref="R1760">Maritime Legislation Amendment (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Bill 2003</inline> and the amendment moved by the member for McMillan.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>15527</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It gives me great pleasure to speak on the <inline ref="R1760">Maritime Legislation Amendment (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Bill 2003</inline>. It gives me pleasure because I rise to speak wearing two different hats and carrying two different interests. The first is as the representative of the area of Flinders and the second is as a student of environmental history. I will turn to the first of those. I come from a coastal seat. I grew up on the Mornington Peninsula and I travelled as I was growing up throughout the Port Phillip and Westernport areas. With the extraordinary expanse of coastline, both of these areas run the risk of fouling by discharge from ships, whether they be cargo ships, container ships, bulk goods ships or cruise ships. So this legislation directly addresses a concern which has been a reality.</para></talk.start><para>Only last year we saw an environmental catastrophe which has not received the coverage it deserved. A great number of the colony of penguins on Phillip Island were killed as a result of discharge from a ship passing through Bass Strait. That is something which had a direct, practical and real effect on the lives of people who depend upon the tourism industry and on the ecology of the area. This bill is not about a theoretical situation; it is about a reality. Neither is it the final word. It is a step along the way to protecting our oceans, our coastlines and our marine ecology. It is a step—a positive and important step—but it is not the final step. There is much still to go.</para><para>I now turn to the second perspective from which I view this legislation: as a student of environmental history. If you read Rachel Carson's <inline font-style="italic">Silent Spring</inline> and Garrett Harding's <inline font-style="italic">Tragedy of the Commons</inline>—two seminal texts which focus on the collective failures which result when we do not cooperate on environmental issues—you will realise that these failures of cooperation build a significant problem, not just for us but, most importantly, for future generations. The actions we take in long-leading environmental issues have an impact on our children, our grandchildren and the generations beyond them. Let me give you an example from my own area. At Westernport, which takes in the coastline from Flinders to Somers, Balnarring, Hastings, Koo Wee Rup, all the way around to Phillip Island—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN3</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Brendan O'Connor</name></talker><para>—It is a lovely area.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMV</name.id><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name></talker><para>—It is a beautiful area. It is also an area with a significant problem, and it is a problem bequeathed by previous generations. It has run-off from the catchment areas and run-off of agricultural products, and we have failed collectively to take action. The result is that there is significant silting, overly high levels of nutrients and, as a result of that, death of the seagrass. The seagrass dies, firstly, as the nutrient levels are out of balance and, secondly, as the silting smothers it. As the seagrass dies, so goes the marine ecology. The result is twofold: we lose a natural environment and a natural heritage and we also lose the economic impact from tourism and from fishing. The capacity to fish is dramatically decreased by the damage that we have done.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I view this both as a local representative and as a student of environmental history. This bill implements one of the important acts of international cooperation on the environmental stage. We work towards a common set of international standards, though not to a lowest common denominator. We work towards a common set of international standards which help across the range of environmental activities. In addressing the bill, I will speak briefly about three things: its background, its importance and its implications for the protection of Western Port, Port Phillip, the Mornington Peninsula and the Bass Coast. Regarding the bill's background, the bill is designed to achieve three things: to protect waters from pollution by the discharge of sewage from ships, to meet new international maritime environmental standards and to improve the administration of maritime environmental compliance. </para><para>How does the bill work? Through the bill, Australia will implement annex 4 of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, which is otherwise known as MARPOL Convention 73/78. Significantly, the convention is already in force in 103 countries. In 2000, the International Maritime Organisation amended annex IV of the MARPOL convention to address concerns from some countries that had delayed its acceptance. That means that these laws which apply to the discharge of sewage from shipping apply to ships of over 400 gross tonnes that are on international voyages in international waters and new ships of less than 400 gross tonnes which are certified to carry more than 15 people. Those are the steps. I say that there is more to go. We have to push beyond the boundaries enshrined in MARPOL. We have to push for a much more rigorous approach to sewage discharge. But the bill is about continuing to implement laws in accordance with the conventions of the IMO. </para><para>Moving forward, we see that it has importance in a series of ways. Effectively, it achieves four outcomes. It helps to protect Australia's natural marine environments. In particular, it will give additional protection to the Great Barrier Reef. As the member for Newcastle discussed, and as we see in Western Port within my own electorate of Flinders, marine sewage can be the cause of a series of environmental problems. The sewage from the ships can have an impact on the quality of a marine environment through the level of nutrients. This can cause algal blooms that disturb the growth of seagrass. Algal blooms can also block sunlight and, when the algal blooms begin to spread, they consume the oxygen within the water, which again harms marine life. Together, all of these effects which can come from the large-scale dumping of sewage, whether from ships or shore, create a huge problem. </para><para>This leads to a second important development. In addition to the protection of the marine environment, the bill protects and enhances human health. Safer sewage disposal is something which is a concern in all Australian states. It has an impact on our beaches. If there is any doubt about this, we saw this with the destruction of part of the penguin colony at Phillip Island. It is real, practical and tangible. We see the results where these problems go unchecked.</para><para>The third important step forward is that the bill demonstrates the Australian government's commitment, through the Prime Minister, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, to international cooperation on maritime environmental issues. That is a tremendously important role for Australia, given that Australia is a coastal nation with an extraordinary length of coastline exposed to the flow of discharge from ships. As I said at the very outset, unless we cooperate internationally, we simply cannot act alone and hope that we will be protected. </para><para>The fourth important development is that the proposed amendments will contribute towards a streamlined national approach to environmental maritime legislation. Without a national approach in the future, the states and the Northern Territory may potentially develop different legislation from one another. This creates extraordinary difficulty for shipping; it creates the potential for weak links in the chain. Without a national approach, we risk some areas of our coastline being affected.</para><para>I said at the outset that I would also address how this bill fits in with the protection of Western Port, which is in my area. I have been arguing elsewhere that it is time to develop a `save Western Port' strategy. For the reasons outlined before, Western Port is suffering from severe environmental degradation. There are three causes. Firstly, there is the unchecked run-off from agricultural lands. That can be addressed without harming the farmers. Around the world there are programs dealing with that. There was the Western Port catchment management authority, but that was abandoned by the Victorian government. It should be reinstituted in a modern form to address that region as a whole. Secondly, there is land based outfall. The Gunnamatta outfall at Boags Rocks on the Mornington Peninsula discharges 420 million litres of secondary stage sewage every day. That is simply unacceptable. I am seeking to compel the state government to work towards a program of closure by the year 2025 for zero outfall through a process of reuse and recycling, which has been achieved in many other parts of the world. We can do it. The arguments against it are simply not substantial. </para><para>The third area of protection for Western Port is in those provisions outlined in this bill—that is, we protect against the run-off and the land based sewage and by this against threats from the sea. Ultimately, against that background, because of its practical and international impact, I am delighted to support and commend to the House the <inline ref="R1760">Maritime Legislation Amendment (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Bill 2003</inline>.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>15530</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran, as always it is a pleasure to speak when you are in the chair. In this parliament, I represent an electorate with a proud maritime history. The electorate of Shortland has an extensive coastline and its constituents recognise the importance of it being pollution free. It is an electorate with golden beaches and a pristine coastline that is closely linked to our heritage and very important to Australia as a whole. The <inline ref="R1760">Maritime Legislation Amendment (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Bill 2003</inline> will lead to the protection of that pristine coastline in my electorate. However, I believe that other initiatives of this government, particularly in the area of the maritime industry, will jeopardise that; but I will concentrate on those a little later. </para></talk.start><para>The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, known as annex IV of MARPOL 73/78: Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Sewage from Ships, and the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Act 1986 need to be given effect so that we can be party to the convention. MARPOL was actually agreed to in the time of my predecessor, Peter Morris. I see that representatives of the department and the minister's office are acknowledging that. He is a person who put in a lot of work in this area and who has been very dedicated to the maritime industry and the shipping industry. I will touch on that a little more as I proceed with this speech. The provisions relating to annex IV have not yet been proclaimed. It is great to see that they are finally coming to this parliament. We on this side of the House are going to be supporting this legislation.</para><para>The nature of the amendments is fairly technical, reflecting the number of the regulations contained in the annex. The thing in those amendments that I would like to highlight is the way this will impact on our environment and what it means for Australia. It relates to the provision of new power for the survey authorities to issue international sewage pollution prevention certificates; it amends the name of the international sewage pollution prevention certificate; it reflects additional requirements set out in the revised annex IV, including conditions whereby a ship will be maintained in order to conform with the provisions; and it also sets out where and when ships can discharge sewage, untreated, disinfected and fully treated. It had in place a four-nautical-mile limit where no disinfected sewage could be discharged, and this was initially a barrier to the ratification of annex IV. The four-nautical-mile limit was one barrier to the necessary level of support. While there is a reduction, it is only a nominal one. That comes into effect as the distance from the shore that dumping of treated sewerage can take place. The Queensland Minister for Transport, I notice, has expressed no concern about that particular matter.</para><para>As I was saying, the legislation sets out that untreated sewage may only be discharged at a distance of more than 12 nautical miles from the nearest land; that disinfected sewage may only be discharged at a distance of more than three nautical miles—there was an agreement that that would change from four to three—and that effluent from an IMO approved sewage treatment plant may be discharged at any location, providing the effluent does not produce visible floating solids and does not cause discolouration of the water. This legislation puts in place something that we in this parliament should be supporting.</para><para>I mentioned my predecessor, the previous member for Shortland, Peter Morris. In doing so, I said that he has made numerous contributions in this area of protecting the coastline and protecting shipping. He was involved with the report <inline font-style="italic">Ships of shame</inline>, which I notice was mentioned by the member for Newcastle—and I am sure many other members have mentioned it—and which identified some of the real problems in the maritime industry. He then went on to be involved in an international report by an international commission on shipping, ICONS. They put together a report called <inline font-style="italic">Ships, slaves and competition</inline>. Once again, it identified many of the problems that are facing the maritime industry worldwide. </para><para>There is currently another review taking place, the independent review of Australian shipping—IRAS. The interesting thing about it is that two former transport ministers—former Minister Sharp and former Minister Morris—are chairing that inquiry, and it is my understanding that they will be in this parliament building next week. The Hon. Peter Morris has emphasised time and time again to me the importance of protecting our environment and ensuring that ships that operate in our coastal waters are safe and that they are crewed by suitably trained and experienced crews. We are an island nation; we have got to transport goods long distances and the sea provides a road just like the roads that traverse our land. It is really important that we protect our sea roads, and in doing that it is important to protect our environment. This legislation puts in place a protocol to do that.</para><para>But what concerns me is that unfortunately proper surveillance is not in place; we do not have the proper resources to ensure that this actually happens. We all know that while annex VI of MARPOL deals with the dumping of oil at sea, it still happens and we are not able to determine which ship dumped that oil. That is because the protocols that were in place to test and record the oil of all ships so you would be able to identify which ship actually dumped that oil have been removed, and also we do not have enough people to actually enforce these annexes. This lack of resources has the potential to undermine this very important legislation that is before us today. Unless the government acts to deal with that issue, it will be culpable for the damage that can be wreaked on the Australian coastline and coastal environment. That is a very important message for the government to take on board: to ensure that there are proper resources to actually police this annex once it comes into being. This is something that, as all speakers on this side of the chamber have said, it is important for us to support because it is about ensuring that our coastline is protected. It disappoints me that it has taken so long—I think it was 1985 when the Hon. Peter Morris was the minister dealing with this—although I know there have been some problems from an overseas point of view as well as a little bit of tardiness on behalf of the government.</para><para>The government's shipping policy unfortunately has been driven by its ideological hatred of the Maritime Union, and this has been one of the things that has underpinned all the changes and all the legislation generally that this government has brought in, although I am not referring to this piece of legislation. The Howard government is more interested in creating profit for people who are involved in the shipping industry than protecting the jobs of all those Australian maritime workers. It is determined to destroy the Maritime Union and, in destroying the union, it has actually led to the destruction of our Australian shipping industry—an industry that employs many people in our country and an industry that is of vital importance to this country. It is not only the shipping of goods around Australia; there are also numerous onshore employment benefits that involve insurance, lawyers, managers—it creates all these different jobs within Australia.</para><para>So I think that the government is being short-sighted in focusing just on the union. Issuing continuous voyage permits and single voyage permits to flag of convenience ships has really jeopardised Australian jobs. It has seen the end of many Australian jobs and it has also had an enormous impact on the environment. In my own electorate we had the MV <inline font-style="italic">Wallarah</inline> that was taking coal from Newcastle and had been operating since 1873. It had the effect of keeping 200 coal trucks off the road. The MV <inline font-style="italic">Wallarah</inline> is no longer operating there. There are 200 coal trucks on the road going between Catherine Hill Bay and the coal loader in Newcastle. That is having an impact on other transport infrastructure. That ship, which was purpose-built to carry the coal to Newcastle, is now owned and flagged in Tonga. The people of my electorate that had jobs on that ship no longer have their jobs. It is crewed by Tongans and it is now called the <inline font-style="italic">Ikuna</inline>. It is still operating within Australia carrying wheat around the Australian coastline. I feel this is really sad, because people in my area who are good, hard-working, skilled people are now unemployed. I really think that some of the actions of this government, particularly in this area, have had enormous implications for the shipping industry and for Australians. </para><para>Earlier this year I was talking about flag of convenience ships—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Corcoran, Ann (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Ms Corcoran)</inline>—Is the member for Flinders seeking to ask a question?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMV</name.id><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hunt</name></talker><para>—Yes.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Is the member speaking prepared to answer a question?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83N</name.id><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name></talker><para>—No, simply because I do not have enough time. If I were given an extension of time I would answer your question, but I know I will not be. Earlier this year I went aboard the <inline font-style="italic">Angel III</inline>, a Greek ship sailing under the Maltese flag which was crewed by Burmese people. The only two people on the ship who were Greek were the captain and the first officer. We were not allowed into any of the quarters where the crew lived. The crew appeared quite frightened. One thing I noticed was that none of the crew could speak English. When I said to the captain, `All the signs are in English,' he said to me, `They can read English; it's an international language.' It was not true. The implication for us here in Australia is that it is creating unsafe conditions. These ships are going round and round our coastline and there is a potential for an enormous environmental disaster. The government needs to thinks very carefully about what has happened in the area of shipping, because the consequences can be enormous.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I will mention the Great Barrier Reef and the potential for a disaster there. I have some figures that I wish to quote. On the <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> program of Thursday, 21 November 2002 at 6.35, Mark Colvin said:</para><quote><para>In the past seven years there have been around 35 collisions and groundings of more than 50 large commercial ships in the Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait waters.</para></quote><para>Since 1995 there were the <inline font-style="italic">Corolla</inline>, which is a German ship, a Danish ship, a Panamanian ship, an Egyptian ship, an Indian ship, a Singaporean ship and a Malaysian ship. It is interesting to see the variety of countries that these ships came from. I will leave my comments on that particular aspect there.</para><para>I would like to take a bit of licence now and refer to something else. As I mentioned earlier, Shortland is a coastal electorate. We have one of the most accessible lighthouses on the eastern coast of Australia—the Norah Head lighthouse—and 15 November this year will be the centenary of the commencement of operations of that lighthouse. The trust<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>is arranging a program of celebrations leading up to that centenary day. I am writing to the minister at the moment asking him to facilitate an RAAF fly-by on that day. I am putting that on notice here in the parliament. It is a very important area as far as the RAAF is concerned. Nearby Bird Island was used for bombing practice in the 1940s, and the MV <inline font-style="italic">Nimbin</inline> was struck by a German mine some eight miles off Norah Head. We have a maritime service every year recognising the significance of that area in the maritime history of Australia. The residents of the local community have had a strong association with the operations of the RAAF, shipping and the defence of Australia. I want to put on the record how important it is to the people of the area I represent that the government assist with this and provide that service.</para><para>In conclusion, I return to the legislation and say yes, it is about time annex IV was ratified by the parliament. It is important that it become part of the legislation of this parliament. We need to remember that Australia needs a viable and vibrant shipping industry and at the same time we need to ensure the protection of our environment. I believe that many of the changes that have been brought in by this government have led to situations that endanger our environment and have most certainly undermined the shipping industry.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>15533</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McGAURAN</name><name.id>XH4</name.id><electorate>Gippsland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Science</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank members who have contributed to this debate on the <inline ref="R1760">Maritime Legislation Amendment (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Bill 2003</inline> and especially note the very constructive and thoughtful contributions by the members for Wentworth and Flinders, both of whom understand the importance of this reformist legislation aimed at further protecting our marine environment.

Somewhat eerily, later on Monday—perhaps in reply to my plea, but overtly in response to a question from the member for Barker—the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations said in the House:</para><quote><para>... let me say that this is a government which encourages employing people, not retrenching people. This is a government which wants people to earn more and to keep their jobs rather than to lose their jobs.</para></quote><para>This could not be further from what actually occurs out there in the real world under the Howard government's policies—the policies driven so hard and obsessively by Minister Abbott. The real world is the world of 23 workers from Blue Ribbon, locked out and prevented from doing what the minister claims his government is all about: workers earning more and keeping their jobs. I will inform the committee about the stories of just three of these 23 workers.</para><para>One worker has been with Blue Ribbon for 28 years—a loyal and dedicated employee. He recently became the primary carer for his mother and father, and he has moved them into his home rather than place them in an aged care facility. His father is 80 years old and has cancer, and his mother is also very ill. Another worker is 62 years of age and has worked at Blue Ribbon, mainly in a supervisory role, for 32 years. During that time, he has never taken part in industrial action. He has raised five sons, but he has never earned enough to have anything left for a nest egg. The third worker is a much younger man. He is 35 years of age and has six children. He did exactly what the government has always asked of people. He moved from New South Wales to Tasmania for better employment and other opportunities for his family. He moved to where he could find work. He rode a pushbike to work every day, and he only got a licence and a car when he got a full-time job. He was the very model of responsibility.</para><para>These men and women do not earn a packet. We are talking about real battlers. Many people on the other side have probably never met one, but real battlers do not do it too well. These low-paid workers earn around $23,000 a year on average, and the maximum that any of them would earn in a year is $25,000. That is less than the Prime Minister is known to pay for accommodation in Rome for four nights. These are good, honest Australians who have done absolutely nothing wrong. They turn up for work every day but are refused the opportunity because they do not believe they should have to sign the oppressive contract that the new employer at the site has provided to them. Aided and abetted by the minister and the rest of the Howard government, the company offers them no choice. If they want to want to keep their jobs, they have to sign a contract which includes in its provisions the following:</para><quote><para>I acknowledge and agree that there is no relationship of employee/employer.</para><para>I agree that payment will be on the basis of either an agreed amount per hour for actual on site hours, or fixed job price to be agreed.</para><para>I agree I have no claims in respect of holiday pay, long service leave, sick pay, any similar payment or other leave entitlements.</para></quote><para>And so on and so forth. To see what would happen if they sign, we only have to look as far as those who, in absolute desperation, did succumb. They have been offered a day rate of $125. To date, this has been applied by the company in such a way that those workers have been paid $125 a day whether they have worked nine hours in that day, 11 hours in that day or, extraordinarily on one occasion, 19 hours in one day. This government has created a window of opportunity for some employers to do whatever they want, carte blanche to take profit at any cost, the green light to treat honest workers with contempt. In complete contrast to what the minister has said, this is not a government which encourages employing people rather than retrenching people. This is not a government which wants people to earn more and keep their jobs rather than lose their jobs. This is a government so ideologically obsessed that it allows honest Australian workers to be treated appallingly and to lose their dignity and livelihoods.</para><para>The locked-out workers at Blue Ribbon deserve much better from our nation's leaders. The time has come for this government to have a good, hard look at what is going on out there in the real world—the world of the low-paid Aussie worker—and admit that its plan is flawed. Let us return to a system in which everyone—employer and employee alike—gets a fair go. The workers are trying to obtain just that. They have been before the state industrial commission and presented their case, but it will be next week at the earliest before the commission reconvenes to hear the employer's side. A final decision looks to be at least another five weeks away. What is all the more devastating for these workers and their families is that today already marks day 57 of this appalling lockout.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</title><page.no>15536</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>15536</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to lend my support, as do many others, to those parties of good faith within the Middle East who are working towards reconciliation between the Israeli and Arab populations. There have been a number of decisively important steps taken over the last two weeks. However, I want to address a broader context first. </para></talk.start><para>The question of terror within the Middle East, which now, through the actions of al-Qaeda, spreads beyond the Middle East, derives its source from three points of origin. Firstly, you have an external genesis. That is that the Middle East conflict between Arabs and Israelis spreads throughout the Middle East. It has an impact of poisoning goodwill, it has an impact on the sense of self and it creates an anger and frustration in people on both sides. Secondly, you have an internal problem within each of the Arab states—states with a rich cultural tradition, although most are new states. The problem here is the lack of a democratic framework. The lack of democratisation through either elections or free speech means there is unresolved frustration and tension. As many authors have noted, this takes the form of seeking an outlet through violent action. Because of the absence of democratic freedoms within the Arab countries, there is a significant problem.</para><para>That leads to the third source of terror: the notion that there are sponsors that are willing to play on this. Firstly we have Syria; secondly, until recently, we had Iraq; and, thirdly, we know that Iran has played a role. In Syria we have a country which is largely unreconstructed. It maintains its links and continues its actions of support for terrorism. That has to cease. In Iraq there has been a change of government and, as the Prime Minister has said, there is a very real chance that the road to peace in the Middle East will start in Baghdad. In Iran we see a country struggling with its history—a country which has competing forces at present between those who are reforming and those who would sponsor terrorism. That battle is a challenging one and one in which we have to support and give courage to those who are working towards having Iran play a constructive role within the world.</para><para>Developments in the Middle East over the last few weeks have been extraordinarily positive in terms of the Arab-Israeli dialogue. On both sides there are people of good faith who need to be encouraged. On the Palestinian side, the new Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas, or Abu Mazen, has already indicated his willingness to adopt the road map for peace. He does this not just at the risk of political vilification but also at the risk of losing his life. This is a man of considerable courage who should be rewarded, recognised and supported for the steps he has taken in moving the peace process forward.</para><para>On the other side, we have also seen a very important development within the Israeli government over the last two weeks. We have a provisional acceptance from Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Prime Minister, of the road map for peace and with that the critical recognition that there must be a two-state solution—a state for Israel behind secure borders with a secure future and recognition and a state for the Palestinian people. I have lived and worked within Israel and Palestine. I have seen the conditions the Palestinian people have endured, and they too deserve their own state and are entitled to and have a right to that. The acceptance by Ariel Sharon of the road map for peace has been an extraordinary step forward, and this in turn has been echoed within the cabinet, which has accepted that road map. </para><para>I commend the Palestinian leadership under Abu Mazen and I commend the Israeli cabinet under Ariel Sharon which has, significantly, taken a great step forward. These are promising steps. My own belief—and it is more than just a hope—is that by 2006 we will have a two-state solution; but in the meantime we need to lend all our support and encouragement to those of good faith on both sides.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Franklin Electorate: Breakfast Clubs</title><page.no>15537</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>15537</page.no><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr QUICK</name><name.id>AV5</name.id><electorate>Franklin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I take this unexpected opportunity to talk about something in my electorate that I am very proud of. Some of the schools in my electorate have introduced breakfast clubs. It is a bit of an indictment on our society when schools and neighbourhood centres in my electorate see a real need to provide breakfast for anything up to 74 children—as in one particular school in my electorate—and not just one day but five days a week. These schools are doing a fantastic job, and it is not just the school children and teachers who are benefiting; the whole community is benefiting from the fact that these children have a solid meal in their stomachs before they commence school. Three of these schools are close to my electorate office and one is in a suburb a bit further away called Risdon Vale. The breakfast club at Risdon Vale has been going for quite a while now—a couple of years—and it is not unusual to see up to 70 young children arriving there on a cold, frosty morning to be served a range of cereals, porridge, orange juice, Milo, and toast with all the accoutrements.</para></talk.start><para>As well as providing breakfast to the children, the adults—there are usually about 20 there—sit down, have breakfast and talk to them about issues. This builds a relationship between adults and young people generally that I think strengthens a community approach. Just recently Herdsman's Cove Primary School, Bridgewater Primary School and Gagebrook Primary School have taken up the challenge set by Risdon Vale Primary School. At first we only had one child in each of the three schools because there was a reluctance to get involved, but now up to 30 children attend. It is wonderful to see the relationship being developed in these three schools between the children, the staff, the parents and the volunteers who assist in that provision of breakfast.</para><para>To their credit, the state Labor government has finally put its money where its mouth is. Initially, neighbourhood houses, involved parents and the Coles supermarket chain provided all the ingredients free of charge. The state government said in its pre-election promises that it would fund this, but there was some indecision about whether it should be through the education department or the Department of Premier and Cabinet. Knowing bureaucracies, it takes a stack of time to get things up and running. But the people in these four communities wanted to have the program up and running from the first day of the first term, to make sure that the kids were in a routine so that when winter came they would have the opportunity to have a wholesome, nourishing breakfast.</para><para>From those initial four schools this project has now moved right through my electorate, and lots of schools now have a breakfast club. At one of the high schools the breakfast club is organised by a church group called Fusion, which is doing a fantastic job. They see the breakfast club at Kingston High School as a way of developing relationships with a lot of kids who are having real hassles not only at school but also in their families and relationships. It is a chance for them to sit down with the kids, have a breakfast, share some thoughts and build some relationships.</para><para>I would like to congratulate all the schools in my electorate that are supporting, fostering and promoting the breakfast clubs. To the mums and dads who find it difficult, for a variety of reasons, to provide their kids with breakfast, I say thank you for sharing your kids with us. Hopefully, some of these parents will get involved in working in the schools and seeing their kids in a different light. So I take this unexpected opportunity to speak for five minutes to thank the people who are involved. They make a wonderful effort, and I commend them for it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Family and Community Services: Custody and Child Support</title><page.no>15538</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>15538</page.no><name role="metadata">Haase, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAASE</name><name.id>84T</name.id><electorate>Kalgoorlie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I stand today to bring to the attention of members the frustration I feel when confronted by a number of parents in my electorate of Kalgoorlie who are struggling with the payment of child support. I have to say that child support is the single most emotive and maddening issue that is repeatedly brought to my attention. People come into my office angry and upset because they cannot see a way forward. They are at the end of their tether, they seem to be obstructed at every turn, and they feel victimised and resentful. Frankly, I do not blame them. I believe the child support system we have in place can be unduly intrusive, unfair and damaging to relationships both new and old. I can see why it is perceived by paying parents to be one-sided. I am not defending those parents who are trying to shirk their responsibilities; those who will go to extremes just to avoid paying up. I am referring to hardworking, non-custodial parents who are happy to pay towards the upkeep of their children but who also have lives of their own to lead.</para></talk.start><para>It is not being selfish or uncaring; it is simply fact: we cannot badger non-custodial parents to the extent that they cannot afford to pay their bills. New relationships break down and children from second relationships suffer. The result is anything but healthy. It seems even more unfair in those cases where the custodial parent refuses to allow contact with the child. How frustrating must that be? You are paying to support a child and you cannot even visit them. I support moves to enforce Family Court orders giving non-custodial parents access to their children just as stringently as the Child Support Agency enforces the collection of child support moneys. We as a government tried in 2001 to pass legislation that would lower the non-custodial parent's child support contribution, scaled on the amount of time they spend with their children. That move was rejected by both Labor and the Democrats in the Senate. </para><para>The building of healthy relationships between children and both parents should be encouraged regardless of the state of the parents' relationship. A child is entitled to the support, love and care of both parents. Just because one parent may not live in the family household does not diminish that right. Both parents have a responsibility, to the best of their capacity, to ensure that all the needs of the child are met so that they thrive, develop and grow into decent, contributing members of the community. But a non-custodial parent's capacity and ability to pay needs to be taken into account, as should the contact—or refusal of contact—with the child. If the child support payable is assessed on the basis of gross income, why can it not be taxed as income for the custodial parent?</para><para>I have a constituent who has contacted me with a scenario where, despite having sole care of his child for two months, he is still forced to pay the mother child support. If the support is intended to be for the child, why should the parent who is caring for and supporting the child in his own home have to pay the other parent? He is being told to pay $1,500 to the child's mother for two months whilst the child was living with him. It seems quite ludicrous to me. Steps must be taken to ensure that equity and fairness are introduced to the child support system. In my electorate we have a highly-paid young male work force, possibly contributing to the fact that child support is a major issue in my electorate. I see the helplessness felt by parents, mostly men, who are not trying to dodge their responsibilities but are merely trying to survive. I feel the frustration of knowing that we as a government continue to try to make changes to the system, try to make it more equitable to all parties, and that these efforts continue to be shunted by the opposition in the Senate.</para><para>The Child Support Agency is enforcing laws that we as a government have tried to change. It is time that the system is changed and that Labor and the Democrats wake up and see the damage they are inflicting by refusing to allow those changes. I remind members opposite that the future of this nation is going to suffer, because the people we are hurting most are the children.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title> Melbourne Ports Electorate: Community Survey</title><page.no>15539</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>15539</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Recently I sent out a community survey to my entire electorate, and some very interesting results were apparent. One of the hundreds of respondents said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>I am particularly concerned about the plight of women who have been bought and sold. This is quite distinct from people-smuggling and asylum seekers. This ubiquitous trade in flesh happens within this country ... Traffickers offer women to brothel owners ... DIMIA bureaucrats do not appear interested and they just deport the women asap so that the traffickers are not charged because of lack of evidence.</para></quote><para>This is a matter which I believe the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs should pay far more attention to. I think the practice of just deporting some of these poor women back to places—particularly in Asia—is not the way it should be looked at by the department of immigration. They should be looking particularly at the people who brought them here and who are exploiting them. I particularly commend the shadow minister for immigration for her activities in highlighting this and putting pressure on the government to act. Another respondent said:</para><quote><para>Doctors and dentists are more and more pulling faces when shown the Veteran's Affair's Gold Card. I was refused treatment by a dentist in Glenhuntly ... as an 80-year-old returned airman with war injuries, this hurts. </para></quote><para>It is disgraceful that veterans who have served Australia are treated in this manner. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs needs to do more about this. I particularly commend the work of Senator Bishop, the Labor spokesman for veterans' affairs, who has been very active in highlighting this.</para><para>`HECS fees are too high. The bulk-billing system must be fixed in an equitable way,' said a man from Balaclava. In Melbourne Ports the rate of bulk-billing has dropped by 12 per cent. Copayments in Melbourne Ports are the third highest in Victoria, at $17.80. With the AMA saying that we are going to have to charge non-concession card holders more, I expect people in Melbourne Ports are going to have to pay even more in their copayments. I think that the two-tier system being introduced by the federal government is the kind of inequitable health system that Australians do not support, and I hope that the federal government will pay a political price for it. Another person in the community survey said:</para><quote><para>As someone involved in teaching at RMIT I'm concerned about the increasing inaccessibility of tertiary education for those who are not affluent. Health is very much an issue—the ever increasing cuts to bulk-billing make access to doctors less realistic for many people.</para></quote><para>Talking about education changes, one of the members of my community in Elwood said that it is `vital to ensure adequate funding for state schools'. Some of the private schools in my electorate have received remarkable increases in funding under this government—one school went from some $4 million to nearly $8 million, a 100 per cent increase. I know that some of the poor parochial schools around there look across their fences and see that one of these schools has rebuilt its fence three times in the last few years. I have seen it too as I drive past it in the electorate. As I said, one school—a category 1 school—has received a 100 per cent increase in federal government funding, from $4 million to $8 million.</para><para>Another problem that people in my electorate have identified is with Centrelink. Centrelink have apparently dropped their numbering system at the reception desk so that when people go to use Centrelink's facilities, as is their right, there are now increasingly angry mobs of people who are not being treated in the dignified way you would expect an Australian federal government bureaucracy to treat people who are Australian citizens. This is not adequate, and I have written to the minister to ask why Centrelink have dropped their procedure of having numbering at the reception desk for people who have appointments. They should go back to the old system. It is, frankly, disgraceful that they are treating people in this way.</para><para>The last of the many concerns that people in my electorate have is about the Kyoto accord. A male constituent from Caulfield wrote to me—I know we are enjoined not to mention individuals by name—and said, `I regard concern for the environment, particularly global warming, as head and shoulders ahead of other problems.' There are many issues regarding the environment, Medicare and higher education that the Leader of the Opposition outlined in his budget address-in-reply, and they are the concerns of the Australian people. <inline font-style="italic">(</inline><inline font-style="italic">Time expired</inline><inline font-style="italic">)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Eden-Monaro Electorate: Bushfire Relief</title><page.no>15541</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>15541</page.no><name role="metadata">Nairn, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NAIRN</name><name.id>OK6</name.id><electorate>Eden-Monaro</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I speak today to highlight some great news for the people of Eden-Monaro, in particular small business operators severely affected by the destructive bushfires earlier this year. Yesterday I joined the Minister for Tourism and Small Business, Joe Hockey, for the announcement of cash grants under the federal government's small business bushfire relief program. Almost half a million dollars will be paid out to 158 small business operators in Eden-Monaro in the coming days. The federal government announced the special cash grants program back in March, after I took Minister Hockey to the Snowy Mountains. The 158 local small business operators will receive up to $3,000 each after putting forward applications last month. I am also extremely pleased to say that every single qualifying applicant from Eden-Monaro has had a grant approved. The federal government actually increased the original $2 million program by nearly half a million dollars to ensure that every eligible business that applied from right around the country will receive a much needed cash boost.</para></talk.start><para>Applications were lodged from a range of businesses from the tourism, retail, service, food, and forestry and logging industries. Many local farmers who suffered stock, fodder and fencing losses were also eligible. The cash grants were in addition to the generous support received by many from people in the community through donation appeals. They were also in addition to other assistance programs and compensation from insurance companies. All of this assistance will help bushfire victims get back on their feet. These cash grants will be crucial for some, as they will allow many Snowy Mountains businesses to get back on their feet just before the busy winter season.</para><para>I was extremely pleased to see that Allan and Jenny from Tinderry Mountain Dried Foods were able to be on hand for the announcement yesterday. They contacted my office seeking help after being forced to shut down their business for a month to fight fires around Michelago. Allan is the local fire captain at Anembo, and Jenny takes care of the communications. This necessary action almost forced them to close their business. But, after substantial hardships, things are on the improve. On top of this, they can now expect $3,000 to be deposited into their bank account within a few days. This will allow staff to be paid and their four-wheel drive to be repaired, which is a must with winter almost here.</para><para>I know that Norm and his father, Peter, at the Cooma Motor Lodge were also recipients of this grant, which they greatly appreciated. Their business virtually stopped overnight at the time of the fires. A big part of their business was coaches coming through the area in January. With the fires blazing in the region, those sorts of tours stopped overnight so their business also stopped. There was virtually no income for that month. Unfortunately, they were not given any of the volunteers who were coming down to fight the fires to stay with them. I do not think that enough was done with respect to making sure that all the businesses got a share of that.</para><para>These grants are another example of how the federal government listens to small business operators and then delivers. The grants total almost half a million dollars in Eden-Monaro and will also provide a great economic boost in towns like Thredbo, Jindabyne and Cooma. It is reasonable to assume that this money will probably change hands locally at least three times.</para><para>I also inform the House today that the Snowy-Monaro Business Enterprise Centre—or BEC, as it is known—recently celebrated its 10th birthday. The federal government has been a major supporter of the Snowy-Monaro BEC over the years. It has in the past provided a $440,000-odd grant to purchase and renovate the former army reserve depot in Cooma that the BEC now calls home. That funding allowed the building to be modified into a modern office complex, providing a valuable resource for the Cooma business community. It has to be said that, because of the BEC's support, many small businesses have not only got off the ground but also gone on to major success.</para><para>In particular, I would like to single out John Mercer, the manager of the BEC, for his continued determined efforts for the area's business operators. The BEC is also now an AusIndustry business partner, which provides clients with direct access to the officials they need to deal with. This is yet another example of how the federal government is helping small business, particularly throughout the regional areas of my electorate.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Personnel</title><page.no>15542</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>15542</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The defence forces, both defence ministers and the Chief of Defence Force often say that the people in Defence are its greatest asset. I want to preface my remarks by again drawing attention to that. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may be aware that the Army has what I understand is called a big wall climbing club and, in recent times, that club has had one death in the United States and three deaths in the Himalayas. It has been recently brought to my attention that the person who died some 2½ years ago in the United States was Sapper Morrison. In situations like that it would be scandalous if we did not try to learn the circumstances of the death and find out whether or not measures could have been taken to prevent it. This would give evidence for the assertion that people are Defence's best asset.</para></talk.start><para>A board of inquiry is set up with specific powers under due authority to investigate such deaths. In relation to Sapper Morrison, the board of inquiry has been going on for some 2½ years. I understand that the cost of the board of inquiry to date is $2 million. I do not quibble about the money. What I do quibble about is the time. I find it utterly outrageous that the widow of Sapper Morrison, herself a serving ADF member, and their two children spent two years before they were informed of the injuries that Sapper Morrison suffered. I think that this is an utter scandal. I call on Minister Vale to take an interest in this case—not to wash her hands and absolve herself but to take an interest in this widow and the two children.</para><para>There have been 18 submissions to the board of inquiry seeking the evidence of eight American eyewitnesses. In the 2½ years of this board of inquiry, there have been 18 submissions to the board pleading for the testimony of eight American eyewitnesses to be heard. I thank the Chief of Army, as I understand he has recently, after refusing to allow the board to go to America, agreed to it going and agreed to a small extension of time.</para><para>Whilst Sapper Morrison is represented at the BOI, as is appropriate, his widow is not. She has no legal representation whatsoever. If this is caring about ADF members and their families, it leaves a lot to be desired. I would say that, other than providing the ADF welfare community worker who is supporting Sapper Morrison's widow, Defence needs to do a lot more to support her. Indeed, an extensive report on military justice recommended just that.</para><para>I am appalled that a board of inquiry about a single death can take 2½ years and still need an extension. I am appalled that fundamental rules like having the presiding officer outrank all other officers are still not being adhered to. This case is an utter disgrace. When the widow seeks an interview with the Vice Chief of the Defence Force, it should be granted. The minister, Minister Vale, should take an active interest in this very sad case and ensure that there is some support for the widow of Sapper Morrison and her two children in coming to grips with the situation and trying to find some closure in relation to this untimely death. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Moncrieff Electorate: Education Funding</title><page.no>15543</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>15543</page.no><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name><name.id>00AN0</name.id><electorate>Moncrieff</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to talk about ways in which the Howard government is achieving good educational outcomes for all children on the Gold Coast as well as for adolescents and tertiary students. The last Howard budget was a budget that delivered in full for areas like the Gold Coast. On a number of occasions, I have mentioned in this chamber and in the main chamber that the Gold Coast faces unique challenges because of its very strong population growth rate—the fastest in the country for the last 35 years, and projected to be the fastest in the country for the next 25. This places a great burden on the infrastructure, in particular the educational infrastructure that is located within Gold Coast city.</para></talk.start><para>I am delighted to stand in this chamber today to highlight ways in which this last budget delivered. I would like to break it down into several categories, principally with regard to and focusing on the secondary and tertiary sectors. If you look at, in particular, the secondary sector, you will see that over the next four years the last budget delivers $30.6 billion in funding for schools. If you break that down further, you will see that it contains, as part of the overall allocation of money, funding of $48.2 million over the next four years for the capital grants program. The capital grants program is a very real way in which the Howard government is funding capital works projects at schools in each member's electorate. I am pleased to highlight two such examples on the Gold Coast. </para><para>The first of those—and this is a recent announcement—is the allocation of additional funding of some $90,000 towards the upgrading of general learning areas at Trinity Lutheran College. I know that Trinity Lutheran College was especially pleased to have this funding allocated to it; it will go a long way to improving facilities for the children there. Likewise, as part of the Special Education—Non-government Centre Support Program, there was some $181,000 provided to the Queensland Society for Crippled Children to assist them with the facilities that they will currently be operating and building in Arundel, a suburb within my electorate. Both of these grants are significant additions to educational infrastructure on the Gold Coast, both for children who are disabled and need to have special opportunities to improve their learning outcomes and for children in mainstream educational paths.</para><para>I am very committed to the local schools and to furthering education on the Gold Coast. I recently took the opportunity to meet with the principal of Benowa State High School, John Milne, and to tour the school. Whilst it is a fantastic school, with a great number of programs in place, it is a school that would benefit more if the Queensland state government actually contributed something more to it. In particular, I was perturbed to notice that a large number of school classrooms did not even have paint on the walls. I question exactly what the Queensland state Labor government's priorities are. That school should stand proud of their fine reputation with regard to, for example, their French immersion class and their arts program. They are two fine ways in which Benowa State High School is leading the charge in terms of quality education for children.</para><para>I recently had the privilege to have the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, in my electorate. I took the opportunity to take the minister to the Southport School—TSS, as it is known. It was important that the minister had an opportunity to view both the public and private schools in my electorate. The visit to TSS was an important one, and certainly highlighted and built on the minister's awareness of exactly what can be achieved with the education of boys. I was delighted, too, as part of that visit, to have the Surfers Paradise Liberal candidate, John-Paul Langbroek, accompany me.</para><para>With regard to educational outcomes for boys, I was pleased to see $20,000 provided—as part of the lighthouse project, stage 1—to the Nerang alliance, an alliance between a number of schools in Moncrieff to help boys achieve maximum learning outcomes.</para><para>With regard to other announcements in the budget regarding the tertiary sector, I was pleased to note in particular that 1,400 new places will be provided to the tertiary education sector on the basis of population growth. I would expect that the lion's share of these places will flow to cities such as the Gold Coast. I am sure that Griffith University, which is doing an excellent job, will stand to reap the benefits of this increased investment in new places. I thought I would highlight this to the House.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>McMillan Electorate</title><page.no>15544</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>15544</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The federal government have behaved in an appalling way towards the community in Korumburra. They have taken a decision to dispose of the Korumburra drill hall and some related property that they own in Korumburra. They have sold the residential property that they owned in Mine Road for $91,000. That was just one two-acre block which no-one in Korumburra particularly cared about. It was their land, and it was fair enough if they wanted to sell it because it was not appropriate for them to hang on to any more. The Korumburra drill hall is another kettle of fish altogether. The argument that the federal government have run out in relation to why they cannot give the Korumburra drill hall to the people of Korumburra is that, they say, it cannot be done by legislation. They maintain that it is impossible for it to be done. This is a complete untruth. This is completely untrue.</para></talk.start><para>I have done some research in relation to this matter and, aside from the very public example of the Prime Minister giving some defence department land to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust—in his own electorate I would point out—there are two other examples which I have come across. The first is the Torrens Parade Ground in Adelaide where around $3 million of federal government money was used to purchase the defence department land and then for it to be handed over to the community. The second is the Fremantle artillery barracks where the federal government have agreed to transfer that land and that site to the Fremantle community for alternative uses. These are two examples of what the federal government say they cannot do for Korumburra. All I would say is that, if it is good enough for them to do it in Sydney, if it is good enough for them to do it in Adelaide and if it is good enough for them to do it in Fremantle, it should be good enough for them to do it for us in Korumburra.</para><para>The people of Korumburra have made a big contribution to the defence of our country over many years. There is a fair bit of evidence that supports the view that some years ago the shire of Korumburra, as it then was, actually granted the land in the first place to a fledgling Commonwealth government to be used for defence purposes. Those records are hard to get hold of nowadays because of council amalgamations and the like, but there is a fair bit of evidence which supports that view.</para><para>I would say to the federal government: act decently in relation to this. You have got precedent here to justify granting this land to the people of Korumburra. It is not a lot of money. It is estimated that the value of the land would be between $50,000 and $100,000. It is not a lot of money to the federal government, which have got a surplus of around $2,000 million; but to the people of Korumburra, it is a lot of money. The government should do the right thing.</para><para>The other issue that I wanted to talk briefly about today was the outrage in the community relating to the Howard government's broken promise on the Pakenham bypass. There has been massive community reaction to the Howard government's broken promise on this issue. I have received a huge response to a letter that I sent to the people of Pakenham in which I asked for their feedback on John Howard reneging on this promise. I have had a massive response and many hundreds of letters have come already in the first day or two. This is a sample of some of the things that people have said in their correspondence to me. From someone in Tynong North:</para><quote><para>This is the fastest growing area in Victoria and deserves to receive the promised funding. </para></quote><para>From someone in Pakenham:</para><quote><para>Mr Howard, why not surprise us all and do something honourable—keep your promise and put up HALF the cost for the Pakenham Bypass before there are more needless accidents.</para></quote><para>Again from someone in Pakenham:</para><quote><para>Honour your Promises. We need to believe in our leaders.</para></quote><para>From someone in Tynong North:</para><quote><para>The Pakenham bypass is long overdue, it was promised by the Liberal Party not only in the 2001 elections but elections previous to that. 50/50 sounds more than fair to us, so we feel that the Howard Government should stop stalling and “Cough up”. </para></quote><para>I think that those sentiments reflect the broad cross-section of opinion in the Pakenham community. There is a massive amount of anger in the Pakenham community about this issue. All that we are asking for in the Pakenham district is that John Howard and the Liberal Party honour the promise that they made to the people of Pakenham. It is not good enough that they think that they can say one thing before the election and when they are in government do something completely different. It is not a lot of money to the Howard government. They have got a surplus of around $2,000 million forecast for this coming financial year. But without that additional $21 million, which the Howard government have to put in, the project will likely stall and that means that there is a great risk of more deaths on that road. All we are asking is that the Howard government honour the promise they made to the people of Pakenham.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Conservation</title><page.no>15545</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>15545</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is perhaps no more dramatic an example of how speedily community attitudes and the responsibilities of government can change within our federal structure than that provided by our approach to the protection of our environment and heritage. It was just over 30 years ago that the Commonwealth took its first steps in the field of environmental conservation with the establishment of a Commonwealth environment office by the Gorton government. Since then the Commonwealth, in line with community expectations, has expanded its powers and involvement in this policy field. It has been a process that has occasionally involved great leaps but predominately has been the gradual accretion of responsibility.</para></talk.start><para>These steps can be traced by the actions of this parliament: the passage of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, the establishment of the Australian Heritage Commission in 1975, the decision to protect the Great Barrier Reef and Fraser Island, and the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983.</para><para>The most significant leap towards a national framework was the product of this government. It was something the WWF described as the biggest win for the environment in 25 years. The passage of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 2001 represented the most comprehensive change in consolidation of the way in which the federal government perceived its role. For the first time, the Commonwealth outlined those matters that it regarded as being of national environmental significance and legislated to provide real teeth for its capacity to act to protect matters within that ambit. Legislation currently before the Senate in relation to a new national heritage regime will add a final weapon to the Commonwealth's armoury in these two areas.</para><para>Side by side with these developments, funding for environment and heritage programs has increased dramatically, most notably as a result of the Natural Heritage Trust. Forty years ago, these developments would have been beyond the imagination of most policy makers. But they have occurred, and they have been of enormous benefit to a unique and diverse environment and our rich heritage.</para><para>Not surprisingly, some have sought to stand in the way of these developments—most notably the state bureaucracies, who jealously guard their fiefdoms. But by and large they have been welcomed. The broader community has certainly supported a stronger role for the Commonwealth, and its gut instinct is based on a firm foundation of logic. If we have accepted international obligations to protect places such as World Heritage sites or Ramsar wetlands or to meet commitments in relation to biodiversity, responsibility ultimately falls on the federal government. If a matter is of national significance, all Australians represented by their federal parliament have an equal interest. If we believe that action must be taken to protect endangered species, our concern does not stop at state and territory borders. A resident of Perth has as much interest as a resident in New South Wales in seeing great icons like the Sydney Opera House protected. If a matter crosses state borders—for example, as a result of the flows of our great river systems—it logically falls to the Commonwealth to provide leadership.</para><para>Despite the great strides made by this government to give the Commonwealth legislation commensurate with these responsibilities, the jigsaw is not complete. Existing legislation relies on indirect powers provided to the federal government by the Constitution—the external affairs power, the corporations power, the trade and commerce power and the powers relating to race. It would be dishonest to claim that these powers do not provide wide coverage. Many environmental matters do fall within the ambit of our treaty obligations. We can legislatively require corporations and entities that trade to act in certain ways, and we have almost universal coverage in relation to Indigenous heritage. Nonetheless, they do not provide blanket coverage for the Commonwealth in fulfilling the legitimate obligations it has. For example, the Commonwealth's new heritage legislation does not benefit from the existence of an extensive international framework. Instead, it is primarily corporations and the Commonwealth itself that will come within its fold. Similarly, the High Court has made clear that a valid law relying on the external affairs power must be faithful in the pursuit of an obligation imposed by an international treaty. Legislation must be reasonably appropriate and adapted to the particular provisions of the treaty.</para><para>The combination of existing constitutional powers may not, for example, provide the federal government with the capacity to implement the type of regime needed to address one of our nation's most pressing environmental problems, the Murray-Darling Basin. If the processes in place—which involve divided responsibilities between several jurisdictions—fail, strong action might become necessary to protect the interests of our most important catchment.</para><para>For these reasons, I believe it is time for this parliament and the Australian community to consider the issue of whether our Constitution should be amended to include a specific head of power that would confirm the Commonwealth's responsibilities for nationally significant environmental and heritage matters. It is a step that I would certainly support, both for the practical reasons I have outlined and also to symbolically assert the national interest we all have in our heritage and environment. This question has been raised in the past but never comprehensively studied. The last real examination of the issue occurred 15 years ago during the deliberations of the Hawke government's Constitutional Commission. While it recommended against this approach, it did so at a time when acceptance of a strong Commonwealth role in the environment was still evolving.</para><para>I know that some will argue that the definitional issues will make such an amendment difficult. I reject that it is beyond the wit of Australians to overcome such drafting difficulties. Our Constitution—to use words that have almost become a cliché—has served Australia well. But it can never be a static document. If ever there was a case for an evolved role for the Commonwealth that could not have been envisaged on the decks of the <inline font-style="italic">Lucinda</inline> over a century ago, it is that relating to the environment and our heritage.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Greenway Electorate: Urban Change</title><page.no>15547</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>15547</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to talk about the future of our communities. Globalisation has brought with it many challenges at both the national and international levels, but it has also brought many challenges at the local community level. In many respects, these have been overlooked by policy makers. The federal government's economic and immigration policies are driving greater changes in our suburbs and our local communities. </para></talk.start><para>The area I represent in Western Sydney is undergoing great changes. There is a huge boom in residential development and its associated increases in population. During the last federal redistribution, the electorate of Greenway shrank in terms of geographical area but grew substantially in terms of population. Urban infill is occurring at a rapid pace. In established suburbs, a single house is torn down and replaced with three or four townhouses or a block of 60 flats is replacing two or three freestanding houses, while suburbs are being built from scratch on vacant land or old market gardens with a combination of low- and medium-density dwellings.</para><para>If the industrial revolution of 250 years ago drove the population from rural areas into the cities, it is the technological revolution that is driving people to the suburbs today. Better roads, better forms of transport and communication will allow people to live comfortably on the urban fringes of our cities. We now need to shift our focus to creating policies that will deal with this fundamental shift in the structure of our society.</para><para>My colleague the member for Werriwa, the shadow minister minister for urban development and community security, is doing some excellent work in this area. His electorate, like mine, sits on the urban fringe of Sydney and is undergoing changes at a massive rate. We as local members are experiencing these changes first-hand. On an almost daily basis our communities are changing before our eyes. Planning policy is vitally needed. There will be some who will say that planning is a state issue or a problem for local councils, but it is more than that. The forces that are driving changes are national and international as well as state and local. Therefore, I believe there is a role for the federal government in this policy area. We cannot continue to simply pass the buck and wash our hands. This is a challenge that affects all of us, so it is a task for all levels of government to become involved in. Labor recognises this. That is why we have a shadow minister in this area. It is a pity that the government is so short-sighted. It is a pity that the government does not even have a minister for housing or community development. </para><para>We have to cease building housing estates and begin building communities. We have to consolidate the trend of moving jobs closer to where people live. We have to ensure that all people, regardless of background or location, are able to grasp the opportunity that the future brings. Who knows what the future holds? A government can no longer simply administrate; it must plan, think to the future and create an environment that will be able to cope with whatever the future may bring. We need flexibility and foresight: two things this government lacks that the Labor Party can provide.</para><para>The lines of responsibility have been blurred in this modern age. By ignoring this policy area, the current government is ignoring its proper role, which is to provide the framework for a growing and changing community. We need a national approach, not just an ad hoc approach. Every community is different. I will not deny this. It is what makes Australia a rich and diverse nation. That is why local councils need to be involved: to reflect local conditions, local attitudes and local circumstances. Local community organisations like the Riverstone Neighbourhood Centre, Marayong House and the Toongabbie Neighbourhood Centre in the more established areas of my electorate, and the Glenwood Residents Association and Stanhope Gardens in the new residential estates, are all great resources for community building. Each community has different needs and these organisations know their area and have the drive to get results. Each community also faces common challenges, which is why the federal government also needs to play its part.</para><para>It will not be easy, but then government never is. It will require a whole-of-government approach, and it is not just planning: it is transport, communications, health, energy, environment, resources, education, industry and employment. None of these policy areas can exist in a vacuum; they all have an impact on our local communities and they must be woven together to form the fabric of our society. It is time for innovation. It is time for daring. The same old solutions will not work in the new modern age. New challenges require new thinking. If we are to be true to the generations of Australians that are to come, then we cannot be selfish in our approach today. We must build the platform on which these communities will stand, and we should not be cutting corners in materials or putting up with shonky workmanship. We, as representatives of our local communities, have been given a great responsibility at a critical time in our history. The status quo is not an option. The decisions we make affect those who are to come. The impact will be felt down through the years and we cannot afford to drop the ball. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Information Technology: Bioinformatics</title><page.no>15549</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>15549</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHNSON</name><name.id>00AMX</name.id><electorate>Ryan</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—One of the great privileges of representing the federal seat of Ryan in the Australian parliament is that I am frequently given the opportunity to meet some highly creative and incredibly talented people.

Their initiative and innovation led to a prize of $25,000 for their talents and efforts. </para></talk.start><para>Today I want to speak in the parliament about the Queensland Bioinformatics Consortium that I had the very real pleasure of launching last Tuesday, 20 May at the premises of Data 3 in Toowong, where we were kindly hosted by Bruce Crouch, manager of enterprise infrastructure. I want to report to my colleagues in the parliament that the Queensland Bioinformatics Consortium is a tremendously exciting initiative that encourages bioinformatic education and training through links with industry and tertiary institutions to propel the commercial development of bioinformation in this country. The winner from this will be Australia.</para><para>The QBC is a combined initiative of Genetraks Pty Ltd, the Queensland University of Technology and the University of Queensland, situated in St Lucia in my electorate. The QBC's initial funding was sourced through the Innovation Access Program, a federal government grant program initiated under the Howard government as part of the Backing Australia's Ability program. The consortium was awarded a $250,000 IAP grant from the Department of Education, Science and Training. The Innovation Access Program, an initiative of the Howard government's innovation statement, Backing Australia's Ability, is a strategy to promote research, development and innovation throughout the national economy. The federal government has provided $100 million to businesses to tap into world's best technology and science.</para><para>The government's Backing Australia's Ability is a five-year strategy and a major breakthrough in innovation policy. Backing Australia's Ability will position Australia at the forefront of the international trend towards knowledge based and new economies. What this means for our country is more jobs, better paid jobs and higher standards of living for our fellow Australians. By encouraging and supporting innovation, the Backing Australia's Ability strategy will enhance Australia's international competitiveness, economic prosperity and social fabric.</para><para>Let there be no mistake: Australia is not only capable of competing internationally with other players in the field of bioinformatics but indeed can flourish in this niche sector of the economy. But we must be innovative. We must be the first out of the blocks. We must lead the world in our capacity to generate ideas and then, absolutely critically, commercialise them and turn them into viable applications for the consumers of not only this country but indeed the world. The federal government's grant of $250,000, which I mentioned earlier, will go a long way to ensuring that one particular consortium can make this happen.</para><para>I commend the merits of the Innovation Access Program because its big picture goals—to promote innovation and competitiveness by increasing Australian access to global research and technologies and facilitating their uptake by Australian researchers and firms, particularly SMEs—are helping kick-start important projects such as QBC. There is certainly no doubt that in the electorate of Ryan the support of the federal government is making a meaningful difference to improvements in science and cutting-edge technology, which clearly plays a vital part in many businesses. I can attest that the businesses of Ryan have that great advantage.</para><para>The QBC is a great example of how Backing Australia's Ability is accelerating the commercial application of innovative ideas in a local electorate such as mine.

Trade Practices Act 1974 (the Act).
