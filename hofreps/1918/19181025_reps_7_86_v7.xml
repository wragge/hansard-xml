I ask the Assistant Minister for Defence if the statement is true, and, if it is, how many returned soldiers are likely to be displaced? Is this action of the Government indicative of the gratitude it feels towards returned men? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member yesterday showed me a letter on the subject to which he now refers, and I have asked for a report as to the facts. The Electoral Act provides for the enrolment of an elector in the division in which he or she lives. In cases of non-enrolment, every facility is afforded for the making of explanations without going into Court. The lady concerned made an explanation, but the magistrate, I understand, thought that she was in error. However, as I have already told the honorable member, I shall endeavour to ascertain the facts, and to see that justice is done. </para>

I ask the Acting Minister for the Navy if he will consider the advisability of establishing a central booking office in each big city, so that priority may he obtained by those who first make application for space ? </para>

                        <para>- Returned soldiers who are engaged in hand-weaving here are making splendid cloth, but they are being supplied from a Government Department with a shoddy yarn. This yarn has got into general use, and a lady who has made a tremendous number of socks for the men at the Front has complained about it. I produce one of the socks made from this yarn. Honorable members can see from the effect of six days', wear, how poor the quality of the yarn must be. Will the Acting Prime Minister do something by regulation under the War Precautions Act, or in some other' way, to prevent injury being done to our returned men who are weaving cloth - because cloth made of this yarn is useless - and to prevent the yarn in question from being supplied to the women and girls who are making socks for out soldiers. </para>

It was stated in. the daily press last week that a claim had been made upon the Navy Department for £27,000 ; that the officials had reported in favour of paying £7,000, and that, despite their recommendation, the Minister for the time being had authorized the payment of £25,000. These facts were alleged in a most circumstantial way in a leading article in one of the Melbourne daily newspapers, but no notice appears to have been- taken of the statement. </para>

Ministers are not acquainted of all that the censors are doing unless they are asked to make inquiries on the subject. The censorship is operating throughout Australia under general rules, and we are not acquainted with the particulars as to what is done. So far as the Government are concerned, however, I may say at once that there is no political significance attaching to the occurrence to which the honorable member alludes, and that, so far as I am aware, no action has been taken to suppress, in the case of the morning newspapers, what may have appeared in any evening paper. </para>

                            <para>- We have experienced very great difficulty in compiling lists of eligibles in the various States. We had only the war census cards of 1915 to work upon; but, with the assistance of officers of the Electoral, Police, and Postal Departments, we have compiled a list with fairly satisfactory results. I hope to be able next week to announce when we shall send out the ballot cards, and the subsequent date on which the ballot will be taken. </para>

                                <para>- It is a fact that we have received some letters complaining of the nature of certain illustrations in the pamphlets sent out. On the other hand, we have had many letters eulogizing the character of these illustrations and of the pamphlets generally. It is also a fact that the pamphlets and letters, in some cases, have, unfortunately, been sent to persons whose sons have been killed at the Front, as well as to men over military age.  Out of 160,000 pamphlets issued, however, less than 3¼ per cent. have been sent to such people. </para>

If Ministers are not to be allowed to answer without interruption, questions put to them, I shall have to put a stop to further questions without notice. I should regret to have recourse to that procedure, but honorable members must recognise that the House is largely entering upon an abuse of the system of asking and answering questions without notice. The House should assist the  Speaker  to secure the conduct of such business in proper and regular form. I must insist that when an honorable member is asking, or a Minister is replying to, a question, he shall be heard without interruption. Neither questions Dor answers to questions are open to debate. </para>

Having regard to the large number of eligibles in all the Departments, will the Minister give special attention to the request of these men, and see if it is not possible to give them the relief they desire ? </para>

                        <para>- Yesterday, the Treasurer, at my request, furnished a return showing the number of  eligibles,  between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years, employed in the Taxation Department, Melbourne. The summary showed, approximately, that thirty had joined the Australian Imperial Force, that there were thirty-three rejects and ninety-four returned soldiers employed in the Department here, and that 168 of the employees did not come within any one of these classes. Will the Treasurer endeavour to enforce in this Department the rule of preference of employment to returned soldiers ? </para>

                        <para>- I did not attempt to analyze the return very carefully when laying it on the table of the House. I gave it to the honorable member as soon as I received it; but, so far as the Departments with which I am associated are concerned, wherever possible returned soldiers will be given preference. I am a believer in the principle, and will see, so far as I am able, that it is enforced. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret having to take the course of moving the adjournment of the House ; and I can assure the Minister concerned <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> that I have no personal feeling in the matter. The outcome of the deputation of ship-yard workmen yesterday to the Assistant Minister for the Navy renders it necessary that something should be done. The press has published an account of what took place at that deputation, and certain actions and utterances of mine are embodied in the report. I wish to say at once that the Minister himself was the cause of the trouble, and was very agitated throughout the whole of the proceedings. Personally, I have no animus against the Minister, and it was no action of mine that gave rise to the events of yesterday. I raise the question to-day because the honorable gentleman has refused to do anything in connexion with this urgent business; as a matter of fact, he refused to hear the statements that the deputation desired to make. Before I had an opportunity to introduce the deputation, the Minister at once attacked those composing it on a certain question, and called for their admission or denial before he would hear them. I could see that trouble was imminent, and, after some further remarks between the Minister and the deputation, I asked permission to withdraw the members of it, so that I might re-introduce them with some sort of unanimity on their part. This proved that I had no desire for any trouble with the Minister. When the deputation returned to the presence of the Minister, he took the ground that they had no right to express an opinion as to how the work is conducted at these particular yards; he held that they could not possibly have any knowledge in that regard, and that all the knowledge and rights were on the part of the management. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The gentleman who was previously in charge in Victoria has accepted an offer from the New South Wales Government, and thus we have lost his services. Why that gentleman was allowed to go I cannot conceive. According to the attitude of the Minister to the deputation, he evidently is of the opinion that the trained artisans employed at the yard know nothing about the trade. We all know that a private soldier is as well able as an adjutant to say whether a drill is being properly conducted ; and . the understrappers in any Department are quite able to appreciate  whether the head is conducting the business in an efficient way. </para>

                    <para>The conduct of the Commonwealth Ship-yards is of interest, not only to the Minister and the management, but to the men who work there, and to the community at large. Statements made by the men had appeared in the newspaper, and when they asked the Minister to allow them to substantiate those statements, surely he ought to have permitted them to do so? He not only refused to hear them, but said that they were not judges of the matter, and he could not listen to them on the point. It is time that the country knew the exact position at these yards. I know that the present Minister took over the duties of the office from another, and, to my mind, did his onerous work well. As I have already said, I have no ill-feeling against the honorable gentleman, but I must call attention to the peculiar position at these shipbuilding yards. The least the Minister could have done at the deputation was to put his own feelings on one side, and allow the men to state their case in regard to the statements that had appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald.</inline></para>

                            <para>- They did not deny the accuracy of the statements, but wished to reiterate them. When the Minister refused to hear them, I took the members of the deputation outside, and said to them, " Do you want to have your case tried?" and they replied in the affirmative. Then I told them, "Very well, if so, you must pacify the Minister in some way." But, like Woodrow Wilson with the Germans, the Minister demanded an unconditional surrender, his idea, apparently, being to make them crawl on their stomachs before he would hear them. The Minister would not hear them unless they unconditionally surrendered in respect of all they thought and all they had done. Now the Minister says that the deputation- denied the accuracy of the report. The deputation had to adopt certain methods  in  order to get a hearing, and . I am pleased that they took my advice. The men affirm that all the statements reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> are correct, and they ask for an opportunity to prove them. If the Minister will not provide the opportunity, it is the duty of the Government to do so. It is all very well for the Minister to brush the statements aside in a highhanded fashion. I assert that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curchin</inline> knows nothing about shipbuilding. He may be a good naval architect, but he is not a shipbuilder. </para>

                        <para>Allegations in regard to the conditions of work at the Williamstown Shipbuilding Yards were made at a meeting of the Victorian executive of the Australasian Society of Engineers last night. </para>
                        <para>Speakers asserted that essential tools had disappeared and had not been replaced, that even necessary bolts and nuts could riot be obtained, that men were told to " keep out of sight," because there was no work for them to do, and that certain officials were trying to drive the members of the Australasian Society out of the yards. </para>
                        <para>Eventually the following motion was carried :  - </para>
                        <para>That, failing an inquiry by the Minister into the charges made, at which inquiry the Australasian Society of Engineers shall have due representation, we favour cancelling the shipbuilding Agreement with the. Government. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>It was because of that motion that the Minister refused to receive the deputation. He said to the men, " If it is true that that motion were carried I will not hear you." He would not allow them to explain that the motion had been moved at a meeting of the executive and had not been referred to the main body. However, after a discussion outside the Minister's room, the deputation returned and was allowed to proceed. The report continues - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The opening speaker said that difficulty had been experienced in expediting work now in hand at the yards, and as from the beginning there had been hostility on the part of certain officials to the Australasian Society, an  effort  was being made to cast the blame on its members. The definite charge was made that the members of the society .were incompetent. This charge was not laid at present against the members of other organizations at the yard. There was not a semblance of truth, in the allegation that members of the Australasian Society were incompetent. (Hear, hear.) Neither, was there any truth in the allegation that work had been delayed by the engineers. </para>
                        <para class="block">Deficiency in Stores. </para>
                        <para>The reverse was true. Among other things there was <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> deficiency in stores, tools, and appliances, and the men claimed that certain officials in responsible positions had not before been identified with shipbuilding and could not direct operations. The attitude adopted by the management towards the Australasian Society had been one of hostility from first to last. These complaints had been placed before the Minister from time to time, and sworn affidavits had been put in, but he appeared to have been swayed by. other advices in dealing with these matters. ' In view of the Minister's attitude they had come to the conclusion that there was no other course open but to take drastic action - ( Applause. ) </para>
                        <para>The next  speaker  had a number of complaints to make about men being put off. He alleged that a pattern-maker had been brought from Ballarat to the yards, and had then been put off; another man in the fitting shop was dismissed, and on asking what charge was there against him, was told that there was a shortage of work. Men had been brought long distances to the yards, and had broken up their homes, only to be put off. The  speaker  complained, that there had .been an attempt to " blackball " him at the yards by. asking everybody to undertake a job which it was alleged ho could not do, while the real reason was that . there were no appliances there to do the job with. It Was disgraceful that a returned soldier should have been dismissed. ° </para>

                    <para class="block">Obstacles in Wat. </para>
                    <para>Another member of the executive said that ever since he had been engaged upon a certain  machine  at the yards every possible obstacle had been put in his way. When he took the machine over ho found that it had been tampered with and sot up so that it would not work. There were no tools to enable him to work the machine, even after it had been righted. One job had been lying unfinished at the shop ever since he had been there. (Laughter.) There was no machine at the yard suitable to do the job in question. The reason, the  speaker  asserted, that they wished to get him off his machine was that there were only three men in Victoria who could work it. When he asked that some repairs be done the- other day the blacksmith told him there were no tools in the blacksmith's shop to do the work with. "It is nothing for us to take two or three days  over a job and then have to do it over again two or three times," was the next complaint voiced. "If we want packing we have to use  undersizes  or  oversizes  and make it fit as best we can," continued this engineer. " If bolts or nuts are required the man has to get them from the '  scrapheap  and file them off. There is no such thing as assortment of tools, and we have no small spanners. There are no plans to work by, and after getting half way through a job you will find that it has to be done another way. The material which has been wasted is alarming. I can. honestly say that since Friday I have only done four or five hours' real work, and when I asked for instructions I was told, to keep out of the way as there was nothing for me. (Laughter.) That time will be booked against me, and I will be informed that I should have done the work more quickly. There was none to do. (Laughter.) One job had to be done three times, and when I did some necessary filing I was told not to interfere with work of which the foreman was proud. After this job was put up it was found to be all wrong and it took ten days to fix it up again, because I was not allowed to do work which any one could see was necessary. This particular job had teen completed in the wrong way before the Australasian engineers entered the ya.rd, so they can't blame us. Another job was put in place on the vessel, and it was not until three months after that they discovered it had to have  key ways  in it, and it had to be taken down, (Great laughter ) I had previously told them it would have to have  keyways." </para>
                    <para class="block">Surely any Minister could see that statements like the foregoing demand inquiry, but from the very outset of the deputation the Minister was determined not to hear what the men had to say. The men say that there is no material on the job, yet the Department is asking the society for fifteen more fitters, five turners, and other men. The Department well knows that . the society is not a large body, and the Government are having trouble with another organization of engineers. Naturally, the men desire to know why these additional men -are wanted. The Department asks for five more turners when there are only two spare machines, on which the apprentices work. Why are fifteen more fitters required? The men say that the purpose of the Department is either to make the society admit that it cannot supply the men or to replace workmen already <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the job. Are men to be asked to leave their jobs and go to Williamstown to do temporary repair work ? We know that no machinery is available for additional labour. The men say that the Department is asking for these men for a certain purpose; -the Minister replies that they have no right to consider whether a certain action by the Department will put them out of work.  His  attitude reminds me of a boss for whom I worked about thirty years ago, and who used to say, "I am running this show; you have <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> rights at all." That was the idea of the old bosses. Surely the Minister will not contend that the men have no right to conjecture, on the basis of the knowledge that they have, that the additional tradesmen who are required are intended to supplant the present employees. </para>

I admit that he has difficult problems to face, and I do not wish to speak harshly of him; but in view of the known shortage in machinery and material, the statements of the men should receive consideration.

                            <para>- Nothing of the sort. I admit that I demanded that the men should be heard properly, but the Minister pointed to the door. It was then that I expressed the desire that he might go somewhere else. I have not in any way sought to bring about trouble. I have introduced numbers of deputations to Ministers, as many as any other honorable member has, and I have never had trouble before. In fact, the Assistant Minister for the Navy is a personal friend of mine, and we have talked over this matter on previous occasions, but the method pursued on this occasion was most peculiar, and the deputation was not received in the ordinary way. </para>

                            <para>- I do not want an inquiry by the men, but they claim that they should have representatives on any inquiry board, who could put- forward their side of the question. It is a fair claim that they should have the opportunity of stating their case. As this matter is one of considerable interest to the community, I am justified in asking the Ministry to give consideration to the request of the men, especially now that the matter has been ventilated in the press, and charges have been made against, the management of the yard. Even if there should be no proof in support of those charges forthcoming, at any rate there is good ground for inquiry. An inquiry board, comprising the heads of some of the Departments, with a representative of the men, would satisfy me, but I want action to be taken immediately, so that the management will have no opportunity of " whitewashing " themselves. If they cannot stand an investigation of this- sort, they have no right to occupy the positions they hold, and as the charges made by the men are so transparently true, I wonder, the Minister cannot acknowledge it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curchin</inline> is not a shipbuilder; he is a naval architect; a sort of superior draughtsman; and we have been endeavouring " to ascertain from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pickering</inline> where he served twenty years as foreman, and the particular branch of shipbuilding of which he was foreman. When I submitted a question to the Minister, he tried to 'be funny, and said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pickering</inline> had been foreman of a tailor's shop. At Wednesday's deputation to the Minister, eight different branches of shipbuilding work were represented. We want to know what' branch of shipbuilding <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pickering</inline> was foreman of. and whether he was in charge of a branch that would make him capable of filling the position which he is now occupying. It is very apparent that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curchin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pickering</inline> are not the men to run the yard at Williamstown, and that there should be a change. I can understand the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> interjecting that if only half of what I have said is true the yard at Williamstown ought to be closed down. Can any one deny the ability of an artisan to judge the way in which things are being carried on ? Any artisan can tell by the way in which a man handles a tool whether he is a competent tradesman, just as a lawyer can tell by the way a man handles a brief whether he is a member of the legal profession or not. The Minister has no right to claim that the men in the yard are not capable of forming a judgment in these matters. They are tradesmen. The management are not. I have taken the only means .available to me of bringing this matter forward. Unfortunately, I cannot go any further forward, because on his own uncorroborated <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> the Minister will get up - and rebut every statement I have made, and that will finish the business. Nevertheless, the statements made by these men are worthy of investigation, and if the Minister shirks an inquiry he will not be doing his duty or giving justice to the people of this community. </para>

                        <para>. - I am somewhat astonished at the honorable member's anxiety to prevent industrial turmoil, seeing that he has repeatedly stated in the House his belief in it, and that his attitude towards the ship-yard at "Williamstown has always been in that direction. He has made the most glaring and incorrect statements in connexion with the management of this yard that have ever come under my notice. As a matter of fact, they do not agree with the statements which the men themselves have made. I asked them yesterday categorically whether, they indorsed the report which had appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> and they denied the truth of the statements appearing in it. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has made charges against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. On rel i in</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pickering.</inline> I venture to say that the men have made no charges against them. In  no instance has a charge been made to me by the men against these two gentlemen. The charges they have made are against the foreman, who was taken over from the Victorian State Government when the yard was transferred to the Commonwealth, and it is not a new matter - in fact, it has been before me practically from the first day on which I went into the Department. It has no connexion with the shipbuilding scheme. These men are employed on the work of finishing a dredge which was in the yard incomplete at the time of the. transfer from the Victorian Government, and which we are finishing. There has been constant turmoil in  regard  to that particular work. The men want me to do what I certainly will not do, and that is to institute an inquiry into the competency of the management, and they want to -say - they stated it distinctly yesterday, and the honorable member has indorsed it to-day - whether wo  shall  employ additional hands or not. lt is the most absurd claim that has ever come under my notice. The first complaint that reached me was that the foreman was a member of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and they had suspicions that he was not giving them a fair deal. They said that if they had a chargeman appointed from their own society - the Australasian Society of Engineers - things would be all right, because then they would not come into contact with the foreman. I acted on their request, arid a chargeman was appointed from their own society, but not the man they wished to put into the position. As it matter of fact, the man who is making the greatest fuss to-day is the one they wished to have appointed as chargeman". Lf we are to carry on shipbuilding, the management must have control of the yards; and, although I have taken up the position all .along that I am always available to hear the men's complaints in regard to any grievances concerning pay or working conditions, "when they came to me to talk about the management, or say that this or that had not been done properly, I told them, as I repeated yesterday, that it was not part of their duty to do this. There can be- no discipline in the shipbuilding yard if every time a complaint is submitted it takes the nature of an allegation against the competency of the management and a demand for an inquiry. </para>

On one occasion he paid a visit to the yard at Williamstown prior- to the taking of a contract for the building of ships by Walkers Limited, and in my office he spoke of the competent men who were in charge of the yard. I asked whom he referred to, and he said that he spoke of the management generally. It was on the very day that I had received a- letter from the men, signed by several names supposed to be representing several societies, in which they found fault with the management, and suggested that I should take the men in the central office and place them in  charge of the yard and get- rid of the men in control there. Therefore, I was interested in what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> said, and I asked him if he could mention the men to whom he particularly referred. The first man he mentioned was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pickering.</inline> He said, "He is one of the most capable men I have come across."- I said to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> " How much would he be worth to you in your yard ?" He replied, " If you do not want him I am quite prepared to give him £750 a year for his services." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> was capable of judging the class of work which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pickering</inline> was carrying out. </para>

So far as I know, Mr.Curchin and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pickering</inline> are both very competent men. There has been a considerable amount of feeling displayed towards the foreman, who was taken over from the Victorian yard. The men thought that as he was a member of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers he would not give them a fair deal. However, a chargeman was appointed from their own society. I told them yesterday that if what they had been reported to have said was true, he should be sacked instantly, because the blame lay at his door; but they said that the statements in the press report' were not correct. In fact, they denied categorically what the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> has said to-day. </para>

When I asked whether they had said, as reported, that unless I held the inquiry into the management they were going to give me forty-eight hours' notice that they would cancel the shipbuilding agreement, they said that that was not a correct statement. </para>

When i asked them, "Is it true that a returned soldier has been discharged?" the soldier, who was present, said, " No, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> that is not  true." He said he was afraid that he was going to be discharged because the management was asking for another man for -the same class of work that he had been doing. This man took up the position that he was entitled to say that there was no room for another man. Whether there was or not, I do not know, but the management, in my opinion, is the best judge of that. In consequence of a pressing desire to complete work, I sent to this society to secure additional men. It was arranged that we should put on something like sixteen additional men. The work they were required for is very intricate work in connexion with machinery for the dredge. </para>

                            <para>- That is another of the remarkable statements made by the honorable member. Until I saw the statement which appeared in the newspapers I had not heard a word of complaint for the last three months, that is, after the foreman was appointed. Directly the request for additional men went to the society a fuss was made. They immediately jumped to the conclusion that they were to be discharged, and they took up the position, which I think no Minister should tolerate, that they should say whether we required additional men or not. I say unhesitatingly that I do not intend to permit an inquiry by the employees into the management. If that were permitted, all discipline in the yards would be at an end. </para>

                            <para>- To the best of  my  knowledge, I did. As I told the men yesterday, they may be very capable at their own work, but I question whether any  of  them is capable of judging the management of the yard. Anyhow, that is absolutely outside their functions. I may be wrong in thinking so, but that is my conviction; and, so long as I hold my present position, I say that the men in charge  of  the yard should not be  the  persons  to  judge whether men are  to  be put on  or  taken off, otherwise we cannot carry on the work  of  shipbuilding  at  all . In connexion with any other matters where the men have had legitimate grievances they have been heard, and where I believed they were justified in the complaints they made I did what was necessary to remedy their grievances. But when  it  comes  to  dictating  to me as to  the number  of  men who.  are to be  employed, who  is to be  in charge  of  the yard, and the particular persons who are  to  be appointed  to  positions, I do not propose  to  submit  to that  kind  of  thing. </para>

                            <para>- After having been in France, he went to London, and, though marked "C1," he still wanted to serve his "country, and obtained permission to serve in one of the munition factories. He had charge of  a  very big machine in one of the munition factories in. Great Britain, and he knows what ho is talking about. He assured me that  at  these yards, if they wanted bolts, they had to go to the scrap heap to get them. He further said that half the time they were doing nothing down there. These men do not want to have control of the yards, or to take the place of the management or of the Minister, but if this kind of thing is going on, they are justified in going before the Minister and voicing their complaints. The Minister  has said  that they made no complaint -against the management. </para>

                            <para>- Whenever there was anything wrong the honorable member was prepared to take up the matter on behalf of his union, and as a unionist he always adopted the attitude that the employees had certain rights and should not be treated as serfs, or as pieces of machinery. In connexion with an institution controlled by the Government, I cannot imagine how it can be contended that employees have not the right to approach a Minister if they think it well to inform him that in connexion with a particular work something is going on which ought not to be allowed. These men do not want to precipitate industrial trouble, and I ask the Minister to let an inquiry be held. The men make definite charges. We desire - and I am sure the Minister also desires - that our shipbuilding efforts shall be successful. If there be any truth in the statement that the managers are incompetent, our shipbuilding venture is doomed to failure, and we do not desire that. I am satisfied that the Minister would like it to be a success. We know how much depends upon it, because the war may not be over for a year or for two years, and the enemies' submarines may continue to be active. It is, in the circumstances, essential to the interests of Australia that we shall make satisfactory progress in shipbuilding in this country. This will be impossible if we have a body of men engaged in the industry who are labouring under what they conceive to be a genuine grievance against the management. Their grievance may not be genuine, but sometimes illusions cause more trouble than is caused by genuine grievances. I ask the Minister not to be stubborn, and to have an inquiry by competent men, and let us know whether the men in charge of these yards are thoroughly competent to carry out their work. There must. be something wrong if the statement is true that the men are walking about half their time doing nothing. The returned soldier referred to told me that half their time they were playing cards. </para>

                            <para>- He says that both these men, Curchin and Pickering, are doing so. That is absolutely the statement he made to me. I have not visited the yard, but, listening to the discussion to-day, I remembered the charges which this man made in conversation with me. I thought there might be something in them, and, after all, they appear to me to be worthy of consideration. The Minister should not be obstinate, and should not assume the attitude that the men have no rights. They are citizens of this community, just as the Minister himself is. </para>

                        <para>.- There are difficulties in the way of shipbuilding in Australia. There is a shortage of material and of necessary machinery, and there is also a shortage of men trained to shipbuilding, because we have never previously constructed ships in Australia of the size now required. I should be the last man to place any difficulties in the way of extending the shipbuilding industry in Australia in view of the necessities of the world, and particularly of Australia, in the matter of freight. We are feeling the lack of shipping facilities very greatly in the Commonwealth. 1 have represented unionists upon deputations to employers, not. only in Australia, but in other parts of the world. If I returned to my trade to-morrow I should probably find myself on deputations again. I have never worked for. a Government, but I know that in private employ it very often happens that men who are given foremen's positions are not the best tradesmen. The Acting Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> knows as well as I do that in private employ the men who are prepared to stand up for their rights are not given foremen's jobs. </para>

                            <para>- That is true, if the honorable member is referring to shipbuilding in the Commonwealth. We took over the yards at Williamstown before the Prime Minister left for the Old Country in April, and before the Acting Minister took charge. There was a dredge on the stocks there which was being built for the Melbourne Harbor Trust. It is not an exceptionally big dredge, or as big as some of those which previous Governments have been obtaining from abroad. I should think that dredge has been on the stocks at Williamstown now for nearly two years, and the Minister will agree that it is likely to remain there for some months longer before it is completed. I have not been down there since the Commonwealth had charge of the yard, though I did visit the place a few years ago, when the <inline font-style="italic">New Zealand</inline> was here. No harm can be done by an inquiry. We have had inquiries before into other Departments, including one quite recently into the Defence and Navy Departments, and every one who has read the result of that inquiry must admit that it was necessary. One of the recommendations in regard to the Navy Department  was  that a certain gentleman should be placed in a certain position, and for some very mysterious reason this was done at about the time the report was being printed. I do not want the Minister to run away with the idea that I am concerned about which society these men belong to, whether to the Australasian Society of Engineers or the Amalgamated Society; but what has been said shows that an inquiry is necessary. Hew long did it take the management to have the <inline font-style="italic"> Dart</inline> fitted up preparatory to the search for Captain Chugg? </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that the work on the dredge was pushed forward as expeditiously as might have been expected. Possibly there were faults in the management. Managers are not always right. We know that in private employment managers are sometimes displaced by other men in the interests of efficiency. I do not know if these men are members of the Amalgamated Society or not, but I think that, after the representations which have been made by the member  for  Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews),</inline> there is need for an inquiry. Before this motion was submitted, the Minister asked leave to introduce a Bill dealing with shipbuilding. This, I presume, is the measure referred to in the Ministerial announcement at the beginning of the session, and which was referred to by the Acting Minister in , his address to members of the National Federation, when he said it was the intention of the Government to contract themselves outside the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court. Naturally, therefore, I am anxious to see the Bill, because I want to see less industrial turmoil in the future. We all know, from experience, that it is far better to grant an inquiry when it has been asked for by a deputation, because if men are in the wrong they will then be more satisfied. If, on the other hand, their request is refused, they will nurse their grievances for a long time. In the interests of shipbuilding in Australia, therefore, I urge the Minister to reconsider his decision, because, like all other men, he is liable to make a mistake. If ever I make a mistake I do not mind admitting it. I have made mistakes in the' past, and I have no doubt I will make many in the future. If any man declares that he never makes a mistake, he might fool himself, hut nobody else. I believe an inquiry is necessary in this matter, and that if the request is granted, it will he in the interests of all concerned. If the management is quite' competent, surely  there is nothing to fear from an inquiry, which is long overdue. </para>

                        <para>. - If I were the manager of these yards, and subordinates made charges against me, coupled with a demand for an inquiry, I would not sit down quietly and allow the matter to pass. We cannot afford to make too many mistakes in our shipbuilding schemes, because with our long coastline, and quite apart from oversea trade, we are bound to become a great maritime people, and our shipbuilding ventures are long overdue. It is natural that mistakes should be made in a new undertaking of this nature, just as mistakes were made in other Departments of Government activity. When we commenced the construction of railway engines at Newport many mistakes were made, and the croakers and " stinking fish " party said, " Let us have no more engines built here. They are costing a terrible sum of money." But to-day </para>

                            <para>- This result at Newport shows that wisdom has been displayed in selecting the proper class of men to take charge of the works. It has been demonstrated that, under efficient management, the Australian workman, when properly trained, can compete with workmen from any part of the world. If anything is wrong in the supervision of these shipyards, our whole shipbuilding scheme will be a howling farce. Good supervision is the key to success. If I were manager of these yards, I would ask the Minister to appoint an independent Board of Inquiry, so that the matter could be cleared up once and for all, and the public would have an assurance that the management was properly equipped to carry out the work intrusted to it. </para>

Hitherto when a charge has been made on the floor of the House, the responsible Minister has always been ready to grant an inquiry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> invariably took this stand. In this instance I fully expect that a request will come from the management to the Minister for an inquiry, in order' to satisfy the public. I am not satisfied, but I want to be. I believe also that the Minister wants to be thoroughly satisfied. He may be satisfied, because he may have better information than I possess; but the public will be very much disturbed by this discussion, and will not be satisfied if the whole matter is covered up without an inquiry. In the most friendly way, therefore, I suggest that the Minister, if he has come to a decision, should reconsider the matter, and grant the request. </para>

All I can say is that it is well known that something is wrong down there. It is well known that the men in charge are not shipbuilders, and if the Minister does not do something in the matter he will be neglecting his duty. . </para>

                        <para>- I have re-read the paragraph, referred to by the honorable member, in the Royal Commission's report on Navy Administration, dated 18th September, 1918. The section from which the honorable gentleman has extracted the statement in the question affords me no indication as to who the Minister was to whom attention is directed. Probably a minute examination of the evidence would make this clear. However, all the Ministers who have ever been in control of the Navy Department are at present included in the National Government, but I see no reason to pursue the drastic course which the honorable member suggests. </para>

                            <para>- Prior to the outbreak of war, Lysaghts Limited, Sydney, were engaged in the erection of works for the manufacture of galvanized iron, and had installed part of the necessary plant. War conditions had made it impossible to obtain the remainder of. the plant required, despite the efforts of the Munitions Directorate to assist them in this direction, and it is improbable that such plant can be obtained till after the war. It is believed that once the necessary plant is secured, this firm will be able to supply practically all Australia's requirements of galvanized iron. </para>

                        <para>. - When I secured leave to continue my remarks last night I had made a statement with respect to the numbers constituting the British electorate under the revised franchise. I remarked that there were about 20,000,000 people who would be in the new electorate. At the time, the debate having arisen unexpectedly, I had not the authorities with me, and some honorable members opposite questioned the accuracy of my figures.  I  have to admit that, with regard to the numbers previously on the British roll, under the old franchise, I made an error by mentioning that the total was 12,000,000, instead of which it should have been 8,500,000. But, concerning the numbers to be added to the roll,  I  was approximately correct in quoting the total at somewhere about 10,000,000 people. The actual figures  I  have taken from <inline font-style="italic">Whitaker's Almanac</inline> for 1917. This work of reference sets out the franchise in 1916. The total number of British electors on the roll, the year before that, was 8,357,648. The population in 1914 was 46,431,514. I have ascertained the numbers to be added to the roll by reference to a <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the British House of Commons, dated 22nd May, 1917. Therein, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> B. Watson says - </para>

                        <para>The right honorable gentleman in charge of the Bill pointed out that the old register for the United Kingdom contained rather more than 8,000,000 voters, and this measure will add rather less than 3,000,000 male voters. To this 11,000,000, about 6,000,000 women will be added, or rather less than half the adult female population. The whole electorate will be raised to something like 17,000,000, of whom 6,000,000 would be women. </para>

                            <para>- I have just explained that I was under the impression that the old roll contained something like 12,000,000 names, and that the new roll would add about another 10,000,000, making the aggregate about 22,000,000. It appears now that the total new electorate will comprise somewhere about 17,500,000. It means that there will be more voters added to the new electorate than has ever before voted in Britain. </para>

                    <para>I have attempted to point out that, in my opinion, if this Parliament desired to introduce a proper system of political democracy, instead of honorable 'members being required to discuss such a measure as this we would be dealing with the initiative, the referendum, and the right of recall - the initiative, in order to give the people outside Parliament power to initiate Bills for the Legislature; the referendum, to permit electors as a whole to signify their approval or disapproval of proposed legislation ; and the recall, to enable electors to exercise proper and necessary control over their political delegates. I believe that the logical outcome of a reformed Parliament of this description would be that the elected representatives of the people, instead of acting as we do now - that is, in talking for the most part on proposed legislation - and having very little material effect upon the country as a whole - would elect the Government of the day; and the members themselves would be divided into Committees. The whole Parliament would resolve itself into a business Committee, and could be subdivided into Committees to deal with necessary legislation. Every member would have a direct interest in proposed legislation, and the Government of the day would be a truly National Government, since it would be elected by the whole of the representatives of the people. That is my conception of a democratic Parliament in the sense of political Democracy - the parliamentary machine democratized, brought up to date, and made efficient, the people having the power to initiate legislation and to pass their verdict upon it after it has been drafted. </para>

                            <para>- When the sitting was suspended I was remarking that,  though, .political Democracy, as I have at-, tempted to outline it, is eminently desirable and necessary, it does not, from my point of view, affect the real question at issue in this, as in every other country, . namely, the establishment, not merely of political, but of industrial Democracy. In every age, and in every land, the social, intellectual, and governmental institutions have reflected, and have arisen out of, the prevailing economic system of that country and period. This is clearly shown in the evolution of the parliamentary system of government in British1 speaking countries. I have already endeavoured to prove this, though perhaps I have not dealt with it in an adequate maimer, because it is inevitable that, if I attempted to deal with the subject of sociology generally, I should be led away from the discussion of electoral matters. But the conflicting economic classes have from time to time in the world's history - from the time of primitive communism, through that of barbarism, and through the feudal period to the present day of capitalistic  production for profit and its consequent camouflaged system of wage slavery - seized- power as each became the dominating factor in the economic life of the community, and have reflected themselves in the governing institutions of that period and country. Thus, the aristocratic <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> in England was superseded by the rising .capitalistic class, which restricted, the powers of the King, eventually wiped out the authority of the barons, established parliamentary institutions, inaugurated Electoral Acts, and enabled that particular economic class to function politically. Hence we had the Reform Bill as the occasion warranted it. The working classes of Britain are so inadequately enfranchised that under the latest Electoral Act 9,000,000 additional persons will be entitled to vote. Had adult suffrage been adopted, the estimate which I gave last night would have been correct. But women in Great. Britain are not entitled to vote unless they are thirty yeaTS of age and possess certain property qualifications, or unless their husbands possess those qualifications. Consequently, there are millions of women in England to-day who are denied the right to vote. But, nevertheless, then has been, throughout the centuries, a gradual diffusion of political power in the hands of the rising economic classes. </para>

                    <para>To-day, with the advancement of machinery, and with the development which science has . made possible, the rising economic class of the future comprises the industrial proletariat of the world. The working classes are becoming the dominating factor in modern capitalistic  society,  and consequently the political power is' again being re-adjusted. This fact is. evidently recognised, even by the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archibald),</inline> who, in speaking here on the 26th September of the present year, stated - </para>

                    <para class="block">As a student of political economy, he evidently realizes that economic power is at the base of all political institutions, and that with the growing power of the workers as an economic class, they, in common with every other class which has preceded them in the history of Britain, will demand representation in proportion to their numbers and power. I quits agree with the honorable member when he says that we must take steps to prevent a cut-throat revolution of which he spoke. I am no advocate of a revolution by physical force in order to reconstruct society in Australia. </para>

It is, therefore, necessary for me to show where political power originates. I claim' that it originates with the class which possesses economic power in any community.

                        <para>In a paper read by Professor Leone Levi before the British Association, in September, 1865, on the Statistics of Representation, it is computed that if representation in ' England were based upon population, for every 100 votes there should be given four to the upper, thirty-two to the middle, and sixty-four to the working, classes. If, on the other hand, it were in proportion to the amount of taxes paid by each, of every 100 votes eighty-three should be given to the upper classes, thirteen to the middle, and four to the working classes. This will afford some idea of the vast social revolution which would be effected by the introduction of representation according' to population into the electoral system of England: </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">That quotation bears out the trend of my argument. I contend that if adequate electoral machinery were established in this country to enable the great mass of the people to originate legislation - if, in short, they had a real system of political Democracy - though a social revolution would be involved, it would not be a revolution by physical force. It would then rest with the workers themselves, and with their organization, to make their requirements felt through the electoral machinery that would be available to them. If, as I claim, industrial Democracy is the real aim, and not political Democracy, even given the initiative, referendum, and recall, which, though not generally operative in America, are operative in many of the States, we should still have, side by side with our political Democracy, the Plutocracy consisting of the coal-owners and the magnates of the steel and other trusts, who, by reason of their wealth, control of the press, and general power, influence and delude the people. They would still be able to maintain their system of exploitation and robbery. That is why I say that, even given the machinery which I claim it should have, political Democracy will not wholly fill the bill. We must therefore go further and establish industrial Democracy.. </para><para>I agree with the- statement of the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archibald),</inline> that if we are to avoid a physical force revolution in order to re-adjust the social system we must give the people the machinery which, according to their intellectual development and their ability to use it, will reflect their views in the political and social life of the community. To-day we have a parliamentary system of government which reflects the " interests " of this country more or less. Industrial Democracy' would not have in this country a Parliament based on geographical divisions. It would have as its administrative machinery a Parliament, a Legislative Council, or a Legislative Assembly - call it what you will - arising from the indus-. trial Democracy of the nation, and not bounded by the River Murray or the River Darling,, or any other geographical feature. Its Parliament would be representative of the  industrial interests of the country. The interests of the agricultural and other workers would be reflected in it. The representatives from the industrial constituencies would come here, and their function would be to operate the machinery of the country in the direction of production for use instead of, as now, for profit. That system is possible of attainment by the machinery of the initiative, referendum, and recall, plus political intelligence. The initiative would give the right to the necessary quota outside Parliament to call for an amendment of the Constitution. The referendum would give us the right so to alter the Constitution as to chance the whole basis of our parliamentary institutions. We could thus wipe out the geographical divisions that return political representatives to this Parliament. ' Then, with the power of recall - </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I should not be the first individual who has advocated a reform and been the victim of it, but that does not detract from the justice or logic of my argument. I am one of those who look for a social revolution - a reconstruction of society in the interests of the class to which I belong. Every other class which has preceded our class in the history of the world has, as it has attained economic power, moulded existing institutions to conform to its desires. Our present parliamentary system of government by 'individuals is the direct outcome of the development of the capitalistic form of society. The future society, to correspond to the economic development of to-day, will be concerned with the administration of industry, and not the government of individuals. Therefore, I tell the Government side that, if they provide the machinery I advocate, they will be taking time by the forelock and avoiding the clash of a physical-force revolution. Instead  of sitting on the safety valve, they will provide the people with the power so to 'alter the basis of their parliamentary institutions as to make them conform to their intellectual development and political strength. If they believe in the reconstruction of society on the lines I have laid down, that will be a sensible thing for them to do. If they do not, they will disagree with the object I have in view. But that does not do away with the fact that those members of the Government party who advocate political Democracy cannot claim to have- established a real political Democracy unless the power is placed in the hands of the people instead of in the hands of a section. </para>

With the inauguration of a real political Democracy, the representatives of the people would not be here, as I am this afternoon, endeavouring to propagate these views. They would not be here as members of different parties, but the people . would initiate the legislation and pass it after we had put it in a form that they could vote on. We should also be electing the Government from both sides of the House. It would be chosen by the whole of the political representatives of the people, and would be truly national. While the advocates of political Democracy cannot deny that position, I hold that they must go further, because political Democracy is no longer adequate to 'the economic development of the times. ' We must have industrial Democracy. We must introduce Democracy into the workshop, the factory, and the field, as well as into our political Constitutions.

                        <para>In the elections of November, 1914, in Huerfano County, Colorado, J. B. Farr, Republican candidate for re-election as sheriff, a person known throughout the coal country as " the King of Huerfano County," was returned as elected by a majority of 329 votes.  His  rival, the Democratic candidate, contested the election, alleging " malconduct,  fraud and corruption." The District Court found in  Farr's  favour, aud the case was appealed on error to the Supreme Court of the States. On 23rd June, 1916, after Farr had served nearly the whole of his term of office, the Supreme Court handed down a decision which unseated him and the entire. ticket elected with him, finding in favour of the opposition ticket in all cases and upon all grounds charged. </para>

                        <para>The Court decision first gives an outline of the case, using, for the most part, the statements of the counsel for the defendant, Farr; so that for practical purposes the following may be taken as the coal companies' own account of their domain: "Bound the shaft of each mine are clustered the tipple, the mine office, the shops, sheds, and outbuildings; and huddled close by,- within a stone's throw, cottages  of the miners built on the land of, and owned by the mining company. All the dwellers in the camp are employees of the mine. There is no other 'industry. This is  Hie camp.' Of the eight ' closed camps '  it  appears  that practically the same conditions existed in' all of them, and those conditions were in general that members of the United Mine Workers of America, their organizers, or agitators, were prevented from coming into the camps so far as it was possible to keep them out, and to this end guards were stationed about them. Of the" eight ' closed ' camps, one of them, 'Walsen,' was, and at the time of the trial still was, enclosed by a fence erected at the beginning of the strike in October, 1913. </para>

Thus each election precinct, by this unparalleled act of the Commissioners, was placed exclusively within and upon the private grounds, and under the private control, of a coal corporation, which autocratically declared who should, and who should not, ' enter upon the territory of this political entity of the State,, so purposely bounded by the County Commissioners. </para><interjection>

Indeed, it appears that in one instance the Governor and Adjutant-General of the State, while on official business, were denied admission to one of these closed Camps. And that on the day of election, the Democratic watchers and challengers for  Walsen  Mine precinct, one of which was  Neelley,  the Democratic candidate for sheriff, were forced to seek and secure a detail of Federal soldiers to escort them into the precinct and to the polls, and that such soldiers remained as such guard during the day and a part of the night. </para><continue>

I am endeavouring to point out that in a country whose political system is on all fours with ours, and in many of the States goes beyond it, because the referendum and the right of recall are known there, wealthy and corrupt combinations have nullified it. -  </para>

                            <para>- I have attacked the system of electoral representation provided for in the Bill. The measure will be useless if it does not provide for a system at least approximating to political Democracy. I have pointed out the lines that should be followed to obtain political Democracy, hut I have contended that even if we had a political Democracy other measures would still be needed to prevent it from resolving itself into a plutocracy. If I am in order I shall proceed with my quotation - " But if there were any doubt concerning the conditions of the closed camps and precincts, and the exclusion of representatives of the Democratic party from discussing the issues of  the  campaign within the precincts comprising the closed camps, it is entirely removed by the testimony of the witness  Weitzel,  for contested (Farr). He testified that he was a resident of Pueblo, and was manager of the Colorado Fuel_ and Iron Company; that Rouse, Lester, Ideal, Cameron, Walsen,  Pictou,  and McNally are camps under his jurisdiction; that he had general charge of the camps, and that there waa no company official in Colorado superior to him, in this respect, except the President; that the superintendent and other employees arc. under his supervision; that the Federal troops came about the 1st of May, 1914, and continued until January, 1915. That in all those camps he tried to keep out the people who were antagonistic to the company's interests; that it was private property, and so treated by his company; that through him the company and its officials assumed to exercise authority as to who might or who might not enter; that if persons could assure or satisfy the man at the gate, or the superintendent that they were not connected with the  United  Mine workers, or in their employ as agitators, they were let into the camp." </para>

                            <para>- I have dealt withtho Bill from the stand-point of the electoral system of Australia generally, since it is impossible, except in Committee, to consider in detail its provisions. As to the objections one might entertain in respect of the measure, I may say at once that I am opposed to the whole system of political representation in Australia to-day. It is an outworn system - a relic of economic conditions that do not prevail to-day. Political Democracy in this and every country is a huge farce. There is, in fact, no such thing as political Democracy in existence. </para>

                        <para>.- Since I regard this Bill as primarily one for discussion in Committee, I shall not at this stage debate it at any length. I should like, in the first place, to congratulate " the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> upon his lucid explanation of its provisions, and also upon the character of the Bill itself. The two outstanding features of the measure are the provisions relating to preferential voting in respect of elections for the House of Representatives and for the restoration of the postal vote. These  amendments of the law mark an advance in the right direction. Preferential voting has been part of the policy of our party for the last five years. When, we went to the country in 1913 it was one of the leading planks in our platform, and I am glad that the Government are now about to give effect to the principle. There are, however, certain disappointments associated with the Bill. I regret that the Minister, in introducing it, was not able to announce that he had arranged with the various State Governments for a uniform roll for State and Federal elections, since such a reform would mean a considerably reduced electoral expenditure; and I regret, also, that he was unable to announce that an . agreement had been arrived at for a uniform system of voting in substitution of the dual and confusing systems now operating in the State and Federal spheres. As to the provision - for the restoration of the postal vote, I think that the limit of 15 miles might well have been reduced by the Minister. That, however, is one of the questions with which we shall be able to deal more effectively in Committee. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Many honorable members, and a large section of the public, will be disappointed to find that the preferential- voting system is to apply only to elections for the House of Representatives. I find it difficult to understand why the Government, which is responsible to the country for the introduction of electoral reform, should have brought in such a. partial system in this regard. The Bill should have provided for the application of preferential voting or some other reformed system of voting to elections for the Senate. I agree with those who have stated that if, at the next general elections, we have running side by side preferential voting for the House of Representatives and the present system in respect of elections for the Senate, great confusion will, in all probability, result. It i3 not at all difficult to understand why many people who are called upon to exercise their electoral privileges on comparatively rare occasions should become confused when they enter the polling booths to record their votes. It is the duty of this Parliament to simplify, instead of to further confuse, the procedure. I am not only disappointed at the failure of the Government to provide in this Bill for the application" of preferential voting to elections for the Senate, hut I regret that provision has not been made for a further reform in the direction of the subdivision of the States into' electoral divisions for the Senate' instead of each State being polled as a. whole. One of the greatest curses in Australia at the present time is the centralization that is going on in every State. In Victoria we have probably the most shocking example of this, since 50 per cent, of our population is to be found within the metropolitan area. Under the block-vote system, the swing of the electoral pendulum throws the electoral power into , our large centres of population. The large cities throughout Australia dominate the Senate vote, and under the ticket system overwhelming majorities are recorded for one particular party in all our big centres of population. </para>
                    <para>The present Senate electoral system has been spoken of in this House as being peculiarly one for the preservation of State rights. It has been said again and again that the block-vote system affords the only means by which the rights of the States, as within the Federal sphere, can be preserved. That, however, is an entirely erroneous view. Those who have read the debates that took place when this question was under discussion in the Federal Conventions, will know that provision is made in the Constitution to enable this Parliament to determine what electoral system shall be applied to Senate, elections and to decide whether in respect of the Senate each State should be polled as one division or subdivided into electorates. Section 7 of the Constitution provides that - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The Senate shall be composed of senators foi each State, directly chosen by the people of the State, voting, until the Parliament otherwise provides, " as one electorate. . . . </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">When that clause in. the draft Constitution Bill was before the Convention, a very considerable debate took place on the question as to whether each State should be polled as one electorate, or should be subdivided into electoral divisions. The late Lord Forrest suggested an amendment which would have left to the State Parliaments the right to subdivide the -States into electorates for the election of senators, and in the debate which followed that proposal such distinguished men as the late Lord Forres;, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, as well as other prominent statesmen, put .forward the view that the interests as well as the manhood of the various States could be protected only by subdividing the States into electoral divisions for the Senate. While the matter was under the consideration of the Convention, five of the six State Parliaments forwarded requisitions urging that the provision for the polling of each State as one constituency for the Senate should be excised from the Bill, and that the State Parliaments should be free to determine whether each State should be polled as one division or as several. A long debate followed, and the provision to give the Parliament the right to determine whether the one electorate should continue was expressly inserted to enable the alteration to be made if it was believed to be justified by experience. The time has now arrived when we should give effect to that power embodied in the Constitution, and spread the representation as far as possible, so that the people in the remoter parts may have an opportunity of electing their senators. Would anybody suggest that we should have recourse to the block system of voting for the House of Representatives ? </para>
                    <para>Since the beginning of Federation, it has been observed that the man who is best known, or is put on the ticket of some powerful organization or newspaper, has the best chance -of being returned as a senator; and, as a matter of fact, the great bulk of the electors vote for men without ever having seen them. It is impossible for a candidate to make himself sufficiently known all over a State so as to avoid a blind vote of the kind I have indicated. </para>

                    <para>We cannot have a prosperous population in Australia unless we develop our various interests to the " utmost. There cannot be big manufacturing industries in the cities without great land settlement and the production of raw materials in the country districts. We must recognise that we are a great territory with a few people, and with a greater proportion of the population in the cities than is to be found in any other country in the world. It should be the duty of this House to so distribute electorates as to enable the residents, even in the remoter parts, to speak adequately in this Parliament. So far we have not aimed at that object, but have only got as far as one vote one value. I know that that is a very pretty cry, something like that of land nationalization- theoretically perfect, but impracticable when put to the real test. </para>
                    <para>I know that there are several . electorates in Australia larger than mine, but the Wimmera- covers nearly a fourth of Victoria ; and it is not so easy to re-'  present  30,000 or 35,000 people in such an electorate as it is for a man to represent a similar number in a city electorate, which embraces only a few miles. I do not say that we should alter our bedrock system of the franchise. I believe in the universal franchise, because then -the people, through the ballot-box, become the rulers of Parliament, and if Parliament is not up to their ideal, the responsibility is theirs. </para>

To put the matter another way, in Victoria, as an illustration, we have over and over again found that the overwhelming majority cast' in the metropolitan areas has been more than sufficient to neutralize a majority for certain candidates in country districts : and ' Victoria? in this, respect, is only typical of other States. It has always been recognised that under our electoral system there must be a preponderance of voting power in the big cities as against the country districts. It is the only way we can have anything like decent representation in this House. States are cut up into electorates so that some attention may be given by specialized representation to various interests in the country districts, which would not be possible if the block vote were applied to elections for this House. </para>

                            <para>- I would not object to a system of preferential voting at ordinary elections by subdividing each State into three electorates, or as the honorable member for Wilmot has suggested, wo might have proportional representation in the case of a double dissolution. We could have, under ordinary conditions, preferential voting for both Chambers. I do hope that the country members will not lose this opportunity, which may be the only one they may have for many years, to make some amendment of the system of electing senators. The rapid trend of population is from the country districts into the .towns and cities, and if Parliament does not take a hand and do all that is possible to stem that tide, and encourage the country interests, we shall continue to be confronted' with this serious problem - the great bulk of our population still further concentrated in the large cities, and a great reaction in respect of production and the general progress of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>.- It has been my custom at all times to welcome any Bill which will permit me, as a member of the House, to amend any law in the direction of advancing Democracy and the welfare of the people. At first I felt inclined to say that this Bill should 'not have been introduced at this time for the reason that over a quarter of a million of the bravest of our soldiers are away, and therefore will not be able to bring their pressure to bear on the improvement of the measure. Another objection to 'the introduction of the Bill now is that more important measures should be brought before the House. Foremost amongst them is the long delayed amendment of the ' Tariff. I would like to see also a special measure for the. introduction of my old friend the initiative and referendum, and its later and highest political development, the recall. I suppose I shall not be able to get my wish on that matter, although I think that if a referendum of the people were taken the people would compel Parliament to deal first of all with the Tariff, and then with the referendum and initiative and the recall. </para>

Honorable members will recall that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> had the. right in connexion with the last Federal election and the conscription referenda, to indicate a party ticket for the soldiers at the Front. Cognisance was taken of the fact that the soldiers would -not be familiar with the individual names of many candidates; therefore the party ticket was introduced and operated under a regulation of the War Precau-tions  Act. I hope to see the time when the suggestion I am making will be embodied in an amending Electoral Bill, and if an opportunity should occur in Committee, and I am promised reasonable support, I shall move such an amendment in this Bill. </para>

                    <para>Another amendment I should like to see made is that all persons who are under the Australian flag should have the full privilege of citizenship and the right to vote. In the far flung portions of the Commonwealth, such as Papua, the Northern Territory, the Federal Territory, and Lord Howe Island, Australian citizens should have the right to vote, and it is not proper that this Commonwealth, of which we boast as the freest and greatest Democracy in the world, should refuse some of its citizens the franchise. </para>

                            <para>- Having many years on my shoulders, I wish to see that extension take place in my lifetime, and I hope that in Committee, or perhaps when the Bill reaches another place, an amendment will be proposed to give those citizens a vote. It could be done very simply. Papua could be added to a Queensland constituency. I mention that State because all ships going from Australia to Papua make their last call at a Queensland port. The Northern Territory could be, as it was when under South Australian control, a portion of the constituency of Grey. I hope the honorable member for Grey 1 <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> will not think that I have any personal animus against him in wishing to add to his already large electorate. The Federal Territory could easily be attached to one of the New South Wales electorates, and Lord Howe Island is already attached to the electorate of East Sydney. </para>

                    <para>The sections providing for voting in absence are justly retained, with amendments which should make them more useful. Seeing that 250,000 persons make use of the provision, it must appeal to every- honorable member that we should make it more easily availed of. </para>
                    <para>It has been estimated that 77,000 persons will be benefited by the restoration of the postal vote. As one who has suffered more from that form of voting than possibly any other person in the world, I may be permitted- to say a few words in regard to it. In the small subdivision bounded by Spring-street, Elizabeth-street, Bourke-street, and Victoria-street, in the Melbourne electorate, in the campaign in which I opposed the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Malcolm</inline> McEacharn - peace to him, and to every one who goes through the shadows - more postal votes were polled than were recorded in the whole of the State of Western Australia at two elections, or in the whole of the State of Queensland in one election. At least £5,000 was spent upon that election by my opponent, and it' is not to be wondered at that every postal vote was known to the men who conducted his campaign. This is proved by the fact that two of them had their passages paid to South Africa when- they thought that I was on their trail. Bribery and corruption of the vilest kind were resorted to. Of the two secretaries I had to fight, one had served a term of imprisonment, and the other should have been imprisoned for his natural life. I refer to Carey, who robbed a building society of £16,000, and left the State. He was so audacious in his manipulations that I said to my committee, when they were securing sworn declarations, " I want to catch that man above all others." </para>
                    <para>Three or four years afterwards Carey asked me if I would care to go and see how the card system was manipulated during that election. He said, "As an instance of how complete it was, I can tell you that we polled the vote of a man who had changed his residence on twenty-four occasions within six months. So that you will see there was some value in it." I accompanied him, and I saw that all he had told me was true. Later on, he desired to join the Labour party, and, in fact, took steps to do so. He astonished me in Collins-street one day by stopping me, and saying, ""Well, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney,</inline> I have joined your party." Ireplied, "Have you?" He said, "I have given your name and that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prendergast</inline> as my references." I looked at him, and said, " Let us be straight, right here. If they ask me, I will say that I consider you to be one of the biggest scoundrels I have ever met, and that I tried my level best to pin you. If I could have got one solitary sworn declaration against you, I would have had you in Court." He said, " That may be straight, but it is rather awkward for me." Ultimately he robbed the building society of £16,000, and went away. The two election secretaries, Frost and Carey, were the men I was up against, and honorable members will not be surprised at being told that at least £5,000 was spent in order to secure that election for my opponent, and that every vote received by post at that election was known to those who obtained them. There are two gentlemen in Melbourne to-day who took a hand in political life at that time, and they have assured me that they knew in whose favour every person voting by post on that occasion recorded his vote. It was quite possible, under the loose and lax system then in vogue;but I am glad to say that the Minister in charge of this Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> is providing greater safeguards. The Labour party has never objected to a postal-voting system properly secured by statutory rules and regulations, because it naturally recognises, even on the score of tactics, that more people belonging to the working classes suffer from illness or sickness than do those who may be said to be better off. Therefore, I am quite willing, as a member of the Electoral Commission, to give the system a fair trial, and to judge by results. </para>
                    <para>I do not think that the Chief Electoral Officer is given sufficient power, such, for instance, as the power Parliament has bestowed upon the Auditor-General or the Commissioner of Taxation. Honorable members will remember how the latter turned down the suggestion I made for the preparation of the return showing the increased profits derived by income tax payers giving numbers instead of names, in order to secure secrecy. Why should we not give the same power of independent action to the officer who is in control of the most important factor appertaining to citizenship, namely, the right to vote? </para>
                    <para>The Labour party has for many years past adopted the system of preferential voting. The system was adopted in the Victorian State House. The vote of a gentleman representing East Melbourne, the most Conservative constituency in the State, was probably the means of having the preferential system of voting adopted for State elections; but since then that gentleman has not occupied a seat in the State Legislature. He may regret having lost his seat ; but I hope that his conscience will give him sufficient consolation in that he did his duty, and endeavoured to carry out what he thought was right. </para>
                    <para>If honorable members will care to look at the report of the Electoral Commission, they will find that we suggested that, before a person could be summoned under the compulsory sections of the Act, twenty-one days' notice should be given to him to enable him to comply with the Act, and that if, on the expiry of that period, he was not then enrolled, proceedings should be taken. - </para>

                            <para>- Whilst, at a general election, it would not be surprising to find all motor cars engaged, that is not on all fours with my case. The by-election to which I refer  was  the only election held in Australia at that time, and there was not a single motor car available to me on that occasion. If many of my supporters at that time travelled in the vehicles provided by my opponent, I cannot conscientiously blame them very much for having done so. I desire that this practice of using conveyances to carry voters to the poll shall be abolished, though I agree that any one who has a conveyance of his own. should have the right to use it to go to the poll. Just as the  Switzers,  in their many cantons, travel over their mountains to record their votes, because they look upon the exercise of the vote as something holy, so I desire that our Australian people shall regard it as a sacred duty to record their votes when opportunity offers. What could be a more sacred duty than the recording of a vote which may have the. effect of making or marring the well-being of the community. </para>

                    <para>I think I have touched upon the principal features of the Bill, and when we get into Committee I shall seek to amend it, as, from my point of view, I think it ought to be amended. In order that I may do so, I submit the following: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That, contingent upon the second reading being carried, I give notice that I will move that it be an instruction to the Committee to provide in the Electoral Bill such clauses as will provide for the initiative and referendum. </para>

                        <para class="block">No Democrat can object to such a provision as that. If I were asked what words should be blazoned on the temple of Democracy, erected on the sure foundation of humanity, I should say that they should be the three words - " Initiative, Referendum, Recall." We have recognised them, to a certain extent, in our Constitution by enabling this Parliament to permit our creators - the citizens of the Commonwealth - to vote on certain' occasions that we may be informed as to what they desire. I think that this right of the creators of this Parliament should be continued throughout its existence, and provision should be made to enable the majority of the people to say from time to time, if they think necessary, whether a certain law should be amended or a new law introduced. No Democrat can conscientiously take exception to such a provision. Prom the earliest times in the history of the Mother of Parliaments in the Old Land every candidate whoever stood on the hustings seeking the votes of those who possessed the franchise; claimed that he considered it the highest honour to be a servant of the people. If that is still the feeling of those who aspire to represent the people in Parliament, it can be given effect here by providing for the initiative, referendum, and recall. I believe that these magic words will have as great an effect in this country, in the advance of Democracy, as had the three words, "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity  " in the century that has passed. </para>
                        <para>I am reminded of an excellent work, published by the late David Syme, dealing with representative government in England, and which, I think, has brought to him far greater fame than any other of his publications. On this question of the excessive election costs in the United Kingdom, I took out some figures concerning my own election expenses about eight years ago, and I found that, on the basis of United Kingdom expenses, my election would have cost £1,500 at least. From this it will be seen that had I been in England I would have been called upon to find £750, not a penny of which would have come- back to me. This expense is incurred in the preparation of polling booths, payment of officers, and the incidental expenditure. Under our franchise all that is required of any candidate for Parliament is a deposit of £25, and the signatures of half-a-dozen electors of the. Commonwealth. After the election this £25 will be returned to the candidate unless, of course, he fails to secure one-fifth of the votes recorded for the lowest successful candidate. The late James Munro, at one time Premier of Victoria, informed me that he had been offered a seat in England, but that it would have cost him between £4,000 and £5,000; and when the English members of Parliament visited Australia some years ago I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Crooks if he could tell the Labour members of our Parliament, who were then entertaining him at lunch, what his election expenses were Every man nearly fell off his chair when he said his .last election cost him £1,150. The average Labour seat in England" costs the unions or the candidate  anything from £1,000 to £1,300. </para>
                        <para>This principle of the referendum and initiative has received the indorsement of Lord Salisbury, and other members of the Conservative party, as well as the late Right  Hon.  W. E. Gladstone, and' its adoption will enable a man to keep his seat so long as he enjoys the confidence of a majority of his electors. The late David Syme, referring to the bribery and corruption in England, said that he was looking forward to the time when a constituency would have the same right over its representatives as the King has over his Ministers, namely, the right of dismissal. But honorable members need not fear that I am trying to terrorize them when I speak of the recall, for I can assure them that it would not only save the country heavy expenditure, as it would not be necessary to have an election in the same sense as it is understood at present, but so long, as a member carried out his platform undertakings and kept his pledges, thus assuring his constituents that he was the right man for the POSt- tion, there would he no need for him to face-the electors. If there is one quality pertaining to the people, speaking of the common folk, it is a sense of justice, and 1 remember that the ' late Abraham Lincoln said of them, " God must have loved the common people because he made so many of them." After twenty-eight and a half years of parliamentary experience I can say that I would not give up the confidence which the people, especially the old men and the old women, have reposed in me, for the greatest gift from the hands of any Emperor. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>I would like to repeat, so that members may be under no misapprehension, that with the referendum, initiative, and recall the law of the land, those who hold the same views as I do _ in reference to a Protectionist policy would only have to obtain a certified petition from, say, 50,000 of the electors, together with a statutory declaration that the signatures were genuine, and lodge it with the  Clerk  of the House, to insist on this question being put to the vote of the people. Under this system the differences at present existing between Ministers and members would all be swept away. If honorable members will go through the figures of an ordinary election they will find that a fair average of voters is from 60 to 63 per cent. Therefore one-half of that number, or, say, 30 per cent., would be a fair percentage to fix in a demand for the recall. Under this system members would mind their p's and q's  more than they do at present. If any honorable member will examine the figures relating to absentees from this House it will be found that, putting all the sittings together, and dividing them by the number of sessions, certain members have been absent, practically, for a good many years. It follows that when the country became used to the benefits of these three great reforms, general elections would be swept away. I look forward to the time when members will sit as long as they satisfy their creators, the voters who put them into Parliament. Under this system a member could look forward to security of tenure, knowing that, so long as he tried to carry out his pledges, he would have the strong moral and material support of his constituents outside. </para>

Honorable members will see that the system I advocate promises great advantages in the future. I cannot see why Parliament should not continue in session the whole year round. The system I advocate would eliminate burning questions. Switzerland has far greater difficulties than we have, because the difficulty caused by differences of language is always f«r greater than that caused by wide spaces of territory; yet the Swiss Parliament manages to get expeditiously through its business. The referendum and initiative remove all burning questions from the floor of the House. The Swiss Parliament meets at 8 o'clock in the morning in summer, and the roll is called. Any member absent is fined. Members have to keep a quorum without it being necessary to call the attention of the  Speaker  or  Chairman  to the absence of it. The names of members present are recorded at every division, and the absent members are fined. The House adjourns at 1 o'clock, meets again at 2 o'clock, and adjourns at 4 o'clock. In the winter the only difference is that the sittings begin at <inline font-style="italic">9</inline> o'clock in. the morning. They have two sessions of three weeks each. They conduct their business in much the same way as the directorate of a financial institution; not, as we do, with a "second board of directors to review what the first board has agreed to. I hope honorable members will agree that, if it is possible to assert the principle in this Bill, it is our duty to do so. </para>

                <para class="block">Straightforwardly  a  straight question.  I asked him the other day,  without notice,  whether he  could tell  me the name of the Minister for the Navy who,  according  to the report of the Royal Commission on Navy  administration,  had  incurred  expenditure either  without  reference to, or in  opposition  to, the Naval Board. I asked also if that Minister was still a member of the War Cabinet, and, if so, whether the Ministry  proposed  to dismiss him from office. The Acting Prime Minister said it was most  unfair  of me to ask such a  question.  What was there  unfair  about it? He said, "I have  glanced through  the report in the time  available  to me, but I cannot say to which of the 'many Ministers who have had  charge  of the Department the  statement applies."  I  venture  to say that this report is one of the most  damning  indictments ever  presented  to Parliament, yet the Acting Prime Minister would have us believe that he does not know the name of the Minister referred to in it. </para>

The section from which the honorable member has extracted the statement in question affords me no intimation as to who the Minister was to whom attention is directed. Probably a minute examination of the evidence would make this clear.

Pearce, the  Hon.  E. D. Millen, the  Hon.  J. A. Jensen, and the  Hon.  A. Poynton? The Commission which investigated the administration of the Navy and Defence Departments directed attention to the fact that a Minister had incurred expenditure without reference to, or in spite of, the Naval Board, "with unsatisfactory and costly results to the Commonwealth." Who is the Minister who ignored the Naval Board? The reply given by the Acting Prime Minister constitutes a reflection upon every member of the present Government. Are the five Ministers whom I have named, prepared to allow suspicion to rest upon them in order to shield a guilty colleague? The report of the Royal Commission is not in any way ambiguous'. It says, " a Minister " - not Ministers. The members of the Government must be very innocent if they think the public can be gulled into the belief that they do not know who this Minister is. The Acting Prime Minister has stated that a minute examination of the evidence will no doubt disclose the information. I think it would be as well  for the. honorable gentleman to hear what I am saying. </para>

I regret that the Acting Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> who was present the other day when I directed attention to this damaging report, made no attempt to reply to my remarks. Does he wish it to be inferred that he does not know the name of the Minister in question ? Upon page 29 of the Commission's report, I notice that there is printed the report of a sub-Committee of the Cabinet upon the report of the Commission. To my mind, this is a bad practice which has grown up in the. Commonwealth. A Royal Commission is appointed to inquire into alleged abuses, and before its report has been presented to Parliament, that report is handed over to the very men whose conduct is impugned, and they are permitted to attach to it a reply which goes forth to the public simultaneously with the report itself. This report of the Royal Commission, I repeat, was submitted to a sub-Committee of the Cabinet. Was the Minister for Home and Territories a member of that sub-Committee  ? </para>

The Acting Prime Minister is allowing a suspicion to rest upon every Minister who has had control of the Navy Department when he states that there is nothing to disclose who was the Minister involved, but that all- the Ministers who have been in charge of the Navy Department are included in the War Ministry. And he would have it appear that it is for this reason that he does not take the drastic step of dismissing the Minister in question from office. </para>

                    <para>. -  I desire to make a few remarks in connexion with? a statement which you, sir, made to the House about a fortnight ago in regard to curtailing the number of free copies of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that have hitherto bean- circulated weekly. Owing to the fact that the Victorian Parliament has. drastically reduced the number of copies of its <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> which were previously issued to State members, a misapprehension has arisen in the minds of many people, who believe that the circulation of our Federal <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> has been similarly restricted. Persons who would otherwise subscribe to that' publication  aTe  labouring under this misapprehension, and some steps ought certainly to be taken by you, sir, and by the  President  of the Senate, to remove it. The difference between our own <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and the Victorian <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is this : That while the State <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> had only twelve paid subscribers, the Federal <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> has practically 1,000. In some States it is impossible for the people to know what is  going on in this Parliament unless they may see copies of the Federal <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Persons who were receiving free copies, but did not desire to retain the privilege of reading the Federal <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> were rightly advised by you, sir, and by the  President  of the Senate, I understand, that if they no longer wished to receive the numbers, they would not be further sent to them - that was, if they so intimated. But there should be no misapprehension in the public mind in regard to the Federal <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> It should be clearly intimated that if the public desire to subscribe, or to continue their subscriptions, there is nothing to prevent them from doing so. </para>

                    <para>- I think it may be advisable to reiterate what I have already stated in regard to the publication of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> It is to the effect that issues to sub scribers are not interfered with at all, and that the supplies of honorable members' copies of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> are not interfered with, either. All that has been done has been to issue a circular letter to those in receipt of free copies of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard -</inline> to those persons who are on the free circulation register - asking any who do not particularly wish to have <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> sent them, if they will intimate to the authorities of this Parliament their concurrence in the discontinuance of their copies. It is only where voluntary acceptance of discontinuance occurs that the issues of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> are no longer being sent. For example, I had a notification to-day from the  proprietor  of a newspaper to the effect that his office was quite willing to forego its free copy of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> because  it  was able to secure from other sources the information it desired. In that case, the free copy will be discontinued. </para>

One would like, if the forms of the House permitted, to designate it, indeed, by a much stronger term. It is clear that if the Acting Prime Minister had desired to give this information relating to public affairs - to the business of a public Department - he could have done so, and thus the public might have been saved the prevarication contained in his lengthy reply. The question asked was, in effect, " Who is the </para>

The section from which ho has extracted the statement in the question affords me no indication as to who the Minister was . to whom attention was directed. Probably a minute examination of the evidence would make this clear. However, all the Ministers who have ever been in control of the Navy Department are at present included in the National Government, but I see no reason to pursue the drastic course which the honorable member suggests. </para>

                        <para>- Ordinarily it does not lie with the Government to pass upon itself a vote of censure; but the Government both censures and condemns itself if it alleges that it does not know and cannot find out what is sought in the question at issue. If the matter is so difficult to discover, and is being so hushed up, then the greater is the condemnation that the Government deserves. And I concur with the honorable member for Capricornia that this information will be dragged from the Government, in spite of itself, or the Government will be dragged off the Ministerial benches, and that at no distant date. </para>

                    <para>I have re-read the paragraph, referred to by the honorable member, in the Royal Commission's report on Navy Administration, dated 18th September, 1918. The section from which the honorable gentleman has extracted the statement in the question affords me no indication as to who the Minister was to whom attention is directed. Probably a minute examination of the evidence would make this clear. However, all the Ministers who have ever been in control of the Navy Department are at present included in the National Government, but I see no reason to pursue the drastic course which the honorable member suggests. </para>

                    <para>.- It is stated in to-day's newspapers that the postage tax is to be put into operation next Monday. In my division some of the mails run only once a week, and many persons there have had no opportunity yet of knowing the intention of the Government in this matter. I ask the Postmaster-General not to surcharge letters from distant parts of the Commonwealth which do not bear the halfpenny postage tax until sufficient time has elapsed to enable those living in places remote from the Seat of Government to know that the tax has been imposed. I am sure that there is no desire to evade taxation, and where it can be proved to the satisfaction of the Department's officers that the halfpenny postage tax has not been paid because of the want of information regarding it, no surcharge should be made. </para>

                        <para>- When in town during the luncheon hour, a couple of public men spoke to me about the rumours that were in circulation concerning a certain Minister. I said that I did not wish to hear any name mentioned, and I personally declined to father any rumour. My old .friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook, is now in London, and, of course, could not have been at the meeting of the Cabinet the other day; but, nevertheless, I am anxious that no stigma should attach to him. Rumours, once started, quickly grow, and the Acting Prime Minister will do well to stop the growth of this rumour. The public is entitled to some statement from the Acting Prime Minister other than the evasive answer that he gave this morning. </para>

                    <para>Having reference to the statement made by the Royal Commission on Navy and Defence administration, that instances had been furnished to them where a Minister had incurred expenditure either without reference, or in opposition, to the Naval Board, and with, it is alleged, unsatisfactory and costly results to the Commonwealth, is the said' Minister a member of the present Australian National War Government, what is his name, and do the Government propose to dismiss him from office? </para>
                </quote>
                <para>I answered two of these questions quite definitely. As honorable members will note, there are three questions in the last few sentences. First of all, I was asked whether the Minister referred to was a  member of the National War Government. My reply was that all the members of the Navy Administration were members of the present Government. Then I was asked for the name of the Minister. To that my reply was that, having read and re-read the report, I could not find in it anything that made it clear to me as to which Minister was supposed to be involved. I shall read the paragraph in the report referring to this matter, in order to refresh the minds of honorable members, and to show where it leaves the Government in this regard. As to the third question - whether the Government proposed to dismiss the Minister from office, I answered it completely by saying that I did not propose to follow any such drastic course with regard to any of my colleagues. </para>

                    <para>The control of the Navy Department by a Board of experts, with the Minister as President, is - undoubtedly sound in principle. Instances have been furnished to us where a Minister has incurred expenditure either without reference or in opposition to the Naval Board, and with unsatisfactory and costly results to the Commonwealth. This would not occur under a proper scheme of control. It is impracticable for any Department to be managed efficiently when a Minister ignores the decisions and opinions of experts in matters not involving questions of policy. </para>

                        <para>- I believe so.

I prefer to be present when such statements are made, so that I . may deal with them immediately. </para>
