                            - With reference to the statements which have recently appeared in the press regarding
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Tudor</inline>
                            and myself, I would like to state that as far as the presents of jewellery to
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Tudor</inline>
                            are concerned, the  statements are absolutely false and have not a single atom of truth in them.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Tudor</inline>
                            has not received any jewellery from any one (excepting myself) for over twenty years, and the jewellery that I have given her has all been bought and paid for by me. The whole of the statements appearing in the press are a gross exaggeration and distortion of facts, and it is difficult to 'understand how such statements could be made by any person  of sound  mind. I believe that
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nash</inline>
                            is unable to think and reason very clearly lately owing to the fact that certain matters of a private nature have arisen. I feel confident that any officer who was in the Customs Department whilst I was there,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lockyer,</inline>
                            who was Comptroller-General, or any of the Collectors, or any one else, will state that I never at any time asked for special treatment for any firm or business. I met
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nash</inline>
                            the first time about six to eight years ago in Sydney in connexion with rowing. I was over there, and saw the Inter-State Eight Oars Race, and met
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nash,</inline>
                            who was  president  of the New South Wales Rowing Association. At that time I had not the slightest idea as to what firm he was connected with, or what was the character of his business. Some time afterwards I found out that he was the Australasian manager of Walker and

                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Hall. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nash</inline> was also  president  of the Australasian Football Council (Australian rules) and  president  of the New South Wales Football League. In 1916 I was asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hickey,</inline> the secretary of' the Australasian Football Council, to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nash,</inline> who wished to speak to me about football matters in New South. Wales, where certain difficulties had arisen. At the luncheon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nash</inline> asked my advice in connexion with certain matters, as they had purchased a ground in New South Wales upon which to play the Australian game. The whole of the conversation at that lunch was in connexion with football and the war. I do not think anything else was mentioned. At that lunch I gave <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nash</inline> certain advice, which, I understand, he followed. He subsequently invited me to another luncheon to thank me for what I had done. This was about the time . I left the Ministry, in September, 1916. The conversation again was principally on football matters, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nash</inline> said that for the advice I had given him he would like to make me a present, but I at once declined. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> M. Hickey, who was only present at the first luncheon, has informed me that he knows nothing whatever about the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nash.</inline> On the following Christmas (three and a half months after I left the Ministry) some one (I presume it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nash)</inline> forwarded to my two girls - one a bracelet watch and the other a chain and locket, as Christmas presents, and their value is only about one-fifth or one-sixth of the value stated in the newspaper. The whole of my connexion with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nash</inline> was regarding sport, and I am sure that no question respecting Customs matters ever cropped up. </para>

                                is one of the principals of the Aunger Artificial Limb Company, San Francisco, United States of America. At the age of sixteen, he had the misfortune to lose a limb in a street car accident. With the aid of his father he manufactured his first artificial limb, which he wore until the completion of his education at the High School. Upon being fitted subsequently in one of the large eastern factories with an artificial limb, the manufacturers were so impressed with the merits of the limb which he had himself manufactured that they immediately made room for him in their factory. After about eight years' experience in fitting and manufacturing artificial limbs in that and other large eastern factories, he went to San Francisco, where he commenced business for himself as an artificial limb manufacturer, and where he was very successful, building up the largest factory on the Pacific coast.

                                is the inventor of several mechanical devices used in the Aunger limbs. At the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in 1915, Aunger limbs were awarded the highest honours.  His  qualifications are superior to those of local applicants, both in his expert practical knowledge of the work and in the business management of such a proposition, as proved by his great success in his private undertaking.

I have now much pleasure in informing the honorable member that by quarantine regulation 56 venereal diseases on any vessels are compulsorily notifiable by the master of the vessel to the quarantine officer. Every case so notified is removed to the quarantine station for treatment, and there detained until cured or until replaced on the vessel when it leaves Australia. These arrangements are in force in each of the principal ports where practicable. </para>

                        <para>- Personally I have nothing against any honorable member in this House; politically I have. Politically I would do to honorable members as they would do to rae - that is, do my best to put them out of office. No one can claim that the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy represent Australian public opinion. It is true, as an honorable member interjects, that the Government secured a majority at the last election, but that majority was wiped out on the 20th December last. The resolutions carried at the Paris Conference have done more to prolong the war than anything else that has occurred during the war. The Prime Minister's speeches at that Conference did not represent Australian opinion, nor does the Prime Minister represent Australian public opinion to-day. I hope that my amendment will be carried, so that the people outside will realize that honorable members are awake to their responsibilities, and do not desire to permit two Ministers who are entirely out of touch with Australian opinion to represent them at the forthcoming Imperial Conference. During last week we heard honorable mem- - bers on the Ministerial side of the Chamber giving reasons why the present Ministry should no longer remain in office, though not necessarily for the purpose of " putting the Labour party there. I do not want honorable members to imagine for one moment that the Labour party are anxious to go to the other side of the chamber, nor do I wish it to be understood that I am claiming that any honorable member of the/ Opposition should be sent to the Imperial Conference instead of the Prime Minister, although I can claim that honorable members on this side more accurately  represent public opinion than does the Prime Minister, if we are to accept the verdict given by the people on the last great question submitted to them. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but that was on a question which the Government said was more vital than any other could be. They said that if it was turned down they would not remain in office. They are still in office, though they know better than others do that they do not represent Australian public opinion - not only on the question of conscription, but on many other matters as well. Can any honorable member say that the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy do represent the whole of Australian public opinion ? Can any one say that any honorable member sitting on the Ministerial side represents the whole of Australian public opinion? </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members of the Opposition represent a majority in so far as the last great question which was submitted to the people is concerned, and that is more than any honorable member on the Ministerial side can claim. A vital part of the Ministerial policy was turned down by 160,000 votes, and by four States out of six. The Prime Minister knows quite well that he cannot claim to represent the Labour party at the Imperial Conference. </para>

                        <para>- The Ministerial statement informs us that the British Government have asked .representatives of the Dominions to meet in London at an early date, and that&gt; the Government feel that at this critical juncture Australia must be represented. I remember, on another occasion, when a Prime Minister, whom I was supporting, was going away from Australia, the howl there was in the papers about Ministers going away and taking retinues with them, and because some of them took their wives with them. By the way, they received no extra allowance on that account, and I presume that they had to pay for their wives out of their own pockets. However, that was in peace time. Let honorable members see how many officers will be accompanying the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy when they leave to-morrow. We are informed by the press that they are to leave immediately. Will those gentlemen who are howlers for economy denounce the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy for taking a great number of officials with them? I can imagine the large-minded individual from Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Palmer)</inline> swallowing the great number of officials who will accompany a Prime Minister whom he is supporting, notwithstanding the fact that he raised objections when a number of officials accompanied a Prime Minister whom he was opposing. </para>

                <para>I wish to get on with some of the other matters that are dealt with in the Ministerial statement. I endeavour to tell the truth; I do not say, as was said at Wesley Church on Sunday afternoon last, that every honorable member in the Labour party voted against a certain motion when it is well known that they voted for an amendment to that motion, and not against the motion itself. When honorable members deliberately go out of their way to make misstatements concerning actions of honorable members on this side, we have a right to mention them when the opportunity presents itself. </para>

The party did try to obtain an amendment, but were not successful ; and, as the records prove, not one member voted against the motion proposed by the Prime Minister. I presume that under similar circumstances we would again endeavour to obtain an amendment more agreeable to our own way of thinking, and should we fail, it would not follow that we must vote against the motion. If, personally, I prefer an amendment, and fail to obtain it, I am at liberty to vote for the motion as the next best thing. As is well known, the resolution was carried on the voices. </para>

Personally, I cannot congratulate the ex-Treasurer  on his obtaining the title recently bestowed upon him. There is no man, as I say, whom I hold in higher esteem as a public opponent; but I object to titles, particularly hereditary titles; and we in this democratic country of Australia ought to set our face against them. Honorable members on this side are prepared to congratulate the right honorable gentleman so far as he is individually concerned, but we object to titles in the Commonwealth. I feel sure that the ex-Treasurer  will take this criticism in the spirit in which it is offered. </para>

My invitation to that Conference was by telegraph, and informed me that the object was to obtain harmony in this great crisis. Before the Conference, I met the whole of the representatives of Labour who had been also invited. Although the responsibility was upon the Government, they advanced not a single suggestion for the promotion of the desired harmony - not one single suggestion was made by any representative of the Government, any representative of the State Governments, or any representative of the Employers' Federation, at that Conference. When I realized that the Government had no suggestion to make, I, on behalf of the Labour representatives, of whom I was the leader by virtue of my position in this House, laid before the Conference certain suggestions dealing with what we believed to be obstacles in the way of obtaining harmony. The report of the Conference will be available to-morrow, but a condensation of it appears in the press to-day; and I should like to place on the records of the House the suggestions of the Labour representatives.

                <para class="block">I stated plainly that I did not go to the Conference in any bargaining spirit or with the intention of saying, "You must concede these things or I shall not assist in recruiting." And no other Labour representatives made any such conditions. But I and others pointed out these things as obstacles to recruiting and to the re-establishment of harmony in the community, and I said that the time had arrived for action by the people who had created those obstacles. These troubles date back to September, 1916, when the first conscription referendum was held, and they must be removed if harmony is to prevail in the community. We cannot achieve that end by any pretence that they will be removed,  because the people .outside must be convinced that their undoubted grievances no longer exist. I am not much concerned about any resolution carried at the Conference. Those who were present at the Conference know that from the outset I said distinctly that, in my opinion, no resolution would do any good, that this was not a time for resolutions but for action. Has not the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> given illustrations of victimization in which the sufferers have been men who have sent their only sons to the Front? I desire to direct the attention of the Postmaster-General to the case of  a  man who enlisted from the Postal Department, and on coming back to Australia after two years' service  resumed  duty on the 10th January last. That man had lost £252 in earnings, representing the difference between his departmental salary and his military pay. But he was told on resuming duty that he would be required to refund  the  insurance  that  had been paid by the Department on his behalf, and that he would not be granted  any  leave this year. It is cases of this kind that are responsible for the lack of harmony in the community. </para>

                        <para>- This is not the way to warm people up. Much as the honorable member and I disagree with regard to many things, he will agree that it is not right that a man who has served at .the Front for two years should be treated in the manner I have related. I shall give to the Postmaster-General the facts of this case, and if he is prepared to justify that treatment he cannot be sincere in his desire to stimulate recruiting. "We have received assurances from the Prime Minister and private employers that the obstacles we have mentioned will be removed, but the obtaining of harmony in the community will depend on the manner in which those promises are carried out. It ls harmony that I am most anxious to obtain, and I do not think we can get it while people who are in favour of only one system of obtaining reinforcements by their action prevent the best results being obtained. </para>

                <para>In this Ministerial statement we are told that the Government propose to establish a Council of Defence, a Finance Council, and State Councils in connexion with Repatriation. Do the Government think that the workers of the community are not entitled to be represented on any of these bodies? Is it not fair that the Labour party, representing nearly 1,200,000 of the voters in the last referendum, should have representation on any of these Councils? Are all the brains in Australia covered up when honorable members on the Ministerial benches put on their hats? Is no honorable member on this side, or no persons outside the House who support us, to receive consideration simply because they belong to the party in Opposition? Are the workers to be entirely ignored? I am astonished to read the following paragraph in reference to price fixing : - </para>

                    <para>In connexion with this Department, the Government proposes to avail itself of the patriotic offer of the Chambers of Commerce to place at its disposal some first class business men, to be representatives on a council which will assist the Minister and Assistant Ministers.

                <para class="block">Paney selecting members of the Chamber of Commerce to assist in price-fixing! I understand that the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Massy Greene)</inline> is to be in charge of the Butter Pool. I had a little to do with butter while I was in charge' of the Customs Department, and I remember the pressure brought to bear upon me by the butter merchants and others who desired to ship butter out of Australia in order to inflate  local prices. We are told that we who represent the workers are not worthy of a place on any of these committees; but this Council of Trade and Commerce will presumably comprise the Minister for Trade and Customs, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Massy Greene),</inline> and there is representation for the Chamber of Commerce. Are the workers to be represented ? No. Are the consumers to be represented? Certainly not. But there is representation for the Chamber of Commerce, whose interest will lie, not in decreasing prices, but in increasing them all the time. If this proposal represents all the Government are prepared to do in the matter of price-fixing they are absolutely failing.

                <para class="block">One practical suggestion I offer is that the consumers shall be given at least as much representation as the Chamber of Commerce on any Price-fixing Board. Surely the people who have to pay for the commodities are as much interested in price-fixing as are those who wish to inflate prices. With all due respect to the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Massy Greene),</inline> I say that he cannot represent the consumers of Australia in regard to the fixation of butter prices, for he is elected by the largest butter-producing district in Australia. The representatives of the butter trade told me hundreds of times, when I was Minister for Trade and Customs, that I could not represent the producers, and I say that the honorable member for Richmond is not more able to represent the consumers than I was to represent the producers. Apparently the best qualification for membership of any of these committees or councils is to be a prominent official of the Nationalist party. The honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> is a member of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry. The secretary of the Nationalist party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HumeCook,</inline> is another member of the Bureau, but no workers have been appointed to it. There is not a single representative of the workers connected with it. The Nationalist party apparently intend to keep the Bureau of Science and Industry entirely in their own hands, and to keep all representatives of the workers off it. I feel confident that the Prime Minister will admit that up to the present the Bureau of Science and Industry has not justified its establishment. It cannot show anything for the large amount of money and labour spent upon it. </para>

They involve the complete organization of all industries, primary and secondary, into associations, which will send representatives to a General Council of Commerce and Industry, and the Science and Industry Bureau will be thoroughly equipped and re-staffed, to be at the disposal of this organization. </para>

                <para>I candidly admit that I understood that what was proposed was that the Bureau of Science and Industry was to be reorganized. It appears, however, that the staff is to be entirely altered. I wish to  say here that if the Bureau of Science and Industry is to be merely an appendix to any or all of our universities, a very big mistake will be made. I deliberately expressed that view in another place, and I am more emphatic to-day in my views on that point than I was oyer twenty months ago, before I left the Ministry. The Bureau must not become a mere appendix to any or all of our universities. It must do practical and independent work or it will be of no  use at all. </para>

                        <para>- I am against that. I trust that honorable members generally will seriously consider the position I have placed before them. First of' all, I contend that the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy do not represent public opinion in Australia to-day, since their most vital war proposal has been twice turned down by the people. In the second place, it is necessary, in order to secure harmony in the community, that the obstacles to it to which I have referred shall be removed ; and, in the third place, if the Government intend to continue to do as they have been doing, and ignore the workers in the appointment of various Committees, their action, will not tend to harmony, or to our obtaining the best service from the Australian public in the solution of the great problems with which we must grapple, not only now, but in the future. </para>

                    <para>.  - We have heard from the Leader of the Opposition a speech to which, in some respects, I take no exception. The honorable gentleman is a man whose disposition ig by nature so kindly that it is with difficulty that he makes any remarks that are offensive, or even irritating, to his opponents. But he has, in fact, moved a vote of censure on the Government, and has done so for the reasons that he has set out. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The first thing I have to say is that t do sincerely regret that he has taken the course. I say so because we have been sitting in another place for some eight or nine days discussing how we were to work together for the common weal. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> as he has stated, put forward some suggestions which, in his opinion, would promote harmony between the different sections in Australia. Speaking with their authorization and on behalf of the Federal Government and of the Governments of the States, with the exception of the Government of Queensland, I set forth at the Recruiting Conference what were the views of the various State Governments and the Commonwealth' Government in regard to those suggestions. The honorable gentleman has stated the points in the course of his speech, and I will not repeat them; but I refer honorable members to the report of the proceedings of the Recruiting Conference, which will shortly be available to them. It will be found to set out clearly the attitude of the State and Federal Governments towards the suggestions submitted by my honorable friend and his colleagues. While we did not admit that all or any of the matters which he mentioned were responsible for the lack of harmony, we were prepared to meet our friends because we sincerely desired the co-operation of Labour, without .which I say now, as I said at the Recruiting Conference, it is utterly futile to expect that response to the appeal iu support of voluntary recruiting which we so earnestly desire, and which we must have as a nation struggling now in the final round of this desperate conflict. Because it was desirable above all things to secure their cordial and complete co-operation the Governments of the States and the Commonwealth were prepared to meet them. When honorable members generally have an opportunity of , learning what was conceded, they will agree that we went a very great way indeed to meet our friends .opposite. We took upon ourselves, responsibilities which we were not authorized to take by those whom we represented at the Conference. The State Government of New South Wales, for example, felt very strongly - and I do not propose to argue the merits of the question - about the late great strike, in that State, in connexion with which they had introduced legislation to de-register certain unions and punish them for striking in time of war -which they conceived to be an act incompatible with that spirit of loyalty which, at this time of all others, should actuate every citizen. They de-registered certain unions. As to that, I need say no more ; but I shall never say that the fault is always on one side in matters such as these. The point is that the Government of NewSouthWales have now said that they axe prepared, in order to secure the cordial and complete co-operation of Labour, to repeal that Act, to place the unions where they were before, to make no distinction whatever between one man and another, to have no victimization, and to restore everybody and everything to the <inline font-style="italic">status quo,</inline> except in so far as preference to unionists is concerned. </para>
                <para>As for the Federal Government, I declared that we would do, so far as in us lay, everything that was necessary to support that action. And, speaking also on behalf of the employers - as I was authorized to do - I said that the Employers Federation would also use' their efforts with every employer to endeavour to put men back to their former status, and to impose no embargo on the employment of those unionists who are now precluded from employment. The condition which existed in Sydney, last week, at any rate, was that men were, by reason of merely being members of the old Coal Lumpers Union, or of my old union, precluded from employment. All this was arranged on the distinct understanding that there should be given the complete and cordial co-operation of organized Labour. </para>
                <para>With regard to economic conscription, we said, without reservation, that we would have none of it, as a Government; and we were able to say, on behalf of the employers, that the Employers Federation would use its influence to prevent economic conscription on the part of any private firm. </para>
                <para>In the matter of censorship, we were prepared to insure freedom of speech on all matters not relating directly <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the war, the Allies, and recruiting. And I said, last of all, that I would be prepared to do something further in realization of the fact that a great deal of the real trouble had arisen, not because of the regulations, but owing to their administration. I want to remark that if I had been on the other side I might have said things about the censor even more effective than I have heard from my friends opposite. But this is what I was about to state: I propose to create a tribunal on which Labour shall be represented. There Shall be one representative of Labour, one representative of the Government, and an impartial chairman, mutually agreed upon; and, if they cannot agree, then there shall be a Judge, and he is to decide in all hard cases. We met them there. We agreed that we would not use the War Precautions Regulations for political purposes, and I spoke, of course, on behalf of the State and Federal Governments. </para>
                <para>In regard to conscription, I repeated what I had said at the show luncheon at the Agricultural Society's Grounds in Sydney, during Easter. As far as I can recall them, those words were: " Conscription has been rejected by the people. Good! The Government accept that verdict and call upon citizens to help the Government to secure recruits." </para>

                    <para>The people have decided that there shall be no compulsion in recruiting. Good! The Government will accept that. But the Government calls upon every citizen to do everything within his power to give effect to the policy that alone remains. Voluntarism has been nailed to the mast. Let it be so; but let us have no hypocritical humbug about it. Let every citizen do his utmost to make voluntarism a success. So much we owe to our country, to our soldiers, and to those who have died, to those who to-day rush into the jaws of death. </para>

                <para class="block">That is the policy of the Government, and it clearly sets out our views regarding conscription. That was the attitude of the Government at the Conference last week. We put these things forward, and presented our concessions upon the distinct understanding that organized Labour would do everything within its power to make voluntarism a success. We asked the gentlemen representing Labour there to pledge themselves to do it, to go back to their organizations and urge them to do it. </para>
                <para>They declined. Very well. All that we said that was contingent upon Labour doing these things, so far as our undertaking is concerned, falls to the ground. I want to say, on behalf of the Federal Government, however, that we shall do what we said we would do, though Labour shall do nothing. All those pledges and undertakings that I made there we shall carry out in the spirit and to the letter; and never mind whether Labour does anything or not. </para>

                        <para>- But " over there " today, although there is a lull for the moment,, our fate is undecided. And yet the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> after our week's effort to arrive at a <inline font-style="italic">modus vivendi,</inline> comes to this House and moves a vote of censure. He declares that my colleague (the Minister for the Navy) and myself are not fit to represent Australia. When the history of all these days that have come and gone since August, 1914, is written, we shall be weighed by those who care to read that history, and it will then be found who it was that really represented Australia and her best interests - whether others do or f do, whether those opposite do, or those who have stood with me. Will any honorable member say now, even after all the things that have happened with regard to myself, that there is any one of them over there having a better record with regard to Labour than If There are some honorable members sitting opposite who criticise me who themselves have done nothing for Labour. There are some men still in the Labour ranks to-day who were there when certain honorable members opposite were in their swaddling clothes, and it is the friendship of those 'men that I still retain. The men who are fighting me to-day are not those who came with me through the wilderness and fought for Labour in those early days, but are those who have climbed on the back of Labour when the cause of Labour was securer However, I pass that, and say that it my colleague and I are not able to represent Australia at the forthcoming Imperial Conference, then no two men ii Australia are. </para>

                <para>My honorable friend, the Leader pf thi1 Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> cited my' attitude at the Paris Economic Conference as one of the reasons why I should not repre] sent Australia. Now, sir, it is perfectly clear that the honorable member does not understand the scope and object of the' resolutions of that Conference. Why, sir, if there is one thing I glory in more than - anything else it is the part I took at that Conference. In what way do we make war? When I make war, it is war to the death; and I say that the only way to deal with those who are trying to grind us into economic slavery is to fight them in the spirit in which they attack us. In ten years' time this country would have been the economic vassal of Germany, just as Russia is today. The price which Russia has to pay for peace with Germany is the agreement that Germany shall control the economic destiny of that great country. Surely no man worthy of the name would support any peace terms which would place Australia in that position? Would even my honorable friend the member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> vote for a peace that handed over the economic destiny of Australia to the Germans? Never. I will never believe it of him. In this great war, "whether in the economic field or on the field of battle, I am sure that all true Australians are and will remain against Germany to the end; and if for me there be no other end but death, then I am for that  end too. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> poses as a disciple of peace ; but we heard to-day the first tinkle in a slogan, of war of another kind, and there was then very little evidence of the pacifist in- him. I am in this war because I believe in it heart and soul. Honorable members may jeer at me if they like ; but I am no Jingo, and I have proved, by my twenty-five years of earnest work for Labour, that I am no recent convert to National defence. On tha contrary, I waa the first man to stand up in this House in defence of that print- nciple. Indeed, I laid the foundation-stone of our system of National defence, at a time, too, when many men on my own side were opposed to me. In 1908 I declared that Germany was preparing for the great attack upon freedom she is now making. My right honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, who was then the member for East Sydney, ridiculed the suggestion. But the war is here. At this very hour the enemy is thundering at the gates of the citadel, and if we would live as free men we must fight. In this hour of our danger, therefore, I appeal to honorable members, and through them to the people of Australia, to unite. </para>
                <para>I shall say nothing further by way of reply to the charge that I am not fit to represent Australia, except that my life's work is the answer. I invite those who say I am not fit to represent Australia to place their finger upon1 anything I have done - excepting in this matter of conscription, to which I committed myself, because, in the hour of my country's danger, there seemed no other means of getting that support necessary for victory - to justify their charge. As for other things, what have I done? I have endeavoured to rouse the people of Australia to a sense of their duty. Does the honorable member venture to suggest that the war aims of the people of Australia are reflected. by the pacifist resolutions passed by the Conference of the Labour party? The Leader of the Opposition says the people have twice repudiated the war policy of this Government. That is untrue. I can answer that charge very shortly. I know what the feeling of the people of Australia is in regard to this war. They "&gt; are prepared to see it out to the bitter end, and it is that view I propose to represent in London. </para>
                <para>I remind the House that, during the first referendum, members who are at present sitting on the Opposition side of the House came to me and asked me to retain office. </para>

I remember also that my distinguished leader at about that time indicated that he would do something that would make the people of Australia fall down with fright !' We were defeated in the 1916 referendum by a narrow majority, but we went to the country subsequently and were returned to power on a war policy approved of by the largest majority ever given to any party in the history of Australia. That war policy included the policy of voluntarism. In our manifesto to the people, we said - </para>

                    <para>The people of Australia have' decided that they will not resort to compulsion to fill the ranks of the Australian divisions at the front.

                <para class="block">We were elected upon that policy.

                <para>My honorable friend saw fit to mak« some remarks about my honorable and distinguished friend, Lord Forrest. I think that his words were in very poor taste. I wish only to say that if he had approached this matter with that due sense of what was demanded of him as Leader of the Opposition at this time of desperate crisis, he would not have said what he did. It was unworthy of him. There was not a word of truth in his insinuation, and it was a most unworthy utterance. </para>
                <para>My honorable friend also said that we have created new offices - that we have appointed a number of 'new Ministers. As  a matter of fact, we have appointed only one more Minister than there would have been previously, having regard to the absence of my colleague, the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cook),</inline> and myself. </para>
                <para>When we go, my honorable colleague, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> will act as Prime Minister, and I ask this House and the country to give him that support which, it has lent to me. I feel perfectly confident that he will carry on the business of this country and of this Parliament in a manner, which will redound to his credit and to the benefit of the whole community. </para>
                <para>I repeat that the Leader of the Opposition has stated that we have appointed many new Ministers. But I would remind him of a fateful occurrence in another place when it was decided that there should be only a certain number of Ministers ; but, when owing to a difficulty in deciding who was to be the last one - there was a tie - we decided to put both members into office. My honorable friend was one of the two. He and myself now differ. That cannot be helped. But I feel I should be unworthy of my position if I did not take this opportunity of saying that, not only, do I accept his statement as applied to the ridiculously absurd charge which was recently published in the newspapers, but also that the opinion which I hold of him now - and that I have always held of him - is of the highest possible kind. I do not believe there is enough money in the world to buy him. </para>
                <para>I come now to the Councils of which my honorable friend has spoken. We endeavour to 'carry on this Government as best we can, but in our efforts in that direction we do not get very much assistance from "him. I would be very glad indeed to avail myself of the services of honorable gentlemen representing Labour organizations, but when I invite them to meet me, and they do meet me, they are censured by their associations for having done so. Not long ago I invited three representatives of the Trades and Labour Council of Victoria to meet me to discuss the Industrial Arbitration Act - a very proper thing for me to do. We discussed it in all amity. The next thing I heard was that these gentlemen had been rapped over the knuckles for having dared to meet me. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition, too, that Labour was invited to meet us in conference to consider the formation of a Bureau of Commerce and Industry. Its representatives came, sat there a few minutes, and then went away; neither lending us the benefit of their advice nor offering us that assistance to which we were entitled. They acted thus, notwithstanding that I had previously pointed out in my public addresses that without the co-operation of Labour the movement could not be a success, and that Labour itself has, at least, as much to gain from the organization of industry, if not more, than has capital. We shall be confronted in the time of demobilization after the war with problems such as organization alone can solve. The honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> and myself are old opponents industrially, but I know that he has at heart the interests of the men whom he represents, and I "am sure he will be interested to learn - as was stated in tEe newspapers this morning - that we have just sold practically the whole of the Australian output of zinc during the next ten years. That has been done by organization. The ideal condition of things would be to sell advantageously the whole of our primary products in the foreign market. That would be a very good thing indeed for Labour, and if we could so improve and develop the manufacturing industries of Australia as to provide employment for the hundreds of thousands of soldiers who will return to our shores when the war is over, when the era of borrowed money has ceased, and when we come down with a dull crash to the realities, that also would be a very good thing for every one. So far from saying in regard to our plans for organization that Labour shall not enter here, I say in all earnestness to its representatives, " Come along and give us a hand." We asked its representatives at the Conference the other day to go out to their organizations and urge them to help recruiting - to sound the tocsin, to tell them the truth - that Australia is in danger - and that, this was no time to talk about the minor interests of Labour or Nationalism. Yet they hesitated to do so. I said to them then - and I say now in all earnestness, "What is it that has come over the Labour movement? Why does it not stand up straight? Of what is it afraid? What has invaded it? What has emasculated that virile spirit that has carried it triumphantly to victory during the last quarter of a century?" There was a time when Labour cared for nothing; when it ignored the attempts of the wealthy to defeat it. But now it walks as if it were afraid. Above all, my honorable friends opposite are afraid to go into their organizations and tell them the truth. Yet those organizations ought to be told the truth, because they would be the first to condemn their representatives if the latter did not tell them it. The position in Australiato-day - I will not say it is desperate, because I do not wish to be charged with exaggeration -but I say it is so grave that any man who does not now act, who does not put aside all other things so that he may do his best for his country, is indeed a traitor or a decadent. He is unworthy to be called an Australian. I know that my honorable friends opposite are not unworthy. They are Australians. We differ upon many subjects. There is room in regard to many matters of ordinary concern for an honest difference of opinion. I say, further, that all those things which the Government have promised to do they will do, whether my honorable friends do their part or not. But I appeal to them to act in this hour of crisis as men, and as Australian citizens. Let them go out and tell their fellow countrymen the truth, and urge them to act. By so doing, notwithstanding any present criticism which may be showered upon them, they will earn the lasting approval of their fellows. I have nothing more to say. It may be that I shall not have an opportunity of speaking to this House again for some time, but, at any rate, I shall endeavour- </para>

I can quite understand that there are employers over whom we have no control; but, so far as the Government can put the men back where they were, we shall do so. Wherever we have the power to put things as they were we shall. My right honorable colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,</inline> has reminded me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beeby</inline> said at the Recruiting Conference that the New South Wales Government would clear up the other part of this matter. The State Government of New South Wales and ourselves, acting together, I think, are able to do everything that the honorable member wants. </para>

                    <para>.- The Prime Minister, in the speech which he delivered just before he left, made some remarks about me which I did not catch, but I have been informed that he suggested that I was a conscriptionist, and that I wished to keep him in power. I have correspondence which shows my attitude on the question of conscription. At this stage I shall not deal with the circumstances of the conscription referendum, my, connexion with the Hughes Cabinet, and my retirement from it, and the breaking up of the party, because it would take too long. Let me say, briefly, that on the return of the Prime Minister from England I wrote to him saying that, in my opinion, if he introduced conscription, he would smash up the Labour party. I endeavoured to keep the party together, knowing what a split would mean; and, unhappily, events proved me to be a true prophet. When the Prime Minister introduced the regulations to, as he termed it, " give the shirkers the shock of their lives, at the ballot-box,'' I, together with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> left his Ministry. I think that, in my own defence, it will be necessary on some occasion during the life of this Parliament to tell the whole story of that episode. I am satisfied that when I have done so the public will sympathize with me for the position in which I was placed when, as an anti-conscriptionist, I remained in the Hughes Cabinet. </para>

                <para>We have had to-day an illustration of the Prime Minister's methods. He has left to attend a very important Conference in which he will speak on behalf of Australia, or claim so to speak, but he has given the House no opportunity to express an opinion about the representation of Australia there, nor has he told us what subjects are likely to be discussed. All he did was to make a speech bid goodbye to his colleagues, and go. I wish to know why the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy have gone to England. Surely it is not to tell the British Government how to win the war, because they have made a terrible bungle of the administration of the affairs of this country. The Prime Minister cannot claim to represent any party, not even his own. I do not suppose that there is a member opposite who is prepared to trust him. </para>

We know from common report that at the meeting of the Nationalist party, at its caucus, great objection was raised to the leadership of the Prime Minister, every one hoping that he would get out, as he would have done had he been a strong man. But on that occasion, as on every other similar occasion, he raised the old cry of " Wolf ! " stating that the country was in danger, and that there was need for unity, meaning, of course, that there was need for keeping him in the Prime Ministership. His attitude reminds me of that of the profiteer, of whom we have read in the press, who, when a customer complained that he was charging twice as much for his goods as before the war, replied, "Why bring up such sordid matters now? Do you not know what is happening at the Western Front? " </para>

It is all very well for him to say that we should let bygones be bygones, and forget his words and actions, now that he has left for the Old Country, but I cannot forget them. The Prime Minister has insulted this party and a very large number of persons in the Commonwealth, and for that reason alone he has no right to go to the Old Country  and  say there that he represents the people of Australia. </para>

He objected to such a coalition, saying, " What more do we require than that we should be in Opposition, where we have won our name." At the very thought of a coalition he shed tears, and could not proceed, but had to sit down. There was great sympathy with him then, and he got his way. Within three weeks he was advocating in the Caucus the same coalition. Similarly, he shed tears in the Caucus meeting at the time of the conscription referendum, and he has shed tears on almost every platform, and I believe did the same thing during the recent Conference concerning the situation in which we now find ourselves. When he was asking young men to go to the Front he said of those who would not go - </para>

That is the language of tragedy, which we might expect from any red-eyed orator. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BonarLaw,</inline> Chancellor of the Imperial Exchequer, did not take that view of Russia in the House of Commons the other night.

                        <para>- The Prime Minister was told at that Conference the things that were standing in the way of recruiting, and has promised to remedy them. If these grievances under which the Labour party suffer are to be remedied, it will not be by the act of the Prime Minister. It will be by the act of the members of the Cabinet who remain after the Prime Minister has gone. They are men who, possibly, do not hold such distorted views of things, and who are not so vindictive as the Prime Minister. He said the other day, "Liberty is trembling in the balance." Is not that an exaggeration! </para>

                        <para>- Of course it is. No such alarm was expressed in Bonar Law's speech in the House of Commons the other night. He is Treasurer of the United Kingdom, and his statement was that the amount of money raised by taxation for war expenditure up to 1917-18 was £1,044,000,000, while at the end of the current financial year, on the present estimates, we should have raised £1,686,000,000. These figures proved, he said, that the country's financial strength after five years of war, would be much greater than could have been anticipated, and was an amazing testimony to the country's financial spirit. Finance is the most delicate barometer by which to ascertain the war atmosphere. There is no doubt in the mind of any investor in this country, or the United Kingdom, about the success of the Allies. The honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett),</inline> who said that liberty was trembling in the balance, has no doubt about the future. As a financial man, he knows that the principal investment companies in this country are earning more now than they ever did, and were' never sounder. </para>

Instead of talking about what is going to happen after the war, the Government should be attempting to win the war.

No agreement the Prime Minister enters into now will be valid after the wai-, because the old provisions dealing with State rights will then come into force again. The sections relating to trade and commerce will operate, and it is impossible for the Prime Minister or any one else to make a contract which will bind the States nine years after the war closes.

Yet the other day Lloyd George told the public that in 1917 the Allies had an overwhelming majority of troops on the Western Front. While the Prime Minister was telling us that the men were crying for help in the trenches, at that very time there appeared in the press a statement by General Birdwood that the majority of the Australian soldiers were resting, and that others were in an easy sector, while the situation permitted of hopes that they would have a long period of peace.

I mention this as a reason why a very vital question ought to be asked - whether our delegates should not go to the Old Country to urge that there should be an armistice on all Fronts, and that the representatives of all the belligerent countries, with any neutrals acceptable to both parties, should meet to discuss peace terms? </para>

                        <para>- The Government will not take that course because the Prime Minister is too afraid of losing his position. A prominent business man asked me recently, " Why does not the Prime Minister do the right thing? He is the best-hated man in Australia; why does not he get out? " I said, " He will not, because he loves the Prime Ministership too much." He is not a strong man. If he had been a strong man he would have gone to his Cabinet, in August, 1916, and said, " Gentlemen I believe in conscription; if you do not accept it, I will resign." But no, he said, " I propose to have conscription." When we defeated him on that question he brought in his referendum proposal. If he had been a strong man he would have gone back to his party after the referendum, as he was asked to do, and submitted his case to it; but no, he was afraid that the majority was against him, and he was too anxious to keep the Prime Ministership ; which, as a matter of fact, he had usurped or had purloined from this party. </para>

                <para>Had he been a strong man, he would have come to the House with conscription, but no, he was afraid to do it. All along, all his manipulations and all his intriguings have been in the direction of keeping the Prime Ministership. He says that 100,000 more men to-day would make it certain that the onward march of Germany would be stemmed. That is the kind of stuff which be has been inviting the public of Australia to accept as a reason why they should continue to send men - more and more men, an ever-increasing number of men. The exaggeration of the statement may be seen by a glance at the figures given in the British House of Commons during the passage of the Man Power Bill, showing that the enlistments for the British Empire have reached a total of 7,500,000 men, made up as follows: - England, 4,530,000; Scotland, 620,000; Wales, 280,000; Ireland, 170,000- that disloyal Ireland; Dominions and Colonies, 900,000. These, with native troops, labour corps, carriers, and similar workers from India, Africa, and other Dependencies, make up a total of 7,500,000 men. Then there are 3,500,060 French soldiers, 2,500,000 Italians, and 500,000 Americans. All these make 14,000,000 men; and if we deduct 4,000,000 for casualties, we have a balance of 10,000,000 men available for the Allies. Yet the Prime Minister, apparently with great fervour, endeavours to persuade the country that if we could only get 100,000 more men from this sparsely populated Continent the German's advance would be stemmed. </para>
                <para>As a matter of fact, no thought has ever been given by the Prime Minister, or, so far as I know, by any member of the Ministry, to the question of how many men Australia can afford to send to the war, or how much we can do financially. It would appear that the young men of this country have been put up to a kind of auction. I have no desire to exaggerate, but I say deliberately that if we read the press from the commencement of the war until recently we shall see that the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Joseph Cook)</inline> said, " We will send 20,000 men," when the Prime Minister immediately said, " We will send 40,000 men." Then the. Minister for the Navy said, "We will send 60,000 men"; whereupon the Prime Ministersaid, "We will send 80,000 men"; then the Minister for the Navy said, " Let us send 100,000 men." The Prime Minister followed by saying, " Let us make it 150,000." The Minister for the Navy next said, "We should send 200,000 men." And so the whole thing went on until the Prime Minister capped the bidding by saying, "We will send 300,000 men." There has been no attempt to ascertain how many men were really required to carry on the primary and secondary industries of this country, to see how many men could be safely spared from the cattle stations, the sheep stations, the farms, the dairying industry, the fruit-growing industry, metal mining, coal mining, or commercial pursuits; and again no serious attempt has been made to ascertain how we can finance the war, having due regard, not only to our present responsibilities, but also to those which must face us after the war. Our financial obligations demand that we must maintain and equip our men at the Front. . Canada and South Africa do not do that, but we have to do it. We have also obligations to face that will mature after the war in regard to our men and their dependants ; 200,000 or 300,000 men must be repatriated. We are heaping up a huge national debt, which is going to be shared by the producing classes of this country, the brain and hand workers who produce our wealth. </para>
                <para>I ask my financial friends in this chamber whether it is not a fact that after this war the rieh in this country and everywhere will be richer, and the poor of every country poorer? When we were introducing taxation measures, my friends opposite said, "What is the use of putting this into law - the tax will pnly be passed on to the working classes?" No doubt in a great many cases taxation is passed on to the great masses of the workers, who possess nothing. Time will not permit me to show that after the war, not only in this country, but in every country, the position that I have stated will prove to be true. </para>
                <para>We were rather surprised at a resolution which was passed the other day by a conference of railway men. That resolution was as follows :  - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>That in view of the fact that the Federal Government have made no attempt whatever to deal with the financial problems that have arisen, and will arise, through the war, and realizing that the whole burden of the war will fall on the workers, this conference advocates the repudiation of the national war debt. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I need hardly say that I do not agree with that resolution. As I have said previously, we cannot expect the general public to lend us money for nothing; indeed, we ought not to expect it . I have already pointed out that many people contribute money to our war loans who could make, very much more by investing their capital in other ways. However, I point out to honorable members who are desirous of continuing the war, apparently indefinitely, and endeavouring to do the impossible, that they are building up such a war debt that they will find the workers in every country talking in the same strain. It would appear that so long as money can be found to carry on the war, it will be carried on; that it will only end when the financiers in every country engaged in the war become alarmed as to the soundness of their security, and that when that time comes they will be prepared to discuss terms at a peace conference. </para>

                        <para>- I have always pointed out that in preferential trade we ought to have a provision that goods so favoured should be manufactured at trade-union rates, and bear a certificate to that effect; but, so far, I have not been able to get the House to see the justice and wisdom of this. Supposing we exclude GermanAustrian goods, we shall simply find these goods sold to neutral countries, . or America, or some of the Allied countries, and coming in here under the preferential Tariff. Under the preferential arrangement with Great Britain, we found that Belgium agreed with exporters before the war to pay the 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. British preference if our merchants would deal from them. </para>

                <para>Nor would it be of any use passing resolutions such as were passed recently by the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, that all goods from enemy countries should foe labelled. What was the effect of the "Made-in -Germany" label in England ? It spread German trade throughout the British Isles. It will be remembered that when the Inter-State Commission was inquiring into the piano manufacturing industry in Sydney a manufacturer said that the retailers asked him to put German names on the instruments, because these were preferred to English names. </para>
                <para>Nor should we be able to hurt Germany by a silly resolution such as that of the Honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kelly),</inline> who desires the Government to cut all German names out of the Australian vocabulary. That would not have the slightest effect, because the goods would come in, and the vendors would simply say that the articles were those which used to be known under German names. </para>
                <para>As to the German colonies, we ought to know what the Prime Minister proposes to advocate in the Old Country. At the recent Conference at Government House, the Prime Minister said that there was a peace propaganda going on, supported with German money. If so, it is singular that the Prime Minister, who is at the head of all the military and Commonwealth police, does not discover the person who is spending the German money, and put him in gaol. I have before referred to the enormous extent of territory we in Australia have under our control, and pointed out how much it is costing to develop, and with what little success. I have also urged that the annexation of the German colonies is quite inconsistent with our pledge to wage a holy war. In a speech I made on the subject, I said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>I say quite frankly, and with complete indifference concerning any abuse or adverse cricitism by the press, that we ought now to affirm that we are willing to return captured colonies to Germany the moment peace is declared. </para>

                <para class="block">By the way, when I wished to publish that speech, the censor cut out the part I have quoted. It is an extraordinary state of things when I am not allowed to tell the people what I believe would shorten the war, while others are allowed, as in the case of the Queensland Recruiting Committee, to urge that we hang on to the German colonies. </para>

                <para class="block">Recently, I picked up the report of the Lieutenant- Governor <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Murray)</inline> for Papua for 1916-17, and, without any special searching, opened it at page 47, where I came across some remarks regarding our own Territory. As to the natives being able to determine such matters for themselves, let me read you a passage from a report by the Lieutenant-Governor, after he had visited Strickland River and Lake Murray - </para>
                <para>In the morning we found that we were anchored opposite a large house built near a clump of coconuts, on some rising ground on the right hand side as you enter the lake from the Herbert River. A few men came out in canoes, but they were rather shy; there were about fifty more on shore. I saw no women or children. </para>
                <para>We went on shore after breakfast, but our landing was the signal for a general dispersion of all the natives into the surrounding bush. We followed them for some time, but could not come up to them, so we returned to the house, leaving presents on the track, and trusting that their natural curiosity would eventually overcome their fear. </para>
                <para>Proceeding, he said - </para>
                <para>In the meantime the natives were beginning to come back, some in friendly, others in hostile mood. One of the latter discharged a couple of arrows at Sergeant G. E. Gera, and another appeared to be on the point of putting one into me, when he was discouraged by a couple of shots which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> fired over his head. At a later stage of the proceedings a little old man emerged from nowhere in particular, and, nervously fingering his bow and arrow, seemed determined to try the effect of a shot upon our cook, when the man over whose head <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> had fired ran up and stopped him. Evidently the shot had had more than a momentary effect. </para>
                <para>It seemed improbable after the shots that we could establish friendly relations with these people, but by degrees the constraint wore off, and harmony reigned in its place; indeed, before we left we had them dancing and singing with the police. </para>
                <para>We had, unfortunately, no common language, but, so far as we could ascertain, the name of this house is Miwo, and there are two other villages, one further up the lake called Piwor, and another between the lake and the Herbert River called Moroyu. </para>

At the New Hebrides there is a Condominium, or mixed tribunal, consisting of an Englishman, a Frenchman, and a Spaniard, who decide disputes as they arise. This arrangement gives no satisfaction to either French or British. Only recently I saw a published complaint that, while the French" are carrying out their part of the programme with regard to the isolation of the Germans, the British are allowing the Germans to trade just as much as before the war.

                        <para>- The Germans asked the Allies to discuss peace in 1915: Without doubt, after the battle of the Marne they recognised one of their own military maxims, that when an invader is stopped, he is beaten, and they were anxious at that time  to  make the best terms possible. They again asked us to discuss peace in 1916, and the Reichstag passed  a  resolution favouring no annexations said no indemnities. But when wild speeches, such as those delivered by the Prime Minister, are made, when we talk about bringing Germany to her knees, and of boycotting her for ever after the war, we give the militarists an argument with which to approach the pacifists. </para>

I repeat that when we, have an opportunity to discuss peace, we should take it. I do not believe that the Germans will succeed in their attempt to reach the French coast. Their advance will be stopped, and probably they will avail themselves of the territory they have captured to again entrench; and when the Allies resume their offensive they will probably lose hundreds of thousands of men, as the Germans have done. If highly-placed men are in possession of information that this war will result in a return to the status <inline font-style="italic">quo ante bellum,</inline> they ought to be manly enough to say so, and not, for the sake of their miserable, paltry political reputations, continue the war longer, in the vain hope that it may bring them victory. </para>

                    <para>.- The opinions of the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> in regard to  the war are as f,ar removed from mine as are the poles apart. I hold the opinion that if we had made peace at any time during this war on the basis of the military situation it would have meant ruin to Great Britain and Australia in the near future, lt is vital to our very existence that we shall continue to fight until we are in a position to restore the map of Europe to something like the condition it was in before Germany broke upon that portion of the world with its outrages. But, as I have already indicated in this House', I am, to a considerable extent, in accord with the attitude of members of the Opposition in their antagonism to the Prime Minister, and I regret very much that I cannot support the amendment in its present form, because the Leader of the Opposition has included in it a condemnation of the Minister for the Navy. I strongly approve of the right honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Joseph Cook)</inline> going to London to attend the Imperial Conference. He is still leader of a party that has consistently taken a very definite attitude and shaped a very definite course in regard to the war, at any rate until we were beguiled into the arms of the Prime Minister. The Minister for, the Navy has stated his opinion quite* freely and frankly, that if we cannot obtain reinforcements for our men at the front by voluntary means other steps will have to be taken, and I trust that he has expressed that view very plainly and forcibly to the Acting Prime Minister, so that when this present farce of recruiting is absolutely played out the opinions of the old Liberal party, as expressed by the Minister for the Navy, may be carried into effect. We heard from the Prime Minister this afternoon a speech that was quite in his best style, a speech which 1 have no doubt will be placarded all over Australia, and will add laurels to those the right honorable gentleman has already gained by his eloquence. But I have listened to so many of these speeches made in somewhat similar circumstances that they do not affect me so much as they may affect others. I saw the Prime Minister on one occasion actually break down under the stress of his emotions when speaking in support of a certain cause, and I saw that same right honorable gentleman a week later betray the very cause for which he had shown so much feeling and enthusiasm. The Prime Minister took a great deal of credit for the patriotic and magnanimous spirit in which he claimed to have met his opponents at the recent Conference. He even protested to his supporters that they should not continue to abuse honorable members opposite in the way they have been doing, when we know perfectly well that he himself has been the principal sinner in that respect and has led the chorus of attacks on his political opponents. The Prime .Minister had in his hand, in the course, of his speech, that large and weighty volume, weighty in the literal sense, at any rate, which records the sayings, if not the' doings, of the Conference which concluded last week. I never expected very much from the Conference. I recognised it largely as an effort on the part of the Governor-General to remedy the blunder he made in calling this slacker Government back to office, and I am not surprised that in the circumstances the Conference ended with a pious resolution which takes us not a bit further forward "than we were in regard to finding reinforcements for our men at the Front. When the Prime Minister waxes so pathetically eloquent over the necessity for obtaining those reinforcements, and when he calls in frenzied accents upon the young men of Australia to do their duty, does he ever realize that he also has a duty to perform in this matter, a duty that he has carefully left alone, a duty that at the present time is almost overwhelming in its necessity and urgency? That duty is to give the country a lead in regard to recruiting. It is a duty that he and his Government must take upon themselves if they are to be a Government in anything more than name. They must take upon themselves the securing of the needed reinforcements by hook or by crook. If one method fails another must be adopted. Is there any question in the mind of any honorable member as to the absolute failure of voluntary recruiting? We have been faced during the last few weeks with the gravest crisis that has ever overtaken the British Empire. We are confronted with a position that may well bring concern to the mind of the most indifferent individual in the community. Have we had any substantial response from the manhood of Australia? I grant that in New South Wales there has been a partial response to the appeal for recruits, which has not been due to the gravity of the military situation in Europe, but to the efforts of one individual. Horse racing flourishes, and the theatres are still crammed. I came into Melbourne a few nights ago, and I felt sick at heart at seeing about the Block crowds of eligible young men, careless, happy, and absolutely indifferent, as if they were unconscious that a war was in progress. I stood one afternoon on the outside edge of a recruiting meeting at the Melbourne Town Hal!, and I heard a returned sergeant make an appeal that should have moved any man who was fit to volunteer and desired to do his duty. He asked that at least one should come forward to fill his place. What was the response? After a very great deal of pleading, one man did come forward, and he turned out to be a returned soldier. I stood at another recruiting .meeting out at Hawthorn a few nights ago, and again heard a returned officer make an eloquent and moving appeal to the crowd about him, but he appealed in vain. Then, becoming sarcastic, he told them that he had had a very successful recruiting meeting in the Town Hall a few nights before, at which he had secured four recruits, one of them an old man, and the other three returned soldiers. It is sufficiently well known that at the present time the bulk of the recruits we are getting are men with families, lads who have just reached the age at which they are permitted to volunteer, or returned soldiers. It appears to be of no use to make these appeals to men who are fit to go to the Front and whose duty it is to go. Every method by which they can  be urged to the performance of their duty has been used without result, and to prolong the farce any longer is only to continue to cover this country and its, Parliament with unutterable shame and disgrace. </para>

                        <para>- I suggest that when it is clear that the voluntary method has failed .some other .method should be adopted, and to my mind it necessarily involves compulsion. I feel sure that were that method put into operation the fearsome suspicions ' entertained of it by many people would at once be dissipated, and that it would become quite popular before very long. At all events, I wish to point out that the Government have not yet tried to introduce conscription. They have not yet made a proposal to Parliament to introduce it. If they can crack the whip over honorable members in connexion with matters of secondary or trivial importance, I fail to see why they should not endeavour to, secure support for a measure of compulsory enlistment. We are continually told that the people have turned down conscription. If there is anything of which I am more certain than another, it is that the people of Australia did not vote on the merits of conscription. I feel sure that at both referenda the majority in favour of " No " represented electors who voted against the proposal in hostility to the Prime Minister, or as a protest against such a matter being put before the country at all. I find that even those who took up a position of antagonism to conscription are beginning to express doubts as to the wisdom of the course they have adopted in the past. The ' Leader of the Labour party in one of the State Parliaments has recently been saying something -like that. I know there are many people who opposed conscription in the past because they believed that the voluntary principle had not been absolutely exhausted, but are now of the opinion that there is nothing for it but a measure of conscription. -Surely there is nothing alarming in the suggestion that the shortage under the voluntary principle in supplying 5,400 men per month should be made good by the compulsory method. I do not suggest the sweeping of every able-bodied man in Australia into military camps again. That was one of the reasons why the conscription proposal was burned down in the past. But I protest with all the earnestness of which I am capable against continuing the farce of voluntary recruiting. We all know that it is a farce. We all know that the voluntary principle has failed. There is left only one thing to make our eligible men do their duty, and that is the necessary degree of force which I believe the present Government could exercise with every justification at the present time. Whatever may have been their pledges in the past, and whatever antagonism certain members of the Government may have shown to conscription previously, all those considerations are absolutely overborne and thrust aside by the one necessity before Australia at the present time. Speaking generally, another 100,000 men will not make very much difference to our Forces fighting in France, though they might count at a critical point in a battle, and even if we started sending those men now they could hardly be in France before the present critical position is relieved. What I am proposing is necessary for the honour and reputation of Australia in the eyes of the rest of the world. We had suggestions in our cables of what America thinks about Ireland, and the attitude to conscription there. What does she think about Australia? The time may come when this country will be helpless before even as great an evil as that which threatens us at the present time, and when we shall naturally desire that America should come to our assistance. America may well decline to do anything of the kind. Australia cannot afford to neglect her duty at the present time. We have an overwhelming obligation upon us to put ourselves in line with the people of Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and America; and if we do not do it, it is a case of God help our children, at all events, if not ourselves. Let me say, in conclusion, to the Government that if they take courage and do that which I suggest is the duty which stares them in the face, I believe there will be very little difficulty about it. I fail to see that the attitude of the people of Australia will in any way differ from the attitude of the people in other countries of the Allies that have accepted conscription from their respective Governments. On the other hand, the necessity is now greater and more clamant, and the justification for conscription more complete than ever it was before. So far as I am personally concerned, I do not hesitate to say that I shall continue to do everything in my power to spur the country, the Parliament, and the Government to the performance of our plain , duty in the only way in which it is possible for it to be performed. I am sorry that I cannot support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Tudor). I am in accord with the spirit of it, but for the reasons I have already stated, my vote cannot be given in favour of it. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> seeks to put in plain and specific terms the reasons why objection should, and can, be taken to Australia being represented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> at the forthcoming Imperial Conference. That objection is based on experience, because honorable members will recall that in 1916 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> who was then Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Government, attended the Imperial Conference; and it was with the full concurrence, not only of his party, but of the whole House. There is some ground for the objection raised by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> with respect to the inclusion of the Minister for lie Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cook)</inline> within the scope of the amendment; but honorable members may perhaps recall in my favour that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was- about to depart in 1916 I suggested that the then Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cook)</inline> should also proceed to London so that both parties and both sections of the community should be represented and their views expressed before the Imperial authorities. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>It is largely, no doubt, because of the conduct of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> at that Conference that objection has now been taken to his departure for London. What happened there we do not yet know. There was a secret session of both -Houses of the Com-*, monwealth Parliament upon his return, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was expected to detail confidentially to honorable members something of the discussions which occurred at the Imperial Conference. We heard a good deal about other things, but nothing about the Conference itself. And, so far as Australia is concerned, what happened there, how Australia was represented, whether our views were expressed as we would have wished them put, or whether the attitude of Australia in regard to war problems was clearly shown, is quite unknown to honorable members even at this distant date. What we do know is that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> arrived in London, he, in a really remarkable way, abandoned the political friends with whom he had been associated previously. He forsook the friends of the party he was then leading, and sold himself to Lord Northcliffe. </para>

                        <para>- At that Conference <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> went alone. The Opposition at that time made no claim and asked for no representation. But, as it turned out, their views were represented, while the views of the party which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was leading were not represented, because his utterances in London and Paris were not then, and are not to-day, the views of the Labour party in Australia. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> went to England in 1916 he was alone, and with his clever ability to stage-manage things, he took the whole of the limelight; it was a well-known fact that he' refused to allow even prominent Australians, including the High Commissioner and such visitors from the Commonwealth as members of this Parliament, to either assist or be associated with him in the work he was doing. Honorable members will also recall that last year another invitation was stated to have been received, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> again accepted it, and was prepared to leave for London forthwith. But at that time, evidently, his new-found political friends were not quite sure of letting him go alone, and it was decided that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine should accompany him. Why those two, and why two, we have not been able yet to discover. </para>

                <para>Of their quality I am not complaining, but we wondered why two had been chosen to watch <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> when the Labour party had been content to let him go alone. Possibly it was that his friends profited by  out  experience, and decided to send two of his colleagues to keep a -watch on him. However, that- particular visit collapsed ; and it was not due to anything that we did, or were able to do, but because two of the Prime Minister's own supporters in the Senate at the last moment carried a motion which compelled the abandonment of the trip, exactly a day before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was to have left Australia. That Imperial Conference was held, and Australia's views were more clearly known in 1917 by our non-representation thereat than in the previous year, when we were represented. </para>
                <para>Coming to this present visit, honorable members will bring to mind the secrecy which surrounded the departure of the Prime Minister in 1916. They will recall the remarkably clever strategic manner of his leaving Sydney, and they will remember the acclaims of the people which rang in his ears as he was about to leave, together with the arrangements which were made in Melbourne, Adelaide, and Fremantle for farewell meetings. And we ali know how he left Sydney, and, after going a few miles, doubled back on his tracks; and presently we heard of him in America. One wonders why there was all this secrecy in respect to. his departure. Yet that has been almost paralleled by the circumstances of his present departure from our shores. Even oh Saturday last he bluffed his own constituents in Bendigo. He is reported in the <inline font-style="italic">'Age</inline> of Monday to have said - </para>

                    <para>The voices of the other Dominions will be heard at the London Conference. The voice of Australia will be silent. What will our soldiers, who have borne the heat and burden of the day, who have endured, fought, bled, and sacrificed all things in order that the honour of Australia might be upheld -what will they say when they learn their country is not to share in these vitally important deliberations? What can any loyal Australian say of a party calling itself Australian which thus deliberately inflicts this humiliation and injury upon his country? </para>
                </quote>
                <para>And what has Australia lost by not having been represented on that occasion ? During this present visit to Europe the Prime Minister will not go near the soldiers - I venture to say. He will not ask their opinion about this trip. He has lively recollections of the last occasion, in similar circumstances. No. The front line will not see him. He may get the soldiers to again walk 11 miles to hear him talk, and then trudge another 11 to their work on the Front again. The Prime Minister sighed, and cried, and whined because he was not allowed to go last year. </para>

                <para>What the Imperial Conference proposes to do this time we do not know. Certain it is that it cannot do anything to increase Australia's active interest and  concern in regard to the war. We differ upon the methods for securing reinforcements for. our troops;but the attitude of the people and . the part taken by Australia need neither apology nor excuse, and the Imperial Government would be the last to suggest that there is anything wanting in Australia's support in relation to the war. We may have our own opinion - and some of us have very definite opinions - concerning the methods of conducting the war ; but in regard to the necessity for persevering in the effort to secure a satisfactory and lasting peace the people of Australia are of one mind with the Imperial authorities. </para>

                        <para>- I think it was. It will be remembered that when the figures for the last conscription referendum were announced the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> and other British papers said that the vote did not mean any lessening of Australia's interest in the war; But that it merely indicated that Australia did not approve of that method of: finding the men. We have not heard one word yet of complaint from the other side, or any derogatory statements, in regard to Australia's share in this war. The Imperial Government know what our attitude is, and apparently they are satisfied, so what can this Imperial Conference hope to achieve ? Will it determine what is to be Australia's position after the war? Will it consider the question of the German colonies in the Pacific, and the probable effect their re-occupation by Germany will have upon Australia's future safety? If so, then the Prime Minister of Great Britain must again make an alteration in his statement, because he has said quite clearly that the position of the German colonies and their place after the war must be determined by the Peace Conference, so the pending Imperial Conference can be of no use so far as that matter is concerned. </para>

I only hope, now that the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy have gone, that they will have a successful trip, that the Imperial Conference debates will be of some value, and that when they come back we will have an opportunity of knowing what it was all about. Up to the present we have been told nothing, although we have asked repeatedly if the representatives of this Government were going to London, what they were going to discuss, and if the House would have an opportunity to express its views upon the various subjects. That opportunity has been denied to us, so that the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy are now on their way to London with a free hand, so far as any instruction from this House is concerned, whatever instructions may have been given to them in the National party's Caucus room. </para>

The one satisfactory feature about the whole business is that they cannot commit Australia to anything, and that,afterall, their visit will be purely of an advisory character. That being so, I submit that the expenditure involved by the retinue accompanying the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy will impose an unreasonable tax upon. Australian finances at a time when economy is being so assiduously, and so properly preached by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt).</inline></para>

                        <para>- As I have already said, the Prime Minister's attitude on his former visit to London establishes his unfitness to represent Australia at this juncture.  His  utterances at the Paris Economic Conference, and those of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George - especially those known as  the" knock-out blow " speeches -have done more than anything else to prolong this wax. This is not merely my own view, but it is corroborated to a large extent by the press of Great Britain. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> pointedout to-night that the speeches made by the Prime Minister at the Paris Economic Conference, where he denounced all idea of future dealings with Germany and maintained that nothing but the absolute annihilation of that country would be satisfactory, that Germany must be so absolutely overwhelmed that she never could hope to rise again, were circulated in the trenches among German soldiers. I leave it to honorable members to imagine howGerman resistance must have been stiffened when the German people realized that even after the war was over a ruthless and determined economic war would be conducted by the Allies. I have repeatedly stated that, in my judgment, the Prime Minister has proved himself to be the greatest pro-German in this country. </para>

I believe you encourage enemy peoples more by telling them you are going to keep at them until they are absolutely and hopelessly crushed than by cheering them.

                <para>Mr.FINLAYSON.-  President  Wilson has absolutely repudiated the Paris Economic Conference resolutions. The latest utterances : by Mr. Lloyd George, when stating the war aims of the Allies, are to the effect that it is not desired to disintegrate Germany or deprive her of her great position. That question, he now points out, is a matter for theGerman people. With few exceptions, that represents the view of all leading men. They state that it is not our desire to destroy the trade of Germany, but to crush Prussian militarism, and that when that is done our work will befinished. </para>

                <para>It is unfortunate that the Prime Minister should seek to represent Australia at the Imperial Conference, because he is so unreliable and uncertain. I admire his fervid and patriotic utterances, and I question if there is another man in Australia who could make such telling speeches in regard to the war. But even in this House to-day we heard him repeating that when he went out to fight, whether it was a physical or economical struggle, he went out to fight to the bitter end. Thus, expressing this sentiment, he has gone from Australia with the intention of fighting Germany to the end - fighting her in the present struggle, and fighting her afterwards. </para>

                        <para>- Or of the people of Great Britain. It is undoubted that since the Paris Economic Conference the views of the people of Great Britain and of our Allies have undergone a remarkable change. A change was expected to take place when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> was dethroned and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George was elevated to his position, as the result of one of those clever tricks for which the present Prime Minister of Great Britain is so well known, and of which our present Prime Minister is so apt a pupil. On the occasion of his last visit to England, the Prime Minister sold himself to the Northcliffe press. That fact has been published in glaring language, and it is now stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George is nothing but the puppet of the Northcliffe press. He is dominated by Lord Northcliffe, Lord Beaverbrook, and Lord Rothermore. These men, and not the Parliament, are the real rulers of Great Britain. </para>

                        George has just completed a year in office as Prime Minister. He has held the highest position in the biggest Empire in the world, with greater powers and greater opportunities than any man has ever had before in recorded history. He has abused every power, and missed every opportunity.

                    <para>He does not trust the people, and the people do not trust him. He tells us that the enemy are being beaten and are whining for peace, and twelve months afterwards he tells us that they are at the height of their boastful power. He tells us that he has effected complete harmony and co-ordination with the Allies, and twelve months afterwards he tells us that that unity was all pure make-believe. (At any rate, he will never make us believe anything again. ) He tells us that he has no further fear of the submarine, and a few days afterwards his First Lord of the Admiralty tells us that the submarine menace, though held, is not mastered. He boasts that on a certain day we destroyed five submarines, and a few days afterwards his First Lord of the Admiralty has publicly to deprecate the drawing of deductions, not merely from any one day, but from any one week or month. </para>

                        <para>- I believe there are plenty of persons in Queensland who hare heard of the <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> newspaper in Brisbane, but to whom the idea of spending a penny upon the <inline font-style="italic">Standard</inline> has never occurred. May I be permitted to illustrate how very unreliable our Prime Minister really is? Last year he told us that the war would be over in July of that year. Of course it is easy enough to find cover for that statement by reason of the position which has since been brought about in Russia. No doubt Russia provides a very satisfactory excuse for the prolongation of the war. But my point is that last year the Prime Minister was emphatic in his declaration that the war would end in July. Yet on last Saturday evening, in a speech which he delivered at Bendigo, the right honorable gentleman declared that the war position is desperate. / </para>

                        <para>- I am not saying that it is good. The Prime Minister, on Saturday night last, told his constituents that is was desperate. Yet to-day, in this chamber, he informed us that he did not want to alarm the people- that the position is not so desperate as some folks imagine. But who is to blame if the people have grown alarmed during the past few days? </para>

                <para>In the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of Saturday last there was an article which said that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> had announced that it was proposed to immediately increase the strength of the Citizen Forces by calling up 40,000 men. No time was to be lost in calling up these men between the ages of 21 and 50 years of age! Naturally the people of Australia asked, " What is the particular reason for calling up these men?" If there is a clanger threatening Australia no delay will be experienced in securing the men for its defence. Then on the 23rd inst., the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> stated that " the uneasiness of the De fence authorities had been intensified by certain evidence that has come before them since Saturday morning," and in the evening newspaper of that day the Minister stated that " there was no need for alarm." Conflicting announcements of this character are more disturbing than anything else f can be. If Australia is in danger, is there any reason why we should not know it? Are we not prepared to throw in the whole of our weight if danger threatens us? </para>

                        <para>- The danger that is suggested by the articles from which I have quoted is not the danger which threatens us overseas. According to any honest interpretation which may be put upon the statements which I have read, there is a local danger threatening us.' We know that there is a danger threatening us overseas. None of us can forget it. We realize it - every man of us. But if there is a local danger threatening us such as the Minister for Defence suggests, is there any reason why we should not know it? What is the reason for calling up 40,000 men in Australia for home defence. I give the Minister an opportunity to deny my statement when I say that I believe the reason is to be found in a desire to bring about a lot of artificially-created vacancies, so as to find room for returned soldiers. I think Parliament is entitled to know why business is to be disturbed by the calling up nf these men unless there is a local danger threatening us. The Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> suggests that the people do not realize the danger. May I remind him that the Recruiting Conference which was recently held at Government House unanimously adopted a resolution which recognised that danger. That resolution reads - </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it is necessary to suggest that this amendment is in any way antagonistic to recruiting, or that it violates the spirit of the Recruiting Conference which was recently held. If so, it would be a most unfortunate thing, because it would make us believe that, after all, the Conference was a political one. </para>

                        <para>- And , therefore, should we say nothing about it ? May I remind honorable members that at Bendigo last Saturday night the Prime Minister said, "He deprecated any suggestion that the Labour party were responsible for any failure in recruiting. His remarks were not directed against Labour or the Labourparty any more than against any other party. He hoped he would no longer hear Nationalists speak of Labour men as if they were more responsible than other men for the failure of recruiting." He expressed the hope that there would be no more recrimination. We refuse to accept the blame for the failure of recruiting. We say that the Prime Minister is to blame for that failure. </para>

                        <para>- I propose later on to refer to him.. I have no objection to any of these gentlemen, but it cannot be denied that only one point of view can be expressed on the Council as- constituted. The Council of Defence can see- in only one direction. There- is not one- of these men on the Council of Defence- who. is not a declared conscriptionist and a declared Imperialist. If there is to- be harmony, we must make, at any rate, some concession to. each other's views. We must give consideration to those who differ from us, and believe that, after all,, they may be able to offer helpful and useful suggestions. The honorable member for1 Franklin urged that on the1 Shipping Board, for instance, there should be some members of this House. It would be of great advantage to the Government, and,, to an extent, would rob the Opposition, of a good deal of their power of criticism, if on all these Council's, there was. a representative of the Opposition and also a supporter of the Government. As iti is, the Government are- represented on these Boards through their Ministers, as they ought to be ;. their expert officers' are also there, as they ought to be-;- but surely there should also be representatives of the Opposition on the Council of Defence,, the Finance Committee, and especially on the Committees dealing, with, trade and industry. We have,, after all, our point of view,, and that point of view has- .been approved in no uncertain manner by the people of Australia. We represent a larger section of the people than our numbers would indicate. Our views- are- held by a very large number of the people- of Australia who are directly interested in the operations with which these. Committees are designed to- deal, and, as the Prime Minister has said, the Government must have the support and the cooperation of the Labour organizations if they are going to carry on successfully the government of the ' country and its war work. Hot\\, can- that he secured unless' Labour members in this Parliament, or their representatives outside, are given some consideration in the appointments that are being made- to these Councils or Boards? </para>

This resulted in my talking very much to the point, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was present all the time, he. guided the show along, and we got through pretty fast. After some discussion, I moved that the scheme be made self-supporting by a levy of 1 per cent, on the turnover, or something of that sort." </para>

                        <para>- I believe that to be true. It is true that before the war the whole of our British universities were impregnated with German philosophy and , German teaching. Everything German was then all right. Even education was not considered complete until a diploma had been secured from a German university. </para>

                        <para>- I do not follow the honorable member's argument. Here we have put forward by the Prime Minister a definite scheme for the organization of industry, based upon a book written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Benn</inline> - a book which in itself was based upon a scheme for the organization of industry and commerce to which Great Britain has, unfortunately, been a stranger. Germany made its way in the world, and climbed to the position it occupied prior to the War, by reason of the organization of its industry. In that way, it has been able to beat the British manufacturer in British communities. The Prime Minister was quite right in suggesting to-day that we should so organize our industries that the danger threatening us before the war - the danger of being simply an economic vassal of Germany - would not be resurrected. By that means, he suggested, the danger would be avoided. I know of no better way of averting it than the suggestion of the Government; but the scheme will break down if, as I have already said, only the one point of view is to be represented on these Committees. You are going to get only the employers' view. But history teaches that, unless you can get the best wisdom and advice of all sections of the community, you cannot hope for success. </para>

                        <para>- The Postmaster-General is not free to come back to this  party and find out whether we still possess liberty of action. He knows that he was not interfered with while a member of the Labour party, and I assure him that there is no more interference with its members now than there was then. I am not conscious of, and have seen no evidence of, such interference. But there is evidence that the Postmaster-General himself is not a free agent now. I hope that the friendly offers and suggestions of the Prime Minister will not be forgotten while he is away, and that the Acting Prime Minister, whom I am glad to see in his place, because I think we shall have a good time with him, will remember the clear and emphatic statement of his chief that the Government would stand to its promises in regard to all matters discussed at the Conference. If the Government will do that, and, by its repeal of the many administrative acts that have caused friction, give evidence of its desire for harmony, it will do good work for Australia. </para>

                    <para>.Honorable members have all received a copy of Statutory Rule 88, which contains the regulations that constitute the repatriation scheme which has been formulated by the recently appointed Commission and the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Milieu).</inline> These regulations, together with the Discharged Soldiers Settlement Bills introduced in the various States, constitute the whole of Australia's repatriation legislation, and may betaken to stand for our repatriation scheme. I have no desire to speak to the amendment, which I regard as a waste of time. The Prime Ministerhaving left for England, what is the good of discussing an amendment which says that he shall not go? With all deference to the Minister for Repatriation, the Commission, and the various State Boards, I am extremely disappointed with the repatriation proposals, not so much for what they contain as for what they omit. I leave aside the land proposals, which, by an arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States, have been taken over by the Statesindivi- dually. It would not be in good taste to discuss in this Chamber the administration of the Lands Departments of the States,and I do not propose to say more concerning it than that I have been in the closest possible touch with the Victorian Minister for Lands and the Victorian Acquisition Board, and with the various branches of administration in this State. Until the 8th April, in connexion with repatriation, everything except land settlement was done by the State War Councils, : and so fax as my experience goes, much more favorable terms could be arranged for returned soldiers with them than can be obtained under the new administration. I do not know where the blame rests, and am not seeking to take it off any one's shoulders, nor do I level any charge,myobject being merely to point out what is dealt with under these regulations, and, what has been omitted. Let me proceed to classify them. First, , we have those dealing with administration, which, of course, is by the Central Commission, passing down by a system of devolution to the State Boards and the local committees. On the industrial side extensive machinery has been forged to deal with those returned men who, unfortunately, have suffered injury at the war, and, according to medical opinion, are unable to continue their old advocations. Where men are able to follow their old avocations, no responsibility is undertaken by the CommonwealthGovernment, but men whose injuries have unfitted them for their former work are given the opportunity, under a system of vocational training, to learn a new trade, or craft, or calling, fairly liberal sustenance being provided during the period in which they are being taught. But there is no provision for meeting the thousands of cases of young fellows who went to the war just as they were blossoming out into life, and ready to start some little business . or enter upon some trade or calling. There are many small businesses which men with initiative would be able toConduct. </para>

                <para class="block">Certainly section  57  provides that a grant up to  £25  may be made to a widow in necessitous circumstances with children, and also to a totally incapacitated soldier to acquire furniture. A grant of  £10  may be made to buy tools of trade, or, subject  to  the Board's approval, up to  £50  for the same purpose; but there is no other provision in the regulations enabling a soldier  to  start in life. A case came under my notice the other day. Three brothers, returned soldiers, wanted to make a start in a country town. One of them was an experienced baker. He wished to carry on the baking part of a business, and employ one brother on the cart and the other in the shop. A small business was under offer to them at a reasonable price. One brother enlisted from my own electorate, and under a movement we have there we were prepared to give him certain assistance, which we do not by loan, "but by way of absolute gift, but on inquiry we found that there was absolutely no provision in the scheme to give the brother who was a baker the slightest assistance. The same applies to every soldier in the Commonwealth who wants to start in some small business on his return. I have mentioned the only three cases that can be assisted financially. The only other cases for whom provision has been made to enable them to start in any sort of business are a widow with one or more children, a married soldier incapacitated to the extent of being  unable  to engage in his usual employment, and a soldier who prior to enlistment was dependent for a living on a business which he owned and conducted. </para>
                <para>I would draw the attention of the  Acting  Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> to the very wide discrimination that Australia is setting out to make amongst its returned soldiers. Victoria has fairly reasonably grappled with this problem, and sets out  to  do something tangible for land settlement, but it has been estimated that less than  10  per cent. of the returned soldiers will desire to settle on the land, and reasonable provision is badly needed for the great  body of  men who desire to start in a small  way  in one of the  many  great ramifications of trade and commerce. Under the land settlement scheme, any soldier, subject to passing the qualification test, may acquire land up to a total value of  £2,500,  but thousands of deserving decent young men, having fought the battles of their country abroad, and returning to a grateful country, many of them desiring to fulfil contracts of marriage - and there is a great' disposition on the part of returned men to settle down - find in the regulations, no provision to advance them  £1  to acquire their homes. Why do we set out to settle one branch of our returned soldiers on the land and leave it a general scramble for the rest? I give the Acting Leader of the House my positive assurance that I have no desire to take up a carping attitude. I have spent two and a half years at close grips with this subject. In our district we have established sixty odd local committees. We have been acting in close touch with the State War Councils on the most friendly terms of co-operation, and with the discharged soldiers' body under the Land Act'. Many earnest persons are devoting their best energies to advance the settlement of returned men, but there has been a grave omission in not making wider provisions. In our district we have adopted this system : With the consent of the Government, we have raised many thousands of pounds. The money is vested in local committees, who have absolute power, subject to a very reasonable constitution, to determine the case of every soldier. They know the men, having seen them grow up, and know what they are fitted for. By giving a cash advance, and in co-operation with the. War Council, they have been able to establish many young fellows in their own homes. We have also been able to establish widows in their own homes, but there is no provision in these regulations to assist a widow into her own home. It may be said that she gets a pension for herself and children, but that will barely keep body and soul together. </para>

Since then, I have been only too pleased, at any time, to offer any suggestions.

                <para>We cannot allow these regulations to stand as Australia's sense of her duty to her fighting sons. Honorable members will remember that when the proposal came forward to allow a Board of comparatively unknown men to arrange the repatriation scheme, I took strong exception to it. The claim was made that it was humanly impossible for a deliberative Chamber like this to draft a scheme; but I maintain that there would not be the grave omissions in that which has been submitted to us had honorable members first been given the opportunity to discuss it. On the occasion on which honorable members had the Bill before them, we sat until 3 o'clock in the morning endeavouring to have some amendments made in the Bill . The honorable member  for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts)</inline> was very busy that morning in seeking to have some amendments made in the Bill. </para>

This scheme does not reflect Australia's good-will to her. fighting men; it is not a fair return to men who, while we have been enjoying three of the best years in Australia-'s history, have stood out in the battlefield risking their lives and meeting with disablement. Men whose earning power can never be what it was before, men who had bright and brilliant careers in their grasp, come back only to be told that if they are not fitted for their previous vocations, they can take up some form of vocational training.

                        <para>- No ; the. Minister for Repatriation has been careful in that regard. It is not a second mortgage, but it will be merged into the first mortgage, making, as it were, a joint first mortgage. In addition, a widow or a totally incapacitated soldier may have £25 for furniture, but there is no provision for helping a young soldier to get any assistance. There was an arrangement during the administrative period, of the State War Councils under which we were enabled to render admirable assistance. We advanced £50, and the War Councils advanced £70, to a widow as an absolute gift, and we arranged for the balance of £75 to be obtained on the Credit Foncier system. However, all that is now done away with, and there is no provision to enable a young soldier to pay a deposit on a house or a business, or to enable a widow to provide a home or furniture. There is an absolute absence of any scheme to start a young man. in life, and if honorable members opposite are content that, so far as returned soldiers are concerned, a man, once in the ranks of labour, shall always remain there, they are not, in my judgment, doing a fair thing. </para>

I shall be no party to any scheme under which the men, who have done so much for us. will suffer to the extent they have suffered in the past. The circumstances are such that the non-combatants of this country, who have enjoyed the benefits of trade, commerce, and production, and. the benefits of freedom and safety for three years, ought to, "shell out," either by means of loans or by taxation. If there is to be taxation, let it be " thumping " taxation for the benefit of the men who have fought for us. </para>

If we meet the transports, or go to the Base Hospital, or the institution at Jolimont, we see men hobbling around, while the rest of the community are not only enjoying perfect health, but greater prosperity than ever before. I hope that Parliament will wake up, and see that provision worthy of Australia is made for our fighting men. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor).</inline> I do not know whether to sit down and mourn over the departure of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> or whether to congratulate Australia on his absence for, at all events, a few months. I think, however, that we may shake hands with ourselves on the fact of his departure, and I sincerely hope that those people who so closely followed him on his visit to the Old Country - the dukes and the duchesses - will take him by the arm an this occasion in recognition of his ability. It is strange to think that for five weeks the members of the Opposition have been trying to ascertain from the Prime Minister whether he intended to go to this Conference or not, and have been unable to get any definite answer until to-day. This afternoon the right honorable gentleman suddenly came into the chamber, made a speech in reply to that of the Leader of the Opposition, and immediately left, without asking the members on this side whether they had any suggestions to make. He did not give them an opportunity to even inquire whether they could be of service to him on this occasion. I take it for granted that members on this side are just as capable of constructive thought as are honorable members opposite, for I should not like to assume for a moment that the Government possess the whole of the brains of the Parliament. </para>

                <para class="block">Minister had no policy to lay before it after  His Excellency  had delivered his opening speech. It was left to the Leader of the Opposition to lay down a policy, with the result that the Prime Minister came into the chamber this afternoon, and said he was prepared to accept every suggestion by the Labour leader. The Prime Minister told us that one of the most important subjects discussed at the Conference was whether or not the country should be free from every sort of conscription, whether straight-out or by means' of economic pressure, and he assured us - " Conscription is. completely abandoned; I have not. the slightest desire to again mention it." I hope that the Prime Minister is sincere in that statement, for, astounding as it may appear, we find that at the present moment economic conscription is in operation in Australia. A great number of private firms and large companies are enforcing it to the fullest possible extent, and, in face of that fact, it is strange to hear the Prime Minister say that under no. circumstances will he tolerate it.

                    <para>In the case of one well-known engineering firm - Messrs. Massey-Harris and. Co.

With these men, as with all their employees, the firm undertake to make up the difference between the military pay and that received by them while in the firm's employ, and in the case of one of the men in question, who has since enlisted, they have undertaken to pay an insurance premium in respect of him during the period that he is away. One of the men to whom the letter was addressed obtained a medical certificate of rejection, and was immediately replaced on the staff. </para>
                    <para>The letter, which was signed by the management, was as follows: - "We beg to notify you that your services will not be required by this company after Tuesday, the 23rd instant. We exceedingly regret having to adopt this course, but we must release all our single men for. the service of the Empire. We feel that every one who is of military age and. medical fitness,  and who can be of service to our country, should be available, as every man is urgently needed. Therefore we would not like to think that any action of ours would withhold one single  man  from the service of the Empire in her hour of need. We have no alternative but to adopt this course." </para>

                            <para>- Both Massey-Harris and Company and Anthony Hordern and Son have adopted this policy. On every pay-day Anthony Hordern and Son hand to the eligible single men a pay-docket on which are the words, ' ' Your country needs you ; we do not. " While these firms are compelling these men by a threat of starvation to enlist against their will, because they may have conscientious objections to military service, will they replace the discharged men by returned soldiers and other men who are not eligible, or will they have the same amount of work carried out by a smaller staff ? This system enables a number of firms, large and small, to reduce their hands, and create a sweating and speeding-up system by having the work carried out by a lesser number of employees.One of the first steps of the Government should be to declare that no firm shall be permitted to sweat its employees under the conditions which exist to-day. The same practice is in operation with other firms throughout Australia. There may be a few firms that are not in the happy position of being able to replace their eligible employees with other men, but where the employer can get older men at a lesser rate than he is paying eligible men, he accepts them, and economically conscripts the eligible young men. </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister said, at the Recruiting Conference at Government House, " I will give you anything you like, provided you will join hands with us." Did not the right honorable gentleman stand up here this afternoon and make a most emotional and hysterical speech? He was almost on the verge of tears, and as much as said that if he were sitting on this side he would be the happiest man in the House. That is exactly the Prime Minister's thought at the present time. I do not think any one takes very grave exception to the Minister for the Navy representing Australia at the Imperial Conference, because he is like a chip in porridge - he is of no use, but he will do no harm. I do not think he will do very much damage, and the trip may do him the world of good, even if it is made at the expense of the taxpayers. During the last eighteen months or two years the Government have been preaching economy. </para>

                    <para>I want to refer for a moment to a part of the Ministerial statement, in order to inquire how it affects the workers of the country. We have been looking forward to the adoption of a policy by the Government which would materially assist the, working people. Week after week we have been in hopes that something would be done to enable the workers of this country to obtain the necessaries of life at a lower price than they are required to pay for them at the present time. We have looked to a sympathetic Government to bring that about. In this connexion I quote the following paragraph from the Ministerial statement :  - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Finance Council. - In order that the Government may have at its disposal for the purpose of its finance administration the services of the highest financial experts, it is proposed to create a Council of Finance, composed of the Treasurer, the Secretary to the Treasury, representatives of the banks, and representatives of the financial institutions. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Arethere not a sufficient number of members of the Government to form this Council, without calling in the assistance of representatives of the huge financial institutions of the Commonwealth? Are not the representatives of the financial institutions the very people who are responsible for the greatly increased cost of living? It is strange that, in the circumstances, the Government should invite the assistance of representatives of the Chambers of Manufactures, Chambers of Commerce, and the great financial institutions to regulate the prices of the commodities in the sale of which they are interested. It is clear, from the paragraph in the Ministerial statement which I have quoted that any hopes we might have entertained of relief in the matter of the increased cost of living are completely shattered. </para>
                    <para>The Prime Minister this afternoon gave honorable members certain assurances which I take it for granted the Acting Prime Minister will give effect to. We were assured that things are to be restored to what they were before the last strike, and that victimized men are to be returned to their employment. I assume that this means that coal-miners at present victimized will be given an opportunity to secure re-employment in the mines in which they were employed previous to the strike. The same thing should apply to men who lost their employment in the Railway Department of New South Wales. I hope that, within a short period, the men who lost their employment during the strike will be able to return to work, and that no victimization will remain. I trust that trade unionism generally will revert to the conditions prevailing previous to the strike, and that all bogus unions will be wiped out of existence. If that is brought about, something will have been accomplished which will be of benefit to the workers of this country. </para>
                    <para>I sincerely hope that, when the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy return, we shall be able to compliment them upon the work they have performed. They may possibly come back with some surprise for us, as great results may accrue from their labours. I may say that, at the present time, honorable members on this side do not expect it. I believe that honorable members apposite do not expect very much either from the visit of the gentlemen named to the Imperial Conference, because they left in a secret sort of fashion, and did not divulge their mission to the rank and file of their party. </para>
                    <para>I desire before I resume my seat to refer again to a matter I mentioned last week, namely, the provision for the housing of workmen at Lithgow. I am not prepared to rest content in this matter until I get the assurance of the Minister who has charge of the business that he will have estimates concerning the necessary works placed before the Works Committee, in order that the proposed housing scheme may be brought into operation as soon as possible. It is all very well to say that everything is going on as rapidly as may be, but some assurance should be forthcoming from the Minister concerned that the housing question at Lithgow will be immediately dealt with. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Cook has raised a point of order that the honorable member for Barrier was quite in order in referring to a petition presented by the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Palmer)</inline> to-day, and he based his point of order on paragraph (c) of the amendment, which reads: " The conduct of public affairs in Australia." That is, the conduct of the Government. The petition presented by the honorable member for Echuca was not within the keeping of the Government at all. It was a petition of 80,000 odd citizens of Australia to this Parliament; it has only yet been read, and has not been dealt with. Therefore I rule that the point taken by the honorable member for Cook has no standing. </para>

                            Carson has repeatedly said that if the Government puts Home Rule on the statute-book the Provisional Government will be set up. We look for fulfilment of this promise.

These gentlemen, it appears, are working overtime turning out regulations setting certain sections of the people at loggerheads with one  another. Up to the present no man has been arrested or charged with being an active member of a Sinn Fein organization. Where, therefore, was the necessity for this regulation? Was there any evidence of disloyalty, or any prospect of a rebellion being hatched? I think not. The honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett),</inline> who suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> adopted different tactics when he belonged to the Labour party, might supply the information I seek.

                            <para>- He has a lot to do with it. The writer referred to further states - and we are seen to be bankrupt, not only in statesmanship, but even in common sense, which has always been the glory of our English civilization. Englishmen, unfortunately, do not bother about Ireland. They do not know that last summer the police policy pursued in Ireland almost led to a tragedy, which might have lost us the sympathy of the world; they do not know of the conspiracy of the Anglo-Irish and Ulster influences in England to attempt conscription - which would have led to civil war; they do not know that Ulster all this time has been laughing with her tongue in her cheek, blocking, and determined to block, any settlement calculated to lessen the political power of Ulster, misused in the name of England. Yet this is so. And Englishmen will have now to devote some attention to the Irish problem if they mean to go to a peace conference with any hope of being credited with sincerity, and so will the British Government. </para>

This regulation has been put through, although there is no organization of a disloyal or rebellious nature in Australia the existence of- which warrants its introduction, lt appears to me that it has been issued for the express purpose of stirring up national hatred and religious prejudice, with a view to turning Australia into another whirlpool of passion such as characterized the last two referendums. </para>

                            <para>- I do not care about that. To me it suggests that an amalgamation has been effected among the different forces in Ireland. However, the Postmaster-General can attend to that matter in the early hours of the morning. We have been told that Ministers here have been racking their brains in an endeavour to protect the Empire, not from the Germans, but from their political opponents. " Protecting the Empire " apparently means protecting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and his Cabinet from the wrath to come. In Ireland, which is supposed to be so averse to British rule that it is almost in open rebellion, we find that gentlemen belonging to the same organization as the lip patriots of Australia, who rush to the Prime Minister with petitions urging that the Sinn Fein should be declared disloyal, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mannix</inline> should be deported, are acting in quite a different way. There, people who have been at one another's throats for centuries are sinking their differences. They have adopted a flag to show that all past animosities have been buried/- and that between the North of Ireland Orangemen and the South or West of Ireland Catholics, there is no real difference. They have- blended the Orange and the Green by putting the white flag of peace between the two emblems. But to-day in Australia, where we are endeavouring to promote harmony amongst all sections of the community, that flag of peace has been banned by regulation. Here people are engaged in an effort to harmonize their differences by stirring up the animosities of the Old Land. I was born in Ireland, but I have no desire to see introduced into Australia the bitterness which has characterized past fights between Ireland and the British Government. Here, persons who are not natives of this country any more than I am are engaged in stirring up the animosities of past centuries with a view to making political capital out of them. </para>

Now the Prime Minister and his colleagues are attempting to keep these old hatreds alive. They do not desire to heal the breaches between sections of the people. Under your ruling, sir, I am not permitted to refer to the utterances of supporters of the Government; but the attitude of some of them, at least, has been made apparent by the presentation of a petition by the honorable member for Echuca. </para>

Since the Sinn Fein organization is non-existent in Australia, the regulation will not do it much harm. It will, however, .offend the susceptibilities of Irishmen and Irishwomen, who, whatever may be their views as t6 the wisdom of the rising which took place in Dublin during Easter week - just 'two years ago to-night - will resent such a regulation. Whatever may be the views of Irishmen as to the attitude adopted by the men who took part in that rising, they at least, as a people, respect brave men who are prepared to sacrifice their lives for the sake of the principles in which they believe. As an Irishman, I have nothing to say in condemnation of those men ; they at least died for the principles in which they believed. Men have been gaoled and starved to death in British prisons for standing up for their rights, not during the rebellion' itself, but in. the aftermath.. Irishmen, like men of other countries, have long memories, and they cannot fail to&gt; contrast the treatment meted out to De Wet and his followers in the Boer rebellion in South Africa with that extended to Irish rebels who took part in the rising two years ago. If Irishmen in Australia are to be brought into that frame of mind which is necessary to. secure their active co-operation in connexion with a war to preserve the rights of small nations, and to extend freedom to other countries, then such a regulation as that to- Which I have just referred ought not to-be allowed. It is not in that way that we- shall secure harmony. What is done in Australia in this regard is heralded abroad. Irishmen in America and wherever the British flag flies will know that distinctions are being made here, just as they have been made in the Old Land for hundreds of years. The authorities seem to consider, not so much what has been done, but rather by whom it has been done. If Irishmen are responsible for any matter complained of, then differential treatment is at once meted out to them. This rs the first Australian Government to adopt tactics of this kind, and now that the man responsible for all the turmoil and- disorder that has reigned in Australia since he took office as Prime Minister, is well on his way to the Old Country, the Cabinet would be well advised if they reconsidered this regulation, along with others under the War Precautions Act, and put it in tha waste-paper basket, to which it, with others, ought to have been relegated before now. </para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wallace)</inline> adjourned. </para></speech>

                            <para>- I know of one case in which a returned soldier has been waiting for a year and seven months, and the records are not yet to hand. I do not wish ito blame the Department, but it is time the Government took action to require the British authorities to return these records concurrently with the return of the men to Australia. The delay in the return of these records crops up in connexion with quite a number of matters. The widowed mothers of soldiers who have been killed at the Front are among others who in this way are kept out of money to which they are entitled. These delays ought not to occur. The Government are ready to take drastic action in certain directions, and I think they should deal drastically with those responsible for the failure to return these papers promptly. It is not pleasant to have to refer so frequently to matters of this kind, but the complaint is general, and I hope that prompt steps will be taken to remedy it. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> on 17th January last, made a statement in this House to the effect that a speech, made- by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan,</inline> Premier of Queensland - was censored throughout Queensland, while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom's</inline> speech was allowed to go forth without any censorship whatever. Yet the day after the delivery of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom's</inline> speech the censorship of such utterances was again imposed. </para>

                    <para class="block">The statement was so flagrantly inaccurate that I did not attempt at the time of its utterance to seriously deny it. I find,  however, that it has been repeated in Queensland by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore.</inline> A copy of a newspaper containing the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore's</inline> speech was sent to me, and I asked the censor for a report on the subject.  His  report shows that there is absolutely no justification for the allegation. No differentiation of any kind was made. From what I have ascertained, the statement of the honorable member for Capricornia was without foundation of fact; but 1 should not have drawn attention to it had it not been that it has  been  repeated outside. </para>

                        <para>. -  The matter referred toby the honorable member for Melbourne Ports(Mr. Mathews) has caused the Defence Department and the Minister controlling it considerable concern, particularly during the past few months. The difficulty of getting papers fromEngland in time to permit of the prompt payment of deferred pay has been the subject of much correspondence and cable communication with the other side of the world. The Cabinet, as late as last week, therefore requested the Minister for the Navy (Mr.Cook) when is London to pay attention to this matter, so that if possible there might be a prompt settlement of all accounts with returned men and the widows of men who had been killed. I hope that whatever else may happen as a result of the Ministers visit to London, this difficulty, at least, will be removed. </para>
