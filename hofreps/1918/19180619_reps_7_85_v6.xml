                        <para>- Varying statements are made by Federal Ministers, and State Ministers, and also occasionally by Comptrollers in regard to the operation of the Wheat Pool, some of which have a very damaging effect on the value of wheat scrip. It has recently depreciated from this cause by as much as2½d. per bushel. In view of the great importance of the financial stability of this scrip will the Acting Prime Minister take counsel with the Wheat Board for the purpose of seeing whether an official weekly bulletin can not be issued giving information in regard to the operations of the Pool, not only the information, but also the essential facts upon which it is based, so that the holders of the scrip may form an estimate themselves as to its value? </para>

                        <para>- The proposition is somewhat novel. I have not heard it suggested that frequent information of an official character should be issued, and I am somewhat doubtful as to the possibility of giving facts that would be of service to the wheat-grower without knowing what is taking place at the other end of the world. Information can be given as to the quantity of wheat stored in Australia, the quantity shipped, and the quantity consumed each week, or each month, but, obviously, for various reasons, in war time, we cannot publish the facts in relation to the difficulty of shipping. It is what prospective buyers at the other end of the world- think of our crop that governs all these matters, and clearly as I am not in a position to give that information I could not publish it. However, I will confer with the members of the Australian Wheat Board as early as practicable in order to see whether it may not be possible to do something in the direction of regular publications in order to stabilize the fluctuating wheat scrip. </para>

                        <para>- From information I have received I am inclined to think that the French Mission cannot arrive in Melbourne at so early a date. In order to arrange for the maximum amount of sightseeing of a vital kind within the shortest possible time, the itinerary of the Mission was arranged some time in advance of its arrival, and as it came to Sydney first, it was thought advisable that Queensland should be visited before the weather became too hot. The Mission will come down to Melbourne in due course, and is' timed to arrive here about 14th October next. It will then proceed to Tasmania, and return to Melbourne in time to co-ordinate with another great festival which is held here in November. </para>

                        <para>- The matter referred to formed the subject of considerable discussion between myself and some of the commercial banks in the two principal cities of Australia. An arrangement has been effected, which I understand is agreeable to the banking community, that a more liberal system of transfer from the commercial banks to the Commonwealth Bank shall be allowed. Instead of the commercial banks being required to pay to the Commonwealth Bank- instanter, on the instalment date, the amounts which they have collected in respect of their clients' subscriptions, there will be allowed a period over which that transfer will" extend. In view of the number of days on which instalments are receivable there will be practically a gradual but continuous transfer, as required, from the commercial banks to the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

                        <para>- I think it was Queen Mary who said that, at her death, the word " Calais " would be found written on her heart. I believe that, on my death, the word "wool-top" will be found written on the lingering fragments of my brain. Using the word in its ordinary sense, finality seems to be impossible in this matter. Only this day I have been in consultation with others in yet another endeavour to secure a settlement. I have summoned a conference of those most affected, including the  chairman  of the Central Wool Committee, to meet at Parliament House tonight with the object of trying to accomplish finality by some of the many means by which it should be possible. </para>

                        <para> - At the request of the Prime Minister, I am dealing with this as a metal matter. The arrangements for an association of tin producers have been under consideration for some time. It was attempted in 1915, but then failed ; but we have since developed the matter almost to the stage of completion, though I do not know exactly where the matter rests today. I understand that an agreement is in course of being signed by which it is hoped that the price of tin and' the power to sell will be very much better for the producer for the period of the war, and perhaps afterwards. </para>

After much negotiation, the Prime Minister succeeded in inducing the Home authorities to extend the existing contract to the 31st December. Beyond that, according to the latest advices, he has not been able to persuade them to go. We hope, however, that, before, the honorable gentleman leaves Great Britain, a further extension will have been arranged. </para>

                        <para>- I do hot know to what " turmoil" the honorable member refers; there are always disturbances in the elements, even in the Northern Territory. I can assure the honorable member, in respect to the last series of questions I received regarding this matter, numbering twenty-two, that I find it almost impossible to answer the whole of them, because some of them are almost equivalent to statements concerning things which do not exist. However, I shall give the honorable member information in regard to some of the points to which he drew attention. </para>

                        <para>- Some steps in that direction have been taken. For some time past, I have been inquiring into this matter, and have obtained from the Imperial Institute information regarding the quality of the cotton grown in both Papua and the Northern Territory. The reports were favorable regarding the Northern Territory product, and comparisons with some of the American cotton are favorable to the Australian article. The main difficulty is the cost of labour. Certain machinery, about which I obtained information three years ago, has been found not as effective as people expected, and, therefore, cannot be " substituted for manual labour. I assure honorable members that this matter is receiving very careful attention. </para>

The number of those eligible, but not debarred, has been reduced to a minimum, representing only 5 per cent. of the total employed in the Department.

                        <para>- Many difficulties have arisen in connexion with the administration of the Commonwealth Public Service in consequence of the operation of the Commonwealth Public Service Act and the Arbitration (Public Service) Act. The Government, therefore, propose to review the position of the Commonwealth Government Departments in connexion with the various Acts by which they are governed, and in their relation to the Arbitration Court, with the object of removing and preventing the overlapping conflict of jurisdiction, and ascertaining what steps are necessary to satisfactorily re-adjust the present system, in the light of the experience which has been gained since the passing of the Acts which bear upon the situation. As a preliminary step, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline> C. McLachlan, formerly Public Service Commissioner, has been invited to examine the existing situation, and to furnish a report on the subject, with a view of bringing, if possible, all Departments of the Commonwealth under one form of administration. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">(By leave).</inline> - I wish to put before the House the following statement: - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Recent information concerning the progress of the war has been of the most encouraging character. During the past month rapid and important advances have been made by the Forces of Freedom on the Western Front, justifying the expressions of hope and confidence which have been uttered by the civil and military authorities of Britain and the Allied nations. The Government observes with pride the important part played by our Australian soldiers in these historic movements, and it congratulates the nation on the cheering fact that the casualties amongst our troops have been comparatively light. </para>
                <para>Notwithstanding this grateful change in the military outlook, the Government trusts that there will be no slackening of war efforts amongst the people. </para>
                <para>The prosecution of the war to a victorious end is still the prime duty of Parliament and the nation. </para>
                <para>During the adjournment the man-power problem has received careful attention. </para>
                <para>The arrangements for the voluntary recruiting ballot are nearing completion, and the campaign will be launched in a few days. </para>
                <para>The Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy are still in Britain. Their work at the War Cabinet and the Empire Conference has been of the utmost consequence to the future of the Commonwealth. They are at present endeavouring to remove the great and increasing difficulties surrounding the sale and shipment of our products, upon which so much depends for the preservation of our prosperity. </para>
                <para>The members of the National French Mission, headed by General Pau, have arrived in Australia, and are the welcome guests of the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States. </para>
                <para>Everywhere they are received with popular enthusiasm, and the Government trusts that the visit will cement enduring ties between the people of this country and the great Republic of France. </para>
                <para>It is not proposed at this stage to describe the work of administration since </para>
                <para>Parliament rose. That will be outlined in the Budget, which will be presented next week. </para>
                <para>But the Government desires to record its pleasure at the success which has attended its efforts to secure the return on furlough of the veteran Australian troops who embarked for service in 1914. </para>
                <para>It is the intention of the Government to make the present session essentially a business one. To that end Amending Standing Orders will be brought down, which, if adopted, will substantially expedite public business. </para>
                <para>The Government invites the cooperation of honorable members in the consideration and passage of important legislative measures between now and the end of the year. </para>
                <para>Our growing financial burdens arising out of the war will necessitate additional taxation. Proposals for raising the revenue required will be described and submitted in the Financial Statement. </para>
                <para>In fulfilment of the repatriation policy of the Government, a Bill to provide for the housing of returned soldiers will be introduced. </para>
                <para>An extensive Electoral Bill will also be brought in, which will co-ordinate the electoral machinery of the Commonwealth and the States, consolidate the many existing Electoral Acts, provide for preferential voting for the election of members to the House of Representatives, restore a modified form of postal voting, and remedy other defects shown by experience to exist in the present electoral machinery. </para>
                <para>A Bill making provision for the statutory management of the Government line of steamers will be introduced. </para>
                <para>To secure equitable contributions by the people to the war loans, in accordance with their means, a measure has been framed, and will be presented for consideration. </para>
                <para>Price fixing has now assumed considerable proportions, and it is felt that the time has arrived to place this upon a more satisfactory basis during the war than that of a War Precautions regulation. Steps having that end in view will accordingly be taken. </para>
                <para>To establish conditions essential to the conduct of continuous and economical operation of shipbuilding, the Government entered into agreements with a number of industrial unions. A Bill will be introduced to give effect to the promise made to the Conference, and to the provisions of the agreements with the unions. </para>
                <para>Action has. been taken for the creation of an Institute of Science and Industry. A Bill will be submitted to give effect to this scheme. The intention is to secure full co-operation between the Commonwealth and States in this important matter. </para>
                <para>Legislation will be introduced providing for the adequate control of waters in the vicinity of Naval Establishments, Arsenals, Dockyards, &amp;c. </para>
                <para>A measure to encourage the manufacture of black steel sheets and galvanized sheets in the Commonwealth has also been framed. </para>
                <para>Other measures ready for your consideration are Bills to amend the Defence Act, the Naval Defence Act, the Maternity Allowance Act, the Service and Execution of Process Act, as well as Bills for the purpose of administrative amendments to the Customs Act, the Distillation Act, the Excise Act, and the Spirits Act. These, with proposals for which leave to introduce has already been given, will be the subjects of deliberation before Parliament again rises. </para>
