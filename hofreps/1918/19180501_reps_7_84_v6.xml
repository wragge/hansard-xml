                        <para>- On the 18th March the manufacturers of tobacco increased its price to retailers from1s. to1s. 6d. per lb., and subsequently the Government decided that the increase of price should not continue after the 23rd April. As during the interval between the dates mentioned, many retailers bought at the higher price, I ask the Minister concerned with the fixation of prices if the Government will compel the manufacturers to give to them rebate of the difference between the original and the increased price charged to them? </para>

                        <para>- The changes in price occurred before I took charge of this Branch of the Department of Trade and Customs, but I understand that it was considered that the Government had given the retailers reasonable notice of. its intention to reduce the price of tobacco, the retailers having bought in comparatively small quantities. It must be borne in mind that probably every retailer had a small amount -of stock of which he increased the price when the manufacturers' price was increased. The whole matter is still under investigation'. I shall give careful consideration to the honorable member's question, and see whether it is necessary to take the action he suggests. </para>

                    <para>- I promised the honorable member that I would make inquiries and inform the House to-day regarding the arrangements which were made in connexion' with the Anzac Day Remembrance Procession by the Department, and the reason for there being such a large interval between the rear of the military column and the procession organized by the Returned Soldiers Association as to cause  His Excellency  the Governor-General to think that the procession had terminated after the military column had passed the saluting base at Parliament House. I desire to say that in connexion with the parade of troops through the streets of Melbourne on Friday last, the Department made full and complete arrangements for the procession, and 'the  returned  soldiers were provided for in this respect. The secretary of the Victorian branch' of the Returned Soldiers Association, however, made representations to the- Commandant to the effect that it waa desired that the returned soldiers should march at an interval following upon; that of the military parade, inasmuch as- it was- proposed by the' League to introduce various- items which- it- would not be proper to- sanction in a. purely military parade. This request the Commandant, agreed to, and it was arranged that, there should be an interval between the rear of the: military column and the procession organized by the Returned Soldiers- 'Association, which, it is- understood, was in charge of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Colonel</inline> Bolton. The Commandant thus had no control over the second portion of the procession, and was not aware that a hiatus had occurred, causing the rear portion to be considerably delayed, and it was considered (erroneously as it now appears) that when certain vehicles completed the procession at Bourke-street, these terminated the display. The occurrence was a most regrettable one, and an explanation on the basis of the above has been made to  His Excellency. </para>

                        <para>- No; the matter is still the subject of negotiation. Quite a number of important subjects have to be determined, which it seems almost impossible to settle by correspondence. It is therefore proposed to confer with the Premier of Queensland regarding them at the Premiers' Conference, which is to meet in. Sydney at the end of next week. </para>

It is stated that victimization' has been indulged in very largely of men who were officials of the union. Will the' Minister ascertain whether theses allegations! are; true, and, if so, whether the position is not contrary to the promise made by the: Prime Minister to the Conference which recently sat to endeavour to bring about, harmony in the community? </para>

                            <para>- That is an odious comparison which we, on this side, do not care for. We were in consultation with a representative of the Government of New South Wales for two days last week in regard to that Government's part in the undertakings, and I have reason to believe that those undertakings will be faithfully observed. However, that is not the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government. Whatever influence we can bring to bear on any Government to have the promises made at the Conference kept will be exercised. So far as the Commonwealth Government's undertakings are concerned, the Departments are preparing proposals for the consideration of the Government, and those matters which are being dealt with by the Law Department are nearly complete. In regard to the repeal of objectionable War Precautions Regulations, I await consultation with the Leader of the Opposition, and I shall be glad to meet him at a time convenient to himself. </para>

The attitude of the Department depends on the nature of the offence. I do not believe in taking a man to Court for a purely technical or inadvertent default, but evasion and attempts at evasion are so common that the Department must be left tolerably free to exercise its discretion. </para>

The Indian Government have placed the services of their Jute Controller at the disposal of the Commonwealth Government to purchase this year's requirements. Sixty million bags have been purchased at a very reasonable price, and. conferences are now taking place with the shipping autherities to secure the necessary freight. An early announcement will be made as to prices and details of the scheme for handling the goods. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether it is a fact that the Western Australian fruit-growers are given, by the Commonwealth Government, a bonus of 9d. for every case of fruit landed in Sydney? If so, why is that done? If such a bonus is given, will it not militate against the settlement of soldiers in the Adelong district, which is further away from the market than are the Western Australian orchards? </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether it is the intention of the Government to deal at an early date with the question- of the reform of the Commonwealth and State Taxation Departments, so as to secure a uniform system? The Government, I am sure, appreciate the friction, trouble, and expense incurred under the present diverse systems of State and Federal assessments. The report of the Conference which dealt with the subject urged that action would have to be taken at an early date if the reforms were to be made before the next returns were required. </para>

There are many cases of overlapping in taxation between Great Britain and the Dominions, and in all probability they will occur in regard to the war-time profits tax.

                        <para>- I would like to offer a few words of explanation in regard to the matter of tobacco for soldiers. I am a great tobacco smoker, but about the only crime that I did not commit in the Army was the smoking of cigarettes. I stuck to the old pipe. The great cry among the Australian soldiers in France is for Havelock or Vice-Regal tobaccoes. Tobacco is not sold to the troops; it is issued to them; and that which is supplied is almost unsmokable. If we could send supplies of Australian tobacco to the boys at the Front they would appreciate it very much. </para>

                            <para>I am advised that three officers have been transferred from the Prime Minister's Department since 1st January, 1917, one to fill a vacant position, the other two temporarily. In the cases of the two loaned officers, the reasons for transfer were that persistent and urgent requests have been made from time to time by the Defence Department, since the outbreak of the war, for the services of capable officers to be made available from other Departments; and Departments were instructed to render all possible assistance. In February, 1917, the </para>

The Acting Commissioner was communicated with accordingly. </para>
                    <para>On 20th March, 1917, the Acting Public Service Commissioner advised, in this connexion, that he had approved of the transfer, temporarily, to the Defence Department of an officer (whom he named), and requested that arrangements be made for his services to be made available as soon as possible. This was done. </para>
                    <para>On the 11th March, 1918, the Acting Public Service Commissioner advised, also in this connexion, that he had approved the temporary transfer to the Defence Department of a second officer (whom he named), and requested that arrangements be made for the services of this officer to be made available as early as possible. Effect was duly given to the Acting Commissioner's decision. </para>
                    <para>With regard to the third officer, representations had been made by the Audit Office that additional staff was needed. A senior 5th Class officer was employed in the Central Staff, Prime Minister's Department, on duties which could be (and since his transfer have been) discharged by an officer of lower classification, and it waa considered that his services could be utilized to better advantage in the Audit Office. He was, therefore, temporarily loaned in October, 1917, and subsequently the Acting Public Service Commissioner approved his definite transfer to fill a vacancy in the Audit Office staff. </para>

                    <para>This is a Bill to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act, dealt with as the principal Act in this amending measure. Such a Bill as this is necessary for four main reasons - firstly, to adopt the main recommendations of the Conference of </para>
                    <para>Commonwealth and State Commissioners of Taxation, which met in Melbourne in March and April last year for the purpose of drafting, amongst other things, a uniform Bill for levying and collecting Commonwealth and State income taxes; secondly, to prevent leakages of revenue which have been detected ; thirdly, to fit certain provisions of the principal Act in with the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act; and, fourthly, to allow the better general working of the principal Income Tax Act. All the recommendations of the Taxation Commissioners' Conference have not been embodied in the Bill, because it was found that some could not be adopted in view of the general scheme of Commonwealth income taxation, but as many as possible of the recommendations have been incorporated. The Bill, as presented here, is mostly a machinery measure, and I shall first try to explain in due order what the various alterations are designed to achieve. After that, I hope to enumerate the 'suggestions of the States which the Government finds it cannot accept, and I shall then endeavour to show how far our proposals will lead us in the direction of uniform income tax returns, and a unified collection of the direct taxes of the Commonwealth and the States. If honorable members will follow me, I think this seriatim explanation will be found the simplest I could give. </para>
                    <para>Clause 2 contains seven amendments of the principal Act. The first two amendments, <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> widen the definition of " agent," in order that persons outside Australia who receive income from Australia may be more effectively reached for purposes of collecting income tax from them. </para>
                    <para>Amendment <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> definition of "business," is proposed in order that section 21 of the principal Act (which deals with deductions of losses from profits) may operate to allow a deduction of a loss in a business to be made from a salary or wage. This has not hitherto been possible, because " salary or wage " is not in the strict sense profit derived from a business carried on by the recipient. </para>
                    <para>Amendment <inline font-style="italic">d,</inline> relating to companies, is a drafting amendment only. It does not alter the original definition, but merely clarifies it. </para>
                    <para>Amendment e is a re-cast of the definition of "income." </para>
                    <para>Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> is the original definition-, of income, and paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> and c are? new.

                    <para>Paragraph 6 is proposed because cases have come under notice in connexion with the Commonwealth law relating to pensions, in which it would have been been of great assistance to the Commissioner of Pensions in arriving at decisions if he could have obtained information concerning 'the incomes of persons connected with the persons applying for the pensions. Notwithstanding a .provision in .the . Pensions Act requiring any person to furnish information required 'by the Commissioner of Pensions, the Commissioner of Taxation is advised that section 9 of the Income Tax Assessment Act will not permit him to disclose any 'information to the Commissioner of {Pensions. In view of the very clear intention of Parliament to place the .'Commissioner of Pensions in possession of the 'fullest possible information, it 'has been decided to amend section .9 of the Income Tax Assessment Act to authorize the Commissioner of 'Taxation to disclose information in his possession to the Commissioner of Pensions for the purpose of the administration of the Pensions Act. </para>
                    <para>The last amendment, <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> in this clause is proposed for the guidance of Courts, who are sometimes asked by parties to an ordinary civil action to nave the income-tax returns of either party produced in Court. A case recently occurred in Sydney which 'indicates a doubt in the mind of the Supreme Court there as to its power to insist upon the production of these returns. The 'Government takes the view that no taxpayer's return should be produced to a Court unless a taxpayer's assessment is before the Court on appeal 'or the Department is suing for recovery of tax. </para>
                    <para>Clause 5 contains an important drafting amendment. The words proposed to be omitted have, been held by some taxpayers .to mean that if the Department fails to make an assessment before the close of the financial year for which the tax has been assessed, it cannot do so at a later date. This would, of course, permit the escape from taxation of all persons who "have not yet lodged returns, but who are liable to do so. The Department, I may say, takes the view that reading the Act as a whole it has power to make an assessment at any time. The amendment will, however, remove all doubt on the point. </para>
                    <para>Clause 6 deals with three amendments in the principal Act, two of which, <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and 6, are of considerable importance.' </para>
                    <para>The first amendment deals with the tax on interest from investments in Commonwealth war loans, and will exempt the interest to the extent to which the prospectus for each loan declares it to be free from Commonwealth tax. </para>
                    <para>The amendment in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> will definitely exempt war pensions and the income of agricultural societies and similar bodies established for the purpose of encouraging the development of primary industries. </para>
                    <para>Clause 7 contains a re-cast of section 13 of the principal Act to express the recommendation of the conference of Taxation Commissioners, .and to make the intention of the original section clearer. The original law enabled a person to escape income tax on all his past income as soon as he enlisted, notwithstanding that he might soon afterwards be discharged as unfit for active service. Business income which .might accrue to a soldier after his enlistment and during his active service has always been and still is exempt. </para>
                    <para>Clause 8 deals with six amendments in section 14 of the principal Act. That section provides for the assessment of shareholders in companies on their dividends and interest. No alteration is proposed in connexion with the main principle of the original law under which shareholders in companies are taxed on their dividends and interest when received. Paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a, b,</inline> and c deal with formal machinery matters. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> represents the amalgamation of the first and third provisos to subsection <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of section 14 of the Act, with the addition in lines 9 and 10 of the paragraph of the words, " Appropriation Account, Revenue and Expenses Account or any other account similar to any of the foregoing accounts." These words have been rendered necessary by a High Court judgment in order to prevent great loss to the revenue. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> is merely a drafting re-cast of the present law to make the intention of the law clearer. ' Paragraph / is inserted to prevent injustice to many employees who are obliged to, reside in business premises, and who are required by the present law to include 5 per cent, of the capital value of the premises occupied by them. The amendment requires the inclusion of the annual rental value of the premises occupied. In. many cases this will be less than 5 per cent, of the capital value of the premises. </para>

                    <para>Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> represents a re-cast of the present law relating to the special tax of 6d. in the £1 on dividends and interest paid to absentees, with a reference to interest paid on debentures payable to bearer. The principal portions of this particular amendment are the four provisos to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> They authorize a company to retain out of the dividend or interest sufficient to pay the tax due by the absentee, and to prevent double taxation when the absentee includes his dividend or interest in his return of any other Australian income derived by him. The provision regarding payment of interest to absentee holders of bearer debentures will require the company to pay tax on the total, of such payment at the graduated rate applicable to the total payments as if that total were the income of an individual. There is provision in the third proviso to the amendment for refunds to those of the debenture holders who prove to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that they are not liable to pay tax. </para>
                    <para>Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> amends sub-section 2 of section 16 of the principal Act, which is a penalty clause on companies that do not distribute a reasonable proportion of their income to shareholders. At present if a company finds it necessary to retain the whole of its income of the year, not only must the company .pay tax on it, but the shareholders are deemed to have received their shares of that income, and are assessed individually, in addition to the assessment of the company. This provision has operated with great severity and injustice in some cases, and it is, therefore, intended to amend it, so that the income shall be deemed to have been distributed to the shareholders if the tax then payable by the shareholders would exceed. that (payable by the company. If, however, it is less than the company's tax, the latter tax only will be collected. If the shareholders' tax happens to be greater than the company's, the company will not he assessed, but the tax will be collected from the shareholders in their individual assessments. </para>
                    <para>Provision is made also to prevent double taxation of companies' profits when they reach, the shareholders in some subsequent year as dividends. At present the company pays tax on undistributed profit, and if that is, in a subsequent year, distributed to the shareholders as dividends, the shareholders are taxed on it again in their individual assessments. This double taxation is being removed from the Act. This amendment should be considered in conjunction with the immediately preceding amendment to section 16(2), in order to understand that the revenue is fully protected against undue retention of profits by companies in the hope that some large shareholders might escape part of their responsibilities. </para>
                    <para>Clause 11 provides that the public trustee may be authorized and called upon to pay the income tax on dividends received by him on shares of enemy aliens which have been transferred to the public trustee. Under the present law there is no power under which the Commissioner may demand the trustee to pay this tax,  or under which the trustee could pay the tax if it were demanded. </para>
                    <para>Clause 12 amends section 17 of the principal Act in the case of mining companies so as to bring that section into line with the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act on a similar point. </para>

                    <para>Clause 14 deals with eleven amendments of section18 of the principal Act. Under that section all the ordinary, and some of the special, deductions common to income taxation are mentioned. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> deals with employers who employ their children over fifteen years of age in their 'business. The effect of the proposed amendment is that where the employer <inline font-style="italic">bonâ fide</inline> pays his children wages, he will be allowed to deduct them, but not otherwise. Paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">b, c, d,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> are not important. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">f</inline> remodels the present law in regard to deductions for gifts to charitable institutions and patriotic funds. In future all cash contributions to patriotic funds will be deductible irrespective of amount. The third part of this paragraph provides for deductions of contributions in cash or kind to the Department of Repatriation or to any public authority for the purpose of being handed over to that Department. Paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> are not important. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> is important to all lessees, inasmuch as they will now be entitled to deduct the sinking fund required to recoup expenditure on improvements in which they have no tenant rights. </para>

                    <para>The last amendment of all was recommended by the conference of taxation officers for the purpose of completely removing inequities in connexion with the deductions to be made from income from personal exertion and property in the case of mixed incomes. </para>
                    <para>Clause 15 contains the provision relating to the general exemption of £156 in the case of persons having dependants, and of £100 in the case of persons without dependants. The Conference of Commissioners of Taxation recommended that a fixed general exemption should be allowed from each assessment in order that taxpayers might the more readily calculate their 'taxable incomes. This recommendation has been very carefully considered with a view to its adoption. It was found that the only general and fixed exemption which could be allowed without serious loss to the revenue would be £100. In view of the present cost of living, it is not considered desirable to materially alter the general exemption allowed to persons having dependants. At the same time it is not desirable to increase the exemption allowed to persons without dependants. A further objection to allowing the general exemption of, say, £150, in each assessment is that it would mean exempting an additional £14,000,000 of taxable income over and above the amount now exempted by the existing general exemptions. The average rate of tax applicable for 1916-17 (1s. 5d. in the £1) applied to this sum would represent practically £1,000,000 of revenue which would be lost. This would not be the only loss, because the general exemption would, of course, reduce the rates of tax in all assessments (except those of companies) and so cause further loss of revenue. </para>
                    <para>Present necessities forbid any such arrangement. It is, however, very desirable that the present operation of the vanishing exemption should be simplified. The amendment by the Senate in December last in this connexion has proved to be most difficult to apply. It has also entitled taxpayers with mixed incomes to a total exemption of very much more than £156. In some cases the exemption has actually been twice £156. The amendment now proposed will vanish in every case when the taxable income reaches £624, except in the case of unmarried persons without dependants, when the general exemption of £100 will vanish when the taxable income reaches £600. </para>

                    <para class="block">By clauses 20 and 21, the scheme of the principal Act in regard to the assessment of partnerships and trust estates has been remodelled, on the recommendation of the conference of Commissioners of Taxation. At present, a partnership or a trustee is taxable on undistributed income at the rate applicable to the total income of the partnership or the trust estate. This has worked inequitably in many cases, and it is now proposed that the taxable income of a partnership shall be deemed to have been distributed to the partners, and that the whole of the taxable income of a trust estate shall be deemed to have been distributed to the beneficiaries where there are beneficiaries entitled to receive it as income or to have it credited as income. In order to protect the revenue against the formation of bogus partnerships to escape the tax, the amendment relating to partnerships provides that where any partnership is formed after the commencement of the amending Act, and any part of its income is apportioned to a person who is not a taxpayer, tax shall be paid on that part of the income at the rate applicable to the total income of the partnership remaining after allowing all deductions allowed by the Act, unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the partner is in full receipt and complete control of his share of the income.

Clause 33 deals with an unimportant amendment of section 51 of the original Act. It was suggested by the Conference of Taxation Commissioners to fix a time for the notification of the appointment of a public officer of a company. Clause 34 deals with an amendment designed to assist the Department in collecting tax from business incomes derived by resident principals through their agents. The clause also provides, a new section to meet the case of absentee principals deriving income through agents in Australia. By clause 35 it is intended to tax at the source, and before payment, all cash prizes in lotteries. It is intended that 10 per cent. of the cash prize shall be retained by the prize-giver and paid to the Commissioner as tax on the prize. This will be the only tax payable in such amounts, and it will not be necessary any longer for the prizewinner to bring the prize into his return as part of his income. This tax will apply to all cash prizes in lotteries, some of which now escape owing to their amount or their distribution between non-taxpayers. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing at present with a taxation measure. Clause 36 contains an amendment which all the Commissioners of Taxation in Australia have found to be necessary for the more effective working of income taxation laws. It deals really with an internal matter. By clause 37, section 56 of the principal Act has been re-cast. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of the amendment is the only addition to the original section. This, too, was recommended by the Conference of Taxation Officers. Clause 38 recommends an amendment suggested by the Conference of Taxation Officers in order that Courts may be compelled to impose reasonable penalties on defaulters. For the protection of the Department against negligence or wilful delays in lodging income-tax returns, it is proposed, in clause 39, that a penalty of £1 for every month, or part thereof, during which the failure or neglect continues, shall be charged to the taxpayer ; but power is given to the Commissioner to remit this penalty wholly or in part if the circumstances warrant it. If the circumstances of any case justify prosecution for neglect, the cumulative penalty of£1 per month is not to be applied. At present trouble arises in regard to the use of the word "wilful" in the principal Act. Some delays are negligent, and some are wilful, and it is proposed that a penalty of £1 for every month or part thereof during which the failure or neglect continues shall be chargeable to the taxpayer. As I have said, however, power is given the Commissioner to remit the penalty, wholly or in part, if the circumstances warrant it. </para>

                            <para>- That is an objection to which the honorable member has previously directed attention. I asked the Commissioner to consider the provision of a new method under which, as is the practice in the State Departments, a man shall be dealt with at the Court nearest his home instead of being taken, as in some cases, from Northern Queensland to a Court well into the south of Queensland. If the circumstances of any case justify a prosecution for neglect, the cumulative penalty of £1 per month is to be applied. It is also proposed to amend the Act to give the Department power to prosecute where the circumstances justify, in cases in which a return, which is false in any particular, has been lodged, or a misleading answer has been given. At present it is necessary for the Departmen to prove wilfulness, and, in most qases, this is impossible, although its presence is obvious. We have all heard of cases of the kind. The proposed power is similar to that contained in the Customs Act. By clause 40 it is proposed to amend the law to empower the Commissioner to prosecute with greater hope of success in cases where persons have lodged false returns or given false answers to questions. At present it is necessary for the Department to prove intent to defraud in every case. In many cases such intent, while obvious, is extremely difficult to prove. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> of this proposed amendment is copied from the provision in the Customs Act authorizing prosecutions for false entries. </para>

                            <para>- Not at all. The law as it stands compels the Commissioner in every case to prove wilfulness or intent. The Commissioner now asks that he be relieved of that requirement, and that the Court be invested with a discretion in the matter. In view of the great lack of uniformity in the penalties imposed upon taxpayers, by Courts of summary jurisdiction throughout Australia, for neglect to comply with the law in any particular, a minimum penalty of £2 has been fixed, on the recommendation of the conference of Taxation Commissioners. The maximum of £100 previously in the Act is retained. This is to secure something more approximating to uniformity of penalties. </para>

                            <para>- The trouble is that different magistrates have different ideas as to what should be the minimum fine. A Victorian magistrate might regard as a trivial offence what a Queensland or New South Wales magistrate might consider to be a serious offence. Coming to clause 41, on the recommendation of the Conference of Taxation Commissioners the penalty for omitting income from a return, for failure to furnish information when called upon, and for claiming excessive deductions, or for deductions which are not allowable, has been fixed at a minimum of £1, or 10 per cent. of the total tax payable - whichever is the greater - when the offence is neglect to furnish information, and at a minimum, of £1, or double the tax payable, in respect of omitted income and deductions not allowable, whichever is the greater. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish my friend to convey to the House that the clause makes the whole of the Bill retrospective. A few cases where special reasons can be given for retrospective action are provided for in that clause. There are only two other things upon which I wish to deliberate with honorable members, because when they read the report of the Taxation Commissioners, they may hold strong views in regard to certain of the recommendations of the Commissioners which have been omitted from the Bill. I am bound to inform the House that the representatives of the State Governments have, I think almost without exception, expressed disappointment that this measure does not contain more than it does. Seeking, as they apparently did, quite <inline font-style="italic">bonâ fide</inline> to lead up to a system by which we could have one return per annum from each taxpayer for all purposes of income taxation, and seeking also- as I shall have occasion to criticise - to collect that tax for us through the State channels, they still believe that we have not gone far enough in accepting the recommendations in certain vital respects of the Taxation Commissioners' Conference.. </para>

                    <para>The method of taxing a company's profits is one of the principal points of difference between the Commonwealth and the States. We omit the recommendation of the Taxation Commissioners' Conference respecting this matter because, in our judgment, it is inconsistent to, on the one hand, define a taxpayer as a person in receipt of an income exceeding a given sum, and on the other hand to make taxpayers out of shareholders in companies irrespective of the amount of their dividends, and notwithstanding that the shareholder in his own right might not be a taxpayer. If we tax dividends for income taxation purposes at their source, we inevitably tax numbers of people whom the law describes as being exempt from taxation. The proposal to tax a company's profits in the hands of the company would penalize shareholders with small incomes, and, at the same time, greatly benefit shareholders with large incomes by allowing them to escape tax by paying at greatly reduced rates through the companies. </para>
                    <para>I admit that that is not inevitable, because it cam be presented ; but, as the recommendation is framed, it would be a distinct benefit to private companies, and would be a premium to the formation of such companies out of existing firms. At the same time, it would result in a considerable loss ofrevenue.Those are the guiding principles, shortly described, upon which we have decided to differ from the States, preferring to take the Line of taxing the income of the individual. </para>
                    <para>If honorable members will take the trouble to read through the report of the Taxation Commissioners' Conference, they will see that it was not always unanimous. At one time the. Commonwealth representative would be with one parcel of Commissioners, and at another time with another group. In many cases the States unanimously differed from the Commonwealth on matters which, I hope, will be the subject of discussion at the approaching Premiers and Treasurers' Conference in Sydney, where, if we can give this Bill reasonable expedition, I hope to be able to arrange or propose a <inline font-style="italic">modus vivendi</inline> with the States which will be satisfactory to all concerned. </para>
                    <para>The Commissioners recommended the elimination from the field of taxable income of 5 per cent. on the capital value of the taxpayer's own residence. Our idea is that if a man invests £1,000 or £2,000 in a dwelling, it is a legitimate thing, especially in war time, to ask him to put a fair rental value on it, and assess it for the purposes of taxation. </para>

                            <para>- I am talking of taxpayers, not of non-taxpayers. The exemption would still hold with regard to a person with no income. A person who has an income is fairly called upon to include a fair rental value of his own residence as portion of his income. The principle has been admitted in almost all the income tax systems throughout the world. </para>

                    <para>We differ from the Commissioners with regard to the taxation of sales of assets. TheCommissioners recommended, by one vote, after a very prolonged discussion, that all realized assets should be brought to account in an income tax schedule, and that profits upon them should be made the subject of taxation; but the contention of the highest form of income taxation thought is that the realization of assets is a return to the pool of the original capital, and that it is an impropriety to tax it. Although I admit that the point is arguable, yetI believe that the Commonwealth is taking the correct view in opposing this proposal from the States. </para>
                    <para>The Commissioners also propose to fix the taxable income of insurance companies at a percentage of premiums received. This is what the Taxation Office says in regard to the proposal - </para>
                    <para>This was clone at the request of the States, so as to facilitate their calculation of taxable income in this case, seeing that the insurance businesses are carried on in each State. There is no necessity for such a provision in the Commonwealth law, and equity forbids any differentiation between insurance businesses and any other businesses in the 'matter of arriving at their taxable incomes. The former provisions of the Commonwealth law relating to life insurance business have not been disturbed in the amending Bill, and these businesses will continue to be non-taxable. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and even to those which are not fully mutual to the extent to which they are mutual. It is debatable as to how we should deal with the insurance companies making gains - fire, life, marine, accident, and industrial. But putting aside fire companies, which should pay as any ordinary company should if it is trading for a profit, and taking only life assurance companies, and assuming them for the moment to be all mutual, the real position is that these companies do not make a profit in the ordinary sense. What they have done is to take their actuarial valuation of assets and liabilities, and if there is anything of a present value distributable, they give to it a future value, and add it to the credit of the policies existing. It is known as the reversionary bonus value. It is conceivable that, either in war time or in time of peace, that reversionary value could be regarded as a fair field for taxation; but, assuming that we take it at its present value - and it is payable in cash in certain circumstances - we would be doing what I suggested should not be done in regard to companies' dividends - we would be taxing, in a large number of cases, people who are beyond the . reach of income taxation. If we tax these people's income at its source, the man with a policy of £200, who would be getting £2 or £3 worth of reversionary bonuses, would be brought within the scope of income taxation, whereas the law says that he shall remain exempt if his income does not bring him within it. </para>

                    <para>If, on the other hand, we tax insurance companies on a percentage of their premium receipts, we do not properly tax those old-established firms - big, powerful companies - which have huge incomes from investments. I do not like to name any particular companies, but honorable members who are familiar with insurance life know' fairly well the names of the companies who derive two-thirds or three-quarters of their incomes from investments. Why should the premium results, which are not the company's activities, be taxed while allowing the big earnings from investments to be exempt? If the reversionary values of policies are brought into the schedule of the individual taxpayer, let it be done; but, if we seek to tap the income from reversionary bonuses at the source, it would mean hurting mutual provident companies, or the individuals associated with them, which are undertaking something which we should encourage, whether their operations be extensive or small. </para>
                    <para>Another recommendation deals with reciprocal deductions in connexion with the Federal and State taxes, but I need not bother honorable members with that matter at the present time. </para>
                    <para>The Commissioners propose to withdraw the deductions allowed for calls to mining .companies. We .have omitted their recommendation, because we say quite plainly that the policy of the Federal Government, as far as it is able to have a policy on this matter, should be to encourage investment in mining companies, and not discourage, it. I admit that it is an arguable question as to how far mining is to be advantageous to Australia. I come from a corner of the continent where it has always been regarded as most important to do everything possible to encourage the production of gold and other metals. We have found that to be a correct principle, and have not lost much revenue, while promoting,- maintaining, and preserving important industries. </para>

                    <para>I have shown the principal differences between the Commonwealth proposals and those of the States, and I do not think the difficulties presented are insuperable. Although the Acts may differ, I think that we could still provide, if the States are willing, for a uniform return; and the question is, Who shall collect the taxes if the States and the Commonwealth come to an agreement? The proposition of the Treasurers of the States is that we should scrap our taxation officers, and hand the work "over to them because they were first in the business. In this connexion I am a half-and-half Federal and States man - I do not mind saying I am " shandygaff " on the question. The bulk of my experience and my work, legislative and administrative, has been in the State; and I do not believe that- the change in arena has changed my feeling. But, looking at the question from the stand-point of simplicity, economy, and convenience to the taxpayers, I have no doubt as to what should be done. I can see, for example, that, even if we agreed to the States collecting the taxes, it would be impossible to destroy the Federal taxation machinery that we have erected. In my dual experience, I have been able to take both spheres into account, not unduly weighed in favour of either ; and we are now looking for a track which the people of Australia would most approve. There are many people who, like most companies, do business all over Australia, or in many of the States. If we decided to allow the States to collect the taxes to-morrow, there would still have to be a Federal office to collate those people who make, perhaps, £1,000 in New South Wales, £2,000 in South Australia, or £500 in Victoria, and graduate their taxation in the Federal account. It is impossible for us, if we are in the direct taxation business, to delegate our authority to the States, and hope to do so economically. On the other hand, it is possible for the Federal machinery to be mobolized and organized so that the State machinery may disappear. </para>

                            <para>- It applies to all taxation in which the Commonwealth and the States coincide; it could apply, for instance, to stamp duties. The Commonwealth has three fields of taxation similar in many respects to those of the States, namely, income, land, and estate duties. We could collect all these, and, if a proper agreement were made with the States we could, in addition, collect the stamp duties for them. At the present time the cost of collecting the direct taxation of the Commonwealth is, according to the Commissioner, 2.63 per cent. - about 2½ per cent., or 6d. in the £1. I am speaking from memory when I say that in some of the States the cost was not regarded as high when it was 4½per cent., and it generally averaged about 6 per cent. I have not refreshed my memory in this respect recently, but that is my impression. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing with one phase of the question, and, as I have not a duplicate intelligence, I propose to confine myself to that phase. After a close study of the question, I believe that, with our present machinery, we could collect the taxation of the States for half what it costs the States, and I would be prepared, on investigations already made, to guarantee that very substantial saving. It would be a great gain to the taxpayer if we could have one return, due once a year, for all purposes of direct taxation, a conservative estimate showing a saving of £1,500,000 over Australia. And it is not only the money saving for which the taxpayers would feel grateful; for, at present, there is the irritating interposition of the tax-gatherer two or three times a year, with the resulting upset in both business and private life. We have all felt this inconvenience, whether our incomes be large or small ; and we should be very glad if one return were sufficient. I take leave to believe that if the States were assured of one thing, they could not argue against the proposition of the Commonwealth in this respect. As an old State Minister, I know that in the minds of the State authorities there is the idea that, if the Commonwealth were given the handling of this direct taxation, the time would shortly come when the States would never see any of the results. Al- , ready one Treasurer, a personal friend of my own, has said, in the utmost good spirit, that a proposal of the kind means financial strangulation for the States. ' If this question is dealt with, it should be dealt with without prejudice as to the final destination of the money; in other words, amalgamation for the purpose of economy and simplicity of offices should not be made an indirect way of hurting the States financially. I would have no hesitation whatever, with the full approval of Parliament, in assuring the States to that effect. I intend, with the concurrence of the Cabinet, and of the House, to make a serious attempt shortly to get the matter straightened out, so as to secure one return and one collecting agency. </para>

                    <para>That this Bill be. now read a second time. </para>
                    <para class="block">The measure does not require any very long explanation. .It .deals with the vesting of :the land on which the Kalgoorlie ;to Port Augusta .railway .line is built, and also .with the acquisition of land not yet acquired for .the purposes of the railway. Under the agreement set put in the schedule between the Commonwealth and the .States of South Australia and Western Australia, provision is made for the grant of Crown lands, or, as they are called in Western Australia, " waste lands," for the line. This is to be a free grant, and, as interpreted by the States, ;and, I think, acquiesced in by the Commonwealth, it means a grant subject to any leasehold interests created under the Crown. There is also .provision in the South Australian Act that the State will grant whatever other lands may 'be required if, in the opinion of the Government of the 'State, they are necessary for the purpose. No grant has yet been made under the 'terms of the agreement, the chief reason being that the route of the railway could not be absolutely determined until it was surveyed, and it was necessary that the survey should be 'made only ,as the line was constructed. Under the circumstances, plans could -not <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> prepared indicating the lands to ,be conveyed, which were defined in the agreement with -South Australia as one-eighth of a mile on either side; and, in the Western Australian agreement, as a quarter of a mile along the whole length of -the line- a precisely similar area in either .case. It is necessary, pending the grant .under agreement, that, now the railway is completed, the land and buildings shall be vested by the State in 'the Commissioner of .Railways, and that, as clause 3 shows, is the chief -object of the Bill. </para>
                    <para>There is -another provision in regard to lands -to 'be acquired, the total area thus affected being, I think, about 35,500 acres of leasehold. For about 260 miles on the South Australian side, all the lands are leased from the Crown, or, in other words, are under pastoral leases. Beyond that point, however, there are no, or few, leases. In Western Australia, all the lands affected are, ,1 think, unalienated. As a matter of fact, the Bill applies only to the pastoral leases to be hereafter acquired; it will not affect Western Australia, because there the lands are ".waste," or-Crown, lands. </para>
                    <para>On the whole, it is better, TE think, that we should have one tribunal to decide what compensation shall be paid to 'the lessees. Under the existing Lands Acquisition .Act .of 1906, .there may -be three kinds of tribunal. There may be a Court of inferior jurisdiction of the State if the amount claimed be small - a provision that, under no circumstances, would probably apply in .the present case - a Supreme Court of the .State, or a Justice of the High Court. At present, the nature of the tribunal is at the option, first, of the claimant, who, within six months after a claim becomes .disputed, may exercise that choice, .after which it rests with the Commonwealth. As I say, .however., it is .desirable that only one tribunal should decide, so that there may be .some uniformity .of principle in the assessment of the leaseholds; and the -Bill, provides that, where no agreement is come to between the claimant and the Commissioner, the matter shall be referred by the Minister .to a Justice of the High Court of Australia as arbitrator. The principles by which this arbitrator will be .guided are, in the main, .similar to the principles under the existing Lands Acquisition Act. It is provided that if a man is to be paid for land taken over, account should be taken of the effect of severance upon his adjoining land, which may be enhanced in value by the construction of the railway. The general principle of the measure concerning compensation is that an owner cannot make any claim in respect of the enhanced value of land through the construction or the prospective construction of public works. That is the principle which runs through all our legislation regarding land acquisition, but I think in this case it is necessary to provide against excessive claims - claims which really ought not to be carried to the point of litigation. "The Bill provides, therefore, that if a man's adjoining land has become .enhanced in value to a greater extent than the amount of compensation claimed, that is to say, if the Court finds that, instead of loss having been incurred, advantage has accrued to the owner of the land, the amount of excess ought to be paid to the Crown. </para>

                            <para>- To be taken over. The honorable member is very right in emphasizing the point. It would be unfair to bring in legislation that would affect pending claims, though some of them, as a matter of fact, must be decided by the tribunal as it now stands, that is to say, by the High Court. They are pretty big claims. I think the Minister ought to see that the claims to be made hereafter are at least within the bounds of reason, and the best way to attain that object is to say that if a man chooses to go to Court, and takes the risk of. Stating that he has suffered great loss, and if the Court finds that he has gained, through the construction of the railway, by the enhanced value given to the remaining portion of his leasehold, he ought to be prepared to " stump up " and pay the Crown, just as the Crown would be prepared to pay him if he could show that he had suffered loss. </para>

                            <para>- No. Up to the present, between 34,000 and 35,000 acres have been acquired chiefly for water purposes, and something like 28,000 acres of that area have been either paid for or arrangements made with the owners in regard to compensation. There are one or two outstanding claims that are not affected by this measure. It is only right that we should not interfere with existing litigation. </para>

I was rather surprised to learn that anything in the way of compensation has been paid to leaseholders along the route of the railway because of the greatly enhanced value given to their properties by the greater facilities provided by the Government. When men took up that land many years ago they never anticipated conveniences such as they now enjoy. I presume the carriage of stock is now being undertaken by the railway. </para>

                            <para>- When the Bill is in Committee, I should like to know the amount of compensation already paid to leaseholders through whose land the line passes. One of the conditions under which a railway is constructed, in this State at any rate, is that the leaseholders of country affected have practically to make provision for the purchase of the land, and it seems to me anomalous that in a big national undertaking, such as the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway, which no State would dream of putting in hand for a great number of years, there should be any claim for monetary consideration in respect of land necessary for its construction. Has it been settled, once and for all, that the Commonwealth is the possessor in fee simple of land 440 feet wide along both sides of that railway? Is it not part and parcel of the conditions under which the line was constructed ? </para>

                            <para>- It comes as a great surprise, and, indeed, a rude shock, to me to know that any compensation has been paid; and it is a pity that the Bill is not retrospective in its operation. Because of the great benefit conferred upon two States by the construction of the line, I think that if any compensation be paid at all the obligation should be upon the States interested, and not upon the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Treasury has already been drawn upon to the extent, I suppose, of £5,000,000 or more for the construction of the line. That seems to me to be a very fair amount to be paid even for a line of national significance, and I think that any compensation to leaseholders should be a burden upon the States referred to. </para>

                            <para>- If the compensation had amounted to only £5, the principle would be there. I presume the Bill contains nothing contentious, and that the object is merely to make the Commonwealth position more secure than it has been in the past. I thoroughly agree with the principle regarding the enhancement in value of lands included in a lease - though the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foster)</inline> seems to take some exception to it - 'because if benefits have accrued to leaseholders, it is only fair that a deduction should be made in the claim for compensation. I gathered from what the Minister said that some lessees have already received too much, and that, instead of the Commonwealth paying out money to them, they should be called upon to recoup the Treasury if it can be shown, before a duly authorized tribunal, that they have benefited to an extent greater than their claim for compensation. </para>

                            <para>- I think that, in view of the costly nature of the railway, it was unfair on the part of either of the States to allow compensation to be claimed by State leaseholders. I do not know whether this is the proper stage at which I may ask for information, but I should like to know whether any arrangement has been made requiring the Government of Western Australia to give effect to their agreement; because it was part of the bargain that, when the Port AugustaKalgoorlie line was under construction, the Government of Western Australia should almost simultaneously extend the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle, instead of allowing the traffic from Kalgoorlie to be carried over a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge railway. It seems to me that, up to the present, all the bargaining has been on the part of the States, and at the expense of the Commonwealth, and it is about time that we asked both South Australia and Western Australia to give effect to their agreement. </para>

It is a very satisfactory proposal, and I hope it will be passed. The Port AugustaKalgoorlie railway, on' the South Australian side, passes through pastoral country,  some of which has been resumed for the purposes of the railway. I do not know how many resumptions were authorized while I was in office, but I know that some heavy claims were put in by lessees on the South Australian side, because the railway encroached upon their water reserves and interfered with the carrying capacity of their leases. </para>

                            <para>- I have been over it pretty often, and have never seen the country without a fair growth of salt-bush. That is just an indication, perhaps, of the real difficulty. There is not sufficient water to carry enough stock to eat down the salt-bush. The railway rightly has been consuming a certain quantity of the water available on some of the runs through which the line passes; and it certainly seems arguable, therefore, that the lessees concerned have a reasonable claim for compensation. The railway cannot be said to have increased the actual carrying capacity, for it is not much satisfaction to a man whose stock is depleted by lack of water to know that he has the railway handy. </para>

                            <para>- Not fresh water. A large part of the supply of water, so far as the railway is concerned, is drawn from the tanks and reservoirs which the railway authorities have themselves constructed. The whole trouble, as to that, is that the quantity of water required for the running of the system was not anything like originally estimated. As I understand the Bill, the Government do not take away any legal rights which the lessees at present, possess. That is only just. I do not .know whether the claims of the people in South Australia are just or not. That is for the Court to settle. </para>

One of its chief characteristics is that if a man attempts to sink for water he will strike it, but it will be salter than the sea. That, of course, does not improve the carrying capacity' of the country. Many persons who know/ nothing about pastoral land have said this country will carry millions of sheep, and will be a perfect paradise. But the pastoralists are not bumping into one another in a hurry to get hold of those parts. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going into that phase of the question. That does not worry me. I am inclined to think, however, that the country will be taken up and profitably occupied; but, as I have indicated, it can only be done by men in possession of other areas who can move from the dry tract when the pinch comes. Let us suppose that a case comes before the Court years hence, after the country has been occupied under the conditions which I have set out. Then I would say that the construction of the railway had improved that country, because it could not have been occupied but for the facility it gave for stock to be periodically shifted. A pastoralist should hesitate, therefore, before approaching the Court to make a big claim, since it is possible that the law may conclude that the line has bettered the carrying capacity by giving facility to occupiers for transporting their stock from one part of the territory to another. It seems to me that the reference to the principle here is perfectly sound. As to the remark that no occupier should seek compensation, I do not hold with that. </para>

                            <para>- If the country has water, and the railway has taken charge of it and used it, then that interferes with the carrying capacity of the adjacent portion of a run; and if that is not -a matter for compensation from those who have created the trouble, it should be. However, the law is uncertain, and the judicial bench is very uncertain, and it is difficult to suggest how such a claim might be decided. But, in my opinion, there would be a claim. The country on the South Australian side was taken up according to the pastoral laws of that State, and the land was fairly well watered. Then came the Federal Railway authorities, and certain of the lessees were deprived of some of their water. What claim there can be against South Australia, therefore, I am at .a loss to see. The Government have made out a very good case, and I will support the Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - - The case made out by the Minister, together with the necessity for the introduction of this measure, is obvious.. From that point of view I have no objection to offer, but I protest against the provision which imposes on the Federal Government the obligation of paying compensation. Compensation here has its basis upon two different circumstances. There is the question of depreciation of the value of a lease, and then there is the matter of its enhancement by reason of the construction of the railway. I do not object to the principle where a lease has been interfered with, and where it can be shown that the purposes for which the lease was originally taken have been depreciated. A claim on that basis would seem quite treasonable ; but it will come as rather a surprise to this House, and the public, that the payment of the compensation is made a liability upon tie Commonwealth. In a rough-and-ready way, the understanding has always .been that the two States concerned were providing the land while the Commonwealth was to spend the money on the building of the line. </para>

                            <para>- And the schedule to .the Bill supports me in that idea, for it states, " That in consideration of the Commonwealth undertaking to construct the -line,, certain areas along each aide of it shall be .granted <inline font-style="italic">m</inline> fee simple without further consideration." The schedule goes on to stipulate, " The expression other lands to include lands for water catchment and conservation." The second portion of the schedule sets out that an agreement has been made on the part of Western Australia to grant to the Commonwealth an area of 640 acres at Kurramia and 50' acres at Bulong; and it is stipulated clearly that these shall be without further consideration. If the land belonged to the Commonwealth, one could understand that the Commonwealth would be reasonably liable for compensation. But the lands are State property. The States, therefore, get all the advantages of the building of the line. </para>

                            <para>- How can the States impose on the Commonwealth the liability to pay compensation unless the Commonwealth has expressed its willingness to assume that liability? We have spent 'between £5,000,000 and £6,000,000 on this railway, and although the other States': will benefit indirectly by the construction .of the line, South Australia and Western Australia will benefit 4-irectly, and very largely, because of the tremendous enhancement of the value of their public estate. They could, therefore, well afford to pay compensation. </para>

The pu'blic understood that the States through whose territory the line would run would, without any consideration, and without imposing any responsibilities on the Commonwealth, provide the necessary land. The railway will benefit the State of South Australia to a constantly increasing' extent as settlement and traffic develop. I wish to refer also to the possibility of a difficulty in arbitration proceedings. Clause 11 provides that the matter of compensation may be referred by the Minister to a Justice of the High Court, who shall act as arbitrator, but clause 14 states that for the purposes of this measure, the provisions of the law of South Australia relating to arbitration shall be adopted. As arbitration cases will not arise in respect of Western Australianland, how will the Minister get past the arbitration tribunal of South Australia.? </para>

                            <para>- The enhancement in the value of the land is to be made then basis, of the compensation. On what; prospects of development is the estimate of the enhancement of value to be- made ? The Bill says nothing of that, and we have been, given no definite information on the subject. In most cases the increase in value will be a slow but con.inuous growth, and the payment of compensation on any other basis, will be entirely in favour of the lessee-. The enhancement in value- as years go by might more than cover any immediate disability which might be suffered by a lessee-. Theenhancement, in value might well be estimated over a period of years, so that the compensation might be. reasonable according to the expectations of development. </para>

                        <para>. - South Australia, under the agreement with the Commonwealth respecting the railway, does not get a penny of compensation, and is not responsible to- the lessees. These lessees however, by.  the terms of their leases, have the right to compensation. The railway will benefit this country chiefly by providing facilities for the movement of stock. Those who know this country are aware that it has only a limited rainfall, and it is the -limitation of rainfall that governs its possibilities. Even if railways were made all over it, it could not become rich and prosperous while subject to droughts. In looking through the Bill, it occurred to me that a -new departure had been made creating a precedent in the manner of determining compensation claims. Clause 12 introduces the betterment principle. This would be all very well if done in a proper manner, which would be by the Railway Bill itself. . </para>

What is new in this Bill ls the provision that if- a man goes to law, and it is found that the land which he retains has increased in value more than will compensate for any loss he may have suffered, he will have to make up the difference. </para>

                            <para>- A dangerous precedent is being created, because the Commonwealth Government may introduce the same principle into legislation affecting land of considerable value. I want the Minister to consider the equity of the proposal. The honorable gentleman says that if a claimant seeks compensation for property acquired by the Government, and the claim goes to arbitration, 'and it can be proved that the construction of the railway had increased to an amount equivalent to the amount of his claim the value of the property remaining to the claimant,  he will get nothing. </para>

                        <para>This Bill is an important one, inasmuch as it seeks to lay down practically a new principle. When honorable members were asked to vote 'for the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, they were definitely assured that the land held by the States, through which the line would pass, was to be handed over to the Commonwealth as a free gift. In addition, an area upon either side of the line was to be gratuitously vested in the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>-It will be difficult enough to make the line pay under the most favorable circumstances; but there will be no hope of achieving that result if the Commonwealth is to be called upon to pay compensation in cases like that which has been mentioned by the right honorable member for Swan. Unless it can be proved that damage has been done to any leaseholder, without any corresponding benefit having been conferred upon him, we have no right to pay a single penny by way of compensation. In regard to the clause mentioned by the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster),</inline> it does seem inequitable that if a man lodges a claim for compensation he shall practically have a revolver pointed at his head. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt. That clause, in effect, says, " If you claim compensation we will see what benefit you have derived from the construction of' this line." But, to my mind, the clause is inequitable, inasmuch as it provides only for an investigation into the affairs of the man who claims compensation and does not permit of an investigation into the affairs of thousands of others who make no such claim. A leaseholder whose land is close to a railway station will, naturally, be able to get his stock away more easily than will the individual who is less favorably situated. Consequently, the former will say, " I will not apply for compensation. otherwise the authorities will inquire into the measure of the benefit which I have received from the building of the line." -If the provision embodied in clause 12 be a sound one, every leaseholder along the line should be compelled to pay for the benefit which it has conferred upon him. </para>

                            <para>- I did not know that . he held any land along the line. It is significant that the newspapers which were loud in their condemnation of certain men because they were members of the Labour party, have not a word to say against them to-day when they are members of the National party. I say that if any man, because of the position which he occupies in a Government, is able to obtain information of value prior to the general public obtaining it,- he has no right to make use of it. I am glad to know that in Australia we are very free from imputations of improper conduct in that connexion. I hope that we shall always remain so. But public journals ought not to set the bad example of throwing mud at members of a political party to which they are opposed. That is the reason why there has been so much talk of political corruption in America, where, as a matter of fact, there is very little truth in the allegations which are so. recklessly made. </para>

                        <para>.- Under clause 12 of this Bill it is only proposed to assess the value of the land held by such leaseholders as make claims for compensation against the Government. I should like to know whether it is the intention of the Ministry to apply the betterment principle to leaseholders all along the line? If so, they will open up in Australia a very big question indeed. I hope that they do not intend, even by means of the thin end of the wedge, to adopt that principle as a set-off against any genuine claim for compensation. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to know whether this Bill has been introduced for the purpose of relieving the South Australian Government of responsibility or whether it is a measure which we must pass for the protection of the Commonwealth. So far as I can gather from the remarks of the Minister, we must pass the Bill in some form or other - whether we like it or not - because of the fact that compensation is being claimed by certain station-owners along the route of the railway, and the Bill provides the machinery for dealing with such claims. Were the position otherwise, I would vote to reject the measure in its entirety. In my judgment, the principle which it seeks to introduce here should have been embodied in the measure authorizing the construction of this line. Clause 12 appeals to me as providing really the safety-valve of the Bill. It will prevent claims for compensation being made against the Commonwealth by leaseholders, upon whom the railway has really conferred a very great benefit. This railway has enabled the leaseholder to get his cattle away quickly in time of drought. As I passed along the line </para>

                        <para>. - I am sorry that it is necessary to introduce a Bill of this sort. When the proposal for the construction of this railway was brought before Parliament, we fully understood that the land required for it would be given.. The two States interested - South Australia and Westerns Australia -were only too anxious to give to' the Commonwealth the land needed for railway purposes! It may be that close to Tarcoola, and. at other places, some land was required by the Commonwealth outside of the area granted by the States. If the Commonwealth desired a larger area that that which the States had given them for the purpose, I am satisfied that the State Governments, under the powers they reserve when granting. leases would have been able to resume the land for reasonable compensation, and hand it over to the Commonwealth. The statement has been made that over £4,000 has been paid in compensation claims already, and that there is another claim by one leaseholder amounting to from £75,000 to £100,000. Such claims are so preposterous that they should not be entertained for a moment. </para>

I wish to do nothing that will deter people from taking up areas along the railway and trying to develop the country. The success of the line will depend upon the -development of the land through which it passes. Pastoralism can only be made to pay by the Government leasing the land in large areas, and by the expenditure of large sums of money by the lessees. There axe a big water difficulty and the rabbit pest to cope with; and these will necessitate heavy expenditure. Whilst I am glad that a provision has been inserted in this Bill in order to prevent people taking advantage of the Government, I warn honorable members that if we carry the betterment principle any further than the Minister _ has proposed, we shall be doing something that will prevent the development of these lands. </para>

                    <para>Lord FORREST (Swan) (6.12] . - T should mot have risen to speak on this Bill did I not feel that I had .a -duty ,to perform. Having taken a prominent part in -promoting the construction of this rail- way, I can hardly .ex-press myself sufficiently strongly regarding those persons who are trying -to improperly make money out of the 'Commonwealth because the Government have .dene a great and beneficent work. The country through which this railway passes was almost, entirely unoccupied and uninhabitable. Through it a railway has - been built by the Commonwealth Government at an immense expense, with a view, firstly, to connect the eastern and western sides of the Common wealth, and,  secondly, to facilitate the utilization of those vast unoccupied areas and make them wealth producing.. Now We find that the persons who have been shepherding this land, and putting it to very little use, on account of the absence of facilities of transit, are asking the country to compensate them. ^ For what? What have they done that they should receive compensation? I -can quite understand; this Parliament generously saying to the leaseholders along the line, " We will not make ,yo.u pay for .the advantages which the line has brought to you, but you must make no claim against us." That seems to me to be as generous a proposition <inline font-style="italic">&amp;s</inline> could be made. But when a person tries to get from the Commonwealth money which, he has not earned,  a betterment law should be made to apply to such person. I have said for the last thirty years, and I repeat now, that those persons who try to make money out of their country after it has done a beneficent work by which they have benefited, deserve to be .dealt with by every Parliament in a manner that will prevent them cheating the State. I remember that, on the completion of the great gold-fields water scheme in Western Australia, which was projected and carried out by the Government of which I was a member, a gentleman brought an action against the Government claiming that the impounding of the water in a water-course that was not even perennial, impaired some rights he thought he had miles below the Mundaring Weir. I introduced in Parliament a Bill which proposed to prohibit .amy such action being taken, and if taken, being proceeded with. My friends induced me not to proceed with the Bill, bub to create instead a special tribunal of three Judges to deal with any claim that might arise. Although this particular claimant was a friend of mine, I called him all sorts of names. When his claim was dealt with by the Court, the Judges were of opinion that he had been subject to a great deal of trouble, and they awarded him £500, which, in my opinion, he ought never to have received. I thought that we had heard the last of claims of that kind, but those dealt with by this Bill are even more scandalous. I was told by the Department of the case of a pastoral leaseholder on whose land is a well. He was not making use of the water, and the Government utilized it for railway purposes, and subsequently took legal proceedings to reserve it for the Crown. Each month this leaseholder submits his claim, with interest added, and the total now is about £70,000. I shall never be a arty to giving that man a cent. He has benefited very largely by the construction of this railway, and it is scandalous that men who are making a profit in  consequence of Government expenditure should try to fleece the public. </para>

                        <para>. - In regard to the question of compensation, which I think is the most important matter discussed by honorable members, I should simply like to say that the majority of the provisions in this Bill are already contained in the Lands Acquisition Act of 1906. They have been adopted in principle from the Acts of the State Parliaments, and I think they run through all the laws for compensation in both the United Kingdom and Australia. Section 2S of the Lands Acquisition Act of 1906 provides that the Court, in determining compensation under the Act, shall take into account - </para>

                    <para>Therefore, the principal of betterment is embodied to some extent in existing legislation. The only alteration made by clause 12 is that, whereas the existing law provides that, where the remainder of a man's land has been increased in value by the carrying out of a public work, the amount of such increase may be deducted from the compensation, this Bill further enacts that if the amount of the enhancement is so great as to exceed the claim, the excess, if a Justice of the High Court so orders, will have to be paid to the Government by the claimant. The honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> and the honorable member for "Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> asked the reason for inserting this provision. It is inserted to deter persons from ridiculous claims, and, I think, is justified for that reason. Something like 35,000 acres were required, chiefly in order to secure water required in the construction of the railway. As I have already mentioned, the total amount of compensation paid in respect of the 27,918 acres of leasehold acquired is £4,860. I have not all the figures by me, but I looked this matter up in connexion with an existing claim. I looked up the whole business from the beginning. </para>

                            <para>- That is another point. The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> asked me how I justified the introduction of such a provision as is contained in clause 12 of the Bill. He did not think it could be justified by precedent but I remind him that there is scarcely a single reform that has been carried in Australia that could be justified by precedent. The first country in the world to introduce an unimproved tax upon land was South Australia. It was introduced by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> and I also had something to do with it; but if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> had been asked what precedent there was for it, he would have had to shut up. South Australia is a State for which it is advisable that I, as well as the honorable member for Wakefield, should show some respect. It was the first State in Australia to establish the principle of women's suffrage, from which two good- and important results followed - it established a precedent, and secured the return of your humble servant to Parliament. I suppose that I was the first man in the British Empire to be blessed by the female vote. </para>

There is an existing claim, upon the merits of which I shall not say anything, but I mention it as a justification for the provision to which the honorable member for Wakefield has referred. It is a claim for £103,000, and I have offered in connexion with it compensation to the extent of £3,230.

Our power under section al of the Constitution is to acquire " on just terms."

This matter had to come before the State Parliaments, because there is a provision in the Railway Act of 1911 that certain Crown land grants were to be made by the States. Then we had the Transcontinental Railway Line Grant Act of 1911 passed in the Parliament of South Australia, in which it is provided that - </para>

The matter is also dealt with in a State Act, No. 1079 of 1912. We have gone into this matter very thoroughly, and have had a legal opinion from our own Crown Law Department before any action has been decided upon.

                    <para class="block">I know that the stand taken up by the State Parliaments, particularly of South Australia, was that they undertook only to give " Crown land." That is what is meant by their legislation, and by the agreement the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor is of the opinion that that was the view of the Commonwealth also, and in the circumstances we have simply to do what was agreed upon. The honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> asked whether in this matter we were proposing to relieve the Government of South Australia of some burden which is properly theirs. I have looked up their legislation, and I find that there was an Act passed in 1893 under which the Government of South Australia might possibly have resumed land for us on better terms than we can resume it under our legislation. I find that compensation under that Act would have to be granted to lessees for leases issued alter a certain date. But the Government of South Australia refused to exercise any of their powers in that direction. We have, therefore, been driven to take this action, and to make the best provision possible in the circumstances for the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - There are some verbal amendments that I shall have to make in a few of the clauses. Wherever the word " Minister " occurs, so as to make him the administrator of the Act, I propose that it shall be left out, and the word " Commissioner " put in. The reason for this is that the Railways Act, which was passed last year, makes provision for the Commissioner of Railways dealing with all lands that are in future to be acquired for the purpose of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, and that I think it better that he should also administer under this measure. I therefore move - </para>

                            <para>- We thought that the Commonwealth was protected by it. The general impression was that for a quarter of a mile across the line the whole of the land along this railway would be a gift from South Australia and Western Australia to the Commonwealth. I believe every honorable member understood that to be a part of the compact. We now find the Government confronted with claims representing thousands of pounds in respect of land, the value of which has been improved by the building of this railway. I hope that the Minister, as far as his power under the original Act will allow, will see that compensation is strictly limited to what is legally necessary. At a time when every penny counts, we are proposing to pay large amounts by way of compensation to rich men who do not deserve it. </para>

                <para>This Bill is necessary, because, under the definition clause of the Lands Acquisition Act 1906, " land "- does not include public parks vested In or under the control of municipal or local authorities and dedicated to or reserved for the recreation of the people, or such other lands dedicated to or reserved for the use and enjoyment of the people as have been specified by proclamation. </para>
                <para class="block">Some land at Leichhardt, Sydney, is required by the Defence Department for ordnance stores. The Commonwealth intended to acquire it, but when the Department was about to issue a proclamation for the purpose, it was thought that inquiries should be made as to whether a more suitable site could not be found in </para>
                <para class="block">New South Wales. A report was obtained from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> and it confirmed the original opinion of the Department that an area of about* 5 acres at Leichhardt was the best from all points of view for the purpose of the ordnance stores. The obtaining of this report delayed the proclamation which was to have been issued on the 28th February of this year acquiring the area of land In the meantime, on the 1st September, 1917, a special <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> was issued by the Government of the State of New South Wales proclaiming this land as a reserve for public purposes, the public purpose in this case being a public park; but the land had not actually been dedicated and vested in a local authority for that purpose on the 28th February of this year. Therefore, had we issued our proclamation on that date the land would have passed to the Commonwealth under the Lands Acquisition Act, but as the State Government, on the 18th March of this year, issued a proclamation dedicating this land for the purposes of a park, and vesting it in the trustees of the Blackmore Park, we could not acquire it under the Lands Acquisition Act, because that Statute gives the Commonwealth no authority to acquire lands belonging to the State or a local authority which have been dedicated for public purposes. We want the power to acquire this land, and it can only be done by a special Act of Parliament. When the Commonwealth Lands Acquisition Act was under consideration in this House, there was considerable discussion as to whether or not power should be given to acquire land vested as public parks in the various States, and it was decided that when the Commonwealth sought to acquire any park lands for Commonwealth purposes special Bills must be brought in for the purpose. This is one of those Bills. / </para>
                <para>There are other places in Sydney where ordnance stores could be erected, but they do not give the accommodation required by the Defence Department. The officials of the Department have submitted a report as to the suitability of this particular block of land, but I do not wish to weary honorable members by going into details. The question is not one of the suitability of the land; it is one of whether or not we should acquire this land by an amendment of the Lands Acquisition Act. </para>

There is a block of 10 acres altogether, but we require not more than 5 acres 3 roods. There are well-formed macadamized' roads on three sides. It is on the main goods railway line connecting all country centres with Darling Harbor and with Glebe Island. The railway authorities state that there are splendid facilities for railway sidings, and that lt is a splendid site for easy working. There is a. large water frontage, which is navigable for large lighters and punts. It is within 4 miles of the Sydney Post Office, and within 2 miles of the chief manufacturing centre. The  president  of the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce considers it a tip-top . site for business purposes. It is close to electrical supply, and can easily be sewered.

                <para>Of course honorable members would like t6 know the position of the State Government in regard to this matter, which has already proclaimed it as a public park. It is not actually a park at present, nor is it likely to be used as one for generations, but I thought it well to have inquiries made on the point. I have not had a letter from the State Government on the subject, but Colonel Sands, who was in Sydney a short time ago, saw both the municipal council of Leichhardt and the State Minister for Lands, and the impression he formed, and I believe it is correct, is that neither the State Government nor the municipal council objects to our acquiring the land. On the 11th April, I received a telegram informing me that there was no antagonistic public attitude likely to be expected from the Leichhardt Municipal Council, whose meeting Colonel Sands attended, that that body intended to approach the State Government for the purpose of getting the purchase money allowed to them in order to enable them to buy another park, and that the State Government will be favorable to this. </para>
                <para>This Bill is merely asking for technical power to acquire the laud. I do not think that it is likely the land would be used as a park for a long time to come. It is so close to another park. </para>

                        <para>- The distance is not given in the particulars before me, but I have been informed that the Leichhardt park is near, and would serve every purpose this park was . intended to serve. If the State Government does not object, and if the Leichhardt Municipal Council is favorable to the acquisition of this land, everything that can really recommend the Bill from a public point of view has been maintained. The land is required for defence purposes, and it is the very best for those purposes that we can possibly get. There is a long report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> who went into the whole matter. He inspected every place that could be recommended, and he considered that this was the best site for ordnance stores. If it were not for the fact that the land was not acquired on the 28th February, it would not have been necessary to introduce this Bill. It was only because we postponed taking that action that the technical necessity for the passage of a Bill has been occasioned. </para>

                    <para>.- I regret that the Minister should have brought forward such a Bill. I am sure that he has a great deal more sympathy with the general public who have to live in big cities than his proposal would suggest that he has. My experience of public bodies is that they see no reason whatever why their will should not be carried out without any consideration for the feelings of the mass of the people who live in big cities. I enter a strong protest against this proposal on the part of the Government. I suppose that every man who has been called upon to give advice in connexion with it has a' residence in some aristocratic suburb, where his senses are not disturbed by any city slum. I remember the strong agitation that grew up when it was proposed to take Hyde Park, in Sydney, for the purpose of constructing a city railway, and honorable members who are accustomed to visit Sydney can see that the rapacious hands of people who probably live at Strathfield, Pott's Point, Mosman, or some other aristocratic portion of Sydney are already at work on that green spot in front of the </para>

                <para class="block">Central Railway Station, which was formerly used as a park, but is now being used for tramway lines. If no protest is made, and if -an end is not put to this alienation of public land, the weary ratepayer may find no place outside publichouse bars where he may rest his tired limbs. The particular piece of land sought to be acquired has already been dedicated for the purposes of a park, and the argument put forward is that it is within 3 miles of an existing public park ; but, from what I can remember, Leichhardt is very closely populated ; there is  an  increasing number of small houses, probably three or four-roomed houses, in which people must live, on account of their limited wages. As a rule it is the poor who have large families, running up to ten or eleven children, who are compelled to live in such small places. The Defence Department officers who were intrusted with the responsibility of getting a site for ordnance stores, wander round Sydney and seize on a piece of land which has been dedicated for a public park. As the Minister says, this land may not be used for a long time yet as a park, for the reason, I suppose, that the pressure on the poor people in the neighbourhood is not great enough. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. The Government have plenty of money to spend for Defence purposes, and they ought to select a site away from a thickly populated neighbourhood; it is our duty to conserve the interests of the people who have to live in the big cities of the Commonwealth. Our aim ought to be to breed a race able to continue for all time such efforts as are now being made by those Australians at the Front, who came from the great areas of the country and knew nothing of slum life. If we rob suburban people of little pieces of land of something like 5 acres, we shall surely create slums and place obstacles in the way of the development of the  children of the poor. Judging from the attitude of our friends opposite, it will he a long time before we establish the millennium in this country. </para>

                        <para>- I never heard of the Bill until a few moments ago ; and it was sufficient for me to see that the Government are proposing to take a public park. As I move through the various cities of the Commonwealth I find too few parks for the masses of the people, who are too poor to live in aristocratic or outlying suburbs, where the rentals amount to, at least, 25s. or 30s. per week, and where park lands are within easy distance. I view with considerable anxiety the fact that in Sydney there is what is called the Million Club, composed of men whose aim it is to see a population of .1,000,000 in and around that city. </para>

                        <para>- It may bc that we shall see this population in Sydney, for the cities, with their lights and music, are as irresistible to people as the candle to a moth. Nevertheless, we must regard with anxiety this desire to have such immense populations in our big cities, while there are such vast vacant areas in the country. In the more closely-populated suburbs we find no yard space, and the children of the poor are compelled to play on the kerb and in the gutter. This does not, give the rising generation a fair show; it would be a good thing if there were a five-acre park for every half-mile' square of buildings in city and suburbs. This would be of advantage from many points of view, and one advantage would be the saving of expense in regard to criminology. The Minister must have considered that branch of sociology during his long study of political economy; and I know that he agrees with me, only, he happens to be in charge of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- There is no opportunity to study any branch of criminology in the House, unless it is on the Government side, where we have evidence that pledges are not always kept. The Government promised to resign office, and did not dc* so; and that, in the eyes of a great many people, is a political crime. I do not like the Bill at all, and I propose to divide the House on it. All who have the welfare of the masses of the people at heart ought to set their faces against this proposal to seize land dedicated to park purposes. As I say, there are many large areas of land at Lane Cove, Botany Bay, and up the Parramatta River that might be utilized by the Defence Department for ordnance stores; and we ought to compel the Government to refer the matter back to the Defence Department. It is to be regretted that the Bill has been introduced without due notice, because I should have liked to make some observations at length in support of my argument that we ought, in the matter of public spaces, to protect the people in every possible way. </para>

                    <para>.-! support the view so ably put forward by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs).</inline> It is 'always dangerous to&gt; interfere with the facilities provided for the recreation of the  children of the workers. This particular park is in my own electorate, and, therefore, I can claim to have some knowledge of the locality. It is in the centre of a thickly populated district, mostly given over to the purely working classes. In many of these suburbs the yards are small, and there is very little play-ground accommodation, so essential, not only to the physical, but the mental well-being of the young. This land has been dedicated by the State Government as a recreation ground; and one justification urged for its annexation is that the local borough council has no objection. I am not -at all concerned whether the local council has any objection or no; my concern is for the welfare of the people of the district. The council takes up what seems to me a very mercenary attitude; it is quite agreeable to part with this recreation ground if it is given compensation - if it is able to get some " boodle " out of the deal. We ought to be very jealous, and very loath to agree to the disposal of public grounds ©f the kind. In my opinion, not only the people of Leichhardt, but the people of the whole metropolitan area, will resent the action of the Defence Department. I admit that this land is eminently suitable as a site for ordnance stores, but it is not the only suitable land in the locality. All along the foreshore, in a north-easterly direction, there are miles to choose from, without taking away a public park. The Minister ought to consider the fact that this particular site is above what is known as the Iron Cove Bridge. It is a fixed bridge, with no span, and if ordnance stores are established in that locality it will be impossible to bring fully loaded ships alongside. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, as the honorable member suggests, there is a site near where Elliott Brothers have their works, in Rozelle.  There is a vast area there, with a good deep-water frontage, so that boats drawing 25 and 30 feet of water could get alongside. If one of these sites were chosen, it would then be possible to eliminate the great cost of handling and discharging from lighters, such as will be  involved if the Government scheme is adhered to. In addition to this, the proposal now before the House will deprive the people of that district' of a public park which has been dedicated to them. </para>

                        <para>- I quite believe the Minister, but I emphasize the fact that it is proposed to take away a public park, that the site is above the bridge, and thus it will be impossible to bring vessels alongside the stores, and that other and more suitable sites are available below the bridge, where deep-water frontages may be obtained, and so obviate the extra cost of handling. </para>

                        <para>- About 5 acres. I would prefer the opinion of the people to the opinion of others. It is quite unfair to spring a matter like this on the local residents. I am the member for that district, and I have not been consulted in any way, nor have I seen the reports. Surely the member for the district should have been consulted in some way. The Government have no right to take away from the people park lauds, dedicated to their use, while other sites adjacent to that area are available. Honorable members have a right to see these reports so that they may understand the whole circumstances in connexion with the matter. I again suggest to the Minister that he withdraw the measure, if only for the purpose of giving honorable members an opportunity of studying the reports. Surely that is not an unreasonable request, because honorable members should be supplied with the fullest information before they are asked to record their votes. In the interests of the people, and of honorable members themselves who desire to do the right thing, it is advisable that the reports should be made available. </para>

                        <para>. the Commonwealth may acquire . . . so much of the land described in the schedule to this Act as consists of a public park vested in or under the control of a municipal or local authority and dedicated to or reserved for the recreation of the people. </para>

                </list>
                <para class="block">Those words should make the Minister hesitate before proceeding further with this Bill. It should be withdrawn in its entirety, and at once. Surely, as has been said by the honorable member for Dalley, who represents the district, the Defence Department is not restricted to this particular site.- In any case, if the Government have to pay compensation, the amount so paid would probably go a long way towards purchasing some other suitable site that may be available. I realize that the Minister in charge of the Bill has been induced to take this action by representations from the Defence Department; and that he himself knows nothing about the locality, and is not likely to know that the nibbling process has been in operation for some time in regard to private lands in and around Sydney. </para>

                    <para>.- Before honorable members are asked to vote upon a matter like this, a locality-plan should be made available, particularly when the measure deals with parks in a big city like Sydney. We have been told by the Minister, by way of interjection, that it was only because the local authorities stepped in beforehand that they were compelled to bring forward the Bill, and that they could have taken the park by proclamation. Apparently, after all, some municipal authorities are looking after the welfare of their people by acquiring park lands. While I do not doubt the Minister's word for a moment, I think we should see the report before' we can be expected to vote on a matter like this. There can be nothing confidential about it. We are told that the land is required for defence purposes. If it were required for a fort, I would not hesitate for a moment, but seeing that it is merely required for ordnance stores, for holding such articles as boots, clothing, and ammunition, the further they are outside a big city area the better it will be. As the representatives of the people, we should be sure that the people themselves know what is being proposed. The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony),</inline> who represents the district, has told us that he was not aware what was being done until the Bill was brought before the House to-night. If the Defence Department in Victoria were to propose to take away part of Yarra Park for the purpose of ordnance stores that action would be just as much justified as the doing of what is here indicated. Probably it would be more so, because Melbourne is better off for parks, at any rate in the inner area, than any other city. So we should safeguard the interests of the people by seeing that not a foot of their land is taken from them. When the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Bill was brought forward, it was proposed to take away part of a park in Port Augusta for railway purposes. </para>

                        <para>- Quite right, too. If there is one man above all others whose name should be revered in Melbourne, it is a former town clerk, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FitzGibbon,</inline> who did much to retain to the people the parks dedicated on their behalf. We should carry on that good intent. We are told that the portion of land here involved will not be required for a long term. But every big city of Australia to-day is growing bigger. In Sydney, for example, there is an institution known as the Millions Club; which holds a luncheon every week, and whose members are looking forward to the time when their city will have 1,000,000 inhabitants. Instead of taking away from the public parks, we should be adding to them. 1 protest. There is nothing to stop the Federal Department from taking part of our Fitzroy Gardens next. The Government should postpone further dealing with the Bill, and, at least, permit honorable members to see the report, since it cannot be confidential. I trust that the Government will obtain, in addition to the opinions of the local councillors, the views of the people in the locality. Even municipal councils have made mistakes. Bodies such as that are not always representative of the people who have elected them. They have, in some circumstances, allowed lands to be taken for certain purposes, to which action the ratepayers themselves have later objected. I trust, therefore, that if the Government will not withdraw the Bill, there will be sufficient members on the other side as public spirited in this matter as the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford),</inline> who will vote against the public parks being used for any such purpose as this. I had not seen this measure until to-night, and I had no idea of its contents. It is not fair to take away from the people reserves to which they should be entitled for all time, and it is our place here strongly to resent such things. It is easy for the authorities to go about their purchases in this manner, rather than having to go to the expense of buying land in the ordinary way; but the practice is wrong. I, therefore, hope the Government will not put me in the position of having to vote against the measure. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say it is secret, and I do not know whether I am in a position to use it or not. But, after having read the document, I certainly think it warrants the request to hold the question over for further consideration, or, at any rate, until it has been investigated by the Public Works Committee. It appears that the reason why the city authorities stepped in and reserved this park was because just previously they had handed over part of Wentworth Park to the Wool Committee for the erection of buildings for the storage of the wool clip ; and the local authorities naturally became rather alarmed that the acquisition of public parks was being carried on to such an extent that the people might rise in indignation and voice their objections. That document should be read to the House. It is a report recommending the carrying out of the works. The only thing that would constrain me to vote for the Bill would be that it is a wai- measure, and that the stores would only be required during- the currency of the war. I assume that they would be temporary buildings. There is a recommendation in the documents in the possession of the Minister that if they cannot take the land under the Lands Acquisition Act, it should be secured under the War Precautions Act. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but it would also be more honest not to have to use the people's lands in such a manner at all. I view with grave suspicion the taking over of public parks which have been reserved to the people for all time by far-seeing statesmen of the past. Take the case of the Royal Park, Melbourne. This was reserved to the public, and as it was so big, and the population was so small, portion was sliced off for the erection of the Old Men's Homes. That was a public institution, and was built on public ground, and there was not much objection at the time. Next a Boys' Reformatory was built, and, I believe, also a Girls' Reformatory. During the period when I was in the State House there was still another proposition, to take out a considerable area from the Royal Park, to erect a receiving house. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> was one of the bitterest opponents, together with myself ; but afterwards an institution of that nature was constructed there. Another public institution has been recently erected in Albert Park. I refer to the South Melbourne Technical School. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>While this manner of procedure is cheaper in one sense, namely, the utilization of public 'land for public institutions, the policy is altogether bad. The land was originally dedicated to the recreation of the people; not to the construction of public services. The time will come when Melbourne will be a city of several millions. The men who laid out Melbourne set reserves all about it, and to-day one can practically walk around the city within parks. But the suburbs have been rapidly extending in all directions, and it is, unfortunately, almost an exception to see a park in the newer parts. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the Fitzroy Gardens, which are suich an ornament to the city, when first they were taken out of the public estate and reserved as a public park for all time, gave rise to a rumour of a peculiarly petty nature. They were dedicated as the result of the action of the Premier of that day <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J.</inline><inline font-style="italic">G.</inline> Francis), and it was said that, as he was living in a residence in Albert-street, overlooking the park, the reserve was set aside so that he might have a public garden in front of his own door. Such was the vision of the critics of that day. </para>

If the Government persist in carrying the Bill, they should provide that the buildings to be erected upon the land should be only of a temporary nature, and that when the war is over the domain should be handed back to the present authorities for the purpose for which it was originally set aside; that is for the recreation of the people. I repeat again the opinion that I expressed when a member of the Victorian Legislature, that it is bad policy to take over public reserves for the location of public institutions, removing them from the use to which they were originally dedicated ;. that is, as a playground and breathing space for city populations. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know the situation of 'the land that it is proposed to acquire, but if, as the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> suggests, this is only a temporary measure, I think the Government should refrain from taking over a recreation ground. There is plenty of room close to the present ordnance stores on land re- sinned by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I cannot see why the Government should not erect temporary stores there. </para>

                        <para>- In that case, I protest strongly against the taking over of a public park, and against the taking away of any piece of land that has been set apart as a breathing space for the public. Wentworth Park was a few years ago a fine stretch of land; but because the big wool magnates wanted to erect stores with a water frontage, portions of it were filched away, and another piece has been fenced off to accommodate a big kindergarten, so that instead of 50 or 60 acres of recreation ground, the public now have access to only 5 or 6 acres. This is going on everywhere in Sydney, although the city is growing rapidly. Darling Harbor and Pyrmont are being occupied wholly with big stores, and in course of time all the population will be driven from that part. I suggest that the Government should resume land on the northern side of the harbor, somewhere about Ball's Head, near the Vacuum Oil Company's works. In one of the bays, there is only a timber yard, with a splendid depth of water in front of it, so that a vessel of any tonnage could go alongside a wharf to load or discharge, and the locality is close to the Milson's Point railway which connects with every part of the State. The population of the Pyrmont and Darling Harbor district is being forced to move in the direction of Balmain, which every year is becoming more congested, and the need for this park will become greater as the years go by. Up Iron Cove way the water frontages are occupied as timber yards, or sites for factories like that of Messrs. Elliot Brothers, or for other private uses. Land could not be got there for a park except at an exorbitant price. A great deal of park land has been left unimproved, and those in charge of it have allowed it to become occupied for purposes other than those for which it was set aside. Now there is need for more land for recreation purposes. Only a few years ago the Government of New South Wales had to spend thousands of pounds in resuming part of the foreshores of Port Jackson for public recreation spots, the Sydney Ferries Company having bought up practically all the available spaces. The Government will be well advised to hold their hands in this matter until the Works Committee, or some other responsible body, can fully investigate the proposal, and pick a site which will be suitable for the Defence Department, allowing this park to remain in possession of the people. </para>

I do not think even the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony)</inline> will say that the site is not a suitable one for a central ordnance store, putting aside the objection on the score that the land is at present park land. </para>

There are two roads leading to it - one with a bad level and the other with a perfectly flat level. A man can walk along the new road into the site, which is just as flat as is the floor of this chamber. </para>

                        <para>- Does it not occur to the honorable member that it would make a splendid site for a park - perhaps a better site than it would for an ordnance store? Having brushed aside the difficulties attaching to a deep-water frontage and accessibility, let me deal with the park aspect of this question. I am not a believer in stealing public parks, and never have been. I had the honour of introducing into this House last session a Railway Bill, in which I made ample provision to prevent the railway authorities of the Commonwealth from improperly acquiring land which had been reserved for park purposes. The sentiment which was thus expressed is one which we will do well to jealously guard, because although we may now have ample space for recreation purposes, generations unborn will otherwise curse us for our lack of prevision. I confess that I could not suppress a smile when I heard the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)compare</inline> the land at Leichhardt with the Fitzroy Gardens- perhaps the finest gardens of their kind even in all Australia. May I say that, even in the presence of representatives from New South Wales? A big portion of those gardens represents made land. A splendid, noble park are the Fitzroy Gardens as we know them. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to recommend it to the honorable member as a model New South Wales sentiment too. This land at Leichhardt is not at all suitable for a park as we view it. It could never become a Fitzroy Gardens no matter how much money was expended upon it. It is largely reclaimed land which is as flat as is the floor of this chamber, and is almost upon the water-level. It is not a place which would ever induce any of the large centres of population to send their children or grown-ups there for picnic purposes during their leisure hours. There is no decoration on it, and practically a drain runs through it. I am sure that if the members of the Public Works Committee visited it they could not picture a park there, even with the eye of imagination. Some doubt has 'been expressed as to the wisdom of this particular site for an ordnance store. There is also a doubt as to what the municipality will do if the State assists it with this money. May I point out that there is plenty of open land all around this site. With the exception of the area which we have purchased, on which a few tenements stand on the road frontage, there are scores of hundreds of acres which are unbuilt on, and which could be acquired for park purposes as easily as this site could be. </para>

                        <para>- Because it is not suitable, inasmuch as it has not road, rail, or water frontage. All round this area, upon both sides of the arm of the harbor, is vacant land. The population ends where these ordnance stores are to be erected, and beyond there stretches country, some of which is flat and some of which is hilly and very stony. Honorable members cannot contradict my statement, because my knowledge is only two months old, and my memory of the facts is very fresh. I wish to get on with this work. It represents an important defence reform. I am therefore prepared to say that, if the purchase of this land is approved, the Government will make itself responsible for the substitution of a park area. </para>

                        <para>-That interjection reminds me of the story of the sceptic and the theologian, who were talking about Jonah and the whale. When the sceptic  expressed  a doubt as to whether the scriptural narrative represented a parable or a reality, he asked the man of God how he would prove the matter. Thereupon the theologian replied, " I will wait till I get to Heaven, and ask Jonah." "But," said the sceptic, "suppose that he is not there?" " Then," said the minister, " you may ask him." In like manner, if the present Government is not in office, I suppose that my honorable friend will be, and he can give effect to my promise.. I am one of those who believe that when a Government makes a promise its successors will honour it. The Government has a continuous being, and I make the statement which I have made with a full recognition of that fact. We shall make ourselves responsible for the substitution of a suitable area for park purposes if this acquisition be authorized, and I say unhesitatingly, after much investigation, the defence officers have failed to find a site as suitable as this within a reasonable distance of the city of Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- These stores are to be a large work, and will involve heavy expenditure. If the House consents to the ordnance stores being erected on this site, it almost binds the hands of the Works Committee, when reporting on the plans for the buildings, because the Committee will be obliged to report in favour of utilizing the land that has been acquired. The Government would do well to refer the question of the site, as well as the plans of the buildings, to the Public Works Committee, an independent body  elected by the House, and I feel sure that what the Committee recommend this House will adopt. </para>

                        <para>- Botany Bay is very extensive, and there is beautiful level land stretching nearly as far as Lady Robinson's Beach. It has a water frontage; it is close to a railway; it is suitable for ordnance stores, and it will afford plenty of room for expansion. Before we decide on the site, we should take into consideration the materials that are to be stored there, and how they are to be distributed. It is of no use to erect ordnance stores at one end of the city and to have to cart all the stores backwards and forwards. If the site at Leichhardt is adopted, the water frontage cannot be utilized except by means of lighters. About Botany Bay there is plenty of suitable land. </para>

                    <para>.- The speech of the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has made it easier for me to vote for this Bill. The debate has extracted from the Government an offer which would be of great advantage to the people of the Leichhardt district. I do not agree with the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> that the Public Works Committee should have the right to report upon the question of site. When the Public Works Bill was before the Parliament on the first occasion, the Labour Government of the day, supported by honorable members now sitting in Opposition, contended that all works to be controlled by the Navy and Defence Departments should be exempt from the supervision of the Public Works Committee. I think that was a proper provision, and I agree with the Acting Prime Minister that the selection of a site for ordnance stores is a matter for decision by the Defence Department's experts. This discussion is not by any means a waste of time. In connexion with the preservation of recreation reserves and parks in the towns and big cities of Australia, Parliaments should realize their responsibility as trustees of the people. I am invited, by inference, to believe that the governing body in this case might possibly be prepared to make some arrangement with the Federal Government, in the event of this piece of ground being used for the purpose proposed, to apply the money paid by the Commonwealth for its resumption to the purchase of some more suitable area in the vicinity for the recreation of the people. . The description of the site given by the Acting Prime Minister has been confirmed by honorable members who have known the locality for many years, and it is quite conceivable that in the immediate vicinity of this site better sites are to be found for the purpose of a public park. I am strongly of opinion that no portion of a public reserve should be withdrawn from the people except by an Act of Parliament. That is what is proposed in this case, and in view of the statement made by the Acting Prime Minister, that the Federal Government will be prepared to find the money necessary to purchase a site in the vicinity more suitable than this for the purposes of a park, I am prepared to support the Bill. </para>

                    <para>.- I remember that upon one occasion I strongly opposed a proposal submitted by the Government I supported at the time for the resumption of a public park. The proposal was submitted by the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archibald),</inline> and the opposition to it was so strong that the Bill to give effect to it was withdrawn, and we never heard of it again. The present Government would be wise to follow that procedure in connexion with this Bill. I remind honorable members that this Parliament, in 1906, in passing the Lands Acquisition Act, took care to prevent any Government acquiring any parks whatever under that Act. It is clear that the members of this Parliament at that time had a true conception of the need for public reserves in the interests of the health of the people. The area reserved for parks in Sydney is less than the area reserved in any city of its size in any other part of the world. We had a very big fight in Sydney some time ago to prevent the railway station at Redfern being transferred to Hyde Park. I was secretary to a Committee of which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid was  chairman,  that took an important part in that struggle, and prevented the proposed transfer. I have no great faith in municipal councillors in dealing with such matters. They are not disposed to regard them in the light in which they should be regarded in a National Parliament. I know every foot of the particular site referred to in this Bill, and am aware that a portion of it is ground which was reclaimed at a time when there were a considerable number of unemployed in Sydney. My opinion in connexion with this matter has not been altered in the slightest degree by the statements that have been made by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt).</inline> He has tried to make the case for the Government as presentable as possible, but this House should jealously guard every reserve proclaimed for the benefit of the people. We have been informed that land in the vicinity of this site could be obtained for park purposes, but we know that as soon as the land jobbers learn that the Government are after a site for the purpose they will take good care that it will not be possible to acquire a site of sufficient area except at an exorbitant price. .Honorable members have not been given the information which they ought to have before dealing with the proposal. It involves a principle with which honorable members opposite ought not to agree, and which cannot be accepted by honorable members on this side, who are more directly the representatives of the industrial masses, who make up 95 per cent, of the population. It would be well for the Government to allow this matter to stand over. I have no doubt that in the meantime more suitable sites can be suggested that will be easier of access by road and water. Honorable members would be unwise to run away with the idea that this is to be merely a temporary building. It will be a permanent structure. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear that he had so much political honesty. I was rather afraid that he might keep that fact bottled up, and that we should later on find that we had been deluded in giving our assent to this proposal. I shall call for a division on this Bill, even if I should have to vote against it alone. I am confident that the people do not desire that any of these public reserves should be interfered with. We know that in Great Britain, during the last twenty-five years, the people have moved heaven and earth to retain and increase the areas devoted to the recreation of the public. The military gentlemen have no care for the health of the people, but if there is one thing more than another a municipal, State, or Federal authority should look to it is the health of the people. Without a healthy community we* can make no progress. In 1906,. when there were not a great many Labour members here, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and others had the courage to include a provision in the Lands Acquisition Act withholding from the Government the power to take any portion of a park or reserve under that Act. That, in itself, should be sufficient to cause honorable members to recognise how serious it is to encroach upon reserves intended for the enjoyment of the people. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> spoke in the most callous terms of this proposal to encroach upon a public park. In his early political days, he told us, he held up the State House in his determination to prevent any encroachment upon public reserves, but to-day he goes back upon his early traditions. I hope that he will withdraw from that position. As Acting Prime Minister he has done fairly well in his efforts to conduct public business as it should be transacted, and I hope that he will not try to force this Bill upon the House without giving us the fullest information on the subject. The passing of this Bill will mean the introduction of the miserable principle of robbing the people of their recreation reserves. I hope the Minister will agree to the adjournment of the debate. </para>

The debate upon this Bill, however, has resolved itself into a conflict between the present-day requirements of a country in the middle of a great war, and the possible needs of unborn generations. We have been told by the representative of the district that these lands are not at present used as a park. </para>

                        <para>- If it had been required, it would have been furnished and used as a park long ago. I desire to vote on the merits of the proposal, and I think that those who oppose the Bill should make out a definite case against it. As it is, they have merely dealt in generalities in regard to the value of park lands to a great city. Every one recognises that open spaces are most desirable in every city, but here to-day, in the middle of a. great war, the Government tellus that they have searched Sydney and its environments and are unable to find a better site for the ordnance stores. </para>

The Acting Prime Minister, who is a Victorian, has been able, as the result of a visit to Sydney, to inform the House and the representatives of the metropolis of Sydney of the exact value of this particular site for the purpose for which it is required by the Department. He has also tpld us that it is surrounded by several hundred acres of land which are suitable for park purposes. That statement has not been contradicted. </para>

                        <para>- That difficulty could be overcome. If the Opposition desire support in their effort to preserve this area for the purpose for which it was originally dedicated, they should make out a good case. Speaking quite impartially, I hold that the Minister has made out a better case for the use of this site for ordnance stores at this period in our . history than the Opposition have done in regard to the claims of future generations. As the matter stands to-day, judgment must be given in favour of the Minister and the Government. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> who has just resumed his seat has advanced just such an argument as has been put forward by every one who has tried to rob the people of public parks in every city. The case for the people, he says, is not strong enough. I doubt if any one could make out a case strong enough to secure the honorable member's vote against this Bill. I resent the spirit of levity that prompted him to hurl insults at honorable members who know this district well, and who are fighting for the children for whom this area was intended as a playground. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> in discussing this matter, suggested that he was a lineal descendant of the gentleman with horns who  led our Saviour to the top of a mountain and showed him the dominions of the world. The honorable gentleman said, in answer to an interjection, " I cannot take you on to a high mountain and show you all the countries of the world." And then, not content with this Biblical reference, he proceeded to tell an anecdote of a Minister who might gb to Heaven, and of another who might go to Hades. I am astonished that such arguments should satisfy the honorable member for Wannon. </para>

                        <para>- Anything that suits the honorable member's purpose would satisfy him. In answer to an interjection, the Acting Prime Minister said that another suggested site could be shelled by the enemy. Does he not know that this site is only 6$ miles from the entrance to Port Jackson, so that it could be shelled by a vessel 20 miles outside the harbor? No one admires Sydney more than I do. I have never gone there without anticipations of pleasure, and have never left it without regrets. Another ridiculous argument advanced by the Acting Prime Minister,- was that the area in question was reclaimed land, and" could not be compared with the Fitzroy Gardens. The Fitzroy Gardens have been carefully tended for half a century, whereas this park was only proclaimed on 1st March last. There are 80 acres in the Fitzroy Gardens, but who can say what this 5^ acres may be in fifty years' time? I have seen land in Manilla five years after it has been reclaimed, and the Fitzroy Gardens could not surpass it in beauty of verdure or glory of plant life. Two names stand out in the history of Melbourne, that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> G. FitzGibbon, whose monument decorates that splendid approach to the city, St. Kilda-road, and that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> D. Carter, who prevented the Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company from having a right of way over the streets of Melbourne for ever. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FitzGibbon</inline> would never permit without a fight any portion of the people's land to be filched from them. It was owing to the efforts of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carter,</inline> seconded by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Bent, that the Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company is now defunct. I shall always protest against the filching of land. </para>

Where, is that House of God to-day ? It has been taken away, lock, stock, and barrel, from the steeple to the foundations, and on the very site of the foundations the passer-by to-day can see the vile notice, "For sale." No money in. the world could buy the site of the Temple of Jerusalem should it ever get back into the hands of the Jews. But my voice was the only one that was raised in protest against this action on the part of the Church of England. Where public lands are given for church purposes, and they are devoted to any other purpose, they should revert to the State. </para>

A. reserve was made for police purposes, and in the corner a public school was erected, but in time the police were removed, and for the sake of filthy lucre, the Government of the day, to their dishonour, sold the block. The children were thus prevented from getting direct access to Yarra Park, and are compelled to cross a tram line to get to a playground of about half an. acre. </para>

                <para>In these days, when education is spreading more world-wide, when every tendency is towards the building of garden cities, and encouraging plant life with all its health-giving qualities, I am surprised that the Acting Prime Minister should take the attitude he has adopted. In England, cemeteries have been resumed so that little feet may play over the graves of dead humans. In Melbourne beautiful building sites facing St. Kilda-road were filched from Albert Park. In Victoriaparade, land has been taken away for the purpose of bowling greens, though I must admit that' the clubs are compelled to erect low fences, and in any case a bowling green is a health lung, because it is not covered with buildings, and it does grow verdure, which purifies the air of a city. There was another proposed steal when it was sought to build a railway along the parade. A piece of land has also been filched for a bowling green in the Flagstaff Gardens, tout the green is open to the public. Again, in these cursed days of commercialism and love of lucre, it is proposed to shift the honoured dead, so that the voices of a market can be heard, though I am not astonished. After all, the British race seem , to be somewhat careless in their reverence for the dead, or, at least, show to great disadvantage in comparison with the love of the Eastern races for those who have gone before. In the case of this Old Cemetery, with its tombstones lying at various angles, I could imagine the municipal authorities covering it with a beautiful sward and making it a playground for children, because if ever the spirits of the dead come to earth again, no music could be sweeter to them than the laughter and cries of children. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, in two of the most beautiful lines he wrote. Melbourne was splendidly laid out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoddle,</inline> but any one going into some of the suburbs would be staggered and angered at the narrow streets to be found there. In Carlton there is a street 9 feet wide, from house to house, and it is said that a very important member of the City Council has buildings there, though better buildings have been condemned and removed. While Melbourne is splendidly laid out, thanks to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoddle</inline> - to whom I hope we shall see a monument raised some day - the suburbs are not as well supplied with parks as they should be; and the infamy attaching to some of the narrow streets is only equalled by the absurdities on the part of the City Council in allowing buildings of all sizes fo be erected in the principal thoroughfares. As to the particular piece of land under discussion, I at first thought that the Defence Department desired it because of deep water that might be found there, so that they might run up ironclads and place the armament on board, but the fact of the bridge being a fixed structure, and not a drawbridge, removes any idea of that kind. If deep water is the idea, why not find a piece of land in Jervis Bay where many advantages could he found from the point of view of the Defence Department. Again, there is Callan Park, which the State Government are giving up, and which could well supply the requirements of the Department. </para>

                <para>As to the filching of park lands, what is the history of the West Melbourne recreation ground? First of all, there were 7 acres allotted on the West Melbourne swamp, and some £300 or £400 was spent in placing the scrapings of the streets on the area in order to raise the level, though the cost, no doubt, would have been over £1,000 had it been necessary to pay for the cartage. One little bit after another of this recreation ground has been filched, the latest by the Railway Department, until now there is not enough on which to make a cricket ground. </para>
                <para>As a matter of principle, I shall, on every occasion, vote against the acquisition of land for departmental purposes in this way, especially when it means depriving the children of their playground. We all know that some of the finest plantations in the world have been grown on reclaimed land. I have in my mind that magnificent piece of reclaimed land in Manila which, after only five years, presents a sight that cannot be equalled elsewhere. I trust .that the Government will withdraw the measure; and my suggestion need not mean delay, for it would be possible to enter into negotiations with the New South Wales Government for even 10 acres of Callan Park, thus allowing for future development. A Consul for Nicaragua, who was in Berlin on business, told me he had seen a building in that city with 2 square miles of floor space, and of four stories above, and four stories below the surface intended for the storage of ammunition, to be used only in case of invasion of Germany, and that there were similar buildings in every one of the' States of that Empire. I thank the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony)</inline> for his strong protest against the acquisition of this land; and I warn honorable members who vote in favour of the measure, that some day they may find a' similar proposal in regard to land in  their own constituencies. If so, they should then remember some of the remarks, unwise and illogical,  that have fallen from the lips of the Acting Prime Minister, and the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers).</inline></para>

It is most important, if this work is to be carried out properly, that the men in charge should be able to devote the whole of their time to their duties. These two appointments carry a salary of £1,500 and £1,250 respectively, and I think the Committee should have a full explanation from the Treasurer in connexion with this matter. There are other items which might be discussed, but I have no desire to do so at this juncture. This matter has been sprung upon the Committee, and even if the money has been spent, members should be furnished with the fullest explanation. </para>

The Treasurer has told us that these matters were discussed at some length the other evening, and I must say that I was so surprised to find, in 1918, that we were asked to consider the Supplementary Estimates for the financial year 1915-16, that I did not recover myself for quite a while, because I was Treasurer at that time. But of course we made great allowances for the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> then. Honorable members will remember that when I asked him the other day whether he had made an arrangement with the Ministry that no important business was to be taken until his return, he replied that there was no such agreement. We were much kinder to the Prime Minister than his present colleagues are. In fact, we nursed him. The intellect of the Prime Minister is like a sponge - it can absorb ideas very readily. I believe that, with regard to the Science Bureau, some one approached the </para>

                <para class="block">Prime Minister and pointed out -what an excellent thing it would be for the Commonwealth to have a Bureau of Science and Industry. I understand that a plan was set out for him. He ably grasped it, and made a great and eloquent speech to a number of visiting scientists, who were subsequently entertained - and rightly so. The Bureau was appointed; but its <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> consists chiefly of University men, and the great fault that the public have to find is that its members, while eminently successful in their particular sphere, cannot hold a candle - the majority of them - to such practical men of science as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> the Federal Analyst. He works in a small office, and is doing the practical work, which members of such a body as that should all be expected to be associated with. I believe, however, that the Federal Analyst and his office have been entirely overlooked by the Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>- I am not. My impression is that, like a great many other things which the Prime Minister has taken up, this Science Committee has not materialized as he had dreamed. Why has not the Prime Minister put the money which he is allowing the Science Committee to spend - and it is somewhere about £22,000 per annum - to really practical purposes? And what is the Committee doing? Its members are investigating the prickly pear, in Queensland. They should ask the Queensland Government how much money has been spent on the prickly pear. The State authorities offered a prize of £10,000 to any one who could discover a method of ridding the land of the pest at £1 per acre. For years that offer was open.  The prickly pear is so severe in Queensland, that not only the </para>

                <para>I have noticed, also, that the Science Committee has been investigating the question of alcohol for power purposes; and something has been written by that body upon the subject. Its members do not seem to be aware that books dealing with the problem have been for a long time available to the public, and that ten years ago evidence was given before a local Royal Commission on the matter of alcohol for power purposes. Had the Science Committee gone to a practical man such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> he could have given a lot of information. Apparently, however, it did not want that gentleman. I do not know why, but its attitude was such that it will be found, if the Minister concerned cares to investigate, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson</inline> ceased to attend the meetings. This is a matter which only those who are prepared to be held in public ridicule and contempt will take up. One does not like to indulge in criticism which may offend the susceptibilities of university men, but in the performance of public duty a member must tell the Committee what is common  report, and I have heard that these university' professors are in the habit of holding two meetings a day, and charging two guineas for each meeting. </para>

                        <para>- I have been waiting for a long time to say something concerning the Bureau of Science and Industry. The establishment of such a bureau was a good thing ; but the Bureau will not be of much service unless qualified men are appointed to it. I do not suppose that you could get a better man than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gellatly</inline> to edit the financial news of a morning newspaper; but I am not aware that even his studies as a barrister have qualified him for the position of director of the Bureau. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Acting Prime Minister to defer the consideration of this measure until to-morrow. In the meantime, he can go through the file of papers and ascertain the qualifications possessed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gellatly</inline> for this position. He might also call for a report as to the services rendered to the Commonwealth by that eminently practical man, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson.</inline> I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson</inline> possesses the same university degrees as do other gentlemen whose services have been requisitioned by the Prime Minister, but I do know that he has rendered great service to Australia. If the Government had spent only half the amount that it is proposed to expend in adding to his buildings and apparatus, I venture to say that the Bureau would have grown into an institution of immense service to the Commonwealth. I congratulate the Acting Prime Minister and his colleagues on the attitude which they have assumed towards honorable members on this side of the chamber. If we ask for information now, we are not treated as though we were children. </para>

When he was acting on a Commission, either in connexion with the New Hebrides mail service or the pearl-shelling industry, and when I filled the office of Treasurer, a request came along for more money on behalf of that Commission. I asked the secretary for the Department to endeavour to ascertain when the Commission was likely to conclude its labours. </para>

I was under the impression that the Committee would be willing to patch up this finance swiftly and decently. The Bill was carried into Committee with satisfactory celerity, and, although I expected opposition from gentlemen who might not approve of items set out in the schedule, I certainly did not expect it from Che man who was chiefly responsible for their inclusion there. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> will admit that when I introduced the Bill, I threw no blame upon anybody. </para>

                        <para>- There were no flowers, by special request. It was not my business to allocate the blame, but to get the business through. When a question was raised as to whether I thought the procedure was a regular one, I felt bound to admit that I did not. But I pleaded for a swift passage of the Bill. The honorable member for Capricornia has suggested, with unaccustomed kindness, that we are endeavouring to do some work. I admit the soft impeachment. I want to get the business through. This Bill was brought forward to give the Senate - which, in consequence of two censure motions, has not been working overtime - something to deliberate upon. That, I take leave to say, is a reasonable ground for passing these measures to-night. Regarding the question which has been raised as to the Science Bureau, it is not for me at this stage, looking back over a period of twenty-four months, to deal with the appointments that have recently been made. There are no sums in these Estimates dealing with the salary of .the Director who has been appointed. Honorable members will recollect that, at an earlier stage of the session, I gave a definite assurance that this year'. Estimates would be dealt with in Committee of Supply. They will come on for consideration before the close of this financial year. Honorable members will, perhaps, get them sooner than they expect if they give a swift passage to other, measures. They will admit that the notice-paper is not a full-dress one. </para>

But he ought to assist us when we are trying to do his work for him. Whatever the Committee does with the 1917-18 Estimates which will follow, I appeal to the Committee to pass through those for 1916-17, and give the Senate an opportunity to deal with back finance. In regard to the creation of the Bureau of Science and Industry and the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, the Committee will be given the full opportunity of dealing with them at the proper stage, and the Government will afford honorable members the fullest information in our possession. </para>

                    <para>. - There is in these Estimates an item for payment for services rendered in connexion with the regulations under the War Precautions Act. There has been a good deal of expenditure under that Act, and much of it might be described as having been incurred by unclean methods. A lot of money must have been paid to " pimps", who go about looking through keyholes and gimlet holes, and listening to what people are saying in order to prosecute them under the War Precautions Act. Only one section of the community has been selected for such prosecutions, and I do not think that is fair. The War Precautions Regulations ought to be applied to all sections of the community alike. </para>

                        <para>- I have never endeavoured to set one section of the community against another, because, as the Treasurer knows, religious differences in a country will cause more trouble than anything else. Once the fires of religious bigotry have been kindled it is difficult to extinguish them. Why are these gentlemen allowed to continue making remarks and calling meetings with the intention of creating disunity in the community ? </para>

                <para>There is another item for the maintenance of persons admitted to charitable institutions in accordance with the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. I ask the Ministry to seriously consider allowing the benevolent institutions the full amount of 12s. 6d. for each inmate. If those persons were not in the institutions the Government would be required to pay that sum. As the Treasurer knows, in these times, when money is being daily collected for the different activities associated with the war, it is very difficult to get subscriptions for benevolent purposes. I should like to know whether the Government have any intention to deal with that question. I hope that, for the reasons I have given, the Acting Prime Minister will agree that the matter is worthy of serious consideration. </para>

                    <para>.- There are one or two matters upon which I should like to have some information. First of all, will the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> say what, if any, has been the result of certain consultations, which I understand were to take place, in connexion with the conscription of Italians resident in Australia? </para>

                <para>The next matter to which I wish to refer is a statement made by Alderman Reid, who is said in the press report to be an ex-Mayor of Manly and a member of the State War Council of New South Wales, when engaged in a recruiting rally at Tamworth. He is reported, in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 24th April, to have said that that might be the last chance which his auditors would have of offering their services voluntarily, as the British Government might issue a proclamation conscripting eligibles in the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para>A statement appeared in the press a week or so ago to the effect that there was a motion before the Senate of the United States of America concerning the conscription of Australians resident in that country.

                <para>In last Friday's or Saturday's issue of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> a paragraph appeared to the effect that the Hunter's Hill Municipal Council, in the electorate of the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline></para>

In view of the fact that the Federal representative of this body is seeking to bring about a better feeling in the community, I suggest that the municipal council in question might be asked to fall in with the newer spirit which the Government are seeking to introduce. </para>

                        <para>- I did  not take  that view of what he said. I desire to point out that if we are to have a series of fresh conferences within the States, to wrangle over again about the matters dealt with at the Recruiting Conference, that will be the very way in which to nullify any good effects  that might have  been expected from that Conference. If the Recruiting Conference has not completed its work, it should be called together again in order that it may do so. No good can result from the cornering of different sections in different parts of the Commonwealth in the hope, possibly held by some people, I was going to say, that a babel of voices would lead to further dissension. </para>

                <para>Another matter I should like to mention is that of Home Defence. Surely the Government might take this House into its confidence in this matter. As it has come before the Cabinet, every member of the Government should be acquainted with what is proposed to be done. We were told some days ago by the Acting Prime Minister that he would have a statement of the matter prepared . </para>

                    <para>. - Replying, first of all, to the question put by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony),</inline> I can only say that I know nothing about the matter, but will ask my honorable colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> who is in charge of the Department concerned, to inquire into it. I am not anxious to detain the House by replying to all the questions that have been raised on this motion, more particularly as some who have spoken have gone away. In answer to the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts),</inline> I may say in regard to the question of the Italian reservists that I was unable to meet the Consul-General for Italy this evening, but have arranged to meet him to-morrow morning. I had not heard before of the utterance of the " little boy from Manly." I do not approve of it. This Government will be no party to the operation of conscription in Australia by means of British Government regulation or edict. As long as we are a self-governing dominion that must be our attitude. As to the gossip - I think, judging by the way the honorable member referred to it, that it could only have been gossip - to the effect that the conscription of Australia was to be undertaken by the American authorities, I do not credit it. </para>

I know nothing of the Hunter's Hill incident, but will direct the attention of the Minister for Recruiting to it.

As for the action of the Government of New South Wales, represented by the Minister for Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beeby),</inline> I know nothing, except that we cannot control the Government of the Mother State of Australia. They were parties to an important section of the agreement or understanding arrived at at the Recruiting Conference, but we cannot do more than endeavour to persuade them in the matter of how they observe it, or operate it. I would have no hesitation in representing to them the Federal view of the spirit of that compact, if needs be, but beyond that I can do nothing, because they are a sovereign Government, and at liberty to act. However, if I understand aright the spirit of the Premier of New South. Wales and his colleagues in regard to this matter, they are trying to get at a <inline font-style="italic">modus vivendi</inline> satisfactory to all parties, as we are. </para>
