Upon my return to Melbourne, the  President  informed me of the action he had taken, which was in accordance with  a  practice that has been in existence for some years, under which, when either of the presiding officers of Parliament is absent from Melbourne, and a matter suddenly arises requiring immediate attention, it is dealt with by the other, acting on behalf of either or both, but subject to the subsequent approval of the one who is absent.

        <para class="block">I then instructed the Serjeant-at-Arms to have the parcels again placed in the north lobby. . On the afternoon of the 28th February a military officer in uniform, named Lempriere, accompanied by a detective, waited in my absence upon the  Clerk  Assistant of the House of Representatives, and produced a search warrant under the War Precautions Act, signed by GeneralWilliams, State Military Commandant for Victoria, giving authority to seize certain parcels said to contain printed copies of speeches delivered by the &#39;honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts),</inline> in this House, on the 15th and I8th January last respectively, and stated that owing to my absence he had been unable to see me on that or the previous day in connexion with the matter. The  Clerk  Assistant was asked by the military officer to produce the parcels. The  Clerk  Assistant informed the officer that they were the private property of the honorable member for Cook, and were not official documents; also that he knew they had been lying for some time in the north lobby of the building, but where they were at that time he was unable to say. He further said that as officer then in charge of the Department he would take no responsibility in the matter, and that any action the military officer took in the way of searching the building or seizing the parcels of printed matter would be entirely on the military officer&#39;s own responsibility. The officer in charge of the north lobby, acting under the  Clerk  Assistant&#39;s instructions) refused to give any information as to the whereabouts of the parcels. The military officer and the detective searched for and found them in the Labour party room. The parcels were then removed from the building, and were taken away in a motor car driven by a soldier in uniform. In response to my request for information as to the reasons for this action being taken, I received the following letter from the Minister for Defence :  - </para>

              <para>- A copy is available. The proceedings being unusual, and, so far as I have been able to ascertain, without precedent in parliamentary history, I have thought it right to report the incident to the House. It will be noted that the ground of the request for detention of the parcels differs from that given for their seizure. The first was to allow of inquiry being made as to the legality of the use of the Commonwealth Arms on the reprint of a speech without reference to the nature of the matter contained therein. The latter was on grounds of military necessity, involving the safety of the Commonwealth. </para>

You have reported something to the House, and it is now in the power of the House to make any motion it cares to dealing with it.

              <para>- May I, on a point of order, state my case ? You, sir, have made a statement dealing with certain events that have transpired since the last meeting of the House. In that statement there are allegations made against the action ofthe Ministerfor Defence, and as these allegations seem to reflect on the Government, because for whatever the Minister for Defence does the Government is responsible, I am desirous of making a statement as to what actually took place. You raised the question, not, of course, by way of privilege, but as the custodian of the rights of this House. I am in the hands of the House, and Ido not think that my honorable friend&#39;s motion of privilege, or any discussion which might arise, would be interfered with if I just set out the facte as I have seen them. If it is thought proper I shall withhold my view, as AttorneyGeneral, on the question of whether the rights of the, House have or have not been invaded. I think that might be conceded, though I am not going to push the point. This is a matter that concerns the House, but it is a reflection, and a very serious reflection, on the Minister for Defence, and, consequently, on the Government. As  Speaker,  you, sir, have set out certain facts, and I desire to set out the facts as I have them. </para>

          <para class="block">As set forth in the statement which yon, sir, have made, the  President  of the Senate, on Saturday, 23rd February, received a message from the Minister for Defence, asking the  President  to hold certain .parcels which were lying in the lobby of this House. The contents of the parcels have nothing to do with the question before us, and I trust that it will be considered apart from the individual concerned. These parcels were the private property of an honorable member, and, in the first instance, they were held, not at your request, but by the  President  of the :Senate,N acting for you.

What has happened to an honorable member on this side may happen to honorable members opposite to-morrow. It is not to be thought that, because honorable members opposite are in the majority today, they will always be in a majority, and that they can play fast and loose with the rights and privileges of honorable members. This is the most serious thing that has happened, so f aT as the privileges of honorable members are concerned. Regarding the speech itself of the honorable member concerned, it must not be forgotten </para>

              <para>- I admit that, but it must not be forgotten that every word of the speech had been circulated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> throughout Australia, so that this was a belated action on the part of the Government. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the military authorities were so anxious to obtain the copies of the speech, that they stated they were taking them because they bore the Australian coat of arms. Why, every member of the House is supplied with, notepaper bearing the coat of arms. Is it proposed to stop that practice, and supply us with private notepaper? To show how the coat of arms is used in every direction, I have in my hand an advertisement in reference to the rabbit industry, and at the top of it is the coat of arms of the Commonwealth. Apparently the Government have gone out of theirway, and made a serious invasion into the rights and privileges of honorable members, in an endeavour to prosecute one honorable member. This, however, is not merely a matter of the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts)</inline> and his speeches, but a matter of the rights and privileges of Parliament, which have been handed down from time immemorial. The 12th edition of <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> contains case after case, and reason after, reason, showing what the privileges of honorable members are. There has never been an action like that under notice connected with this or any other Parliament. If there be a desire on the part of the authorities to take proceedings against an honorable member there is ample opportunity outside Parliament - there is no room inside. The Prime Minister has stated, or rather inferred, that it is his intention to set forth his view as Attorney-General on the question of privilege, and, I presume, to give the reasons of the Minister for Defence for the action taken. This matter ought not to be treated as a party matter in any sense. I asked the Prime Minister whether he was prepared to get up in his place and seek to conserve the rights of honorable members.- It is his duty, or, in his absence, the duty of the leading Minister present, to protect the rights and privileges of honorable members. I &#39;remind honorable members that whatever is done to-day in this matter will She taken as a precedent. If the motion is not carried, it will be open to the military to come into this Parliament and seize the private property of honorable members. There will be nothing to prevent the military walking in at that door and, not only stopping any honorable member who might have possession of the floor, but stopping the whole proceedings of the House. Once we admit that the military power is supreme - that it has a right over Parliament, a right which I think would not be admitted by honorable members opposite- </para>

              <para>- But what I have suggested will be the position if we &#34;acquiesce in the action taken by the military. On the 2oth February, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> you informed me that you had written to the Minister for Defence protesting against his action, and ordering that the parcels be replaced. They were replaced on &#34;Wednesday, 26th February, and were deposited in the north lobby alongside the messenger&#39;s box. From there they were removed by the messengers themselves into one of the party rooms. All the party rooms and &#39; the corridors are marked &#34; Strictly private,&#34; and reserved for the use of members only. f Further, it is recognised that no honorable member goes into the room of another party unless accompanied by a member of that party, or on some invitation or authority. The same applies to the Ministers&#39; rooms. On this occasion, however, the military and the detectives marched into the Parliament House, and seized the private property of an honorable member. If an honorable member is guilty of any wrong, in the opinion of the Government, there is, as I have already said, plenty of opportunity for action outside without the invasion of Parliament. It is breaking no confidence when I say that on the 26th February you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> informed me that you had ordered the SerjeantatArms to have the parcels replaced, thus safeguarding the rights of members. On the Thursday, however, when, so far as I can learn, no member of Parliament was present, the military came into the building and seized the parcels. If the military have power to do that they have power to seize anything they like. </para>

              <para>- I shall be pleased to incorporate it in my speech, although I should have liked it to be added to your own statement, so that it might appear in its proper place inHansard. Realizing the gravity of this matter, and the important effect which the action of the military authorities would have upon the rights and privileges of honorable members, I requested the Parliamentary Librarian to look up for me authorities bearing on the question. &#34; He advised me that he could find few cases of the kind. </para>

          <para>Both Houses of Parliament enjoy various privileges in their collective capacity, as constituent parts of the High Court of Parliament. We are above all Courts, and the privileges we enjoy cannot be tampered with except by Parliament itself. The point I wish to emphasize is that Parliament should not destroy any of its rights and privileges. If honorable members are prepared to whittle them away by voting against this motion, and so upholding the action of the military authorities, they will create a very dangerous precedent. It will be saidthat the House deliberately handed over to the military power, at a time of war, a right which Parliament alone should enjoy. </para>
          <para>We ought to consider this question apart from its relation to the honorable member for Cook himself.

            <para>Again, in the 4th Henry VIII. (1512), <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Strode,</inline> a member of the. House of Commons, was prosecuted in the Stannary Court for having proposed certain Bills to regulate the tinners in Cornwall, and was fined and imprisoned in consequence. Upon which an Act was passed, which, after stating that Strode had agreed with others of the Commons, in putting forth Bills, &#34;the which here, in this High Court of Parliament, should and ought to be communed and treated of,&#34; declared the proceedings of the Stannary Court to be void, and further enacted that all suits and other proceedings against Richard Strode, and against every other member of the present Parliament, or of any Parliament thereafter, &#34; for any Bill, speaking, or declaring of any matter concerning the Parliament, to be communed and treated of, be utterly void and of none effect.&#34; As the proceedings which had already taken place against Strode were declared to be void, it is evident that freedom of speech was then admitted to be a privilege of Parliament, and was not at that time first enacted; and that the Statute was intended to have a general operation in future, and to protect all members, of cither House, from any question on account of their speeches or votes in Parliament. </para>

They have an opportunity here to protect the rights and privileges of this House, and rather than agree to the whittling away of the rights of Parliament, it would be far better for them to admit that one of their party has made a mistake. </para>

              <para>-Will the honorable member allow me to finish my sentence, just as he would do if it were a sentence under the War Precautions Act? Under that Act the Government are trying to rope in every member of our party. The Act is being used in a way never intended at the time of its passing. An honorable member of the Opposition is being persecuted merely because he is an official of the Labour party. Honorable members opposite may also try to shelter themselves behind the plea that, to use the words employed by the Prime Minister at Bendigo, pressure is put upon them by outsiders;but they cannot deny that if they do not protest against this action by the military authorities they willbe submitting to a taking away of the rights and privileges of Parliament. They may console themselves with the thought that they are in a majority to-day, and that when the Labour party returns to office it will be sufficiently fair-minded to preserve the rights and privileges of every member, notwithstanding that the party in power to-day is following a policy of victimization. Such conduct is unworthy of any member of Parliament ; and I hope that, when we proceed to a vote, the motion will be carried. The question involved is too important to be disposed of in the two or three hours available to us to-day. We cannot deal hurriedly with it. </para>

        <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir,- The Clerk</inline> Assistant has reported to me that about 3 o&#39;clock yesterday afternoon, in my absence, he was waited upon by a military officer in uniform, accompanied by a detective in civilian attire, armed with a search warrant issued under the War Precautions Act. </para>
        <para>The object of their visit was to seize some parcels of printed matter, said to contain reprints of a speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> H. Catts, M.P., in connexion with a recent debate in the House. </para>
        <para>The  Clerk  Assistant informed the officers that any such parcels were the private property of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts,</inline> and he could give them no information concerning them. He furthermore informed them, as acting head of the Department, that any action they, might take in the way of search or seizure within the precincts of the building would not be with his consent, and would be entirely on their own responsibility. </para>
        <para>The officers then made a search in one of the rooms set apart for the exclusive use of members, and, I am informed, removed a number of parcels of printed matter, addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> H. Catts, M.P. </para>
        <para>I would be glad to know the reasons which prompted your Department taking a course of action involving intrusion into the rooms of Parliament House, and the removal in their absence, and without their consent, or the consent of the  Speaker,  of the private property of members. </para>
        <para>I need hardly point out that questions of members&#39; rights and privileges are involved in the proceeding, and it will be necessary for me to direct the attention of the House to the matter. </para>

            <para>By the Parliamentary Papers Act 1840 (3 and 4 Viet., .c. 9 ) , passed in consequence of the decision of the Court of Queen&#39;s Bench in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Stockdale</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> (see p. 134),&#39; it was enacted that proceedings, criminal or civil, against persons for the publication of papers printed by order of either House of Parliament, shall be immediately stayed on the production of a certificate, verified by affidavit, to the effect that such publication is by order of either House of Parliament. Proceedings are also to be stayed if commenced on account of the publication of a copy of a parliamentary paper, upon the verification of the correctness of such copy; and in proceedings commenced for printing any extract from, ,or abstract of, a parliamentary report or paper, the defendant may give a report in evidence under the general issue, and prove that his own extract or abstract was published <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> and without malice; and if such shall be the opinion of the jury a verdict of not guilty will be entered. </para>
            <para>The action of <inline font-style="italic">Barlow</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> was stayed 14th July, 1845, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Weightman in chambers, on the production of the Speaker&#39;s certificate. In the case of <inline font-style="italic">Houghton and others</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Plimsoll,</inline> tried at Liverpool, 1st April, 1874, Baron Amphlett directed the jury that the report of a Royal Commission presented to Parliament in a printed form came within the provisions of the Act, &#34; since it was a report which had been adopted by Parliament,&#39; and of which a distribution of copies had been ordered by Parliament.&#34; This judgment was followed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Darling in <inline font-style="italic">Mangena</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Edward Lloyd Limited</inline> (1908), 98 L.T. 640, an action for libel brought in respect of a statement contained in an extract from a paper presented to Parliament by command of His Majesty. The decision . in this case, the proceedings in which were presented to both Houses (see Cd. 4403), was followed in <inline font-style="italic">Mangena</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Wright</inline> (1909), 2 K.B. 858. </para>

          <para>From these it will be seen that not only are the persons of members of both Houses of Parliament free from arrest on <inline font-style="italic">mesne</inline> process or in execution, but that formerly the same immunity was enjoyed in regard to their servants and their property. </para>
          <para>The two most f amous interferences with the freedom of the House are the demand of Charles I. for the arrest of five members and the expulsion of the long Parliament by Cromwell, the first of which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Speaker</inline> Lenthall implied to the King, was distinctly illegal, and the second an exercise of force which has no analogy to anything existing to-day. In the five years of the Wilkes case, though he was outlawed and committed by Parliament itself, yet it is worthy of notice that when he was arrested for the libel on George III., in the <inline font-style="italic">Forth Briton,</inline> he obtained a verdict and damages against Halifax, Secretary of State, for his action, on the ground that his parliamentary privilege had been transgressed by the Minister&#39;s causing his arrest. A case, in 1811, brought by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Francis</inline> Burdett against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Abbott for trespass for forcibly, and, with the assistance of armed soldiers, breaking into the messuage of the plaintiff, and arresting him there, for a libel on the House, in Cobbett&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Weekly Register,</inline> was decided against Burdett on the ground that action was taken on the authority of the House itself. The action could have been taken on the authority of the House,. but there is no right vested in any outside authority to take such action. That is the point of my contention to-day. The House itself has ample power to deal with the honorable member for Cook if he has committed any offence, but no outside authority may do so. I trust that Parliament will declare that that is the course of action which should have been followed, and will order that the parcels which were removed from the House should be restored. Unless we do that we shall be failing in our duty as members, and shall be whittling away the privileges possessed by this House. I have further extracts bearing on this subject - </para>
          <para>There are &#34;other privileges not specifically mentioned . . . though regularly asserted and enforced by the House. These are the right to provide for the due constitution of its own body, the right to regulate its own proceedings, and the right to enforce its privileges by fine or imprisonment, or, in the case of its own members, by expulsion. - <inline font-style="italic">(Anson.)</inline></para>
          <para>Privilege, however, as both <inline font-style="italic">Anson</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> aptly observe, is law, and must rest upon a legal basis; it follows that the Courts of law must, on principle, be competent to discuss the question where the boundary line is to be drawn between the jurisdiction of the ordinary Courts and the extraordinary jurisdiction which the Houses of Parliament are entitled to exercise for their own protection. - <inline font-style="italic">(Redlich.)</inline></para>
          <para>There is another proposition equally true, equally well established, which seems to be decisive of the case before us.What is said or done within the walls of Parliament cannot be inquired into in a Court of law. On the point all the Judges in the two great cases, which exhaust the learning on the subject, <inline font-style="italic">Burdett v. Abbott</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Stockdale</inline> v.Hansard, are agreed, and are emphatic. The jurisdiction of the Houses over their own members, their right to impose discipline within their own walls, is absolute and exclusive. To use the words of Lord Ellenborough, &#34; They would sink into utter contempt and inefficiency without it.&#34; - (From the judgment of Lord Chief Justice Coleridge in <inline font-style="italic">Bradlaugh</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Gossett.)</inline></para>
          <para>It would appear, I think, to be inherent in every assembly that possesses a supreme legislative authority, to have the power of punishing contempt, and not merely such as are a direct obstruction to its due course of proceeding, but such also as have a tendency indirectly to produce such an obstruction, in the same way as Courts of Record may not only remove or punish persons who actually are  interrupting their functions, but may also repress those who indirectly impede the administration of justice, by disparaging and weakening their authority. - <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Baron Parke, in giving the judgment of the Privy Council in the Jamaica case,</inline><inline font-style="italic">Beaumont</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Barrett,</inline> 1836.) </para>
          <para>If the &#34;War Precautions Act can take away all the rights and privileges of honorable members, as set out in the authorities I have quoted, we have arrived at a state of affairs to which no honorable member will be content to submit. If by an Act of this Parliament we have created a Frankenstein monster that can destroy us, the sooner we know the position the better. As we brought that Act into existence, surely also we have the right to amend, annul, or repeal it; but I say that the War Precautions Act can have no effect upon the rights and privileges of honorable members, and if honorable members on- the Government side say that because of that Act they are prepared to vote against this motion they will be adopting a course which they will have reason to regret. I trust that this debate will not be conducted in a party spirit. </para>

              <para>- Some honorable members, by their interjections, have endeavoured to make this matter a party question, but I hope that it will not be regarded as such. I hope that honorable members will record their votes free from any thought of party considerations, because it is not a party matter ; it is a matter affecting our rights and privileges. I hope also that honorable members will notregard the matter as one affecting the position of any Minister or Ministry. It is simply one that affects each of us individually as representatives of the people. We are the custodians of our own rights, and it will be a big mistake on our part if we do not carry a motion protesting against the intrusion, to use <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> own words, of a military force into Parliament, and the seizure of an honorable member&#39;s private property. The military authorities are no more entitled to seize the private (property of any honorable member than they are to come in and sweepclear the table of this House. That is the spirit in which, I hope, honorable members will treat this matter, and the spirit in which, I hope, they will vote upon a motion of protest against the action that has been taken. In supporting this motion, and in asking that the parcels seized by the military authorities shall be returned, honorable members will show their determination that their privileges shall be maintained intact. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Speaker</inline>seem to have fallen into a most curious error as to what privilege is. There seems to be an impression in the minds of some people that any action taken by a member of Parliament within these walls is sacrosanct, and immune from those ordinary legal consequences&#39; that would attend the action if taken outside.That is so in regard to some things, but to some things only. For example, anything said inside this building does not lay the person speaking open to action for libel or slander; men may say or do things here that they may not say or do outside; but men may not use these premises for purposes which are unlawful. The Leader of the Opposition, in the number of cases he has quoted, seems to have overlooked this most important fact, as well as the circumstances leading up to the seizure of papers about which he complains. We are at war. At this very moment the fate of this Parliament, <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> all its privileges, is trembling in the balance.

He therefore wrote, on 23rd February, to the  President  of the Senate, asking him, in the absence of the  Speaker,  to direct that the bulk parcels containing the leaflets be left at Parliament House.

          <para>I also call attention to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts,</inline> in December last, was convicted in Sydney on three charges under War Precautions Regulations 28 (1) (a), of making statements likely to prejudice foreign relations, and was ordered to enter into three several recognisances of &#163;200, &#163;100, and &#163;100 respectively, to comply with Regulation 28 (1) <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> during the war.

When the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. BT.

If the statements of the honorable member could be accepted by the Government of our Ally as expressing the opinion of the people of this country, then the position of the Commonwealth would be most serious. We stand now in a very grave position. We cannot afford to permit statements to be made which will imperil our relations with our Allies, and while I have the honour to occupy a position in the Government I will not allow any one to make them with impunity. When my honorable friend made those statements he must have known what the consequences would be. He was brought before the Court, and was convicted. At the first opportunity he repeated as much of them as he could, and used the cover of parliamentary privilege to do so. He proceeded then to reprint them, and to claim for the reprint the same privilege as is accorded to the original statement in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> That is not, and never has been, the law. </para>

If that be a crime, then I am guilty ; but I am, and&#39; always will be, one of the most zealous&#39; upholders of civil authority. It is con&#39; tended that a breach of privilege has be*en committed. That is not so. Let me set out what privilege is, its nature, and its , limitations. The charges against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts</inline> - as to the merits of which it is not desirable to say anything while they are <inline font-style="italic">sub  judice</inline> - are alleged breaches of the War Precautions Regulations. namely, making statements in print likely to prejudice our relations with our Allies, and printing matter relating to the war without submitting it to&#34; the Censor. </para>

          <para>The documents seized in the Parliament building by the Defence authorities are the printed matter which is the subject of these charges. Honorable members must know that that is the gravamen of the whole business. It is obvious that no question of privilege arises in connexion with this matter. Parliament House is not a sanctuary of refuge from the arm of the criminal law. It is not even a sanctuary for the persons of members themselves. </para>
          <para>My honorable friend the member for Yarra quoted a number of cases in which he sought to prove the contrary, but - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is not even a sanctuary for the persons of members themselves, as Lord Cochrane found in 1815, when having been convicted of a criminal charge and having escaped from prison he sat on the Privy Councillors&#39; .bench in the empty House of Commons, where he was promptly arrested by the Marshal of the s Court of King&#39;s Bench. The Committee of Privileges reported that the privileges of Parliament did not appear to have been violated so as to call for the interposition of the House by any proceedings against the Marshal <inline font-style="italic">(May,</inline> 11th edition, page 116). </para>
            <para>That was a case of the arrest of a member of the House of Commons in the very Chamber of the House. In the case now being- discussed, neither of these elements was involved. A competent military authority under the War Precautions Regulations has right of access to any building whatever, and to seize any articles as to which there is reasonable ground for believing that they will afford evidence as to the commission of any offence or are intended to be used for the commission of any offence. What happened was that a competent military authority, in pursuance of these powers, seized certain articles in a room in Parliament House building. If Parliament. House were a sanctuary from such proceedings it would mean that the building might be made a store-house, not only for seditious and unlawful literature of all kinds, but even of dangerous instruments of destruction. Such a position is not only opposed to all precedent, but is also too absurd for argument. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>It may be added that, as a matter of courtesy to the  Speaker,  the military officer, before making the seizure, endeavoured on two successive days to see the  Speaker,  and inform &#93;dm o&#34;f his intention; and in the Speaker&#39;s absence he informed the senior available officer of the Staff. </para>
          <para>There has been no invasion of the privileges of this honorable House. On the contrary, the honorable member deliberately endeavoured toy pervert those privileges for purposes incompatible with that welfare. After having made speeches which gravely imperilled the welfare .of the country, he sought to issue them in such a form as to give colour to the suggestion that they were official publications, and to give our Ally reason to so believe. As this is an offence under the law, the honorable member was not permitted to commit it. </para>

              <para>- I could not say. I assume it was. I am not going to defend even the issue of that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> itself. You will remember, sir, that on the occasion on which the speech was made my right honorable colleague, the Minister for the Navy, took occasion to direct your attention to the question. I venture to say, sir, that you would have been well advised to prevent that issue of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> being circulated at all, but you are the guardian of the rights of the House in that respect, and the Government did not interfere. But it will, as far as its authority goes, interfere to protect this House and the community from unnecesi sary danger. The honorable member is seeking now, he himself being charged with certain offences, to make this place the storehouse of matter intended to repeat these offences, and to repeat them in such a way as to enable him to evade the consequences. If he will go outside and say what is in that speech, he knows very well that his bond will be estreated, and that he will be arrested. He knows very well, also, that a reprint has not the same privileges attached to it as <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> has, and, as to the particular issue of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> it should never have been allowed to go out. Personally, I had intended to move a motion, but I shall content myself by saying - in this I speak for the Government, and, I think, for every member on this side of the House, and, I hope, for every member  on both sides - that, while I yield to no man in my zealous regard for the privileges of this House, which is a place where we are to. speak that which is in us, and to say fearlessly all that we think, we are not to say here or elsewhere that which will bring ruin to our country. We are not to play the part of traitors here, and then cover ourselves with the mantle of privilege. &#39;In the hour of deadly national peril we are not to increase that peril by insulting our Allies. No privilege has been violated, but, on the contrary, an attempt has been made by the honorable member to use those great traditional privileges that have been handed down to us, privileges that have been hardly won and nobly maintained, for ignoble, base, and treacherous purposes. </para>

            <para>- I can hardly allow certain remarks which the Prime Minister made in the latter portion of his speech to pass without some reference, since they seem to contain an implied reflection on myself, I feel sure unintentional, in my capacity as Speaker of the House. The right honorable gentleman, expressed the opinion that I should not have allowed the particular number of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> . in question to be issued or circulated. I would point out that, in the first place, I was not in the chair when the point of order was raised, having been temporarily relieved, and that, in the second place, I did not see the Hansard or the particular matter objected to until after <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> was printed. It is true that within certain limits <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is under the Speaker&#39;s control; but it would, in my opinion, be very undesirable to give to the  Speaker  the power to withhold the printing and circulation of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on his own responsibility, and without reference to the House. The exercise of such a power, however judiciously, would subject the  Speaker  to the risk of attack on every occasion on which any honorable member might think it had been exercised wrongly, and thus the  Speaker  might be constantly  having to explain and defend his action. The proper course to have taken, if the  House thought that objectionable matter had been uttered, which should not go into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> was to give a direction to that effect, and for the responsibility to be placed upon the House of either  excising that matter or ordering the non-publication of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Honorable members themselves are individually and collectively responsible for the contents of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and any serious interference with the matter of their speeches, in my opinion, is permissible only by direction of the House. </para>

          <para>Upon the occasion of the invasion of Parliament by Charles I. with the military (forces for the purpose of arresting five members who by their speeches had displeased him, the very plea urged by the Prime Minister to-day waa then put forward. It was then said that those men were guilty of treason because they had been in treasonable communication with Scotland, and. that the King had the right to come into the Parliament with armed forces and seize them. It was argued that their privilege did not protect them when they had been entering into treasonable communication with another part of the country that was in open rebellion to the Crown. </para>

This Parliament would be lost to all sense of its responsibility if it allowed passion, arising during a period like the present, to sway it, and resolve upon a retrograde step in connexion with the great privileges of the Legislature - a matter involving the paramountcy of the civil power as against the military forces of the King. </para>

          <para>In <inline font-style="italic">Burdett</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Abbott,</inline> a case brought in 1811 by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Francis</inline> Burdett against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Abbott for trespass for forcibly, and with the assistance of armed soldiers, breaking into the messuage (the household) of the plaintiff, arresting him there, and taking him to the Tower of London and imprisoning him there for a libel on the House inCobbett&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Weekly Register,</inline> was decided against Burdett on the ground that action was taken on the authority of the House itself. </para>
          <para>In the case of <inline font-style="italic">Bradlaugh</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Gossett,</inline> the following has been taken from the judgment of Lord Chief Justice Coleridge -  . . There is another proposition equally true, equally well established, which seems to me decisive of the case before us. What is said or done within the walls of Parliament cannot be inquired into in a Court of law. On the point all the Judges in the two great cases which exhaust the learning on the subject - <inline font-style="italic">Burdett</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Abbott</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Stockdale</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard -</inline> are agreed and are emphatic The jurisdiction of the Houses over their own members, the right to impose discipline within their own walls, is absolute and exclusive. To use the words of Lord Ellenborough, &#34; They would sink into utter contempt and inefficiency without it.&#34; </para>
          <para class="block">This, it will be noted, concerned the right of Parliament to impose discipline within its own walls. </para>
          <para>In the Jamaica case, 1836, a case coming from a dependency, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baron</inline> Parke, in giving the judgment of the Privy Council in <inline font-style="italic">Beaumont</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Barrett,</inline> said -  . . It would appear, I think, to be inherent in every assembly that possesses a supreme legislative authority to have the power of punishing contempt, and not merely such as are a direct obstruction to its due course of proceeding, but such also as have a tendency indirectly to produce such an obstruction in the same way as Courts of Record may not only remove or punish persons who are actually interrupting their functions, but may also repress those who indirectly Impede the administration of justice by disparaging and weakening their authority. </para>
          <para>The case of Lord Cochrane, referred to by the Prime Minister is reported in the House of Commons <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports, 1st. series, 6th March, 1815, to 1st May, 1815, page 335. Lord Cochrane had been arrested on a criminal charge, tried in the courts of the country, and sentenced to twelve months&#39; imprisonment. </para>
          <para class="block">He was in gaol, but broke gaol, and fled to the House for protection. The House was not meeting, but the Marshal, with his officers, re-arrested him and took him back to gaol. It should be noted that in this case the officer of the law wrote to the  Speaker  informing him that he felt it his duty to go to the House and re-arrest Lord Cochrane, who had broken from gaol. He said, &#34;I do not know whether I was right in doing so; I have no wish to transgress the privileges of Parliament. I submit myself to Parliament, and if my action was not right, I ask to be directed by Parliament.&#34; </para>
          <para>How different was the action in the case now under review. A military officer with clanking spurs walked into the House, and, regardless whether the  Speaker  agreed with his course of action or not, used military force to invade the privileges of this Parliament. </para>
          <para>In the case of Lord Cochrane, already quoted, the Marshal wrote to the  Speaker  asking for direction by the House. The Leader of the House stated he did not think parliamentary privilege had been infringed, but said that the House should be so jealous of its privileges that if any member had the slightest doubt about the matter, a Committee would be appointed immediately to inquire into it. One member only of the House expressed a doubt, and the Leader of the House at once moved for the appointment of a Committee, which reported subsequently that, in view of all the circumstances, and having no precedent to guide them, they did not think, in the peculiar circumstances of thecase, a breach of parliamentary privilege had been committed, but that the action taken must not be regarded as a precedent for the future. </para>
          <para>In the case now under review, Parliament was treated with absolute contempt </para>
          <para>Let us now see what procedure was adopted in recent French cases, notably those in which the ex-Prime Minister of France (M. Caillaux) and Senators Humbert and Loustallot were charged with treason within the last three months. The French Parliament had to specially decide whether it would waive parliamentary privilege and permit prosecution to take place in the ordinary courts of the country. The High Court of Parliament was the only body which could have tried these gentlemen had it not itself determined to abandon its own rights and privileges in favour of. a civil trial in the Courts of law. </para>
          <para>We come now to the argument of legality. The legal officers concerned are as prejudiced as any other people at the present time, and are prompted by the views and actions of their Ministers, and if I cared to degrade the debate by referring to personal matters, I could show, without any shadow of doubt, that a number of these recent cases have been prompted by vindictiveness. </para>

          <para>The Crown Law officers often take up an absolutely illegal stand. Some time ago I was elected by the railway employees of <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> South Wales as their representative on a Superannuation Board. The Government of that State brought forward a regulation which made it an offence to publish any report of the meet ings of that body. I took up the attitude that the Government had no authority to interfere by regulation with any report that I might make to the constituents of that Board and challenged the regulation. As a result, I was haled before the Court and fined &#163;25. Against this decision I appealed to the Supreme Court, on the grounds that the regulation was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> and that it was bad from the stand-point of being unreasonable, and my appeal was unanimously upheld. In that case all the law officers of &#163;he Crown were of opinion that they were legally entitled to interfere with my rights as a representative. But the decision of the Supreme Court showed that they were absolutely wrong (New South Wales State Reports, vol. II., 1911). </para>
          <para>If the contention of the Prime Minister be a sound one, it means that the opinion of the Attorney-General is superior to this Parliament.

          <para>Coming to the struggle which took place between Great Britain and the American colonies, we know that, in Great Britain, it was as popular as any war has been. Those who were opposed to the coercion of the colonies were branded by the press as &#34;disloyalists&#34; and &#34;betrayers of Old England.&#34; The Earl of Chatham - the greatest- of the Pitts - who had saved his country, -who had established the British power in India, and who had secured Canada, everywhere vigorously denounced the war; and refused to be silenced. He publicly justified men in America who, under the law, were guilty of high treason and liable to the death penalty for taking up arms against the Crown. Burke also denounced the war, and ridiculed the idea that he, as one who was charged with a share in the public counsels, should keep silence as to projects which he thought mischievous, lest he should thereby encourage the American resistance. Burke was right, and he succeeded in laying down principles which have kept the British Dominions in loyal attachment to the Empire. It is from the time of Burke that we have gained our policy of local freedom and local legislatures. </para>
          <para>Lord Salisbury supported the Crimean war, which is now admitted to have been a gross blunder, though later he admitted, &#34;We backed the wrong horse,&#34; adding that we had kept the Turk in Europe, and deprived Russia of its <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> as protec tor of Christians in the near East.

          <para>In the reign of James I., in November, 1621, the House of Commons committed the heinous offence of interfering by expressing an opinion as to the relations of Britain with Spain. The King was so annoyed that he refused to consider the petition of Parliament, and, indeed, went so far as to forbid any further discussion of foreign policy. He threatened any speakers that if they did so, or attempted to do so, they would be committed to the Tower. The Parliament immediately carried a resolution from which commences the great privileges and the freedom which Britain and British Parliaments and communities have had handed down to them. This is the resolution in response to the challenge of the King : - </para>

          <para>Reverting to- the tyranny of Charles I. we have the historic Grand Remonstrance of November, 1641. Following upon this came the impeachment of the twelve bishops on a charge of, complicity in the cause of dire discontent in the Kingdom. They absented themselves from the Parliament, insisting that anything done in their absence should be null and of no effect. The Commons were further enraged because these bishops had the audacity to endeavour to exercise negative powers in the Legislature, thus arrogating to themselves the prerogatives of the Crown. This was followed by a fresh impeachment, which landed the bishops in. the Tower, at the instance of the Commons. The King, however, was so angry at the attack on the bishops that he sent the Attorney-General to the House to obtain custody of the leaders of parliament. &#39; The House sent back its reasons for refusal to this request. Charles the next day came down with his forces and raided the Par~liament. And he said to the  Speaker,  &#34; I want to know if Pym, Hollis, Hampden, Haslerig, and Strode are present.&#34; The House of Commons had given them leave of absence, and had sent them into hiding. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Lenthall&#39;s answer to the King rings down the ages. He said to him, &#34; I have neither ears to hear, nor eyes to see, except as directed by this House.&#34; That asserted the authority of Parliament over military force. The King&#39;s reply was, &#34; The birds have flown, but I shall seek them out, and find them, for their treason is foul.&#34; The Prime Minister to-day did not go quite so far as Charles I. went, but he side-tracked the issue just as that monarch and his Attorney-General sought to do in 1641. This outrage on the Parliament, this infringement of its privileges by a military force led by the King, brought about the conflict between the Army&#39; of the Parliament and the Army of the King, and commenced that fight which ended with the overthrow and execution of the King, and the establishment of the Commonwealth under Cromwell, leading eventually to the creation of the British Constitution &#39;as we now know and enjoy it. </para>
          <para>In principle what is now complained of is on a par with the tyranny of Charles. </para>
          <para>In 1653, when . the Long Parliament was about to dissolve, and was making arrangements, which I. have not time to detail now, under which it would decide upon the qualification of new members and .practically control the election of the new , Parliament, Cromwell, on the 20th April, hearing that the Bill to provide for this was likely to be passed rapidly through the House, marched to Parliament with his troops, and burst into the chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Lenthall was in the chair, and Cromwell ordered General Harrison to drag him out. Then he had <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Vane put out, abusing him as he went, and, locking the doors after the expulsion of the members, he carried on the government of England for eighteen months without a Parliament. </para>
          <para>The Hughes Administration, by military interference with Parliament, or with anything within its jurisdiction, committed a crime equal in principle to that of Cromwell. </para>
          <para>In 1799, on the 18th Brumaire, General Napoleon Bonaparte with his troops surrounded the two French Councils - that of the Elders and that of the Five Hundred - then sitting at St. Cloud, near Paris, under the pretence that the soldiers had been brought for their protection. He harangued first one Council and then the other, without success, and it was not until his brother Lucien, who was  President  of the Council of Five Hundred, &#39;had gone out and pleaded with the soldiers to stand by him, pledging himself that should Napoleon play false to the principles of the Revolution, he would strike a dagger into his breast, that they were persuaded to assist in bringing about the <inline font-style="italic">coup d&#39;&#233;tat</inline> which substituted the Consulate for the Directory, and four years later made Napoleon Emperor of the French. Napoleon when in power controlled the Senate, suppressed trial by jury, governed every avenue of publicity, and was thus able to direct and suppress the circulation of opinion, while the Army was won over to him by its fear of the return and  hatred of Royalists. </para>
          <para>In 1851, a nephew of the first Napoleon sought to imitate the example of his great uncle. With the aid of the military he drove the French Deputies from their Chamber, and by a second <inline font-style="italic">coup d&#39;&#233;tat</inline> forced himself into the position of Emperor of the French under the title of Napoleon III. </para>
          <para>We have to go back centuries to find a parallel for the assertion by this Government of the paramountcy of the military power over the Legislative authority. If the military force can be used for any one interference with Parliament seemingly oi small significance, it can likewise be used for greater occasions, even to suppress Parliament altogether. </para>
          <para>There are a few dates in English history which might with profit be remembered by young Australia. 1215. The Barons imposed upon King John, at Runnymede, the signing of the Great Charta. 1621. The assertion, under James I., of the rights and privileges of the House of Commons, the record being torn out of the journals of the House by the King. 1641. Under Charles I., there was the Grand Remonstrance. 1642.

            <para>. - There has been a long debate, much of what has been said being irrelevant, on the question, Does the search and seizure of certain documents by the military within Parliament House, under the circumstances referred to, without the consent of the  Speaker,  and at. a time when the House was not sitting, constitute a breach of our privileges? In considering this question, we must ask, first of all, what is the special privilege of which it is alleged there has been a breach ? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The House collectively, and members individually, possess certain rights and privileges, the object of which is to enable Parliament to perform its functions freely and without interruption. They are intended to provide for the fullest and freest discussion of every subject of public interest without the possibility of control or influence being exercised , on Parliament or members by any outside authority. It is not the object of our privileges to make the member of Parliament free of the ordinary laws which other citizens are bound to obey. Section 49 of the Constitution Act provides that our privileges shall be such as shall be declared by the Parliament, and until they are so declared they are those of the Commons House of Parliament. What is the privilege that it is alleged has been infringed in the case under discussion? There has been a great deal of talk about freedom of debate. &#39; But freedom of debate was not interfered with by the action to which attention has been drawn. No one denies that members enjoy unlimited freedom of debate. They may say in this chamber anything that they please, being governed in the matter only by their conscience. But if a member chooses to publish by itself a speech that he has made in this House, he must run the risks which an ordinary individual has to face in making any publication. </para>

              <para>- Parliament makes laws, but it is the function of the Executive to administer them and to protect the welfare of the nation. Obviously, there would be no privilege for a private citizen in the case which I have suggested. The. action which has been complained of was taken under a power expressly conferred on the military authorities by this Parliament under the War Precautions Act and the regulations. The power of search was expressly given by that Act, which honorable members opposite introduced and supported. The Act contemplates the assistance in the carrying out of its provisions of the Naval and Military Authorities of the Commonwealth. It was an express Act of Parliament passed unanimously in the House with a view to increasing the Executive power and enabling the Executive to call in the military to their aid. Under authority of that Act, War Regulation 50 was issued giving power to the naval and military authorities, wherever there is reasonable ground for believing that it will afford evidence as to the committing of any such offence, or as to whether there is reasonable ground for believing that it is to be used for the purpose of committing an offence, to enter, if need be by force, any land, building and so forth, and search, inspect, and seise articles. Every private citizen of Australia is subject to that law; and why should there be any privilege to enable a member of Parliament to be in a position superior to a citizen in this respect? Why should a member of Parliament not be as liable as any private citizen? Power is given under the Act and regulations in the circumstances specified to enter and search any premises without exception; but honorable members opposite are trying to set up an exemption from the general law for members of Parliament. I am net discussing the merits of the particular case, but dealing with the question of privilege purely in its legal and constitutional aspect. </para>

          <para>A plea is set up for an exemption from the general law, and the exemption from the general law is alleged to be Parliament House itself, that is, the building. In order to maintain that view in a Court of Law, it would be necessary to point out the particular privilege that gives the right; and no wonder an honorable member said this morning that the Librarian was unable to supply him with any authorities in support, seeing that there is no such privilege. Privilegesare given to members of Parliament to enable them to carry on their legislative functions, and is it necessary to that end that members shall be exempt from this law? Will it help a member to carry out his duties if papers containing matter damaging to the Commonwealth are not liable to seizure at Parliament House? In order to prove such a privilege, it must be shown that this House and building, which we call our precincts, are an actual sanctuary from the law - that in this place we are absolutely free from the operations of the law. Should that be so, and by some mischance a man with Ger man sympathies became a member, he might store explosives in the building without fear of the law; he might steal plans or other military documents and conceal them here until he could get them safely out of the country. </para>

          <para>Lord Cochrane escaped, and was arrested by the Marshal whilst he was sitting on the Privy Councillors&#39; bench in theHouse of Commons, on the Tight hand of the Chair, at which time there was no member present, prayers not having been read. The case was referred to the Committee of Privileges, who reported that it was entirely of a novel nature, and that the privileges of Parliament did not appear&#39; to have been violated, so as to call for the interposition of the House, by any proceedings against the Marshal of the King&#39;s Bench. </para>
          <para>Thus the House will not allow even the sanctuary of its walls to protect a member from the process of criminal law. </para>
          <para class="block">Bourinot, in <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Procedure,</inline> 3rd Edition, at page 148, also mentions the case of a member of the Canadian House of Commons who was, during the session of 1885, arrested and fined by an Ottawa police magistrate for an assault committed in the lobby of the House. This shows that neither the lobby nor the Privy Councillors&#39; bench, when Parliament is not actually sitting - I wish to emphasize that point - provides sanctuary. </para>

              <para>- When Parliament itself is sitting, in a collective body, as to-day, we have the fullest power and privileges in regard to ourselves. But the collective privileges which we have while sitting here collectively do not attach to us always in the same respect when individually we are scattered over Australia, though certain privileges are personal. Members of Parliament areamenable to the law in the same way as are other people, but the rights and privileges of Parliament are of the highest character, and Parliament is, very properly, most jealous in preserving those rights and privileges. Honorable members opposite are making accusations against the Government, although it is their duty to aid the Executive in the administration of the law. In discussing this matter, I have <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> referred to any individual, but have dealt with it in a dry, constitutional aspect. </para>

            <para>.- The honorable gentleman who has just resumed his seat has, indeed, given us a splendid example of special pleading, and, from that point of view, has presented a very finecase. But when we consider the essential principles involved, we find that the honorable gentleman has wandered quite away from the question. It is not a matter merely of the rights and privileges of an individual member, or of the members of the House collectively, but of the whole principle of the system of government under which we live to-day. That system is ours now after very many years of fighting and sacrifice of life, in order that the people of British communities might govern themselves as they choose. The people are represented in our Parliaments by elected citizens, and these, on assembling, elect their officials, including the  Speaker,  who is the custodian, not so much of the privileges of members as of the system of government for which Parliament stands. To enable Parliament to carry on its functions, the members thereof have been given what we call privileges, not enjoyed by ordinary citizens outside. The reason for this is that, when a man enters Parliament, he may be at perfect liberty to say and do what he considers right in the interests of the people who sent him there. </para>

              <para>- I was just about to deal with that point. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> attempted to support his case in a most ingenious way that could occur only to a legallyminded man. He told us that we have passed a War Precautions Act, under which regulations have been issued, giving the right of entry, and search, and seizure on any premises in Australia. Does that mean that, by regulation, the functions of our parliamentary system may be abro gated, and our rules thrown into the waste-paper basket? If the argument of the Minister is sound, it means that, by a regulation, under the War Precautions Act, Parliament may be shut up tomorrow. </para>

              <para>- It was not; he distinctly told us that the regulations give the power of search and seizure in any premises or building in Australia. He went on to inquire why honorable members while in this building should ask to be exempt from a law that applies to every other citizen of the Commonwealth. It is well we should know whether his argument is correct or not. If it is, then we may say &#34;good bye&#34; to our system of responsible government as we know it to-day, since it means that the people of Australia no longer enjoy the privileges of responsible government. </para>

              <para>- I believe that the Minister&#39;s argument is not correct. This is a question affecting not only the honorable member particularly concerned, but the Parliament as a whole, and if the House allow the action of the military authorities to go unchallenged merely because the offence was committed against an honorable member of the Opposition, it will create a precedent which honorable members will live to regret. The right we possess to govern ourselves is something that we should always jealously guard; we should see that it is never infringed. Honorable members opposite govern this country to-day because the people gave them the right to govern, and it will be a bad day for Australia - a bad day for the freedom of this country - if we allow the principles of our parliamentary system &#60;to be lightly interfered with. </para>

            <para>.- During the twenty-five years that I have sat in this building, first as a member of the State Parliament, and subsequently as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, I have never known such an occurrence as that which we are now discussing.&#39; Had it happened twenty years ago, both the Liberal and Conservative parties in the State Parliament, which then met in this building, would have united in resenting it. Some time ago, when a number of our brave boys who were about to leave for the Front were parading through Melbourne, I was stopped as I sought to enter this building. I asked by whose authority I was thus intercepted, and when I was told that it was the military authority I promptly replied that I did not recognise it, and pushed my way in. I had with me my member&#39;s badge, and it was my authority for demanding access to this building. I resented that action on the part of the military authorities just as I resent the incident with which we are now dealing. Our parliamentary system is such that the poorest man in the land may enter this chamber, and give utterance here to his inmost thoughts. But for the privileges attaching to Parliament, what chance would a man of limited means have of entering this House and exposing a wrong or an infamy? He would be immediately made insolvent by process of law, and his seat would be declared vacant. If this sort of thing is to go on, we may before long see something th at I never thought possible in Australia. I have always gloried in the idea that Parliament is absolutely pure, and free from bribery and corruption. It is not free from- bribery and corruption to-day. Infamies are being perpetrated which I thought impossible. On every hand prices are going up, and profits&#39; are increasing. I invite honorable members to examine the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> issued weekly to see whether there is a case where big profits are not being accumulated. They will not find one. Very little is being done to check this profiteering. Is it possible to have honesty in politics ? With the Parliament as at present constituted I have many and serious doubts. Parliament is the only created thing on God&#39;s earth that can make itself more powerful than its creator. The people who create this Parliament will never be able to prevent that until they have the right by petition to demand that a member&#39;s seat shall be declared vacant, and a fresh election take place within three weeks. When it is possible to hand to the  Clerk  of Parliaments a petition signed by 30 per cent. of the electors of a division praying that the seat shall be declared vacant, and when effect must be given to such a petition, there will be an end to political somersaulters of the Peacock type. The people themselves will then have control. Every honorable member, when he is seeking election, declares that he glories in being the servant of the people. But that state of mind seems only to last until he can secure a majority, and is safe for another three years. </para>

          <para>I heard but the concluding portion of the speech made by the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> and I can describe it only as an excellent piece of sophism. Many good men have been spoilt by their training as lawyers. It is a training that makes sophists of many of them. They are prepared to argue on one side or the other provided the fees are forthcoming, and certainly the greater part of the Minister&#39;s utterances that I heard was pure simple sophism. The Government are in power to-day owing to a combination of circumstances which no one thought possible, but they are not going to remain in power for all time. They are not unchangeable. A day will come when they will have to give way to others - perhaps to men holding even more advanced views than we profess. And if those men make use of the War Precautions Act, supporters of the present Government, whether they be in Parliament or not, will have reason to regret that by their votes they created such a precedent as they seem likely to create to-day. In one year 331 regulations have been issued under the War Precautions Act. Can any lawyer say that he understands them ? It may be said that they are not laws but regulations. But if under them a man may be fined or imprisoned, then whatever you may call them, they have the force of law, although they were never debated in this House. </para>
          <para>I propose now to make a short quotation from <inline font-style="italic">May.</inline> I object to the servile language employed in it, but it may be excused, having regard to the fights for liberty that have taken place in the Old Land to which it applies. Right down from the time of William the Conqueror to the infernal reigns of the four Georges, there have been fights for liberty and freedom in the Old Country, with the result that we have to-day a limited monarchy. If it were an unlimited monarchy I would not respect it. Honorable members will not find in the political text-books of the Republic of Switzerland, or some of the big Republics of South America, language so servile as that contained in the quotation which I propose now to make from page 63 of the 12th edition of <inline font-style="italic">May -</inline></para>

            <para>Both Houses of Parliament enjoy various privileges in their collective capacity, as constituent parts of the High Court of Parliament, which are necessary for the support of their authority and for the proper exercise of the functions intrusted to them by the Constitution. Other privileges, again, are enjoyed by individual members, which protect their persons and secure their independence and dignity. </para>
            <para>Some privileges rest solely upon the law and custom of Parliament, while others have been defined by Statute. Upon these grounds alone all privileges whatever are founded. The Lords have ever enjoyed them, simply because &#34;they have place and voice in Parliament&#34;; but a practice has obtained with the Commons that would appear to submit their privileges to the royal favour. At the commencement of every Parliament since the6th Henry VIII., it has been the custom for the  Speaker  - &#34;In the name and on behalf of the Commons to lay claim by humble petition to their ancient and undoubted rights and privileges; particularly that their person (their estates and servants) may be free from arrests and all molestations; that they may enjoy liberty of speech in all their debates; may have access to  His  Majesty&#39;s royal person whenever occasion shall require; and that all their proceedings may receive from his Majesty the most favorable construction.&#34; </para>
            <para>To which the Lord Chancellor replies that - &#34;  His  Majesty most readily confirms all the rights and privileges which have ever been granted to or conferred upon the Commons by  His  Majesty or any of his royal predecessors.&#34; </para>

            <para>The claim of privilege in respect of their estates was omitted for the first time on the 5th November, 1852. The claim for servants was retained until the 5th August, 1892, when.&#39; the claim was omitted, their privileges being wholly abolished. - See page 106, 7 <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Debates</inline> 4, s. 18. The officers of the House are still privileged, within its precincts. - 2 Hatsell, 225; Colchester, i., 65. </para>

          <para>I desire to congratulate you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> on the action you have taken to conserve the rights and privileges of honorable members generally. Knowing you, as I have, for many years, you will, perhaps, permit me to say that in this matter you have done your duty just as I should have expected of you. I could say no more of any man. </para>
          <para>Some time ago I wished to circularize the old-age pensioners, and when I proceeded to do so, certain inaccurate statements were made in the newspapers. I obtained leave from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and from the Government Printer to use a stamp, and to pay for the official notepaper and envelopes which it was my right as a member to use. I am not astonished that the Law Department should object to the Australian coat of arms being placed on a reprint of the speech delivered in this House by the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts).</inline> It appears as if the Government are about to create a precedent, and I warn themthat their action will not be forgotten here orby the outside public. That precedent will be followed. </para>
          <para>This is another instance of that infamous system of governing by the War Precautions Act. Many times have I heard honorable members opposite refer to the promise made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> regarding &#34; the last man and the last shilling,&#34; but another promise was given to me, and to every honorable member of the House every time a Bill relating to the war was brought before the House. On each occasion I asked whether the civil power was dominantover the military power. I was assured that it was; but, notwithstanding that assurance, the military power is dominant to-day. Every promise in that respect given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> has been absolutely broken; and I ask honorable members on both sides of the House to come together to resist this infringement of our privilege, and by their votes compel the return of the documents which were wrongly taken from this House. It will then be for the House, acting within its sovereign rights&#39;, to consider the matter at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and if there is anything objectionable in connexion with the reprint of the speeches of the honorable member for Cook, theHouse can decide accordingly. If the House takes that action, the finger of scorn cannot be pointed at us; but if this motion is defeated, the House will be indorsing an unjust action committed by the Government by reason of the powers which the War Precautions Act has placed in their hands. </para>

              <para>- Even that incident proves that the House and its officers are supreme. There are a lot of formalities connected with parliamentary procedure, such as messages from the Crown, and so forth; and many of the &#34;outside public consider those formalities foolish and unnecessary; but when a man has served in this Parliament for some time, he finds that many of the formalities are necessary, because they were instituted for the protection of the people through Parliament. If the military authorities are to be allowed to enter this building, and do as they think fit, we shall soon return to the period when the King could do as he liked, and Parliament then will be useless. Even if the High Court of Australia, or the Supreme Court of any State, desires an officer of this House to give evidence, or produce a document, the permission of the House must be obtained. The highest Court in the land has not power to subpoena any officer of Parliament, or demand the production of any document, without the permission of Parliament itself. Yet the military authorities claim the right to come here, and do as they please. If this precedent is allowed to pass unchallenged, where will the matter end? Honorable members opposite&#39; are playing with a two-edged sword. Feeling safe with their majority, they may make this a party question ; but </para>

              <para>- It is true that the Labour party introduced and piloted through Parliament the War Precautions Act; but when we agreed to that statute we knew that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> was Prime Minister, and we had a great deal of confidence in him. We all recognised that tremendous powers were required to enable the Government to carry on this war; but some of us were afraid that the War Precautions Act might be used to do injustice to some enemy aliens who had&#39; become naturalized, and who are as good citizens as native-born Australians. We never imagined that the Act would be used as an instrument of tyranny, as it has been by the present Government. </para>

          <para>I ask honorable members not to treat this as a party question, although I am very much afraid that it will be so treated, because it does appear that in modern times, since the advent of Labour into politics, all the traditions which used to govern parliamentary procedure, and direct the actions of GovernorsGeneral and Governors have gone by the board. There was a time when, if an ordinary private member succeeded in carrying a resolution against the Government, he was sent for by the Governor, and given a commission to form a Ministry, if he could. I instance the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jack</inline> Want, in the Parliament of New South Wales. But that is not the practice nowadays. Only recently, in the Victorian Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elmslie</inline> succeeded in carrying a resolution against the Government; but was he commissioned to form another Ministry ? No ; a canvass was made, and somebody else was intrusted with that responsibility. And I am afraid that honorable members opposite intend to vote against this motion on party grounds, although they know that the action of the Government was wrong. &#187; </para>
          <para>I warn honorable members no% to allow the, military authorities to believe that they can do as they like. I remind the House that the capital city of Washington was founded in consequence of an act of aggression on the part of the military. </para>
          <para>At the close of the war between Britain and America, in 1783, a number of returned soldiers decided to approach the Legislature of Pennsylvania, and on their way they collected further soldiers from the barracks. They visited the legislative building, posted soldiers at every entrance, and. sent in a written message that if their demands were not conceded in twenty minutes, they would let loose the soldiers on the members. That action led to Congress deciding to establish a Federal capital city, where Parliament might be free from molestation by the military. These facts are related in <inline font-style="italic">Our First Century,</inline> a book published in the United States. </para>

              <para>- It is time that we followed that example, and established a Federal Capital territory, in which the Parliament of the Commonwealth would be beyond the reach of any military authority. I ask honorable members to take note of that incident in American history. The Government are doing very little in connexion with their repatriation scheme, and returned soldiers are seeking employment at bone collecting and rag picking. If we allow the military to think that they can invade this building, and search the rooms of private members, we shall find the returned soldiers marching to this building, demanding to know what has become of the repatriation scheme, and, possibly, as happened in America, stationing soldiers at the entrances, and giving Parliament and the Government twenty minutes in which to fulfil our repatriation promises. </para>

But while, with their tongues in their cheeks, they are concerned about the feelings of Japan, they have not so much regard for the pockets of the Japanese people. There is in this chamber a member of the Wool Committee, and I submit to him, and to the members of this House, that what the honorable member for Cook said in reference to Japan does not weigh as a feather with Japan in comparison with the action of the Government, in the interests of the personal friend of the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W.

              <para>- As a matter of fact, I have among my papers a statement by a representative of Japan, who had to go to South Africa to buy wool. He says that the Japanese were compelled to go to that country to buy wool because they could not get any from Australia. A representative of the Japanese has been endeavouring to purchase greasy and scoured wool in Australia, and was not able to get it until recently, when a certain quantity was released. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member will have an opportunity of bringing forward documentary evidence, and I suppose that I shall have the same opportunity in the future. The talk of the Prime Minister about the statement of the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts)</inline> being likely to cause inharmonious relations between England and her Allies is all so much bluff. The Prime Minister has the habit of exaggerating and bluffing the House. He says that he would notgive anything for the position of Australia in twenty-four hours if certain action sought to be taken by us was to be regarded as the opinion of the House, but I would be very sorry if the Japanese people would regard as representative of the public opinion of Australia the actions of the Prime Minister in regard to the restriction against wool being forwarded to Japan. </para>

            <para>.- As one who at all times renders what assistance he can with the object of maintaining our parliamentary privileges, I feel that this is an occasion when honorable members should come to the support of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> in the action he has taken. It is very humiliating to hear the Leader of the Government(Mr. <inline font-style="italic">Hughes),</inline> instead of supporting the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> trying to do the very opposite, and seeking to justify the action of the military authorities. We have been told by the librarian that it is very hard to find any cases in which the privileges of Parliament have been invaded. The reason is obvious. The privileges of British Parliaments have been so jealously guarded that no occasion has arisen in which they have been invaded. There are very few persons in any country where the British Constitution exists but have pride in their parliamentary institutions. There is so much endeavour to conserve those privileges that no individual in the community has ever made an effort to overstep them. They are so much in the interests of liberty that no person will make any attempt to infringe them. At the time of the Fenian outrages in England, and on the occasion when one of the walls of the Clerkenwell prison was blown in, killing a number of people and frightening thousands, the Duke of Cambridge, as Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, approached the  Speaker  of the House of Commons with the offer of the services of the military forces to protect Parliament House, but the  Speaker,  in the most dignified manner, said, &#34; No. Parliament cannot accept the aid of the military forces to guard the precincts of this place. The police and the civilian authorities are quite strong enough to do so.&#34; </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I feel that the members of this House have not risen to the occasion. They are lacking in dignity. They do not show that respect for their predecessors that they should display. There seems to be too much of the party aspect about the matter. Honorable members opposite seem to concentrate their minds simply on how any matter is likely to affect the party. When the people of Australia have the opportunity of judging the conduct of those who refuse to support the action of the  Speaker  in regard to this seizure by the military forces against his expressed will, they will know what to do with them, and will see that in future they will have no further opportunity of neglecting to uphold the privileges of Parliament. Honorable members seem to be bereft of all sense of their responsibility to maintain the privileges they possess. This matter should have been debated in a manner worthy of a British Parliament, but except for what has been said by a few honorable members <inline font-style="italic">sitting in</inline> Opposition there does not seem to be sufficient stamina or courage in the House to maintain those privileges for which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> and other men would havestood up in the State Houses. </para>
          <para>I am sorry the Prime Minister has not sufficient courage or sense of responsibility in regard to the future liberties of the Parliament to rise to the occasion and commend the  Speaker  for the action he took. I make no reference whatever to the incident that brought this matter about. There may be some justification for condemning the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts),</inline> but for the moment that matter is not before the House. What is before the House is the question, whether we agree with the action of the military in walking into the precincts of this House against the wish of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and seizing documents with which they had no right to interfere, or whether we support <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> in maintaining that they should not interfere with any papers or documents in the possession of this House, or of any member of it. When we passed the War Precautions Act it was never intended that a regulation should be made that would stifle Parliament and the right of its members to give expression to what they believe to be the will1 of. the people of Australia. Every honorable member should rise to the occasion and support <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> so that  similar  action may be prevented on future occasions. I would prefer the appointment of a Committee of five or six members of this House, and that the persons who made that raid on Parliament. House should be brought before the bar of the House, because then Parliament could set out the punishment that- should be inflicted on ,;those persons who infringe its rights and liberties. </para>
          <para>This Parliament is the highest Court in Australia. There is no appeal from its judgment, yet pigmies - I can call them nothing else - would allow all the privileges gained for them by their predecessors in British Parliaments, by men who stood for liberty and progress, and laid down precedents for our guidance in governing our country, to be swept aside. </para>
          <para class="block">When I have an opportunity of consenting to expenditure upon an oil painting of a distinguished Australian statesman I shall lift my hat out of respect to the man who has been ready to uphold, maintain, and hand down to us the privileges that Parliament possesses, but I am satisfied from what I see to-day that some honorable members opposite seem to have so little respect for the men who have done so much for us, and given us so many opportunities to express the will of the people, that they would allow the military forces to enter the precincts of the Parliament House of a democratic coun try where the people are elected by adult suffrage, and take away documents and papers which may be valuable to the institution in conducting its business on behalf of the people. </para>
          <para>I understand that the Government want to close Parliament again. It seems that since the Labour Government was turned out of office Parliament meets only with the one ambition - to open the doors and close them again as soon as possible, and smother the voice of the representatives of the people. I am endeavouring to comply with the wishes of honorable members by speaking as fast as possible, in order to say what I have to say in as short a space of time as possible, so that the vote may be taken this afternoon. I regret from the bottom of my heart that I should have to sit in a Parliament where so little attention is paid to the privileges which are so essential to the liberty of the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>. - I desire briefly to place on record my protest as one of the representatives of the people against the outrage instigated by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> upon the rights of the citizens of Australia in general, and the privileges of the members of this House in particular. I do not pretend to any extensive constitutional knowledge of the question. I am not concerned so much with the traditions regarding constitutional procedure as I am with the fact that one of the Ministers of the day should have used his political power and the position he occupies as head of the Military Forces for the purpose of gaining a political advantage, using it as a partisan to further the interests of his own political side. We have heard the statement made by you, sir, and have heard it criticised by the head of the Government. We have heard it laid down that because statements made in the House are likely, in the opinion of the man who happens to be Prime Minister for the moment, to cause suspicion or prejudice in a country that is allied with Great Britain in the present war, the speech containing them must not be permitted to circulate amongst the citizens who returned the member making it to the House to represent their interests. </para>

          <para class="block">In short, we have been told that the common people outside Parliament are not to be permitted to know what their representatives say here. It is rather amusing to .find so much anxiety displayed on behalf of one of the Powers with which Great Britain is allied. Last night the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archibald)</inline> waxed very eloquent in his description of another Power - the Russian Bolshevik Government. Nothing was too vile or too abusive for the honorable member to say about that Power.  His  remarks will be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> just the same as those of the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts)</inline> ; but I wonder will the same procedure be adopted towards the honorable member as has been adopted towards the honorable member for Cook. The remarks of the honorable member for Hindmarsh concerned a Power of which we read the following in last night&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> as published in the London <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> and therefore I suppose it will be accepted by the honorable gentlemen opposite with great gusto, coming as it does from, the Northcliffe press - </para>

              <para>- I have finished the quotation. The point I wish to make is that reflections have been made in this chamber by a Government supporter in the most scurrilous fashion upon a Power allied with Great Britain at the present moment, and it will be well for the people outside - the masters of the men in this Parliament - to note the different treatment accorded to members on the </para>

          <para class="block">Government side of the House and to members on this side. It will be well for them also to bear in mind the attitude of the Government as defined by the Prime Minister to-day on the question of the invasion of this House by a military force, and contrast it with the attitude of the Government when Miss Adela Pankhurst and her friends approached this Parliament, and the people were starving outside. Their protests about the starving people were met with the statement that &#34;We must preserve the privileges and rights of Parliament against popular demonstrations.&#34; But there is another side to the picture now. When political advantage can be gained, or personal spite can be gratified, by the entrance of the military authorities into this building at the dictation of a member of the present Government, it is done. I hope that this debate will not be lost upon the people outside, but that they will note it for future reference and future action. </para>

            <para>- We offered an amendment last night, but, of course, it was not accepted. The Prime Minister did not in any sense or shape meet the question which I raised, that if this motion is defeated the military will be given a power which they did not possess, so far as this Parliament was concerned, previous to this occasion. The Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> said that we had passed an Act which made every one liable. Of course, every Act makes every one liable, but certain privileges are inherent in Parliament and in every elected representative of the people. We can say here things that we are not permitted to say outside. Legal men on the Government side know that that is so. That is one of the rights given to us in order that justice may he obtained. On one occasion the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> made, from his place in this corner, statements which he was told that he would be liable for if he made them outside. ExSenator Watson, who was defeated at the last election, made a certain statement in the Senate, and was told, &#34;If you say that outside you will be &#39;had.&#39;&#34; Certain members of the Queensland Parliament made statements in Parliament, and afterwards went outside and made them, but they were not &#34;had.&#34; We have rights inside Parliament, and the War Precautions Act was never intended to operate here. The Minister for Works and Railways drew a fancy picture, that we might use Parliament for the purpose of storing things. He said that if any pro-Germans were in this Parliament they could use it practically as an arsenal or a munition dump. The Minister need not be afraid of that, so far as anybody on this side is concerned. We have never appealed for the German vote in this German language, as certain honorable members on the Ministerial side of the House did on the 5th of May last. </para>

              <para>- Nor am I making any. There is only one party that the War Precautions Act is ever put into operation against, and that is the party opposing the Government. No newspaper has been prosecuted for publishing anything unless it was an opponent of the Government. No member has been prosecuted under die Act unless he has been an opponent of the Government, and it is only because the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts)</inline> is a member of this party that this action is being taken to-day. Honorable members are allowing their judgment to be clouded and warped because the member concerned happens to belong to this side of the House; but I hope that, even now, they will vote in accordance with their con sciences. The Prime Minister said that action was first going to be taken because the Australian coat-of-arms was on the reprint. If the printing of the coatofarms on anything makes the Government responsible for the contents, what about the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which come out every morning with the British: coatofarms on them? The very issue of our Australian <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> which contains the speech of the honorable member for Cook was published with the British coatotarms on it. Apparently, the Australian coat-of-arms is repudiated altogether so far as our <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is concerned, but I hope that, now attention has been directed to the matter, we will be Australian at least so far as to have our own coat-of-arms on our own <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> . The Minister for Works and Railways said . also that the War Precautions Act was all-powerful, and that under it the Government could bring forward regulations to operate against members of. Parliament. </para>

              <para>- If it is all-powerful, the Government can abolish Parliament itself, and set up the Prime Minister as a dictator, as he very nearly is to-day. A statement of his that was made upstairs this week runs, &#34;I outlined the shipbuilding proposals; I did this; and I did the other.&#34; The capital &#34;I&#34; runs through the whole of the statement. The Minister said, also, that at the time Parliament was not in session. </para>

              <para>- Of course it was not sitting, nor will it be sitting in another quarter of an hour until next Wednesday. If honorable members, vote, as apparently a lot of them are going to do on this question, they will abandon one of the greatest privileges that we have - the right of publication of our speeches. We suffer more on this side than do honorable members opposite, because they have the press yelling for them every day, as 99 per cent, of the papers that are published &#34;barrack&#34; for them. Honorable members on this side of the House only have an opportunity of reaching the  people through the public platform or by the distribution ofHansard speeches, and unless the House takes a stand now any honorable member may be liable for the same treatment as has been meted out to the honorable member for Cook if he reprints his speeches. I trust honorable members will regard this matter quite apart from the fact that the member concerned is connected with the party on this side of the House, and that they will vote to uphold the privileges of Parliament. </para>

          <para>With reference to the remarks .made by the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cook)</inline> concerning the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, I want to say that I think it is a mercy he is removed from this House. There is not a public servant in Victoria, not a policeman, and not a railway official, who does not hate and loathe the name of the man who robbed them of their rights of citizenship. When a member of the State Legislature, in this very chamber, he introduced two Bills, one the most vile coercion Act that was ever initiated in an English House of Parliament. Any member who cares to read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the 1906 session will see there that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine took what was considered in the House as a bribe of &#163;2,000 from Flinders Lane. He was not man enough to take it himself, so he pushed his wife forward, and in that way took it from the Flinders Lane crowd. When I challenged him in his place to offer his services to the Empire, this man, who has always been howling for other&#39; women&#39;s sons to go to the Front, -declined.  His  biggest supporter in the Mornington district, in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lindley,</inline> said that he would go with me to clean his car if <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine were plucky enough to drive it at the Front for the benefit of soldiers who were suffering from ill-health. On another occasion I intend to give the House the record of one of the vilest men who ever left Ire land. It seems to me that when men are appointed to the judicial bench they must become so fossilized as to be quite unfitted to fulfil the highest position there. One would have thought that a man with eight or ten years&#39; experience of judicial duties would be better qualified to fill the position of Chief Justice of this State than would an individual who is taken fresh from the Bar. We all know that when the late Chief Justice was appointed to the position which he so well adorned, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hodges resented his appointment very deeply, as did also <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Williams. If this matter is brought forward again, I will give the record of the man who has stained the statute-book ot Victoria with two vile Acts, one of which was unanimously repealed by both Houses of the Legislature. God knows how <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine got his title,. Was it for robbing men of their rights of citizenship ? I know that the people of Victoria will have less respect for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, as Chief Justice, than they have had for any other man who has filled that high and honorable position. </para>

            <para>.- I have listened with the greatest regret to what the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> has just said. I have been some years in this chamber, and the one thing upon which we can congratulate ourselves is that, outside of our political differences of opinion, we entertain a generous feeling towards each other. In the &#39; absence of that feeling, many of our deliberations would be poisoned by bitterness which would make the public life of this country very difficult. Of course, every man is entitled to his opinion. But I have been in this chamber for several Parliaments with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine. I have not been able to agree with everything to which he has held most strongly. I do not know - and I, do not care - anything about his past political history in this State, but I do say that, among all the men whom I have met- and I will say it either inside or outside of Parliament - I have never met a more honorable gentleman, a more free, fearless, and impartial critic, than he who has just been elevated to the position of Chief Justice of Victoria. </para>

            <para>.- We have become so accustomed to the use, for party purposes, of military regulations in connexion with the censorship that it seems almost impossible to shock the minds of honorable members by reciting fresh outrages perpetrated by the Government. But for the benefit of those who profess a special regard for the interests of the farming community, the fact should be placed on record that the Government have now taken steps to prevent legitimate criticism, by the farmers themselves, of the management of the Wheat Pool. </para>

          <para>There is no question involved of the publication of news which might be of service to the enemy. As a matter of fact, the Government are using the War Precautions Act, not to prevent the circulation of news which might prove of military value to the enemy, but to prevent the public being apprised of facts which would damn the Ministry from one end of the country to the other. It is because of this that they have adopted these cowardly means to conceal from the people what is taking place. </para>

              <para>- The Minister for the Navy is just as incorrect in his statement as he usually is. Upon any party question it is very difficult for him to be accurate. The question involved is not what was done by a previous Government. When I occupied a seat on the opposite side of this chamber I did not hesitate to criticise the administration of that Government in connexion with the war. That Government was not guilty of what is now complained of. </para>

            <para>. - I was not here when the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts)</inline> read the regulation, but his idea of the management of the Pool is very wide of the mark. The Pool is under the control, first, of the Prime Minister, and of the Minister of Agriculture in each of the States. There is a Board, upon which the farmers are represented, also. The Government have not the control of the Pool to-day. It is a form of joint control, and, as a matter of fact, the Minister for Agriculture in Victoria <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hagelthorn)</inline> seems to have been in the main the man who has known the most about the management of the Pool. I do not propose to go into the operations of the Pool; they are all set out in black and white. There is much that probably requires adjustment, but I maintain that there is no opportunity for fraud or for the great leakages to which the honorable member refers, but about which he actually knows nothing. The figures are on record as to the sales and the stock in hand, and there is issued every week, or fortnight, a statement of the financial position of the Pool. I, personally, take the trouble in my electorate of making extracts from it, and of putting them in such a form as may be understood by the farmers themselves. And I think I can safely say that they are better informed thereby with regard to the Pool than is the honorable member for Cook. The success of the Australian Wool Pool has been, in a great measure, due to the fact that it is under the control and management of men who understand wool, and have grown up with wool, and who know it from A to Z. I have always thought that our Wheat Pool should have had a greater representation of the best experts in wheat production itself. Though there isa wide differentiation between the men who handle wheat and wool, I hope that in the recasting of the control of the Wheat Board more of the growers&#39; representation will be included. It is a good thing that those who place their affairs and their returns in the hands of the Board should be as fully represented upon it as possible. I myself am not perfectly satisfied with the Pool in all respects. In the main, however, it is a sound proposition, and the country, without it, would have been indeed in a bad state. There are now three distinct Pools, all complete. The first has to do with the 1915-16 crop, in respect to which there is, I think, an amount of about 3&#189;d. a bushel to be paid. It is now practically available, and we have a statement that it will be cleaned up in the course of a few weeks. Then there is the second Pool- the 1916-17 Pool- on which there have been advances aggregating, I think, 3s. Then comes the third Pool, dealing with the crop of 1917-18, upon which one advance of 3s. has been made straight out. Honorable members have sought to point out that the farmers are absolutely at a disadvantage, and can get nothing at all. I emphasize, however, that each piece of scrip has a daily price. The scrip is on the Exchange, and one can either sell or get an advance upon it. It would be well, if the money is in hand to liquidate the first Pool, that it should be done forthwith. With regard to the second Pool, I hope the Wheat Board will be able, seeing that it guaranteed for  the  1917-18 crop and the 1918-19 crop 4s. net, to go back to the crop of 1916-17 and say, &#34; We guarantee that that wheat shall be worth 4s.&#34; It would put  the  farmer in a much better financial position. While I know nothing definite with regard to the restrictions placed upon the remarks of the farmers&#39; representative, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Giles,</inline> yet I do know that the affairs of the  Wheat  Pool are available to farmers and to members of this Chamber; and, as I have indicated already, one can periodically secure statements regarding the business of the Pool, and the farmers can be kept well posted. </para>

              <para>- Well, there has been a lot of talk, a lot of promises, but nothing has been done. I want to know why the Government are always making use of the censorship to suppress and manipulate information that ought to go out broadcast all over Australia so soon as it is delivered in any legislative chamber. Why has this been done? It shows that there is something rotten, not in the State of Denmark, but within the Commonwealth. If the censorship is going to be so used, then certain steps will have to be taken which will very soon have the effect of shifting the men who are using it from the Ministerial benches. </para>

            <para>. - It is time to protest against the silly rhodomontade which is supposed to do duty for argument on the other side. I should like the honorable member to be a little more explicit in his statements. He talks about manipulation and suppression, all because, in this instance, the usual procedure has been followed. He knows - if he knows anything at all, and, if not, then he is absolutely ignorant of things that he ought to know - that a statement of such a kind is never made in the Senate until it has been delivered here. </para>
