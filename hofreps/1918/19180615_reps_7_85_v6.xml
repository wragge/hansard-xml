                            <para>- There are none now on furlough. The officer then on furlough was the late Administrator of the Federal Capital Territory,  Colonel Miller,  who has since been retired, he having reached the retiring age. The matter was thoroughly considered by me as the Minister at the head of the Department, and my opinion was embodied in a report that was left in the Department for the consideration of my successor, who, no doubt, will be glad to show it to the honorable member. </para>

I have learned this morning - I must take entire responsibility for the statement - that a private message has been received to the effect that, as the result no doubt of the promise made by the Minister, the embargo has been entirely removed. Can the honorable gentleman give the House any official confirmation of that statement? </para>

                        <para>- In the recent consultation with the representatives of the States and the Federal representatives on the Wheat Board, the matter was fully considered. The States urged that 4s. should be given; but that becomes a question of financial resources, and with some knowledge of the way in which the financial institutions deal with such business I have thought it better to make 3s. the first payment. This will less dislocate and strain the resources of the financial institutions, which we desire to stabilize and preserve, than would the larger demand of 3s. 6d. or 4s. I would rather be safe than sorry in a matter of the kind. </para>

                        <para>- That opens up a question I do not desire to spend much time on, but I think the honorable member is familiar with one phase of the obligations which the Commonwealth has voluntarily incurred - to raise a certain amount of money for five out of the six States. We are now communicating with the British Government regarding the matter. Whether or not we will raise any loans in London, I cannot say at this stage, but the British Government will, of course, be fully apprised of our intentions, and its consent will be asked before we operate. I have not considered the mode of raising the money - whether it will be through the old channel of underwriters and brokers, or through the bank - but I shall give consideration to the matter. </para>

                            <para>- We cannot get money at anything like that rate. The American Government is borrowing money from it6 own people at the lowest rate prevailing in any of the belligerent countries. Before America came into the war, the rate of interest charged to Great Britain and France in the Anglo-French flotation was very high, but since that country became a participant with the Allies money is being lent to Britain at a low rate. </para>

The Queensland Government regretted that, as the beef was all stored and awaiting shipment, the undelivered portion of the order could not be cancelled. The&#39; Commonwealth Crown Solicitor gave the opinion that there were no grounds on which the Commonwealth would be justified in cancelling the contract. After negotiation, thu Queensland Government agreed to take over all the meat in store on Commonwealth account, and waive a claim for interest, on condition that &#163;19,717 10s. 2d. was paid for storage This sum was accordingly paid over. On the question of the production of documentary evidence of payment of this amount for storage by Queensland Government, the Crown Solicitor gave opinion as follows: - </para>

The amount was offered to, and accepted by, the State  as a  lump sum, and,  in  my opinion, the Commonwealth is not now entitled  to  require the State  to  furnish any voucher  or  particulars  in respect  of that sum.&#34; </para>

Since then the Australian Imperial Force Headquarters, London, have cabled in reply to our inquiries that arrangements had been made for regular monthly supplies from America of Havelock, Welcome Nugget, and Lucy Hinton tobaccos for troops in France, and that arrangements were completed for importing cigarettes and tobaccos from America and Canada for issue to our troops in England, duty free, on repayment. </para>

                    <para>.- I am thankful to the Minister for his proposal to restore the provision as it left this Chamber, and carry out the promise he made to the Committee. It will enable assistance to be extended to a discharged man which would not be possible with the retention of the word &#39;&#39; incapacitated.&#34; Some units have been disbanded, and men have been discharged. Officers who have returned have been unable to go back at their old rank, and sometimes they are discharged. In the administration of the Act every reason for a man&#39;s discharge is carefully inquired into by the Department. It is better to rely on the administration in this regard rather than to have a provision in the Act stating that a man can receive assistance only when he has been discharged for certain specific reasons. </para>

                    <para>. - I am afraid the Minister does not quite appreciate the point raised by me. I am not concerned as to the status of the discharged soldier, but I am anxious that the rights of his relatives who were dependent upon him shall not be challenged, even if he was discharged for some reason that might affect his status. Whatever the reasons for his discharge they should not deprive his relatives of their rights under the Act. Some Australians have been very severely dealt with for small offences on the other side, with the result that their dependants here have been deprived of their allotment money, and suffered severely. I think the word &#34; incapacitated &#34; is much better than the word &#34;discharged.&#34; I ask the Minister to give the Committee an assurance that the rights of relatives will not be affected under this amendment no matter what the circumstances attending the discharge of the man may be. </para>

                    <para>. - This is an extension rather than a curtailment of the area of the Act. The provision was confined specifically to the persons mentioned in the Act. It was brought under our notice that it should be extended to the relatives of soldiers who were deceased or who were discharged. I promised that that should be done, and we are now extending the area to the relatives of soldiers, deceased or discharged, where not specifically mentioned. I quite appreciate the point raised by the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> that soldiers might be discharged for certain reasons, and that the disqualification associated with that discharge might extend to their relatives. The point is a very important one, and I promise to bring it under the attention of the Minister for Defence. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not propose to debate at any length the amendment of which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has given notice in regard to the insertion of a clause to prevent the enlistment of youths of nineteen without the consent of their parents. We are concerned, however, in regard to the decision of the Government that boys of nineteen - because many of them are really boys - may enlist without their parents&#39; consent. We hoped that the Government would be influenced to a great extent by the widespread objection throughout Australia to their proposal. The Ministerial party, I presume, discussed this matter in Caucus, and resolved to instruct the Government to abandon their original determination to permit of the enlistment of boys of eighteen years without first obtaining the consent of their parents. </para>

                            <para>- There is nothing derogatory to a party in so instructing its Government. The honorable member must think that we know very little of the practice of the Ministerial party with regard to Caucus meetings. I could, if it would interest honorable members, cite a number of cases in which the Ministerial Caucus has directed the Government, and has pulled them up when they appeared to be about to wreck the party. Whilst the Government may refuse to pay any attention to the opinions of laymen, they certainly ought to be influenced by the advice of men who have served at Gallipoli and also on the Western Front. </para>

A good deal of pressure is brought to bear on young men. I believe that the majority of them have sufficient respect for their parents to endeavour to fall in with their wishes, but the pressure that has been brought to bear, ever since the war began, by ladies who send white feathers to those who have not enlisted, and by the taunts which men under twenty-one years of age have to endure in offices, workshops, and other places, is so great that when the Government give to youths of nineteen the opportunity to enlist without getting their parents&#39; consent, they feel that they cannot any longer endure the reproaches and derision. </para>

                    <para>Another place has made certain amendments which bring the Bill more into conformity with righteous public opinion than it was &#39;originally. The first proposal which the Government made was to break faith with the soldiers who had enlisted for three years or the duration of the war, whichever was the longer period, and they seriously proposed to return the men to Australia and not give them their discharge until the authorities thought fit. That proposal has been withdrawn, and I see no objection to the Bill. Therefore, as soon as the second reading is carried I propose to move the amendment of which the Leader of the Opposition has given notice. </para>

                        <para>. - On previous occasions I have expressed my views in regard to the enlistment of minors, and I do not propose to repeat to-day the arguments I adduced then. My only objection to the amendment which has been forecasted is that it is too modest. . I do not feel at liberty to move a further amendment, but I, object entirely to the enlistment of any young fellows under twenty-one years of age without .the consent of their&#39; parents. Whilst the proposal to make the new regulations apply to the youths of over nineteen years of age, instead of over eighteen years of age, will have my support, it will be somewhat regretful support, because I think that if the principle of parental control is good in regard to youths under nineteen, it applies to minors of any age. Under our laws we refuse persons under twenty-one years of age the right to control their business, . or their cash, or their ordinary affairs. Until they are twenty-one years of age they have no legal standing in the community, and cannot be held legally liable for their actions. Their parents, accept responsibility for them in respect of all the ordinary affairs of life. Yet now, in a matter affecting their life and liberty , and involving, perhaps, the supreme sacrifice - the doing and the risking of what is, after all, the greatest service that a citizen can render to his country -  Ave  say that parental responsibility can be reduced and parental control entirely ignored. Obviously, if in respect of comparatively small and unimportant matters the legal responsibility of parents holds good until their children are twenty-one years of age, that would justify the argument that, in regard also to this matter of such immense importance, parental responsibility should continue till the same age.  But my main objection is based upon that high moral law, which, is stronger and more important than any legal restrictions or statutory powers. The moral law has distinctly placed no limitation upon the duty of children to their parents, or of parents to their children. Four thousand years ago that law was given to the world, and, whether in detail we do or do not recognise the force  of that &#34;law, we ought in a national sense, at any rate, to recognise the binding force <inline font-style="italic">df</inline> those great moral principles known as the Ten Commandments. There is one commandment dealing specifically with the duty of children to their parents, and, therefore, emphasizing the importance of parental responsibility - &#34;Honour thy father and thy mother.&#34; There is no limitation of age in regard to that duty of children, and impliedly ,there is no limitation on the responsibility of parents, but the present Government have substituted a new commandment - &#34; Honour Willie Watt and George Pearce, the self-appointed disposers of thy life and liberty, that thy father and thy mother may know that they have no authority over thee.&#34; The abrogation of the moral law is to me the most serious aspect of this matter. In a previous speech I pointed out the physical and legal effects of the enlistment of minors, and also its possible effect on the homes of the people. I am content this morning to emphasize the moral aspect, because I believe that as moral force is the greatest, and, at the same time, most beneficent, influence in the community, we cannot, without grave peril and loss, be indifferent to the moral law. </para>

                    <para>I was a member of a deputation that waited about three weeks ago upon the Treasurer to protest against the inclusion of gambling amongst the means adopted for the raising of war loans. The chief argument adduced by the gentleman of that deputation, and one with which I entirely agree, was that the regulation approved the introduction of an immoral principle in the conduct of national affairs. I believe that gambling is based upon an essentially immoral principle, inasmuch as it seeks to take from a man something for which no equivalent is given, and which is not earned. </para>
                    <para>No other nation in the world seems to surround the home with such a halo of responsibility as does the British nation. No doubt, in China the virtue of filial devotion is developed to a quite remarkable degree. It is inspiring to note the reverence for their ancestors, amounting to veneration and even worship, which the Chinese have developed for many centuries with,I think, considerable advantage to themselves. But even in China, and amongst other nations where filial devotion is highly developed, homes are not established on the same basis, nor is the influence of the home so beneficent or its responsibilities so recognised as amongst British communities. </para>
                    <para>There is no word in the language of many nations corresponding to our English word &#34; home,&#34; and certainly the influence and responsibilities of the home are not recognised in other communities as they are in British communities. There is a special, subtle, and peculiarly beneficent influence which can only be developed in the home. There is no substitute for it, and its effects can only be feebly imitated where the influence of the home is interfered with. It is quite true that some homes, even amongst ourselves, are not all that according to our ideas they ought to be, but I question whether it is not true that, even in those homes where there seems to be less effort to surround the children with an atmosphere of love, kindness, and goodness, a devotion and service to each other may not be found, which are absent from homes where another atmosphere is prevalent. We may find in homes where there is very little comfort, in which poverty is the daily experience, and all sorts of difficulties are. met with, an attachment of the people in the home to each other that in the circumstances is very remarkable. There is by some means a family devotion engendered and a paternal consideration generated that are largely, if not altogether, absent, from the homes of the well-to-do. where the inmates are less dependent upon each other. </para>

                            <para>- When the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond)</inline> asks questions and then answers them himself, it is not worth while to pay any attention to him. I was hoping to meet his arguments, but he is so absolutely cocksure about his own position that he is not prepared to listen to any one else. I shall therefore take no notice of his interjections. The moral law would have its continuous application were it not for the legal provision which removes parental responsibility when the son reaches twenty-one years of age, and imposes upon him from that time forward the direction of his own affairs. But that does not abrogate parental responsibility, nor does it affect the son&#39;s recognition of his duty to his parents. The moral law covers the whole field of a man&#39;s responsibility to his country and to himself. </para>

                    <para>In the matter of enlistment for military service I refuse to recognise the right of the individual under twenty-one to determine the matter without the parent&#39;s consent, just as in many less important matters we require the consent of parents.. This is more important than anything else in life. It is a matter of the highest service that a man can render to his country, involving the supreme sacrifice, the risk of everything that life holds dear, a man&#39;s liberty and conscience, and I say that in such a matter parental responsibility should be conserved until the age of twenty-one is reached. I shall vote for the proposed instruction with regret that the age is not twenty-one instead of nineteen, as suggested. </para>

                        <para>.- I could understand, and perhaps sympathize, with the attitude of such as&#34; the honorable member for Brisbane if, while he recognised the claim of the parent upon the loyalty of his son up to the age of twenty-one he proceeded further and recognised the claim of- the country upon the loyalty of the man after he has reached that age. The honorable member talks about moral laws with an amount of unctuous rectitude that is not usual in this House, and certainly not usual in the mouths of the people to whom he belongs. If there is one thing more than another that the people of Scotland have maintained, it is that duty to country and to kindred, to wife and mother and daughter, which demands of every able-bodied man, as his first and fundamental duty, that he shall stand between them and the enemy wherever he may appear, and in whatever circumstances he may be ^ found. The Ten Commandments nave given us a code of morality that all civilized communities have endeavoured to embody in law - law that puts compulsion upon every individual concerned. But, in addition, civilization has recognised the one important duty of compulsion in regard to the defence of one&#39;s country and kindred. There can be no question as to the moral justification of compelling every man who is fit to do his duty in such circumstances as we are placed in at the present time. It is most astonishing to me, and one of my bitterest regrets in regard to the cause of Democracy, that this country of ours, which pretends to stand in the very forefront of the world, in Democratic principles, should have put aside the one fundamental and essential principle of Democracy in relation to its self-defence. A blow has been struck by Australia against the cause of Democracy that will react upon it, perhaps, for many centuries to come. If we do not realize it now, the time is not far distant when we, or those who come after us, will feel the terrible effects of the mistake we are making in our attitude towards the war. It is not merely what we think ourselves. It is what the people of the world think of us. Can any one say that a country such as ours, which has enjoyed the protection of the Motherland during the whole of its existence, can continue to hold the respect of the civilized races when, with the welfare and existence of not only the Motherland, but of our own land, in danger, we refuse to take the one step by which we can reinforce our men at the Front, and do our share in the dreadful struggle now proceeding?

                        <para>Some Irish politicians are said to be nursing the mad notion that the people of the United States of&#34; America sympathize with Irish slackers. There was talk of sending an emissary here to solicit America&#39;s opposition to conscription. It would be impossible for America to receive it. The Chief Burgomaster of Berlin would be as welcome. </para>
                        <para>That may be taken as fairly typical of the attitude of the United States of America towards the refusal of Ireland to accept conscription. What must America think of Australia on that question? If there is condemnation in the United States for the people of Ireland in this regard, is it not a hundred times stronger towards Australia, seeing that the people of Ireland have, perhaps, some justification for their attitude, while the people of Australia can plead none whatever? If we are wise, if we will only look at indications such as these, we will realize, I hope before it  i3  too late, the absolute necessity to Australia&#39;s future welfare of doing the one thing needful to rehabilitate ourselves in the eyes of the civilized world.

No. The truth of the matter was that he was cold-shouldered by the people of the United States of America, who would have nothing to do with him coming from a country that had refused its duty in the circumstances that had compelled the United States to adopt conscription. Again I plead with this Parliament, on the last day of these sittings, to realize the tremendous responsibility upon us, and to take the one step&#39; of duty that is imperative if we have any regard for our honour and our future welfare. </para>

I simply remark that the honorable member has taken up the mantle that fell from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine&#39;s shoulders when he left the House. I have a certain amount of sympathy with the honorable member, although totally opposed to his views, because he is to some extent occupying an isolated position in the&#39; House, in reiterating his opinions on conscription. The honorable member has not adduced very much evidence when he asks honorable members to base their views of American public opinion upon a solitary quotation from the <inline font-style="italic">New York Times</inline> with respect to the proposed visit of the Lord Mayor of Dublin to President Wilson. Anybody who knows anything about the newspaper world can appreciate just how representative of public opinion is the press of any country.

                    <para class="block">Australia, upon each occasion on which she has been given the opportunity to express herself with regard.. to conscription, has made a certain declaration ; and on the second occasion she did so &#39; more emphatically than at first, despite the fact that the question was put in a more crafty and cunning manner. Even admitting that the American press criticism was in opposition to our own sense of self-respect, it must not be forgotten that we have been granted the right to govern ourselves according to our own ideals. We have chosen, for good or ill, to do without conscription ; and I disagree with the conception of Democracy, as expressed by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> when he tells us that Democracy has achieved the highest pinnacle of greatness when it has imposed on itself the Continental form of militarism. Militarism and Imperialism are incompatible with Democracy. The growth of Democracy means the downfall of Imperialism. Militarism and Imperialism go hand in hand, while Democracy and freedom advance together. It was because of their distorted ideas of Democracy that&#39; the people were deluded into militarising themselves to such an extent that militarism eventually brought about this conflict. </para>

                            <para>- Self-defence is not a duty. It is instinctive. It is an inheritance from nature that we should protect ourselves. The honorable member and I do not disagree in the matter of defending ourselves. We disagree as to who are the enemies against whom we shall defend ourselves. To use the phraseology of some honorable members opposite, the &#34;enemy within our gates &#34; in every country in the world is the most inimical to the interests of that people. Those individuals who exploit a people&#39;s patriotism the better to explore their pockets are our worst enemies. </para>

                            <para>- The proposal of the Government, in reply to protests from both sides of the House as to the enlistment of minors without parental consent, has been in no way improved upon. I cannot see. that there is any material difference, either physically or mentally, and particularly so far as qualifications to fight are concerned, between a lad of eighteen and another of nineteen. Moreover, if the Government were logical, they would say that if an individual of eighteen or nineteen is eligible and fitted to take his part in warfare, he should be equally capable of undertaking the responsibilities of citizenship, and should be entitled, therefore, to full citizenship rights. The Government should remove the legal dis-&#39; ability with respect to minors. Instead, however, they have simply made a compromise which certainly does not satisfy parents or guardians. </para>

                            <para>- J &#39; have a letter from a very religious-minded gentleman in Sydney with whom I have had personal  friendship for the past sixteen years. In his epistle he refers to those remarks of mine upon the form of prayer delivered in this House. But his mind is not so warped by prejudice against me as is that of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise),</inline> apparently. I propose to read a letter which I have received in order that honorable members may understand the views of certain religious people in the community who have no sympathy whatever either with my political ot religious convictions. </para>

                    <para>Dear Mick, </para>
                    <para>I am writing you asking you to do me a favour, and pray that any effort put forward by you may have God&#39;s blessing. I just read in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> four lines of your speech on the order for prayer for victory. I should like to read all you said. If you could send a copy of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> I might get a better view of your speech. Well, my reason for asking you to help me is this: &#34;This new order of the Government releasing boys nineteen and over from parental jurisdiction has brought a dark cloud into my home. On Monday last my boy Cecil, who turned nineteen last month, has been led away by the excitement and enlisted. He is now in camp. I am afraid that if lie is not released Ids first victim in the war will be his own mother. She has had three restless nights - up at daylight each morning, swallowing her grief. This new regulation appears to me to be an allurement to the sons of conscientious objectors. You know our belief, Mick; therefore you- can know the amount of grief it must bring to us. Had he been a man, he could have chosen for himself. But, even though he is nineteen, he really is only equal to .fourteen, for you know how I have trained my boys and kept them away from nil worldly allurements and evil contamination. Knowing that, even if conscription had been carried, boys the age of my son would have been the last to call up, I felt confident that he could not go to the war, and would not be needed. He is apprenticed to the same trade as myself - the linotype - and pounds have been spent on him for the&#39; piano.  His  teacher <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorman),</inline> one of the best in Sydney, was shocked when informed. He said it was a shame that such a youthful boy, with such a brilliant musical career before him, should be taken to the war.. For his agc lie is exceptionally fine. But this is not my reason for his redemption from war. &#34;Sou know me too well for that. I am not the only Christadelphian whose house is filled with mourning. Others beside me have broken-hearted mothers. Our Brother Rogers&#39; wife is in great straits because of her son enlisting.&#34; </para>
                    <para>I have been on two deputations to Melbourne as representative of the Christadelphians of Australia - once to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who was Minister for Defence; and, about a year ago, to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> when he was Assistant Minister. &#60; </para>
                    <para>I want you to show this letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> who was secretary of our union for many years, and also to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> who will remember mc He will remember the conversation I had with , him at Bondi Junction on the night he addressed the people against conscription. You are at liberty to get <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor, Mr. Gardiner, Mr. Higgs,</inline> or yourself to make public use of this in the House. However,, ask those gentlemen named first before you do anything as to the best course to adopt, because &#34; In the multitude of counsellors there is wisdom.&#34; If your party can help Christadelphians in this matter you will earn our gratitude. I saw a new notification in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> that, before boys over nineteen could enter camp for training, the recruiting officer must inform the parents and ask if there is any objection. I cut this out of the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> and took it with me to the Recruiting Office, corner of Liverpool and Elizabeth streets, to ascertain what course I should pursue, and at the same time to lodge my objections, in harmony with the new decree; An officer seated at the table listened while I told him it was for conscientious religious reasons I objected to his enlistment.. At the same- time I said to him that no one could deny the <inline font-style="italic">justice</inline> of the nation in its defence against the armed camp of Germany. But I said, as a follower of Christ I was compelled to suffer <inline font-style="italic">injustice.</inline> Just then the captain came in, and the officer at the table told him my mission. I did not go there&#39; to discuss the pros, and cons, of my religious conviction. They started it themselves, and when I said that I was compelled, under the command of Christ, to allow the Germans to overrun the country without using physical force to resist, the captain became impertinent and insolent. Others seated on the stool waiting listened to the insult. &#34;Stand aside,&#34; said the captain. &#34;Attend to the others,&#34; he instructed his subordinate officer. I said, &#34; Will you take a note of my application ? &#34; &#34; Take no more notice of him,&#34; said the captain, as though I were something fit for the rubbish tip. My first answer to the captain when he began to talk was, &#34;Honour thy father and mother, which is the first Commandment with promise&#34; -(Ephesians I., 1, 2, 3).&#39;  His  reply was, ves, the authorities have broken that Commandment for the safety of the nation.&#34; How do they make void the word of God by their own tradition. They will break  His  Commandment and then pray to Him for victory. They will sit in the National Church and repeat this Commandment, and&#39; say, &#34;God have mercy upon us and incline our hearts to keep this law.&#34; How can a boy who dishonours his parents (more especially on religious grounds) expect a blessing from God? How can a nation prosper which encourages it? &#34;Vengeance is mine,&#34; said the Lord. &#34;I will repay.&#34; &#34; Righteousness exalteth a -nation, but wickedness will turn a fruitful field into barrenness.&#34; Who can condemn a man for loving his enemies, Who can condemn a man for praying for his enemies? Lot them pray to God to direct the German nation to see its error and determine to cease war. Pray to God to make them better men. Not pray to God to destroy them and send them to hell. How different to the words of Jesus-&#34; I came not to destroy men&#39;s lives, but to save them.&#34; By all means pray to God for peace in the name of the Prince of Peace. But you know our belief concerning the destiny of the British Empire. And no one can accuse us of having no sympathy with it. You know <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Thomas</inline> in <inline font-style="italic">Elpis Israel,</inline> written in 1848, - says &#34;The German and Austrian Empire is doomed to extinction by fire and sword, and that Russia, Germany, and Austria will become one.&#34; It looks like it, and &#34; That Britain would dominate Mesopotamia, Syria, and Palestine, with the Jews as colonists.&#34; A wonderful forecast. Well, Mick, do what you can for us, and God will bless you for it. </para>
                    <para>I am, your faithfully, </para>
                    <para>F; Wotton. </para>
                    <para>P.S. - I offer no objection to this letter being read in the House if you think it would do any good. I might state that the King has exempted our people in England. They work on the farms. And if the worst should come </para>
                    <para>I would then appeal to the King under the Empire&#39;s regulations for his exemption when he came under Imperial jurisdiction. Could you drop me a note by return of post to let me know if you received this, or a wire - &#34; Received letter&#34;? I am extremely anxious. I have preferred to write to you as a one-time close companion than to any others, because you know all the tenets of our religion, and are better . able to understand our sorrow, knowing the ultimate eternal destiny of our son if Tie falls in the battle, having, as yet, been unbaptised. Why did they make the defence law such as to make the law of calling up boys at such an age as the last resource? Because they felt it was wrong in principle to send them. They, therefore, stand self-convicted of adopting a pernicious principle. What does this new regulation mean? A parent cannot chastise his son without the threat, &#34;I. will enlist.&#34; This is not so in my case. There has been no trouble with me or my son. We were given a sudden surprise. Because only a few days before he enlisted he was talking about his future as a musician. It was a sudden event. Some months ago he was tempted to got away and tried, but I stopped him, and he then promised that he would go on, finish his apprenticeship, finish his musical education, and then go abroad for further learning. But excitement of the receptions and cheering of the crowds to returned soldiers and soldiers departing has allured him into the net. My boy went straight into camp, and sent word home that he had enlisted. Self-condemned, he was ashamed to face his father and mother. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member knows nothing about his father, and so he is not competent to judge. The father is a conscientious individual with firm religious convictions. . He is an old friend of mine, a man I have known intimately for over sixteen years, and I should like to help him out of the trouble in which he has found himself because of his religious convictions. He belongs to a particular sect which believes that it is the destiny of the British Empire to work in harmony with Providence for the regeneration of the world. &#34; They look upon the Central Powers as being the adversaries of the Lord. These people are, if anything, essentially loyal; but their religious convictions prevent them taking up arms or taking part in politics. I say, therefore, that this man and the lad&#39;s mother ar.e suffering keen anguish because they believe that as the boy has not been baptised, and as they regard baptism as essential to salvation, the son is risking his immortal life. Their anguish is probably keener than any anxiety that might be felt by parents belonging to other denominations, and who may object for various reasons to the enlistment of their sons. While I do not subscribe to the tenets of this belief, I respect the people who comprise the sect. </para>

                            <para>- The religious belief of the Christadelphians is that without baptism there can be no salvation and no resurrection. As I have already pointed out, in England the King has exempted them from combatant service because of their religious convictions. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, as the honorable member for Darwin has reminded me, the same provision is contained in our Defence Act. The same remarks may apply to the Quakers, who, although they are a different denomination, are  united with the Christadelphians on this question of military service. If concessions can be made to their religious beliefs - I am not speaking for myself in this respect, as I belong to a totally different section of the community, who do not believe in physical opposition without giving* something in return - I think the Government would be well advised to exempt them from combatant  service </para>

I appeal to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> to at least consider the views of these people. I am not speaking personally, because I would not claim exemption for myself or any one belonging to me on those grounds. But these people have rights as have any other citizens in the community, and their feelings should  be  respected. The Government should not endeavour to ride roughshod over religious convictions. As  it  is laid down in the Defence Act that such people may be exempted from combatant service, their case could easily be met. I do not propose to deal with the aspect of tHe matter referred to by the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> with regard to parental control. </para>

                            <para>- Neither have they dimmed my ardour. On the contrary, they added to it. I appeal to honorable members to respect the feelings of the parents of lads who may be induced by the Government proposal to break away from parental control and so do an injury to the religious convictions of their families. The advantage to the Commonwealth will be infinitesimal as compared with the injury done to the families concerned. The Government have made a compromise already. They would be well advised to go all the way and say they will not enlist any persons under the age of twenty-one without consent of their parents. If a lad runs away from home and enlists, ten days are allowed within which parents and guardians may notify the &#39;State Commandant of their objections to their &#39;boy serving, and may have the case investigated; but a lad who wants <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> run away from home will take care to hide his whereabouts, so that he cannot be found. The regulation is a direct incentive to adventurous youths to run away from home. It is causing great grief to mothers and other female relatives, and brings about the disregard of parental control. The Government will be well advised to drop their present policy in this matter. The gain that it may bring to them is infinitesimal compared with the injury that is being done. </para>

                        <para>. -  I do not see eye to eye with Ministers in this matter, though I shall not labour the question now,- because I expressed my views regarding it clearly the other night. No doubt, the motives of the Government were good, and  their enthusiasm caused Ministers to take what they thought a right step in a time of crisis like the present. I fear, however, that they have made a mistake. I was much impressed by the statements of the honorable member for Flinders (Captain Bruce), who is fresh back from the Front, where he fought and bled for his country. He solemnly and emphatically, though in few words, warned us against sending youths to the Front, because he said they were not really reinforcing our strength there. My opinion regarding the need for reinforcements is very different from that which has been expressed by some honorable members to-day. While I do not agree with the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler),</inline> I certainly do not agree with certain views which have been expressed from the Opposition side of the Chamber. My remarks may seem inconsistent, because both of my sons went to the war before reaching the age of nineteen. I am glad that they have made good, and have done good work. Naturally I am as anxious concerning them as persons mentioned by the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> who hold non-combatant, religious beliefs differing from mine are about their sons. But, nevertheless, I thank God that they are there, and that they are doing their bit, and I hope that they will stay there, and see it out to victory. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> is another whose boy went away as a mere lad, and is doing his bit. At the same time, I think that the enthusiasm of Ministers led them into making a mistake which they have tried to cover by altering the age limit from twenty-one to eighteen and to nineteen. It is a pity that they do not alter it again to twenty-one. I refused to vote for the amendment the other night, because it would have been taken as a vote of censure on the Ministry. But as on the present occasion we have an opportunity to express our opinion unclouded by other issues, I say that I cannot support the Government&#39;s action in this matter. </para>

Under the Standing Orders a motion can be moved by one honorable member on behalf of another only when it is a motion for leave of absence, or for an unopposed return, and then only by leave of the House. The practice of the House of Commons, too, is that one honorable member may not move a motion for another honorable member except he be a member of the Government, moving on behalf of another member of the Government. <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> says, at page 250 of the 10th edition of his <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice -</inline></para>

But if the Bill will permit of my moving such a new clause, there is no occasion for an instruction to the Committee. Why should Ave be required to instruct the Committee to do anything like this ? An instruction is not necessary if the Committee can introduce legislation without an instruction. I submit for your consideration, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> the fact that this is a Bill for an Act to amend the Defence Acts of 1903-17. </para>

The Committee can deal only with matters that are referred to it, and those matters come before it in a special form. The honorable member proposes to put something in the Bill which is altogether .outside the scope of the Bill, and, therefore, not in order, apart altogether from any instruction that the House may give. It is outside the scope of the Bill, because the Bill does not contain any provision or reference to the matter contained in the proposed new clause. </para>

                            <para>- One of the provisions of. the Bill is that in time of war persons, who are not graduates at the Military College, maybe appointed an officer of any Expeditionary Force raised for service outside the Commonwealth. If the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> desires to place a limitation on that provision so that youths of nineteen years of age shall not be entitled to be appointed officers of Expeditionary Forces raised for service abroad, I venture to think he is making a mistake. I am glad to know, however, that there is no intention on his part that the suggested amendment should have that effect. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable members will recollect that the Royal Commission which inquired into Naval and Defence administration called attention to the difficulties connected with  the supervision of the clerical staff of the Departments owing to the existence of varying sets of regulations. In their third report, which deals solely with this subject, they point out the nature of the difficulties that have arisen, and draw  attention to the fact that in the twelfth annual report on. the Commonwealth Public Service, the Acting Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner also referred to the disadvantages of the system of dual control. Dealing with the necessity for the abolition of divided control, the report of the Royal Commission says - </para>

                    <para class="block">The Commission recommended that legislation should be passed on the lines of a draft Bill which accompanied their re- . port, but when the matter was considered it was found that many other points had to be provided for, necessitating the drafting of a much longer measure than that which the Commission recommended. The Commission also drew attention to the fact that there are three classes of employees in the Defence Department. As a matter of fact, there are often more. When the Department was formed, some of the employees were public servants under the Public Service Acts of the various States, who had been taken over with all the rights given to them by the different State Acts. In some&#39; States certain employees of the Department were not public servants, but had been appointed under State Defence Acts, although previously they had frequently held clerical positions in the State Defence Departments. Then there was another class, semi-military, which had been appointed under the various State Defence Acts. As the result of the transfer of State officers and other .appointments to the Defence Department, there are on the civil side of&#39; the Department no less than three different classes of employees. This Bill is introduced to overcome that difficulty. It is not an amendment of the Defence Act; it is a separate measure dealing with a special subject, and it will come into force by proclamation, and continue in force for the period of the war and twelve months afterwards. Its object is to abolish divided control, and to bring under one set of regulations all persons employed in a civil capacity in the Defence Department. When the Act expires twelve months after the war no officer&#39;s rights will be affected. Length of service under this measure will stand to the credit of the officer just as if he had all through been employed under the control of the Public Service Commissioner, and each officer whose services are no longer required by the Defence Department will go back to his former position. </para>

                        <para>.- It has always seemed to me an anomaly that the employees in the Public Service should be under separate control. The Public Service Act was passed in order to make it impossible for members of Parliament or Ministers to place their supporters in positions in the Commonwealth Service, the desire being to remove political influence as far as possible from the making of appointments to the Service. Certain examinations are provided for, which, I suppose, are a very good test of ability. We all agree, probably, that it is a good thing that it is not possible for a member of parliament to get his friends or supporters into the Public Service. Some of us are rather pleased to be relieved of the many applications which came to us before the Public Service Act was passed. </para>

                            <para>- I was coming to that point. The whole position in regard to Commonwealth employees in the Public Service or in the Defence Department is unsatisfactory, and some Government should evolve a better method of testing the efficiency of applicants. I do not know that we can substitute anything that will absolutely do away with the educational tests. At present we demand that an applicant for employment shall pass some literary examination, be able to write in a legible hand, and work certain sums in arithmetic, and know the history of the British Empire from the eighteenth century to the present time, more especially with regard to Australia. I do not think it can be held that it is tha best test that could be devised. It might be supplemented in some way. We have all had experience of people possessing most remarkable memories; persons who can memorise dates and facts ; but at the same time they may have absolutely no initiative. That is why it seems to me that something is required to supplement the educational test. We might have something like the test which is applied in regard to students who wish to enter the Naval College. In addition to an educational test there, they are also compelled to go before a committee, which has a conversation with them. </para>

                        <para>. - In my opinion, the wearing of military uniforms by men holding clerical positions in the Defence Department should cease. It is a farce. We have heard the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> speaking in reference to the hundreds of civilians being employed at Horseferry-road who are posing as soldiers when they are not; but if we go to the Victoria Barracks we can see there also a large staff of clerks wearing military uniforms. If it were not for the seriousness of the military situation, it would be a matter for ridicule. There are men employed at the barracks who cannot even do the goose-step, and know nothing whatever about military matters, yet they are lieutenants, captains, majors, and colonels. The Government ought to consider that question. </para>

                    <para class="block">Perhaps the matter appeals to me more than it may appeal to others, but I was reared in the Army, and I know that when I was in the Old Country civilian clerks there did not wear uniforms. I am pleased to see the reforms that the Bill proposes to bring about, but I wish to enlarge upon the matter referred to by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs).</inline> No one can claim that the present system of Public Service examinations is perfect. In my opinion, it is very imperfect. I did not get much chance of securing an education, seeing that I commenced work when I was eleven years and four months old, but I have no nerves, and before I left school I beat boys in examinations who were miles ahead of me in knowledge. I have seen the same thing right throughout life.I knew one man who had passed his third year in medicine, but was unable to pass his fourth. Yet he was able to coach others through their degrees. Young men who studied under him recognised the great talents that he possessed, and they could not understand how it was that he should fail to get his degree ; but the trouble was absolutely nervousness on his part. Then there is the matter of luck. By a peculiar set of circumstances a man may during the course of an examination be called upon to supply answers to the very matters upon which he has concentrated his studies. I think that an examiner should be allowed to pick up a candidate&#39;s papers, and, irrespective of the errors in them, judge whether they display ability or not. The honorable member for Capricornia has said that there are people who can memorise anything, but they only memorise for the time being. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that they are permitted to do so. I brought forward this question when I first entered this House twelve years ago. Another point worthy of consideration is as to the unwisdom of allotting marks for handwriting in connexion with an examination. A candidate&#39;s handwriting should either be passed or failed. Handwriting is largely a matter of personal judgment of the examiner. On one occasion an Adelaide University Professor who was acting as examiner clearly adopted a certain style as being the best, although another examiner might have adopted a totally different style as worthy of the maximum number of marks. During the last thirty years I have known many young men and women to fail at an examination owing to sheer nervousness. I hope the Government will take these two points into consideration - that they will do away with the wearing of military uniforms by military clerks and improve the examination system so that it will result in the selection of the best qualified candidates. </para>

                    <para>When the Governor-General&#39;s message was under consideration in Committee I explained the object of this Bill. I wish to supplement my previous statement by  informing the House that the evaporation of apples is being carried on, not only in Tasmania, but in other States. There are three evaporating establishments in Tasmania, three in South Australia, and five in Victoria. The bounty is to be given, not to the evaporators, but to the growers who supply the fruit to them, and the Bill provides for a total payment of &#163;12,000 in respect of the whole Commonwealth. That amount represents practically a bonus of 10 per cent, on 300 tons of evaporated apples, at 7d. per lb., which the Imperial Government have purchased from the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>.- Our experience of some of the bounties granted by the Commonwealth has not been a very happy one. The bounty on wool tops, for instance, has not had the effect we believed it would have. The employees in that industry seem to have derived no benefit from it. They are expected to work long hours, to work at night .time, and, in some cases, seven days a week. I do not think, however, that our unhappy experience in connexion with the bounty on wool tops is a good reason why we should oppose the proposal to pay a bounty in this case.  </para>

                            <para>- I shall not oppose the payment of this bounty as such, but I take exception to the method by which it is proposed to be administered. All who have regard for the man on the land must sympathize with the orchardist. I have frequently known of cases where the whole results of a fruit-grower&#39;s labour have* been swept away in a single night. A terrific storm may destroy all his crop; his prospects may be ruined by too heavy a rainfall, or he may suffer because of an inadequate rainfall. Those of us who desire to do justice throughout the Commonwealth must sympathize with the fruit-grower, and endeavour to make his lot as pleasant as it is possible for legislation to make it. That being so, I do not oppose this bounty as a bounty. When this question was previously under consideration, however, I asked the Minister whether the fruit-growers themselves would receive the bounty. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member could not have been present when I said that our experience in that regard had been most unhappy. It is true that our Government agreed to the payment of a bounty on wool tops, but we were induced to do so upon the representations of certain people. We were led to believe, that the payment of the bounty would give employment to a large number of skilled operatives; .but, after the bounty had become law, we found that all the employees required in the industry were, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes set out in his prospectus, a few girls to work machinery that was so nearly automatic that it would almost work itself. </para>

                            <para>- Time will not permit of my going into that matter this afternoon. Granted that we did pay the bounty for years, the honorable member will also admit that  Ave  stopped it in 1915, when the Inter-State Commission recommended that it should not be continued. Our experience in that regard should make us careful. If ever the man on the land and the general public are to remove the extraordinary discrepancies now prevailing in society, they will have to adopt, as the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> has said, some form of co-operation. The co-operation which has proved very successful in the dairying industry and made it permanent materializes in a number of butter factories in which the dairy farmers themselves are interested. In those places in Queensland in which the sugar grower is also the shareholder in the sugar mill, the results of his labours are far higher than where the grower has to sell the product of his labour to a private company-owned mill. I understand that the capital for one of the principal evaporators is to be supplied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Jones, a very clever and far-seeing business man. </para>

                            <para>- It may be. We should not take any exception to any man aspiring to manage a large business and get control of a vast amount of capital, but we should insure that in doing so he has not the assistance of the Government. We should not grant a bounty which will find its way mainly into the pockets of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Jones. </para>

                            <para>- I observe that clause 7 says that no person shall obtain payment of any bounty by means of any false or misleading statement. But that will not protect the grower and insure that the bounty will go only to growers. I do not think there will be any advantage to the fruit-growers of Tasmania or any other State, except in a very remote degree, if the principles of the Bill in its present form are made law. </para>

                            <para>- Then the bounty is to be given to the evaporators. The Government cannot shut their eyes to the experience in connexion with the bounty for the sugar industry in Queensland. This Parliament had to make a law that the signature of. the _ grower should be given before the bounty was paid, because the money was finding its way into the pockets of people whom Parliament never intended to benefit. </para>

                            <para>- We know from past experience that the only way to protect the grower is to pay the bounty direct to him, and to get his signature before the money is paid, otherwise the bonus may be diverted  to persons interested in evaporators, who may not&#39; be growers at all, but have taken advantage of the unfortunate condition of the fruit-growers. According to the statement of the Minister in moving the second reading, the fruit-growers are to receive ls. 6d. per  bushel for their apples. The honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> has informed me that the average weight of a bushel of apples is about 40 lbs. </para>

The Judge will declare that it is the words of the Act that must prevail. In the Bill as it stands it is provided that the bounty must bo paid to the grower; but another clause allows the Minister to pay it to the investor. </para>

                        <para>.- On two points the Bill is not satisfactory to me. We should be particularly careful in the matter of granting bounties. Almost invariably our bounties have been paid to the wrong people, and there is a good deal in the contention of the honorable member who has last spoken that the grower should be protected by the Bill. I hope that in Committee we may arrange for that. I regret that the Bill was not circulated a few days ago, so that we might have looked through it carefully. I took exception to the proposed  bounty on wool tops,, on the score that it applied only to tops manufactured for export, pointing out that if we could build up the top industry in Australia, it would assist our local manufactures. I have already expressed my approval of. the American advice in regard to food- , stuffs, &#34;Eat what you Can, and can what you can&#39;t.&#34; But our first consideration should be to our own people. There is no reason why the bounty should be confined to apples evaporated for export. Last year a deputation waited on the Minister asking him to permit the importation of 100,000&#39; cases of apples. I should think that evaporated apples would meet the requirements of persons in the. interior in places to which it is said the Australian apple will not carry. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt, the growers will sell as much&#39; ripe fruit as they can. In the large cities, where the cost of distribution is not much, apples form- a cheap and wholesome diet within the reach of the masses. Only .the other day I bought half a case for 2s. In good seasons there is bound to be a large surplus, and we should be ready to assist in the disposal of this surplus. </para>

                            <para>- By giving a bounty for exported wool tops only, we have not assisted our local manufactures, and, as a result, have to import woollen yarn. I think that the bounty should be given for  all evaporated apples. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs&#39; has referred to the encouragement of cooperation amongst the growers ; and in our legislation we should keep that end steadily in view. Co-operation has been a great success in the case of butter, resulting in a steady supply, with benefit to both consumer and producer. Cooperation in marketing would give Aus- 1tralian people cheap fruit and insure better prices to the producer. The economic loss in the distribution of fruit through waste and the middleman&#39;s charges, is something enormous, there being a difference of something like 200 per cent, between the return to the producer and the price paid by the consumer. I do not know whether the arrangement in regard to the- evaporation of apples will permit of co-operation being furthered by means of the Bill, but I hope that co-operative companies wall be encouraged in preference to those formed privately.</inline></para>

                            <para>- The Minister may have the best intentions, and the honorable gentleman at present in charge knows as much about* the business as anybody in Australia ; but we must remember that business men adopt most peculiar methods. In Victoria the grower is at the mercy of&#39; everybody, and when evaporating companies come into existence he will be at their mercy. We may make all sorts of arrangements as to the price to be paid to the grower, but we know that evaporating and other companies have a custom of making advances, and the interest charges will be so managed that not much of the bonus will reach the man on the land. </para>

                            <para>- Business concerns have no conscience. A large section of the men on the land are at the mercy of the storekeepers, and I am afraid that something of the kind may happen in the case of the fruit-growers and the evaporating companies. Of course, I know that the fruit-grower in a large way is well ab.le to look after himself; but, unfortunately, a large majority of those engaged in growing fruit live from hand to mouth ; indeed, that is one  of the reasons for the introduction of this Bill. </para>

That clause provides that the owner, occupier, or lessee df any land on which the apples were grown, or the factory in which they were evaporated or have undergone any process, shall be deemed to be employed in the growing or evaporation of apples, unless the Minister, in writing, otherwise directs. In other words, a factory shall be deemed to be employed in the growing of apples. </para>

                            <para>- Not to satisfy me. The arbitration proceedings may be protracted, and in the meantime the employers may pay what wages they like. We have had experience of this in connexion with other bonuses, such as the iron bonus. At that time the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> was Minister for Trade and Customs, and provision was made in the Bill for a certain living wage; but this was declared by the High Court to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> The Bill was held up pending some assurance in the matter of wages, and I remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoskins</inline> brought five representatives of the union to Melbourne, who urged us to pass the Bill, saying that they were strong enough to extract from the iron masters the wages and conditions desired. In our . innocence we passed the Bill; and, when trouble arose in the industry, those same unionists asked the Minister not to pay the bonus, because the iron was&#39; being turned out with &#34; scab &#34; labour. As a matter of fact, the employers had outwitted the men, and they succeeded in obtaining the bonus, irrespective of any labour conditions. It will be seen, therefore, how necessary it is to take every precaution in the present case. </para>

                            <para>- In Victoria there are hundreds of men who go fruit-picking. I know very well that the fruit-grower, as a rule, is not able to pay big wages, and I look to this bonus to assist him in that direction. We also know that amongst fruit-growers are a number of grasping individuals who always pay as little as possible to the men they employ. The great fruit-growers of Renmark and Mildura had to be forced by the Courts to pay a fair wage, though theirs is one of the most highly protected industries in Australia. I admit that this </para>

We are now right into the winter, and I, in an interjection, asked the Minister whether he really thought he could pass the Bill to-day. # I can quite understand his anxiety to do so, because the work it covers has already been done.. My great desire is that the grower shall get the bonus, because I believe that, up to the present, certain men, who are dong the evaporating work, have advanced money to those on the land, and for that will charge them through the nose. </para>

                        <para>. - Next_ year, if, as is the case this year, there* is no shipping space provided, for fruit to England, it will be necessary to re-enact this measure. The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams)</inline> has waited on me, and pointed out the necessity there is for a bounty on dried vegetables. I am prepared to consider that, and I also agree with the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Sinclair)</inline> that we should endeavour to make provision for evaporating fruit and vegetables for inland consumption, obviating the necessity for importing fruit from America during several months of the year. It is a matter which I am prepared to take into consideration next year/ However, I would like to have this Bill passed as it is printed. It is only to operate for twelve months, and the evaporating for the year is now nearly completed. &#34;When the fruit-growers, who were deprived of their export market, waited on th* Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> he promised to consider whether assistance could not be given to them by the payment of a small bonus of 10 . per cent, on 300 tons of evaporated apples, purchased by England. I hope that the Committee will not adopt what is proposed by the honorable member for Capricornia and Melbourne Ports, because the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> has assured me that the provision in clause 5 is absolutely necessary. In every instance the growers will get the bounty. </para>

If there were a provision in that Act providing that the owners of a raw sugar mill should get a proportion of the sugar bounty, the honorable member might be right in contending that the clause in this Bill is a similar provision to that to which he has drawn my attention in the Sugar Bounty Act; but the two provisions differ, because in the clause of this Bill we have words introduced enabling the bonus to be extended to the evaporator or any other person who owns a factory in which apples are evaporated, or in which they have undergone any process. We are most anxious to help the fruit-grower of Tasmania or of any other part of Australia. The attitude of honorable members on this side of the chamber supports that contention, but we are not prepared to provide the Government with money so that they may present it to a gentleman - whose interest it has been to spend some of his capital in these evaporating plants and who pays the fruitgrowers1s. 6d. per bushel for the apples which they grow in their orchards. </para>

I am rather surprised that he should have done so in view of his intimate knowledge of the Sugar Bounty Act. Clause 3 declares that the bounty is to be payable to the growers of apples only. In the Sugar Bounty Act it is declared that the bounty is to be paid to every grower of &#39;whitegrown cane or beet, and in clause 4 of this- Bill it is set out that this bounty shall be payable only in inspect of evaporated apples which &#34; have been grown and evaporated by white labour only.&#34; If the honorable member&#39;s amendment be agreed to, the white-labour conditions of the clause will be destroyed. All previous measures of the kind contain a clause the same as that to which the honorable member is now taking exception. </para>

                            <para>- Where he is, we have no objection to the payment of the bounty to him. The Assistant Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> declares that the clause is necessary as it stands, and that since it is stated in clause 2 that the bounty shall be payable only to the grower of the apples, clause 5 is not in any way contradictory. I would point out to. him what he, as a lawyer, must know - that, although clause 2 provides that the grower alone shall receive the bounty, if a subsequent clause declares, as this does, that an evaporator shall be considered to be a grower, then such a person may claim the money. I believe the principle is wrong, and I oppose it. </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable members are aware of the conditions which render this motion necessary. As we do not prorogue during war time, absence from the session is possible even although the House is not sitting. &#39; We are, therefore, repeating the procedure which it was found necessary to adopt in connexion with the -last Parlia-  meat. Another reason for this motion is that certain honorable members who, perhaps, need not be specially mentioned - although as a matter of courtesy and recognition, I think we should mention them - are on active service. They are the honorable member for North Sydney (Brigadier-General Ryrie), the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Burchell),</inline> the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming),</inline> the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates),</inline> and the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Heitmann),</inline> who is shortly to embark. Two honorable members have also returned from the Front-the honorable member for New England (Lt.-Colonel Abbott) and the honorable member for Ballarat (Warrant Officer McGrath). We respond most readily to the desire that while these honorable gentlemen are in the service of their country, either here or overseas, they should be granted the necessary leave of absence. </para>

                <para class="block">I again take the opportunity of thanking honorable members  for  their hearty cooperation during the past week. The Government felt that it was advisable to close the session at this time, because of the problems that are pressing for solution. As honorable members on both sides are well aware, Ministers are severely handicapped in administrative work when the House is sitting continuously. The course we -have adopted was not prompted by any desire to escape into recess, as some honorable members have implied, for there is no holiday ahead of Ministers. The Government desire, as far as the administrative work will permit, to co-operate with honorable members of the House in recruiting work throughout the various constituencies during the early part of recess. As far as they are able to do so, Ministers will visit different portions of the Commonwealth, because the news we are getting every day justifies the belief that Australia must do its duty in the war till the very end. Apparently,, the German offensive is still making progress. No encouragement is derived from a study of the military outlook, but we feel that the heart of Australia is just as sound to-day, if it be properly appealed to, as when we first entered the war. </para>
                <para>Happily, we have &#39;been able during the last few weeks  to  banish some of the asperities from the political arena, and I pay my due tribute to honorable members opposite because of that. The Government have tried to encourage a better spirit than, unfortunately, has prevailed during the last eighteen months, and I hope that when we meet again we shall be able to promote harmony to a still further degree. We have tried to show in spirit, as far as was possible, the consideration promised by the Prime Minister and his colleagues at the Governor-General&#39;s Conference, and in that spirit we go into recess, hoping that the cooperation which has been established in the House will continue outside in connexion with recruiting and the other important national work that calls for attention. </para>

                    <para>.- The Acting Prime Minister, in referring to the sale of our wool to the Imperial Government, said that possibly some of the wool would reach other destinations than England. The inference is that some of it may go to Japan or other Eastern countries. Some time ago the Chamber of Commerce at Townsville, acting in behalf of the wool-growers in the hinterland, appealed to the Government to make that port a place of appraisement. Townsville is the fourth port of the Commonwealth in respect to the value of its exports, and the people&#39; there think that ships travelling to the Orient from that port might take wool, and save the grower the expense of sending it to some other place of appraisement, such as Brisbane or Sydney, and then shipping it to the East. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to take the matter into consideration, and to suggest to the Wool Committee that wool be shipped direct from Townsville to the East, thus saving&#39; a double journey and freights. </para>

                    <para>.- I congratulate the Government on slipping so easily into recess. I had fully made up my mind to test the feeling of the House in regard to the matter of prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors by moving an amendment on the motion for the special adjournment. As, however, fully half of the honorable members of the Chamber had already left for their homes, it was futile for me to do so. But I assure the Government that I shall take the earliest opportunity of asking the House to vote on that subject. It is our duty to do all we can to get reinforcements for the men at the Front, and, even at personal sacrifice, to insure that when they are recruited we shall get the most efficient service from the men, and also safeguard their interests when they return. </para>

                    <para>.- I never found greater difficulty in speaking - to a motion than I do now, because the Leader or Acting Leader of the Opposition is liable to be misunderstood if he responds to the amiable expressions of the Leader of the Government. The duty of an Opposition Leader is to endeavour to destroy the Government, in the belief that the Government cannot possibly do any good; that no good can come out of Nazareth. I find myself in a difficulty. If I agree with the Acting Prime Minister, and accept his compliments for having endeavoured to create harmony where discord formerly prevailed, the Opposition may lose votes from two quarters. When we appeal to the electors they may ask, &#34;Why should we make a change, when you have such a good opinion of the Government?&#34; and our more enthusiastic supporters may say, &#34; You cannot be sincere, because you have not attacked the Government on every possible occasion, giving them no quarter.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The country would be amused, and possibly edified, if the Acting Prime Minister and myself were to fall on each other&#39;s necks and kiss. However, I reciprocate the sentiments that he  has uttered. Greater harmony has prevailed. I do not think that there was any occasion for the discord that preceded it. The Government has not done what we think it should have done. I say that without desiring to create angry feeling. It is not the duty of an Opposition to instruct Ministers as to what they should do. Our duty is to tell the&#34; Government what it should not do. But in the goodness of heart which characterizes those on this side, we are prepared to give the Government a few hints. I agree with the Acting Prime Minister tha.t there is no recess for Ministers: they work nearly as hard when Parliament is not sitting as when it is sitting. That is especially true of&#39; the- Treasurer, upon whose shoulders a tremendously heavy burden will sit during the continuance of the war. In his dual capacity of Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer, the honorable member for Balaclava will have a very great deal to do, and he is entitled to the fairest criticism from opponents. I am of opinion that the Government are making a mistake in regard to the fixing of the prices of meat. Ministers must endeavour to reduce the cost of living to the consumers, bearing in mind their duty to the dependants of the soldiers. It is for the Government also to make the rich bear their due share of taxation. I might enlarge on these matters, but if the Acting Prime Minister wishes for further advice, and will drop me a line, I shall be happy to reply to him freely. On behalf of the Opposition, I thank the honorable gentleman for his amiable expressions, and I hope .that honorable members opposite, as well as those on this&#39; side, may live long and die happy. </para>

                    <para>.- In commending the Government for their advance to the farmers, I wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister, however, to take into consideration the advisability of making the first instalment larger. The proposal is to pay 3s. now, and to keep back ls. indefinitely; possibly for. one year, possibly for three. The instalment of 3s. will all be needed to pay expenses; it is the last shilling that will go to the farmer himself. Therefore I urge the Acting Prime Minister during the recess to consider whether, to meet the case of the necessitous farmer and the man who is farming on the share system, a scheme cannot be devised whereby negotiable certificates may be issued for the second payment. A needy man could then go to the Commonwealth Bank and discount his certificates, while a wealthy man would put them in his safe until the payment which they represented became due. This arrangement would not cost the country much, and would relieve many farmers considerably. At a conference of farmers which I attended, at which there were about 500 representatives, the conclusion was come to that the cost of producing a bushel of wheat, was, at the present time, from 3s. lOd. tq 4s. a&#39; bushel. I know that the Acting Prime Minister will do what I ask, if it can be done, and I &#39;hope that he will&#39; be able to treat the suggestion favorably. </para>

                <para>I ask the Acting Prime Minister to consider a matter . that has been brought under, my notice within the last few days. I am glad to hear that within the last few weeks the censorship has been administered with more wisdom and moderation than characterized it formerly. But I learned a day or two ago that a raid had been made on the office of the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call</inline> - I think on Friday night of last week - during which the premises had been searched and certain papers and printed pamphlets taken away. The raiders were not content to take copies of these pamphlets, but in many cases took the sole remaining copy from the editor&#39;s table, the use of which he claimed for his special purposes and protection. The pamphlet which the military officer and the civil police were particularly eager to obtain was a peace pamphlet circulated during the recent Flinders election campaign. I have the pamphlet here, but do not intend to rea&#39;d it for reproduction in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> If the raid and seizure of the pamphlet are intended  as  the preliminary  to  a prosecution, I urge the Acting Prime Minister, in all fairness,  to  remember that the election  is  a thing  of  the past ; that the candidate  of  his party was returned  by  a handsome majority; and that the pamphlet can  no  longer have any influence. I hope that this sudden attack - this <inline font-style="italic">ex post facto</inline> raid  on  the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call</inline> - does not mean that during the recess there will  be  a recrudescence  of  what  we  consider the unfair administration  of  the censorship. I hope,  too,  that the Acting Prime  Minister, in  his  endeavour  to be just, will try also  to be  generous. </para>

                        had his statements substantiated by the Public Service Commissioners or the examiners, there would be some prospect of intelligent people believing him, but being so uncertain of the accuracy of his statement, he&#39; is good enough to request ait inquiry, so that the onus of proof might be removed from him.

                        &#34; B.H.&#34;  is quite justified in asking me as a public man to substantiate my statement that an unfair advantage is given to some candidates for admission to the Civil Service over others, inasmuch as the actual questions have been made known to some. In the speech made by me at South Melbourne I referred to it not  as a  fact, but  as a  rumour, so generally believed that&#39; it justified  an  inquiry  as  to its truth. I will now go further and&#39; justify my position by referring to an incident which happened a few months ago in the Defence Department at Melbourne. Clerical examinations were being held by that Department. It  waft  found on examining results that the students of one college, the principal of which is one of the party to which I referred, obtained an extremely high percentage of marks. It so surprised the examiners that they became curious, as to the possibility, of the question* having been divulged. At the next examination the precaution was taken immediately before it to alter some of the questions. The result was that the candidates from the particular college referred to failed miserably in the amended questions, but as heretofore easily and correctly answered the original questions.

                    <para>In regard to this test, it was thought that the continued use. of the same papers would lead to applicants acquiring a knowledge of the questions put, and the questions were suddenly changed, with the result that one applicant showed he must have had prior knowledge of them, probably derived from one who had already undergone the test. The passing of this test did not insure employment in the Department, but merely served to give some indication as to whether the applicant had any educational qualifications to warrant consideration for employment. It is understood that another Department has held an examination at a business college recently, and the Minister has referred the papers showing the result of his inquiry to that Department for their information. </para>

                <para class="block">It would appear from this that the statements made by the honorable member for Echuca, on the face of them, from the knowledge we have of our examination system, and for other reasons scarcely credible, have now been proved to be wholly unfounded This is a finding upon which I think honorable members on both sides of the House  may well congratulate themselves. I can scarcely conceive of any honorable member subscribing to the view that an unfair advantage is given to any section of the community in the examinations for the Public Service, and certainly that any unfair advantage is given to any persons by reason of their religion. I thought it, due to the persons involved in these damaging statements that the matter should be cleared up as far as possible. I am glad, therefore, to place on record a complete answer by the Minister showing that there is not a vestige or tittle of truth in the allegation reflecting on a large section of the community and on a well-known educational institution. The honorable member should now withdraw his charges, or attempt to make them good. </para>

I have been very credibly informed that certain people are trying to induce some of the students to promise that they will join this company if it is formed. Those who have not done so have reason to believe that their refusal to sign will militate against them in the forthcoming examination; and I should - like the Acting Prime Minister to consider that phase of the matter.

I can assure my honorable friend that in the recess, if we can call it a recess, there will be no recrudescence such as he referred to; no action will be taken except what the Government feels is necessary for the maintenance of our war aims and the preservation of the country. As I told the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> in a recent letter, we cannot yield on things that seem vital to us in that respect; that will be the guiding principle actuating us throughout. </para>
