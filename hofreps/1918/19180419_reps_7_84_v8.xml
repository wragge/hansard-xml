When I left the chamber, I was under the impression - received from an Honorary Minister - that I was paired with Sergeant Fleming.

                        <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister whether his attention has been drawn to a statement in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of the 16th April last dealing with the work of the Maitland mine. The officers of the Victorian Mines Department there point out, among other things, that, so far as the Department could say, the contract with Messrs. J. and A. Brown had not been signed. The Victorian Government, they add, is supplying voluntary labour for the Richmond Main mine. Will the right honorable gentleman make representations to the Victorian Government, in view of the crisis through which we are passing, and the fact that a large number of miners in the district are unemployed, as to the inadvisability of sending men from Victoria until work has been found for those on the spot? </para>

The voluntary labour question is only one phase of the general victimization question ; and' I hope that, as the result of the Conference now taking place elsewhere, matters will soon be cleared up in a way that will be satisfactory to all concerned. </para>

                        <para>At a meeting of the Medical Students Society recently held at the University, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Allen being in -the chair, great enthusiasm was expressed when a motion was tabled excluding all" slackers " from membership of the society. </para>
                        <para class="block">By more than a two-thirds majority, the voting being 170 for the motion, and only  65 against it, it was decided " that no one should be allowed to become or remain a member of the Medical Students Society unless he could give satisfactory reasons why he was not in khaki, to a committee to be composed of a medical man, a lawyer, and a business man." It was further decided that the medical member of the committee should be an outside practitioner not connected with the University staff. The announcement of the voting was received with loud cheers." </para>
                        <para class="block">I can only add to the information contained in this paragraph that the Medical Students Society is a voluntary association of practically the whole of the medical students in the University, and that the proposal which was carried at their meeting emanated from the society itself, and was not the result of suggestion or pressure on the part of the University or any of its officers. </para>

It so surprised the examiners that they became curious as to the possibility of the questions having been divulged. At the next examination the precaution was taken immediately before it to alter some of the questions. The result was that the candidates from the particular college referred to failed miserably in the amended questions, but as heretofore easily and correctly answered the original questions ?

It is in order that both Leaders of this House might be at the Conference to enable it to finish its work to-day that we are taking this course. In the circumstances, I hope that honorable members will see the fairness of my proposition, in which I have the hearty concurrence of the Leader of the Opposition. </para>

                <para>A Ministerial statement has been made, with a motion that it be printed, in order to provide an opportunity for discussion; and it is only reasonable, seeing that the Leader of the Opposition is engaged elsewhere, that that debate should be adjourned. But we understood that we were called together to deal with legislation. Where is the Bill of the Assistant Minister for Defence? I can only suppose that it is not ready. Where is the new Electoral Bill, or the promised industrial measure? We on this side do not desire any of these measures, because we do not think they are likely to be of any good. From statements I have seen, I am quite satisfied that they are mere party measures, designed to take advantage of the country and of the soldiers in the trenches. At the same time, if there is business to do we might as well face the music. </para>
                <para>The Government is in exactly the same position as it was when it met Parliament' on the last occasion. ' 'The Opposition were not then prepared to debate the Address-in-Reply for weeks on end, and it was found that the Government had no business of. any kind to go on with. Having no business of its own to advance the interests of either Australia or of tie Empire as a whole, in the war, the Government refuses any body else an opportunity to do anything. </para>
                <para>The business-paper is chock full of notices of motions by private members on both sides. There are no fewer than thirty motions dealing with important subjects ; and when the Government have no business of its own an opportunity should be provided for private members to deal with proposals, many of which have been on the paper for months. </para>
                <para>The Government insists upon adjournments time after time, and because the business on the paper is not a particular kind of business the little private despots in the Cabinet desire, every means at their disposal is taken to prevent anything being done. </para>
                <para>I have over and over again referred to those honorable members opposite who claim to specially represent the farmers; and I remind them that there are important motions on the paper dealing with farming interests. Those honorable members tell the farmers that only they can adequately represent them; and yet, by agreement together, they use the tyranny of their majority to suppress. Parliament, and thus delay the consideration of much that is vital and of urgent importance to the farmers' interests. Every honorable member with a notice on the business-paper who agrees to the proposed adjournment agrees to closing his own mouth. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hector Lamond)</inline> has a motion dealing With the question of decimal coinage, and I ask whether he is in earnest, or whether that motion is merely there as a placard. We find him cheering the Government's proposal to adjourn for a whole day on which he could have dealt with that motion, which is the first on the paper. If he is sincere, he must have prepared information of use to the country, and presumably he has reasons which would weigh with the Government. </para>
                <para>The next notice of motion is one by myself dealing with a War Precautions Regulation which has stirred up sectarianism and created irritation and dissension from one end of Australia to the other. This regulation was suggested by a little handful of bigots in this country, and is certainly a fit subject for consideration by Parliament. The Prime Minister, with his strong feelings and his lack of judgment, has over and over again created discord throughout the country ; and surely there ought to be some check exercised by Parliament. Yet honorable members opposite insist on an adjournment, and refuse to afford any opportunity for reviewing a matter of this importance. </para>
                <para>The next notice of motion deals with the conscription of certain citizens of Australia; and surely that would bear discussion? Are honorable members prepared to simply accept the <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of one or two men? </para>
                <para>As to the liberty and freedom of Parliament, honorable members seem prepared to make themselves slaves. </para>
                <para>On the business-paper there are numerous proposals to disallow or repeal War Precautions regulations. </para>
                <para>Under the law, a regulation must be laid on the table within so many days of our assembling, and within a certain period a motion may be moved to disallow it. Surely the corollary of this is that an opportunity should be given to discuss a motion to disallow any such, regulation ? But the laws of the country . are. being broken by this refusal to give an opportunity for the consideration of such matters. </para>
                <para>It is asserted that if there be a majority in the House of opinion that any of these matters should be discussed, there is perfect freedom to submit a motion and insist on a discussion. We know, however, that in practice this is not so. Honorable members opposite, within the last few days, have told us that a motion submitted by the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> met with their entire approval,, but because the Government treated it as one of no-confidence, they voted against it. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member makes a few weak statements of which he knows the Government will take no notice. And who would take notice of an honorable member whom a few short words will cause to sink back and hold his tongue? That sort of conduct in Parliament gains no justice for the persons who are suffering injustice. It is about time the farmers in Calare were made to understand that they are being fooled. The honorable member for Calare tickles the ears of his constituents with stories about the things he will do, but when he Comes to Parliament he merely asks a few questions, and sends out to the farmers proof copies of the replies, and they say at once, " What a wonderful man he is." But when we give the honorable member an opportunity of firing something more than a blank cartridge, when we provide him with a lever that will enable him to get something substantial for his constituents, he stops short. </para>

                    <para>.- The Government are showing scant consideration to members who reside in States far distant from the Seat of Government. These adjournments are_ all very well for honorable members who reside in New South Wales or Victoria. They are able to go to their homes at the week-ends and attend to their private and official business. Yesterday there was no sitting of the House, and now we are considering a motion to adjourn, and not sit again until next Wednesday. There is on the notice-paper business that we ought to be able to proceed with. For instance, we might proceed with the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Lands Bill, of which the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> is in charge. If it is essential that the Prime Minister, the Minister for the Navy, and the Leader of the Opposition should absent themselves from the House, .there are still sufficient members present to enable us to deal with several of the Bills that are on the notice-paper. I ask the Government to see that there is no more loss of time than 5s necessary. Members from Western Australia and Queensland, while being quite prepared to give their time to the business of the country, find it very inconvenient to be detained for long periods in Melbourne unnecessarily, when they, unlike members from other States, have no opportunity of going to their homes at the week-end. </para>

In my opinion, the censorship is used in a very unfair and unwise manner. I support the Defence Department and the Censors entirely in suppressing any information that is calculated to be of advantage to the enemy. But I think we ought to be permitted to discuss matters which cannot assist the enemy, but will lead to the better conduct of the war. Recently I wrote to the Censor and asked him whether I was permitted to discuss in the public press the restriction of the export of greasy and scoured wool to Japan. </para>

                        <para>- In this House we are not subject to the Censor. Fortunately, we are able to speak here that which we think ought to be spoken. But within these four walls only is a man free to give expression to his views. Anywhere else in Australia, outside the parliamentary building, he is subject to military interference, and may be brought before the Court and fined so frequently that he becomes insolvent. Very few men can afford to risk those prosecutions. I wish to discuss the matter of the restriction of the export of wool to Japan.  I  have previously stated, and I believe it to be true, that somebody, acting in the interests of the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, whose operations have been under discussion recently, has prevented Japan from getting greasy and scoured wool. Shortly after  I  made  a speech in January last on this question,  the censors sent to the newspapers an instruction preventing them from publishing any reference to the restrictions on the export of greasy and scoured wool to Japan. In reply to the letter I wrote to the Censor recently, I received this communication, No. O.A. 24,116: - </para>

                <para class="block">Japan is a great Ally, and has rendered splendid assistance to the British Empire during this war. We ought to be able to speak our mind regarding any maladministration on the part of the Government which is 'detrimental to our Allies. I quite agree that we should not make any statement calculated to hurt the feelings of Japan. But if the Imperial Government have been induced by somebody in Australia to prevent Japan buying raw materials from this country, we ought to know the reason. Surely that is a matter that ought to be discussed. </para>
                <para>There is in some quarters in Japan a feeling hostile to this country. Some of the Japanese people are of opinion that we are opposed to them on racial grounds, and they resent that very much. They will not resent our attitude if they know that our objections to their competition is on economic grounds. And some time ago, I suggested to the House that we might reasonably ask Japanese representatives to visit our factories and learn firsthand the truth as to the hours of labour and the wages of the workers, and then ask themselves whether they were entitled to send goods to Australia, subject only to a low rate of duty. The Japanese representatives who come here would take the view that we were entitled, in view of the better conditions of our workpeople here, to ask for a high protective import duty, but this is another question, relating to the supply of our raw materials to Japan, an Ally. Surely the members of the House ought to be permitted to show the public of Australia, and the people of Japan, that our Government, so far as they are responsible for the restriction of the export' of greasy and scoured wool to Japan, are misrepresenting public opinion in Australia. </para>
                <para>When we allow the British or Australian Government to prevent the Japanese from getting our raw materials, we are allowing something which is calculated to create a great deal of misunderstanding between Japan and ourselves. </para>
                <para>I am glad the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett),</inline> who is a member of the Central Wool Committee, is present, for I am sure he will see my point. We do not want to give any friendly nation a real grievance. Anything any member of the House may say about Japan will have very little influence, because there are men in the Japanese Diet who attack Great Britain and Australia, but that does not make any difference to the majority of the statesmen and people of Japan, who desire to be on friendly terms with us. The Japanese are not likely to take much notice of any individual member, but are certainly likely to take a great deal of notice of what amounts to an interference with their trade and industry. </para>
                <para>I appeal to the members of the Win-the-war party to use their influence with the Government to allow greater freedom of public discussion in the press on these matters. If the House permitted itself to be guided by the Prime Minister, no discussion would be allowed in the House at all. The Prime Minister said he would suppress <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> He has such distorted views that it is fortunate for us that the majority of his party do not agree with him in that regard, and do not' desire to prevent any member giving expression to his convictions in the House so long as he does so in parliamentary language, and in accordance with the Standing Orders. Here is documentary evidence that the censors have been instructed, either by the Prime Minister or the Minister for Defence, not to permit in the public press any discussion of the restriction of wool export to Japan, which is a grievous wrong, and calculated to bring about a misunderstanding with a country with which we all desire to be friendly. </para>

                    <para class="block">Bruce Smith) as the champion of the Eastern races. Indeed, the most interesting feature of recent debates here to me has been the suddenness with which honorable members of the Opposition have changed their attitude on various matters. The honorable member for Cook ' <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts),</inline> representing the Newtown Bridge farmers, would move one to tears in the defence of high prices for wheat, when only a few years ago his main political platform was that the unhappy electors of Cook were being charged so high a price for bread that it reduced their earnings, and that the real object of the party in Parliament should be to obtain cheap food for the people. We listened, also, to remarks from the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> lately upon the low prices of the people's meat foods - rabbits. Then we had the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nicholls)</inline> descanting upon the low price of wheat, and the necessity of raising the price of bread to the people of the cities. The party that once represented the great 'mass of the people is now busily occupied in pretending to advocate the interests of those sections of the community which hitherto they have condemned, and which it was their chief object to represent this party as being formed to protect.- Honorable members on this side of the House, who used to be charged with protecting the interests of squatters, farmers, meat raisers, and other producers, at the expense of the country, are now charged by the very same men with neglecting the vital interests of these people, and allowing wheat, meat, and other things to be cheap that would be made dearer if the pretended advice of these gentlemen was listened to. On this proposal for adjournment the same pretence is made of an intense desire to get on with the business of the country. When the question of recruiting comes up we have the same pretence, that honorable members on the other side are intensely interested in getting more recruits. To-day the most important gathering of public men in Australia is continuing its sittings at Government House in the endeavour to find some method to get men to the colours, and is faced with the position that its labours must be brought to an early conclusion. In order to help this the Government have been asked to make such arrangements of the business of this Parliament as will enable the Leader, of the Opposition and the Leader of the Government to attend the Conference to-day. One would expect that such a proposal would be received without opposition by every person who desires to see some good come from the Conference, but the moment it is mentioned in the House members of the Opposition attack it in the same way as they do any proposal for compulsory service in Australia. The man who does anything in any way to help recruiting seems to incur the bitter hostility of some honorable members opposite, and even the Leader of the Opposition is not able to exercise sufficient control over his followers to enable effect to be given to an arrangement which he himself has made with the Government. The honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts)</inline> said I had the first business on the paper if private members' business was brought forward to-day. I should be very glad of the opportunity, but to me the most important thing pending here is what is happening at Government House. I have little zest for any business in this Parliament until some way can be shown to take a more effective part than we are doing in the conduct of. the war. I also feel it is an absolute waste of time, just as the last week has been wasted, to discuss these matters of internal control here if we are unable to secure such a result in the centre of war as will entitle these institutions to remain in this country at all. While our minds are turned in that direction, honorable members are not able to give to these minor matters the attention that under other conditions they would give. I have no desire to proceed with the business on the paper in "the absence of the party leaders from Parliament to-day. The utter hollowness of this pretence is shown in the attitude of honorable members themselves. When the Leader of the Government proposed ,to make up for to-day's inactivity by alloting another day next week, a storm of opposition came from those honorable members who, the next, moment, were condemning the Government for not getting on with the business. The men who want an opportunity to discuss the proposals to be placed before the Imperial Conference refuse to allow the Government to have an extra day next week in which to discuss them. I hope wiser counsels will prevail in the Cabinet, and that they will insist on taking the extra days necessary for the full discussion of these matters before the delegates leave for England. If, however, we fail to secure that opportunity, the fault will lie at the door of those honorable members who objected to the proposal of the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Joseph Cook)</inline> to devote an extra day next week to the business of Parliament. An extra day could easily be given by honorable members, who pretend to be so busy that they cannot come here for four days a week. </para>
                    <para>Mr.FINLAYSON (Brisbane) [12.11]. - The reasons given for this unexpected adjournment may be very good, and I believe they are most important. I believe the Conference, which is expected to conclude its labours to-day, will mark a very important step in the conduct of the war so far as Australia is concerned,' but the reasons given for the adjournment, while important, are entirely unsatisfactory, and one sits amazed to hear such hypocritical humbug put forward as argument as that to which the Minister for the Navy and the honorable member for Illawarra have treated the House. </para>

There was an interval of thirty-eight days; Parliament then sat for one day. There was another interval of twenty-seven days, and then Parliament sat for thirty-five days. Then followed an interval of 104 days, and Parliament sat for seven days. This was followed again by an interval of seventy-six days, and during this part of the session we have now sat for seven days.

                            <para>- The honorable member has taken the words out of my mouth. Honorable members on the Government side therefore corroborate my assertion that during that time the Government have done nothing to carry out the promises they made to the country, and the policy they submitted at that time. They were elected at their own request on their policy of winning the war, and we have already learned during the debates this week that the Government have done absolutely nothing towards that great and wonderful policy. If there was likely to be any difficulty in tie House carrying on business to-day one could understand the reasons for the adjournment, but at the very most only four members - the Prime Minister, the Minister for the Navy, the Minister for Recruiting <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Orchard),</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition, need be absent. It is not suggested that any obstacle shall be put in the way of either or all of those gentlemen attending the Conference. </para>

                            <para>- I also object to the suggestion of the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond),</inline> that it was owing to opposition from this side of the House that the proposal to sit on Tuesday was abandoned. The cause was the opposition from the Government side of the House, and particularly the emphatic declaration of the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster).</inline> The Minister for the Navy would not accept the protest from three members on this side until an emphatic protest came from his own side, and then he immediately altered his motion to the regular day of sitting. The Government have submitted Bills, many of them very important, but not one of them in charge of any of the Ministers whose attendance is required at the Recruiting Conference. There are nine measures on the Government programme, and twenty-nine motions standing in the names of private members. No opportunity is given us to attend to them. Time is going on, and those of us who come from the more distant States are being put under a most severe disability in carrying on our work and attending to the wants of our constituents, because the Government seem unable to go on with business in the absence of the Prime Minister. If he chooses to be absent, that is no reason why the business of the country should be brought to a stand-still. It is not only because there is business to be done by members of Parliament that I object to this motion. I would not like to suggest that it has been moved because the Government do not want to go on with their Bills. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member can persuade the Government to move such a motion, he will have no opposition from me. But when early in 1917 the Prime Minister made' a fervent - I should say fervid, because I do not believe that he was fervent - appeal to members to use a special recess for recruiting, not one Minister appeared on the recruiting platform. That has been typical of their conduct right through. An adjournment to-day will suit me, because I have arrears of correspondence to bring up, but the moving of the adjournment by the Government shows their indifference to the welfare of the country and the winning of the war - an indifference which is characteristic of them. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not often address the House on the motion for the adjournment, but I rise on this occasion because of the attitude of the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson),</inline> and of a number of members on that side who continually sneer at the Government and its supporters when the term "Win the war" is mentioned. It is a simple matter to ask, "What are you doing to win the war?" but the question should never come from those who have done their damnedest to prevent Australia from doing all that she could do in the war. Those who are supported by outside organizations, whose branches in many parts of Australia have passed resolutions against recruiting, have no right to ask us, "What are you doing to win the war?" </para>

                    <para class="block">There are men sitting opposite who have not followed the dictates of their conscience in this matter. There are men there who sneer at the sincerity of the Ministerial party, and yet are afraid to follow the dictates of their own consciences. They said that we should have universal military service, but when outside bodies put pressure on them, they took the platform against conscription and their own private convictions on the subject. Only yesterday an organization supporting members on the opposite side of the chamber sent a message of congratulation to the Bolsheviks of Russia - to the men who have made it possible that the democratic institutions of the world may fall at any moment. These supporters of members opposite look with pride on the efforts of the Bolsheviks. </para>

                            <para>- During the past fifteen or eighteen months we have read in the newspapers, not one, but scores of resolutions passed by outside organizations demanding of members that they should not support recruiting, and in one case requiring them to retire from recruiting committees. I say, too, without fear of successful contradiction, that during that time the press which supports them has been but lukewarm in the cause of the Allies. These members, who say that Australia ' could do enough under the voluntary system, declare now, when asked to do all they can to make that system a success, that unless they get this and that minor grievance remedied, they will do nothing. The grievances that they advance sink into insignificance when contrasted with the main issue. During the war I have suffered more inconvenience and injustice than most persons in Australia; but were I to say that I would do nothing to help my country until my personal wrongs had been righted, I should be in the position of honorable members opposite. Loyalty 'that is accompanied by a qualification is not of much service to the community in this period of our affairs. </para>

                        <para>.- I protest against the proposed adjournment on the flimsy pretext that the House cannot do its work without the Prime Minister being present. On the average, the Prime Minister does not attend here for five minutes on each sitting day. What is the reason for the proposed adjournment? The only reason I can find for it is the lack of sincerity in the Government protestations that their desire is to win the war by helping the Allies. If lying down and sleeping and going slow on the job would have won the war, the Government would have won it long ago. Even one of their supporters has said that nothing has been done. Something has been done. Men have been placed in gaol for their efforts on behalf of their own class. This is the last infamy that has been perpetrated by the Government. A regulation has been issued prohibiting any persons from publishing any matter that has been censored. That is a very fine thing indeed. It is not a war precaution; it is a political precaution, passed for political purposes. </para>

                    <para>This House must do without the presence of the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy during their visit to the Old Country, or adjourn until they return from overseas. If Ministers cannot carry on the business of the country, or go on with the ordinary routine of parliamentary work in the absence of the Prime Minister, it is an admission of incapacity on their part. It is apparent that they have no desire to go ,on with business, and I venture to predict that their programme until the end of this Parliament will compare very favorably with what they have achieved during the past twelve months, and that is nothing, unless it be tinkering with people's freedom, depriving them of their rights, or attempting to gaol them. I like honorable members' protestations as to their sincerity, in the matter of winning the war, contrasted with their continual laying of charges against honorable members on this side of the House. One minute we are called pro-Germans; the next minute we are described as disloyal; after abusing us for a quarter of an hour a Minister will spend the balance of his time in asking us to help the Ministry; and afterwards Cabinet will meet and devise a new and infamous scheme for gaoling us. I do not believe that the House is asked to adjourn to-day for the reason advanced by the Minister for the Navy. </para>

                            <para>- This is where the hypocrisy and sham of the thing come in. The Government were elected by an overwhelming majority, but, after occupying the Treasury bench for twelve months, and doing nothing, they have changed the venue of the conduct of affairs to Government House, and have handed over control to another body, thus acknowledging their incapacity to carry on the business of the country. The honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond)</inline> gets up, and, with his tongue in his cheek, says that the assemblage at Government House is the most important body of men we have in Australia; that is to say, we are to be subservient, to this new Parliament, which has been created by an incapable Government, and by handing over the business of the country to this outside body, Ministers admit their incapacity. When the Conference met, the Government did not even come forward with business to put before it, but expected the </para>

                    <para>I wish to touch upon the general demeanour of Ministers. They are not interested in questions submitted to them by honorable members, although they may give one an answer of a sort. This morning, when J asked the Honorary Minister if he was aware that farmers were being refused seed wheat by a State Wheat Board, he said that he was not aware of it, but that if I would put the question on the notice-paper he would investigate the matter. Surely to heaven the matter was important enough for the Minister to ask me to give him further information upon it, </para>

                            <para>- It is not a State matter. It is a matter for the Commonwealth Government, which controls the Wheat Pool. I have received letters from three farmers in New South Wales who have been refused seed wheat by the State Wheat Board. If farmers who have put their wheat into the Pool are refused seed wheat by the State Wheat Board, it creates a serious position. It is necessary that the whole of our agricultural land should not be devoted to grazing, and unless the Commonwealth Government give immediate instructions to the State Wheat Board in New South Wales to make the necessary seed wheat available to the farmers, so that they may sow their crops at once, the land may not be put under  wheat. It is a matter of considerable importance, because, although we have plenty of wheat on hand now, immediately shipping is available it will be sent away. </para>

                        <para>.- It is quite obvious that there must be some explanation for the alleged refusal of the State Wheat Board to provide this farmer at Narromine with seed wheat. I am quite certain that the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> is absolutely <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> in bringing forward this alleged grievance; but it is to some extent an abuse of the privileges of the House for the honorable member to bring forward such a statement unless he is prepared to lay on the table the letter in which the State Wheat Board alleged its inability to provide this farmer with this particular kind of seed wheat. </para>

This matter should not have been brought before the House unless the honorable member was prepared to lay on the table the letter of the State Wheat Board in which it is supposed to have refused to supply this seed wheat. </para>

No complaint of the kind ought to be brought forward unsupported by evidence, and honorable members called upon to pass judgment on <inline font-style="italic">ex-parte</inline> statements of the kind. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> as I understood him, said he had received a letter from the Censor to the effect that his statements made on the floor of the House, in regard to the relations between the Imperial Governments of Japan and Great Britain, could not be allowed to appear in the press. Apparently the honorable member regards this as a continuation of his grievance against the Central Wool Committee and the general administration of affairs. I am not here to champion what has been done by the Censors in Australia, but I have no doubt that they have been called upon to conduct their work under great difficulties. Although there may be reasons not apparent, at all events, to myself, why many things should be censored, I do not know that I am called upon to either condemn or apologize for what has been done. </para>

                            <para>- Of course; and it is quite possible that their instructions may come not entirely from those who are immediately administering the affairs of this country. There may be greater matters at stake than some of us seem to think, and, in consequence, it may be most undesirable that certain statements should receive wide circulation. However, the Central Wool Committee is not in the remotest degree responsible for the censorship of speeches made here or anywhere else. It is almost a pity that the statement by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> that Japan has been prevented by the Commonwealth Government from receiving our wool, should be repeated again and again. The fact must be emphasized that any interference with the export of wool from Australia to any place in the world is entirely in the hands of the Imperial Government, the Central Wool Committee merely carrying out the instructions of that Government in its distribution. It is, as I say, a misfortune that these allegations should be so continually made, because they have been exploded over and over again, and I trust we shall hear no more of them. </para>

                        <para>in reference to the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nicholls).</inline> It was most unfair of the honorable member for Illawarra to put the words he did into the mouth of the honorable member for Macquarie. The honorable member for Illawarra said that the honorable member for Macquarie was evidently an advocate of an increased price of bread, because he was in favour of an advance in the price of wheat. I have a good recollection of what the honorable member for Macquarie did say, and his complaint was not so much concerned with the price of wheat as with the delay on the part of the Wheat Pool in paying money that has been owing to the farmers for a considerable period. </para>

                    <para>I am pleased to know that the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> intends to present balance-sheets and reports relating to the various factories established by the Government. The Labour party, when in power, insisted that the manager of each of these undertakings should be held responsible, and every year present a report and a balance-sheet; and I hope that now we shall have similar information supplied regarding the Wheat Pools, the Wool Pool, Commonwealth Shipping, and the Metal Pool, if the scheme in regard to metals can be so described. All these are great business concerns under the auspices of the Commonwealth, and the House is entitled to full and complete balance-sheets. This particularly applies to the purchase and working of the Commonwealth line of steamers. It is a plank in the Labour platform that there shall be a Commonwealth line, and the party was not opposed to the purchase by the Prime Minister. But we never conceived of a Prime Minister at any time purchasing vessels and allowing them to be run as a business without presenting proper reports and balance-sheets. I trust the Government will not give rise to adverse criticism by causing any suspicion to rest upon them in regard to some of the transactions they carry out, and, therefore, proper balance-sheets should be presented at no distant date. </para>

                    <para>.- There appears to have been some misunderstanding. When I heard the adjournment moved this morning I returned to Government House to take part in the deliberations of the Conference in regard to recruiting. Later, I was informed that the Government had withdrawn the motion for an adjournment, and that they proposed to proceed with the debate on the Ministerial Statement. I am placed in a worse position than any other honorable member. . Certain things which I said in this House during the want-of-confidence debate, and later, elsewhere, I cannot say to-day. I am a member of the Conference, and I shall regard the proceedings as confidential until they are concluded. I desire to be at the Conference this afternoon. There is a paragraph in the Ministerial Statement which refers to the desirability of our presenting a united front in the face of the common danger. I shall not discuss that paragraph this afternoon, but I proceed to deal with other matters mentioned in the Statement. I think I will be entitled to ask that, when the Conference is concluded, I shall be given an opportunity to speak on the matter of restoring harmony and unity in the community. </para>

                        I entered the House after lunch I was given to. understand by the Minister for the Navy that an arrangement had been made with the Leader of the Opposition to continue this debate, and on that understanding I came in to take charge of the House in the absence of the senior members of the Government. There is no desire on the part of the Government to embarrass the Leader of the Opposition. We realize that he, like the senior Ministers, has duties to perform at the Conference, and if he desires to attend the Conference this afternoon I shall take the full responsibility of adjourning this debate and proceeding with other business.

                            <para>- I think I heard a colorable imitation of politics fall from the lips of the honorable member recently. However, there are no politics in my finance. I do not desire to mete out any blame for past proceedings. Possibly the extraordinary pressure and incidence of public life during the last couple of years have been mainly responsible for the irregularities that have occurred. I am the fourth Treasurer to hold office during the last fifteen months, and this instability probably explains why the, matters which are now under consideration were not attended to earlier. An opportunity is now before me to ask the Committee to validate these things, and I do so with the following explanation. I shall deal first with the year 1915-1916. Honorable members will, perhaps, not require me to traverse all the items in this list of Supplementary Estimates, but I do propose to explain the chief increases. The expenditure may be divided into two classes, that which is consequent on the war, and ordinary departmental expenditure outside of war services. In the first class the principal increases were - In the War Pensions Office, which is naturally a growing Department in consequence of the heavy and regrettable liability which we have assumed, £6,189; premiums on life assurance policies of Commonwealth Public Servants, who are members of the Expeditionary Forces, £2,591; grant to State War Councils for recruiting purposes, £5,000; expenditure in connexion with interned enemy subjects, £45,336; remittance of moneys belonging to members of the Australian Imperial Force abroad, of which has been already recovered, £63,822; moneys received from the sale of Garrison Institute goods on transport, £40,623, which has since been wholly recovered; grant to Administration at Rabaul to meet revenue deficiency, to be recovered, £34,570; grant to Administration at Rabaul to provide for advances- to traders, £41,971, the whole of which has since been recovered ; supply of wire netting to the Government of the United Kingdom, to be recovered, £13,879; pay of Naval Reserves called up for duty in consequence of the war, £5,485 ; for the purchase of foodstuffs for the Governments of India and South Africa, £69,626, which has now been recovered.* A vast number of transactions relating to the purchase of foodstuffs for the Governments of the Empire, and in some cases Allied Governments, have been a constant duty thrown on the Administration since the war broke out. It has developed into a regular business; and is a matter of Treasury liability until adjustments .are made between the Governments concerned. The total increase consequent upon the war in that financial year was £329,092. </para>

                            <para>- The bulk of it has already been recovered. The expenditure for services other than war was as follows: - Docking and overhauling the <inline font-style="italic">Aurora,</inline> £3,939; this is a bookkeeping provision to legalize expenditure which was previously charged against the new works vote for the  construction of the Fleet; coinage of silver, £7,276; purchase of gold for distribution to jewellers, £11,699; this amount has since been recovered; High Commissioner's Office, £4,529; redemption of Northern Territory loans, £181,625; up to 31st December, 1915, this expenditure was met from loan fund; after that date the redemptions were provided for from revenue, and this is the first debit. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, they are burdens on the Territory for which we became liable when we accepted the transfer. There were a number falling due at different dates. Additional advance to Small Arms Factory trust account, £35,000; on the 30th June, 1916, £12,396 was repaid from this trust account to revenue; the Naval College is responsible for an increase on general expenditure of £5,803; £30,000 is for an advance to the Trust Fund Admiralty account; the expenditure from this account is recoverable from the Admiralty; certain extra working expenses for the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway amounted to £10,959; various charges, such as rent, repairs, and maintenance,, came to £11,848, and the extra amount for the Postmaster-General's Department was £4,841. The non-war services thus totalled £307,519. The only other items included are supplementary amounts for additions, new works, and buildings. They include an extra amount of £3,379 for the Federal Capital for that year, and £9,243 for the Flinders Naval Base, £3,012 for improvements to the Liverpool manoeuvre area, and £1,338 for sundry post-office buildings in New South Wales. </para>

I take this to be a validating proposal, and naturally expect that criticism will be offered of the methods employed, but I hope that the Committee will authorize me to deal with these matters a little more promptly in the future if the circumstances of the House and politics generally will allow. </para>

No one holds the present Treasurer responsible, but £639,000 has been spent without the sanction of Parliament, and Supplementary Estimates are brought down two and a half years later. Surely that practice is not going to be continued? We are not sure that it will not be, although the Treasurer says it will not. </para>

If honorable members will make inquiries of the Treasurer, they will come to the conclusion that there is nothing improper about the matter, and that it is necessary, in the interests of the government of the country, to have this fund. All Governments have secret service funds, though these are not openly provided for in the Estimates. </para>

The expenditure out of Treasurer's Advance during 1916-17 - not including that on Additions, New Works, and Buildings - amounted to £672,088, and the amounts are now submitted in detail to obtain an appropriation of Parliament to cover the amount involved. </para>

                    <para>The expenditure on war services is almost wholly made up of an advance of £550,000 to the Trust Fund, Defence Clothing Material Account, for the purchase of cloth from the British Government.. In anticipation of liberal reinforcements for the Australian Imperial Force, large stocks of clothing were obtained, to be paid from the Loan Fund as the cloth was issued. But the expectations in regard to reinforcements were not realized, and, in the meantime, it was necessary to provide funds for payment to the British Government. It is anticipated that the amount will be repaid from the Trust Fund during the current financial year, and provision was made in the Estimates of revenue accordingly. </para>
                    <para>The balance of the expenditure for war services, namely, £7,931, is made up of additional temporary assistance, medical examinations, &amp;c. ; in connexion with War Pensions, £7,229; remission of Customs duties on goods imported for the personal use of prisoners of war, &amp;c, £633; and overpayments to estates of deceased soldiers, £69. </para>
                    <para>The expenditure on ordinary services is made up as follows :  - The Parliament, for a compassionate allowance and additional telephone services, £155 ; Prime Minister's Department£13,128, £1,518 of this amount represents salaries of Acting Public Service Inspectors in New South Wales, South Australia, and Western Australia. A corresponding saving has been made under the special appropriation for Public Service Inspectors' salaries. The balance of the amount is made up of temporary assistance, Audit Office, contingencies of the Prime Minister's Office and High Commissioner's Office and other miscellaneous services. Then, in the Treasury Department, the expenditure was £51,584. Owing to the abnormal conditions brought about by the war, it became necessary to purchase large stocks of paper for stamp printing and ordinary departmental printing. This necessitated advances totalling £22,447 to the Trust Fund; </para>
                    <para class="block">Stamp Printing Account, and Government Printer Account. The amount will be recovered when the paper is issued for consumption. </para>

                    <para>The Attorney-General's Department required for law costs, printing, &amp;c, an additional amount of £2,053; there were sundry small amounts in the Defence Department, totalling £3,148 ; for the Home and Territories Department, £58 ; and for the Department of the Navy, accounts totalling £5,346 were paid - including £5,000 advanced as a working credit to the Trust Fund, Wireless Workshops Account. The expenditure in the Department of Trade and Customs was £7,237, made up of - administration of Commerce Act, £2,612; temporary assistance, lighthouses, £2,182; sundry small' items, £2,443; total, £7,237. </para>
                    <para>The expenditure in the Department of Works and Railways was £20,208.

Already £3,297 has been recovered. </para>
                    <para>The expenditure in the Postmaster-General's Department was £11,240, which was made up of sundry amounts for mails, legal expenses, salaries, and miscellaneous items, a grand, total of £114,157. </para>

                        <para>.- The other day I made a statement concern ing the purchase by the Prime Minister of ships for the Commonwealth, to which the right honorable gentleman made a reply a day or two later. I am not going to traverse that reply. It is sufficient for me to' direct attention to the report of the Auditor-General, who says' that " no vouchers accounting for the purchase of the ships, nor for the London transactions since" have been submitted to him; and that "endeavours have been made in order to obtain these accounts through the Treasury." I ask the Treasurer whether the matter has come before him. </para>

The Prime Minister may claim that the transaction has been a great gain to the Commonwealth, but the Auditor-General tells us that, from the 30th September, 1916, to 30th June, 1917, the earnings of the ships in Australia were £92,114; and that, in addition, £69,825 had been remitted from the London office. These two sums total £161,939, and make up the whole earnings of the fleet at the date I have mentioned, the net profit, so far as Australia was concerned, being £19,384. </para>

                            <para>- The Auditor-General's report reveals what is nothing short of a scandal. Honorable members should have the fullest information regarding both the purchase of the ships and their earnings. I enter my protest against the manner in which the transaction has been carried out. The Auditor-General tells us that " it appears desirable that legislation should be effected to define the powers and functions of the general manager" of the Shipping Department of the Commonwealth. No such legislation has been introduced, nor has it been foreshadowed in the Ministerial statement. The Prime Minister's claim that the purchase of the ships was the crowning success of his life reminded me of the saying that - </para>

                        <para>.- We are entitled to learn from the Treasurer whether or not the receipts and expenditure in connexion with Commonwealth steamers are to appear in the "annual statement of accounts which is presented to Parliament. We should be in a position to find in the year's Estimates a subdivision containing the salaries of the chief officers who will administer the Shipping Department. It will give us some sort of control over these vessels, as we now have control over the Trade and Customs Department, the Commonwealth Railways, and other services in connexion with the Commonwealth. If this course is not to be followed, are the accounts of the Department to be something quite apart from the Treasury; are honorable members not to have any say whatever in regard to those who are employed in it ; are they not even to be called upon to vote the salary of the Controller ? </para>

The people of Queensland have shown at the recent election what they think of what the honorable member calls the " Ryan gang." We know what the Prime Minister is prepared to undertake in regard to the shipping business, and we know what he can do ; but we are not prepared to allow the Department to be controlled outside this House. We should have some supervision over the accounts of the Department,' and I hope the tame will come when we will have some reference to it on the annual Estimates. </para>

                    <para class="block">McDonald), I have not a great deal to say, because coming new to the job, as I do, they will absolve me from the necessity of making promises at this stage. However, I wish to give briefly my view as to what I think should be done, and as to what I shall endeavour to do. Both honorable members claim that a matter of such importance should be brought well within the purview of Parliament.. I hold the same view, and, no matter how the general expenditure on salaries or contingencies may be lumped into one sum, I consider that the salaries of the chief officers of the Department should be set out in the annual Estimates, so that they may be brought up for discussion here, enabling the whole policy of the Department to be open to the criticism of honorable members. In framing next year's Estimates, I hope to be able to do this. </para>
                    <para>The other question raised is whether or not we can have a statement of receipts and expenditure of an intelligible kind for submission to the House. I do not know whether the operations of this Department can be set out in the shape of an ordinary commercial balance-sheet, but it is my desire that statements of the operations of all the enterprises on which the Government have embarked should be submitted to honorable members, so that they may know during given periods what these concerns have been earning and spending. I shall endeavour to get the information for honorable members as early as possible. </para>

I wish to protest against the deportation of Italians possessing naturalization papers as British subjects. They are citizens of Australia, and are covered by the recent decision of the people of Australia twice recorded against conscription. Yet they are being taken by force from their homes and deported. </para>

                            <para>- A meeting waa held in the Socialists' Hall, Melbourne, where thousands assembled to protest against the deportation of Italians for military service, but the censorship was used by the press to prevent any word as to that meeting going out to the public. The same censorship has been used in regard to the " tabloid " speech which I made the other night upon this matter. The people of Australia, owing to the censorship, were prevented from knowing that my speech was dealing with the matter of the deportation of Italians. It was camouflaged by reporting me as making some remarks concerning an Allied country and the present .war. It cannot be denied that the Government have given orders to the press to suppress all reference to these matters. Italians, naturalized or unnaturalized, have been called upon by the Italian Government, aided and abetted by the Australian Government. </para>

                            <para>- The Government does recognise that claim, in so far as they have allowed the Italian Consul to call up men, although these men have produced their naturalization papers. Whether a man be naturalized or unnaturalized, if he has come to this country as a boy of, say, three or four years of age, has been brought up under our conditions, and is subject to our civil and criminal law, he should be protected by the Australian people who have protected themselves against conscription. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and on the ground of common humanity. My point is that the Australian people have exempted themselves, and yet. by an arrangement with one of the other countries concerned, a War Precautions Regulation is issued calling upon every Italian here liable to military service in Italy to report himself to the Consul under certain penalties. That War Precautions Regulation was subsequently amended so as to embrace all Allied countries. If this "is allowed to go on, the time will come when all Servians, Americans, Italians, and Frenchmen resident in Australia are drafted out against the wishes of the Australian people, as expressed at the two referenda, when no distinction was made between different classes. Then those who think with the Government will turn round and say that all the subjects of our Allies have been called upon, while the English, Scotch, and, possibly, in the near future, the Irish, conscripts are allowed to remain in Australia. In my opinion this action in regard to Allied subjects is simply the thin end of the wedge, and if the Australian .people sit down under it, then conscription, without any referendum or appeal to the people, will be carried out. When the anti-conscription majority has thus been broken down, and the English, the Irish, and the Scotch- </para>

The honorable member for Perth does not follow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George's statements very closely, or he would know that there is a considerable number of .Scotchmen and Englishmen residing in Ireland at the present time. At present we have the' Commonwealth Government working hand and glove with' Allied Governments to facilitate the deportation of Allied citizens. The Italians, of whom I am speaking, are paid 2d. per day as members of the Italian Army. The Prime Minister has told us that their dependants in Australia are receiving the separation allowance laid down for dependants of members of the Australian Imperial Force, namely, ls. 5d. a day for the adult, and 4id. per child, plus 2d. paid by a benevolent Italian Government. What is going to become of the 30,000 women and children who are dependent on the 6,000 odd Italian citizens eligible for military service? Will any honorable' member contend that the allowance I have mentioned will keep body and soul together? </para>

                            <para>- You can find that out at your leisure. I have a list of thirty-four of these Italians who live in and about Melbourne. All of them are possessed of property, and are suffering severely in consequence of the action taken by the Government. One of them possesses two- shops worth £600 at St. Kilda, and another a shop, valued at £250,0 in Carlisle-street. In the case of the latter he is forced to sell, and has been offered £87 for his property. An Italian at Nhill, Victoria, has been offered £700 for a business worth £2,500 ; a man at Northcote has received no offer at all for a property  worth £200, and the same has to be said of a property worth £500 at Richmond. For a property in Malvern-road, an Italian conscript has been offered £70 for a property worth £200. So the list goes on, offers of £60, £70, and £50 being made for properties and businesses worth £300 and £400. In these circumstances, the benevolent Australian Government offers to allow the dependants of these men ls. 5d. a day*, with 4jd. for each child. Then what about those Italians who have no property at all - t,he labouring class ? Their Australian wives, and their children born here, are left to subsist on the separation allowance. The Australian Government is saying that' voluntarism has been " nailed to the mast, " so far as Australian citizens are concerned; and what the Australians will not tolerate themselves we are compelling the people of Allied countries to accept. Unless adequate provision is made for the dependants of these men who are being " shanghaied " out of the country, they must become a tax on the general community, and it is a crying shame, and a disgrace to any country calling itself civilized, to perpetrate such an atrocity on helpless people. </para>

                    <para>Tn reply to a question as to whether Australian soldiers are being used for the purpose of arresting these conscripts, the Prime Minister told us that any necessary arrests are being made by the civil police and the Garrison Military Police., or by members of the District Guard. Thus we have the spectacle of the Italian Consul utilizing the governmental machinery of the people of Australia for the very Object against which we have most emphatically declared ourselves. Behind the people, per medium .of the War Precautions' Regulations .and Orders in Council, men are being "shanghaied" out of the country; and there is a policy of smother and hush manipulated by the present Administration, with the effect of absolutely preventing any publicity being given to the state of affairs. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is not very remarkable, because the Government are Prussianizing Australian citizens. By surreptitious alterations, of the War Precautions Regulations they have taken away the right of Australian citizen soldiers to be tried before a civil magistrate. The whole military system, against which Australians were supposed to be fighting overseas in order to keep it out of Australia, is being introduced through regulations issued by the present Government. Regulation 494, paragraph liv., provides for 'any trainee who neglects or- refuses to pay any penalty or fine for an offence against the Act and regulations, ' ' by order of the civil Court or by sentence, of court martial, &amp;c. ," and that has been amended by the addition of the words " or by award of a Commanding Officer." So that, it is no longer necessary to hale a lad before the civil magistrate and allow the prosecution to have the ordinary publicity. Too many lads were taken before the civil Court, and the public were beginning to know in that way what was- taking * place. That did not suit the military authorities, so the Government have by regulation altered the military system for the worse. Regulation 495 allows of the imposition of a sentence of three months' hard labour for any of the offences,, great and small, detailed in the preceding section. Nonpayment of- fines may therefore be severely punished by court martial. I pointed out in the House on another occasion how the lads in Broken Hill were being hauled before magistrates for the most trivial offences; but what sort of things will occur when these lads can be charged, not before a. civil Court which is adjudicating in the full light of day, but before their Commanding Officer, and without any publicity being given to the proceedings? The Government have also included absence from parade amongst the list of offences which a Commanding Officer is allowed to punish summarily. In future the Commanding Officer need not bother the magistrate to compel attendance at drill. All he has to do is to haul the delinquent before him and fine him, and, if he does not pay the fine, to sentence him to three months' hard labour. Prior to entering this Parliament I had an opportunity of travelling with a person who occupied a high position in the Australian Army Reserve, and I overheard him saying in conversation with another traveller that, it was necessary to tighten up the compulsory clauses of the Defence Act; but in the then existing state of public opinion it would not be wise to do that yet, because if the matter came, before Parliament the people would probably insist on wiping out the compulsory clauses.  His  policy is now being carried out under the cloak of secrecy. The press is muzzled ; magistrates are not to be allowed to deal with offences, but the military officers are to be given power to strike terror into the hearts of the lads they are drilling and intimidate, them so that they will become blind tools in the hands of employers. It is about, time that honorable members told the Government in no uncertain .way that they will not allow any more of this monkeying with the rights of Australian citizens. Wie are daily being assured of the necessity of maintaining the liberties that we possess in this country, while at the same time, in a hole-and-corner manner, the Government are amending regulations in order to interfere with the rights, of the people. Through the medium of the sausage-machine regulations they are turning out night and day, every vestige of liberty possessed by the Australian people prior to the war is slowly but surely disappearing. I have taken this opportunity of ventilating the interference with the rights and liberties of young Australians who are being trained under the compulsory clauses of the Defence Act, and the outrage perpetrated on the dependants of Italians, who are being forcibly deported .from this country at the request of a foreign Government, and I hope that honorable members will not allow this state of things to continue. </para>

                        <para>. - I rise to enter another protest against what is taking place in connexion with the censorship. I hold the galley slips of a weekly newspaper which has been continuously published in Brisbane for nearly thirty years. These are proofs of reprinted articles that appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Daily Standard,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Rockhampton Record,</inline> and other papers, but the censor would not allow them to be published in the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> presumably because they reflect upon the conduct of the Government in connexion with the war. The original purpose of the censorship regulations - and it is still being placarded- was to prevent information of value to the enemy being published. That was a good and sufficient reason, and, so long as the censorship was confined to that purpose nobody could, or did, complain of it. But the censorship has been applied for - a very different purpose, and, although members on the Government side may deny that there is any political censorship, I ask them what construction the ordinary man in the street can place upon the interference that is taking place with the press. Evidence such as I possess must provoke the opinion that the censorship is being imposed solely for political purposes. I hope the Government do not regard themselves as superior to criticism; but one would think that they regarded themselves as sacrosanct, when they refuse to allow a reputable newspaper like the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> to criticise their actions. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; and the censor has made a red mark through the three galley slips. This is not an uncommon happening. Honorable members have repeatedly quoted and exhibited specific examples of information that appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> being refused publication in such papers as the <inline font-style="italic">Woman Vater</inline> and the journals published by the workers. Articles published in a number of newspapers that were favorable to the Government were not allowed to appear in the Labour press. We know that the Government have no very kindly feeling towards Labour newspapers or Labour members, but they must recognise that Labour members have some standing in the community by reason of their positions in this House as representatives of the people. If only one side is to be heard in politics, and only favorable criticism in connexion with the doings of the Government is to be given publicity, it would be better for the Government to close down altogether those newspapers which are hostilely critical, rather than to strangle them slowly by means of the censorship. </para>

The fact of the censorship being so severe on the Labour papers is hindering recruiting. The people say, " We are allowed to know only one side.

                            <para>- I am prepared to risk it. The Prime Minister does a lot of funny things, and very unfair things; but, perhaps, this would be a bit beyond even his limits. There is a feeling of dissatisfaction and unrest in the mind of the community caused by the belief that one side is being unfairly and unduly penalized. After all, criticism is most valuable in a democratic community, and criticism of the Government and governmental administration is a healthy sign of progress. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, in a lecture on one occasion, said the war was always the subject of proper criticism, and that the administration of defence by the Government was particularly a proper subject for public criticism. It is only by criticism and discussion in public of public affairs that we have been able to arrive at our present state of political advancement. It would be to the advantage of the Government, and of our conduct of the war, if the censorship was confined strictly to the purposes for which it was originally imposed. This would remove a considerable amount of ill-feeling. Another unfortunate proceeding is the raiding of premises and the seizure of private property by the military. A number of institutions are being branded as ' disloyal, but loyalty and disloyalty are almost interchangeable terms, because what one man considers disloyalty another may just as conscientiously believe to be the most intense exhibition of loyalty. The man to-day who is the Prime Minister of the Empire, and considered a shining example of enthusiastic patriotism, was at one time looked on as one of the most disloyal men in the community. On one occasion he had to disguise himself to escape from the wrath of the loyal mob. I have received a letter from the secretary of the Irish National Association of Queensland, in which the following appears : - </para>

I put no obstacle in the way as to my own property being examined.

                    <para class="block">That discloses a condition of affairs that no Minister can justify. The society was established many years ago for patriotic, social, and friendly purposes. Its loyalty has never been challenged. It is not by any means a political association, and includes men of all shades of opinion. There are a number of - Labour men in it, but I know quite a number of antiLabour men who are enthusiastic members of it. Why did the Government think it necessary to do the things described by the secretary? The Government were very busy for a while in connexion with the Industrial Workers of the World's rooms. In my opinion, there was mighty little justification for that, and now they are extending their attentions to the Irish Association. I wonder if they will try that sort of thing on the Caledonian Society? There are a number of Labour men in it, and there are a number of the other side also. What about the rooms of the St. George's Society? Of course, the 'Welsh Society is protected by the overshadowing power of the Prime Minister, but I have no doubt you could find the Government's brand of disloyalty in that, and even in the St. George's Society, if you wanted to. Disloyalty of the same kind could be found, I believe, even in the Caledonian Society. I will guarantee to find in any church evidences of what the Government regard as disloyalty. After all, what are we loyal or disloyal to ? No matter what our connexion with outside institutions  may bo, I believe, that we are all loyal to Australia. Once that is established, the opinions of Australians in regard to anything else are of very little importance in comparison. Are Ministers going to continue this method of carrying on the war? To what extent has the raiding of premises helped them in their programme of winning the war? By what possible extension of this power, or the seizing of papers, or the holding of property, are they going to add one soldier to the Empire, or increase the strength of the ' Allies by a single ounce ? Will it shorten the war by one day? Will it save the life of one Australian soldier or bring peace nearer? If the Government can show that it will do any of these things, and give their justification for it, I will support them; but every one knows that instead of helping forward a better state of things it is "hindering it. Members opposite talk about restoring harmony and good feeling, and burying the hatchet. The Prime Minister says, "Let bygones be bygones."

                    <para class="block">The Prime Minister is willing to co-operate with us, and invites us to join him by agreeing to the Nationalists' programme. We are in favour of winning the war, but we do not support the methods of the' Government. Our very existence as a party is conditioned on the fact that we are opposed to the political policy of the Prime Minister. How can we be expected to join him while such things as I have mentioned continue to happen ? We have appealed to the Government over and over again during the last three years to justify their actions, or to stop what we complain of. A tremendous amount of irritation has been caused by what they are doing. This dates from the time when the Prime Minister began to talk about conscription. One might, have thought that, having discovered the mind of Australia on that matter, and, knowing the heart-burning and disturbance that he had caused, the right honorable gentleman would not have dragged the matter up twice. While he has been preaching peace, and holding in one hand the laurel wreath, in his other hand he has concealed a dagger, with which he is prepared to kill his friends, and with which he has already inflicted on them some very severe stabs. If honorable members desire that Australia shall put forth her full energy as a united country, as she should do at a time like this, they should try to eliminate the causes of irritation and division. Australia cannot be united politically, socially, morally, and economically while the Government persist in their censorship and military dictatorship, and the sooner that is recognised the better. The Government should satisfy the people that there are good reasons for what censorship is exercised, and that that censorship is not political; and to get the best out of Australia, now and in the future, We must find out the principles on which we can agree and the methods on which we can come to a mutual understanding. Are we to believe that Ministers are in earnest about securing harmony, or are they concerned merely with their own political interests? </para>

                            <para>- That is a satisfactory statement. Even after three and a half years of war, an improvement in administration will be acceptable. It might amount to an admission that mistakes have been made, but, the man who never admits that he makes mistakes seldom does anything else. According to the prayer book, we all " do those things we ought not to have done and leave undone those things we ought to have done." It is for the Government to cease from doing the things that they have been doing and to do the things that they have not been doing. This will take them a long way in the direction of good administration, and I hope that the Postmaster-General will endeavour to induce his colleagues to try to bring about peace and good-will in the community by removing the causes of irritation and misunderstanding. </para>

                        <para>- I mean as to the purchase. Merchants are making their purchases, and' it is rumoured that the Government propose to acquire all the jute of next season, and to adopt a method of distribution through agents. I am not so much interested on behalf of the merchants - who, however, ought to be treated fairly - as I am concerned for the primary producers. We certainly do not desire to have the same conditions as were experienced last year, or even such as now prevail in Western Australia, where there is such a shortage of bags as to seriously interfere with work in the country. Of course, these troubles are bound to occur; and we desire to know the intentions of the Government, so that those interested may take what steps they deem necessary under the circumstances. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister who for some time will control this House a matter which, I think, he would do well to personally consider. I suggest that the Government should invite the co-operation of men who are prepared to volunteer their services, without charge, in the administration of repatriation at head-quarters. There are many young fellows at present engaged in .the work, and earnestly doing their best; but I think that in the case of returned men who are called upon, at ages varying from twenty to thirty, -to enter into new walks of life, the assistance and advice of older men are required. I say nothing against the young men who are there now, but we require- the services of a number of experienced and sagacious men who have themselves been successful in life.  </para>

Speaking from memory of some weeks ago, I think the request of the Auditor-General was for some considerable number of temporary clerks to do auditing; and the view of the Department and the Minister was that so important a function should not be discharged by such employees at low salaries. </para>

                        <para>- It is costing a large sum, but increasing expenditure must mean increased cost of auditing. The chief difficulty was to obtain the services of competent and trustworthy men for so important and confidential a function; and the Auditor-General recommended the engagement of men at about11s. a day. This, as I say, the Minister did not consider desirable. I shall endeavour to see whether the views of those concerned cannot be harmonized in the near future. </para>
