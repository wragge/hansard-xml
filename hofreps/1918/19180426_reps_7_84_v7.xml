As to whether the Government is in a position to inform honorable members exactly of the war position of Australia, I cannot say at the present moment. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> is interested in the same question.

                        <para>- Some months ago, I addressed a question to the Postmaster-General in regard to members of organizations alone securing the benefit of awards made under the Commonwealth (Public Service) Arbitration Act. The honorable gentleman was then good enough to say that he had the matter under consideration. I now desire to know whether he has since passed a regulation, or whether he has one in contemplation, with a view to removing the preference thus granted to members of organizations alone? </para>

                        <para>- So far as the removal of the provision granting preference to members of a Public Service association is concerned, nothing has been done in the matter. But something has been done in connexion with another aspect of the question, which is due largely to the character of the law we are operating as compared with the law which applies to arbitration in connexion with outside employment. There has been a tendency in the Department to rope in all the supervising officers - all the men in control of branches - and thus to put them in the position of having to serve two masters. In order to safeguard the interests of the Department and of the public, a regulation has now been passed intimating that these officers will not suffer materially by reason of their not belonging to the union. </para>

The Chief Railways Commissioner of New South Wales has not referred to a postage stamp in connexion with the carriage of our mails, and such an exaggeration only evidences the amount of sincerity that is behind the question. In regard to the observation made by that officer in respect of defective mail bags, I say it is inevitable, when thousands of bags are being despatched daily, that some will get into disrepair in the course of transit.

                    <para>. - As  chairman  of the Committee whose final report has just been presented, I should like to say a few words in commendation of the splendid work done by my colleagues. My own position was a sinecure, but I feel that the thanks of Australia are due to the distinguished members of the medical profession who sat on the Committee, for the great work they have performed. They were most assiduous and devoted to their duties, and I was surprised to find that men so eminent in their profession were prepared to devote so much of their valuable time to this work. From all parts of the world letters in commendation of our reports have been received, and the excellence of the results secured from our inquiries has been emphasized in many quarters. Letters of appreciation have been received from, amongst others, Professor <inline font-weight="bold">Sir W.</inline> Osier, Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alfred</inline> Keogh, Surgeon-General to the British Army. In the <inline font-style="italic">Lancet</inline> of 21st April, 1917, there appeared a very appreciative article on the report of the Committee upon tuberculosis in Australia, and in the American <inline font-style="italic">Survey</inline> for 17th November, 1917, there was published an article by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Louis</inline> I. Dublin, of the Metropolitan Life Assurance Company, in which it was urged that the United States of America could profit from our experience, and that our reports recounted a remarkable achievement in the community control of disease. The thanks of this Parliament are due to the medical men who constituted this Committee. </para>

                    <para>.- When the debate was adjourned last evening, I had reached that portion of the Ministerial statement of policy in which the shipping proposals of the Government are outlined. I hold that the Government made a mistake in their proposals to the unions with regard to piece-work and the dilution of labour, inasmuch as the shipping requirements of Australia will undoubtedly prove a post-war problem. That is one reason why I object to the action of the Government in seeking to impose certain restrictions upon the unions interested in the ship-building industry. The time has arrived when the Common-' wealth should own and control the marine service along the Australian coast. It is just as important that we should have a State-owned marine service as that we should have State control of railways. If there is one question more than another that has troubled the best minds of the world, more particularly in dealing with the matter of high prices, it is the adequate control of the means of transport. We are capable of producing in Australia far more than we have so far done; but we have never been able to properly cope with the problem of providing an effective service as between the producer and the consumer. The proper control of the means of transport is most important. Our experience is that those who own and control our shipping have enormously increased freights, and, by so doing, in many cases have led to the prices for our products being greatly increased. The benefit of these enhanced prices is not enjoyed by the man on the soil, and I think the Government will be compelled before long to take over and control all Inter-State shipping. We have our own Navy, and we could not have a better training ground for the future men and officers of our Navy than would be provided by a Commonwealth-owned Inter-State marine service. A sailor or a marine officer cannot be trained as quickly as you can teach a man to handle a rifle and do the " goose-step." Likewise the building of merchant ships will keep our dockyards busy when vessels of waT are not being built, and in that way we will keep in Australia a large body of men well equipped for constructing vessels of destruction should the necessity arise for building them. During the 1914 election, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> who was then leader of the party to which I belong, advocated very strongly the establishment of a line of Commonwealth-owned steamers, and one thing he spoke of was the urgent need for providing a Commonwealth shipping service to Tasmania, so that the inhabitants of that island might have cheap transport to and from the mainland, not only for their awn produce shipped to Australia, but also for the goods purchased by them on the mainland. The Commonwealth builds railway lines to provide facilities for the public, why should it not build merchant vessels for the same purpose! Those people who have occasion to ship their produce from one State to the other, if they were asked the question, would agree with me that the solution of the InterState transport problem lies with the Commonwealth Parliament. However, as I shall have another opportunity of ventilating this matter, I shall not proceed with it any further at this stage. </para>

                <para>I suppose that every honorable member . in this House has been in correspondence with the Defence Department at some time or other on the matter of deferred pay for members of the A.I.F. who have returned to Australia, and been discharged. In some cases returned soldiers have not received their deferred pay until two years after their discharge. I cannot understand how this delay occurs, seeing that in New Zealand, according to information given to me by a returned New Zealand soldier, who has been on a visit to Australia, the deferred pay is seldom delayed for more than two or three months. The soldiers cannot understand how it is that the amount of deferred pay they receive differs so much from the calculations they have made as to the amount which should come to them. No explanation is offered, except it be that which I have heard from one returned soldier. He was in Harefield Hospital, but by the good services of a friend he was able to go to London, and when there he went dawn to Horseferry-road, and asked for his pay-book to be made up. He found a number of items in red ink in it, but he assures me that not one of those should have been debited to him, and as he was a pugnacious sort of fellow, he said "damn" in such a loud voice that every one in the office could hear him. One officer approached him, and said, " Dear friend, do not make so much noise here " ; but he replied, "You would make just as much noise if you were robbed." The officer got quite nervous about it, and left him alone. The man went back to Harefield Hospital, but as soon as he was sufficiently strong he took another trip to London, and went once more to Horseferry-road, and had another "go in" with the Pay Branch there.  His  persistence and his knowledge that he was right enabled him to get his book made up in such a way that it made a difference of £12 13s. 'in his deferred pay- </para>
                <para>We know that there have been defalcations in the Pay Office - not a great deal has come to light, possibly there has not (been sufficient evidence to enable convictions to be secured, but, in the light of our knowledge, we can quite understand that there might be something similar in regard to the deferred pay; and until the cause of the difficulty is removed, suspicion must lie on those who control the payments. I . have written one or two sharp letters on the matter, but I might just as well be pouring water into Sydney Harbor with the idea of filling it up. </para>
                <para class="block">Next week, when I have  some time 'to spare, I shall go down to the Defence Department and see whether or not I can get any satisfaction in regard to the matter. </para>

                        <para>- The taxation per inhabitant of Australia for &gt;waT expenditure is not more than ls. in the JE1. The money which we are spending on the waT is derived from war loans, and they cannot last for ever; there is a limitation on out capacity to borrow money in this way. We have just raised £43,000,000, and in September next we are to ask for another £40,000,000. What we have done in the direction of borrowing money for war purposes in Australia is marvellous. Evidently some people are doing well. The honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett),</inline> if he would let us into his secrets, could mention some persons who are doing very well indeed. I think every honorable member should give consideration to the fact that, while the war is in progress, something' more should be contributed from taxation to our war expenditure. Our present method is simply financial muddling, a policy of boom, borrow, and burst. That is a policy which we should abandon, and, as soon as possible, endeavour to make the time to come as easy as practicable for the citizens geneally. I know that a man in my position, who advocates more war taxation, is not likely to become popular; the man who desires to be popular in this House, or in the country&gt; must be a tax dodger, and not one who calls upon the people to assist in placing the finances on a proper footing. </para>

                        <para>- If I had time at my disposal, I should be able to answer the question. I am quite sincere in the opinions I have expressed regarding the finances, which present the most serious question to which we could direct our attention. Only the Government can deal with it; no honorable member has the power to submit a motion here in regard to the finances, which, quite rightly, are in the hands of those who have the control of public affairs. I suggest that a Committee of this House, or some other body, should be instituted to solve the financial problems which now confront us, and, above all, we should meet as much of the war expenditure as possible during the progress of the war. I do not suppose that the Government will keep the House together very long, but I hope they will prove their sincerity in the matter of recruiting, and devise some machinery by which honorable members may be enabled to appeal to the young men of Australia to defend the country we all love so much. </para>

                    <para>.- I know there is a desire to close the debate shortly, and I shall not detain honorable members more than a few moments. The Ministerial statement contains matter that may be dealt with on a subsequent occasion, when the Budget is before us, and I desire to refer to only one or two items. First, however, I must express the pleasure I feel at the fact that Australia is to be adequately represented at the Imperial Conference. Questions of grave and momentous importance, such as the retention or otherwise of the German possessions in the Pacific, international relations, and the knitting of those bonds which we believe are essential to the future integrity of . the Empire, must be discussed before the time for peace negotiations arrives, and, most appropriately, on such an occasion as that presented by an Imperial Conference. </para>

                <para>In the Ministerial statement there are two main departures from ordinary policy as followed by this Parliament. One is the handing over of certain businesses and trading organizations largely to the control of business men from out- side. How far that is a derogation of Ministerial responsibility only time will prove. I counsel Ministers to be very careful how far they relinquish to outside Boards or bodies that responsibility which belongs to them alone, as the representatives of the people. This problem will require very careful handling, otherwise we shall find ourselves governed by extraneous bureaucracies rather than by Parliament through Ministerial responsibility. </para>
                <para>As to the Advisory Council of Science, we are told that when in full operation it will probably mean an annual expenditure of £500,000 or £600,000. That, of course, is serious; and I hope that those who form the preliminary Board will consider the line of demarcation between real research work and that experimentation which alone can prove research work to be of any value. There seems to be an idea that we can conduct a great bureau on similar lines to those adopted in the United States of America; but that is impossible under our Constitution. The Commonwealth can do little more than enter upon research work, and leave the results to be proved by experiment, especially in the case of primary production. In the United States of America, Congress owns two-thirds of the land, and is able, in conjunction with the States, to carry Out great experimental works connected with the bureaux of scientific research, and so prove the utility and commercial value of the latter. In Australia, especially in relation to primary industries, we can only be successful by working in conjunction with the States; and I hope the Council will at once place itself in communication with the various State Agricultural Departments, in order to bring about the necessary co-operation. It is in this connexion that we are likely to make a mistake. The States own the land; and I do not think it is possible, even in the case of secondary industries, to prove the value of scientific investigation, unless the Council and the Government take into their confidence the various trade organizations and industries, with a view to the practical testing of the research results. I hope the Government will go slowly in the policy of building up a great Department, which may mean an expenditure of £500,000 or £600,000 per year without any return of practical value. </para>
                <para>I am glad to see that the various Pools instituted by the Prime Minister are to be distributed amongst other Ministers. Whether it is advisable to have three Ministers for the purpose of controlling these Pools, in addition to calling in. outside business men to advise, only experience can prove. I hope it will be shown ' that the Ministers recently appointed are capable of developing the various Pools in the direction of giving proper representation to the primary producers. So far we have had a Wheat Pool, a Butter Pool, and a Wool Pool. The Wheat Pool has do'ne first class work; and, on behalf of the wheat-growers in a constituency that probably produces more wheat than any other constituency in Australia, I desire to say that they regard the Pool as being the only possible means of handling and financing the wheat during the war. But the trouble is that' the Wheat Pool has been administered in such a way that it has remained stationary; the Pool brought into existence in the first place is the Wheat Pool we have to-day.  The growers' representation has not been increased as it should have been, and the operations of the Pool have not been given such publicity as would be calculated to increase the confidence of the growers in the handling of their product. Greater publicity ought to be given to the operations of the various Pools, particularly the Wheat Pool. There should be some channel of communication between the Pool, , the growers, and the public of Australia that would keep the people acquainted from day to day with what was being done, and would assure the growers that the business was being managed satisfactorily in the interests of the wheat-growing industry as a whole. That can be done only by giving the widest possible representation to the growers, and the various other commercial elements interested in the disposal of the wheat. If we are to have a Wheat Pool controlled by the Government on behalf of the growers and financed on the credit of the whole Commonwealth, it is only right that every great interest should be represented. Those who finance the Pool should have some say in the management; indeed, in the interests of the national credit and the people generally, every section of the community that helps to make the Pool a success should have some voice in its control. But the growers who are chiefly interested should be given greater representation, and there should be a more direct channel of communication between the Board, the growers, and the public generally. Statements which have been made at various times have helped perhaps to impair the confidence of the growers in the Wheat Pool. The Advisory Council of the Wheat Board is declared by many growers to be not altogether the kind of Council that should have been appointed in order to deal with the wheat. J understand that that Council is composed of men who were formerly in the wheat business, and who, although they are advisers to the Wheat Board, are also contractors under the various State Wheat Boards in connexion with the handling of wheat. It is also stated that they have some say in the disposal of the wheat on the London market. It does not seem right that men who are receivers and contractors under the various State Boards should also be advisers to the Central Wheat Board, and should have any voice in regard to the disposal of the commodity on the London market. This matter calls for investigation, and we should have from the Minister in charge a statement showing that he has inquired into the matter thoroughly, and that there will be some reconstruction of the Board at an early date in order to allay the concern of the growers and insure that confidence in the operation of the Pool which alone can lead to success. I believe the Minister for Trade and Customs, as a business man, should be able, with the advice of the Assistant Ministers, to handle this question efficiently. I had an opportunity of sitting with him on the Commission which investigated the financial position of Tasmania in relation to the. Commonwealth, and which recommended that £1,000,000 should be paid to the State by the Commonwealth Parliament. As  chairman  of the Commission, he showed that he had a good deal of business ability, and I do not see why he should not be able, with the help of the Assistant Ministers, to arrange a reconstitution of the Board with a view to increasing its efficiency, giving greater representation to the growers, and wider publicity to the operations of the Pool in order to give greater confidence to wheat producers generally. </para>
                <para>There is one other matter to which I wish to refer, and I bring it forward because it has been mentioned in the wheat-growing districts, and published in the press, and because I think it is due to the growers that the matter should be cleared up. The whole success of the Wheat Pool depends on the quantity of freight we can secure to carry our wheat to the markets of the world. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clement</inline> Giles, who is a member of the Central Wheat Board, and consequently occupies an important position in connexion with the Wheat Pool, has stated that, just before the formation of the Pool, and after the Commonwealth had assumed sole control of the chartering of all vessels for the carriage of wheat overseas, 1,000,000 tons of freight waB offered in London to those who were acting as charterers on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, and that offer was refused. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Giles</inline> made that statement in my constituency, and it has been brought forward in the South Australian Parliament. This House is entitled to be satisfied that every investigation has been made by the Government into such a direct statement made by a gentleman who holds a responsible position on the Wheat Board.

                            <para>- That is so. They were appointed much earlier - in July or August of 1915 - and it is during that period that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .Giles</inline> states that 1,000,000 tons of freight was offered for 75s. per ton to the Commonwealth Government, and refused by them. In view of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Giles</inline> occupies a position as a member of the Central Wheat Board, has made a direct statement, and, in reply to the denial of that statement by the Prime Minister, has written to say that he is prepared to give the name of his informant, I submit that the matter cannot be allowed to rest where it is. It is due to this House and the country that the earliest opportunity should be given for the fullest inquiry into <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Giles'</inline> statement, so that the matter may be satisfactorily cleared up. It is of importance, because we  were informed .that it was only by pressure brought to bear by the Imperial Government on the shipping  companies  that it was possible for us to place the wheat we had at that time from the 1915-16 harvest on the markets of the world. </para>

                        <para>.- The. debate has proceeded upon an amendment submitted to the motion for the printing of the Ministerial statement proposing the addition of words expressing the view that the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy cannot represent Australian public opinion in London because of the speeches of the Prime Minister at and in relation to the Paris Conference, the repudiation, at two referendums, of the war policy of the Ministry, and their conduct of public affairs in Australia. I have consistently fought the Prime, Minister ever since he deceived  us  when the Watson Government were in power. He attended a meeting of 'the Central Executive of the Trades Hall Council in Melbourne, and was accompanied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> and . the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor.</inline> At that meeting he informed those present that the Labour executives of New South Wales and Queensland had agreed to give Liberal candidates freedom from opposition if they supported the Watson Government until the end of that Parliament. The assurance he gave us to that effect .was absolutely false, and we were fooled by his trickery into the passing of a resolution, which I either moved or seconded, pledging the Labour party not to oppose at the next election Liberal candidates who were prepared to support the Watson Government. The Prime Minister asked us to keep the matter secret, and he subsequently left for Sydney. He did not tell the Trades Hall Executive in Sydney how he had lied to us, but he pointed to the resolution which we had carried, and informed the Sydney executive  that the Victorian executive had agreed that the Labour party should grant immunity to Liberal candidates supporting the Watson Government at the coming election. He asked the Labour -organizations of New South Wales to join with us in the matter, so that we might, at the election, exclude the supporters of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook.</inline> Honorable members may be interested to know that the members of the Sydney "Labour executive were either better Democrats than we were, or knew the Prime Minister better, because they turned the proposal down. The period of secrecy  passed, and ten days later we discovered how we had been tricked and deceived, and from that time forth I have never taken the word of the Prime Minister, in Caucus or anywhere else. </para>

I. should like to say that I have never wilfully wronged any man, dead or alive. If I have been shown that I have wronged a man, I have been glad to withdraw any statement I may have made. I remind honorable members that, owing to the infernal way in which the censorship is exercised, the representatives of the press are not permitted to say that the Prime Minister has left Australia. He is following the very bad example which he set on his last visit to Great Britain, when he imperilled the lives of every man, woman, and child travelling by a mail steamer by saying that he intended to proceed to England in that steamer. On the strength of the statements he made, public receptions were arranged for him at Adelaide and at Albany. He arrived in Sydney and then doubled back, got into a motor launch, climbed on board an American steamer, and went <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> America to the Old Country. No newspaper dared say that he had done this.  His  actions placed in jeopardy the lives of every man, woman, and child who left by the mail steamer. Then, how did he slink back to Australia ? Certainly not like a man and the Prime Minister of this Commonwealth. He came back in a transport carrying wounded men. Even the brutal German system, dominated as it is by the cursed Prussian militarism, would scarcely countenance the wilful destruction of a ship carrying wounded men 12,000 miles away from the fighting* line. But the Prime Minister broke international law by crawling back to Australia on a transport carrying wounded men. There is not a man in this Chamber who will claim that the Prime Minister is a man of his word. No man or woman outside will do so. At none of the big meetings I have addressed have I found any man or woman prepared to say that he has kept his promises. No parents in Australia would dream of bringing their children up under the same moral code which would justify the" breaking of their word and their pledge. What has the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> to say about this man, who is going to represent Australia at the Imperial Conference? In the issue of the 17th January, speaking of the Prime Minister, the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> says - </para>

                    <para class="block">And so it is. Has not the sun burst on the horizon of Australia, in the West, where there were only three carrying the flag of Labour, whereas they came back over 200 per cent. additionally strong? Rising towards the early morn, have we forgotten what Queensland has taught us with that magnificent victory against all the forces of the powerful press - the money combines, especially the Colonial Sugar Company? Thousands of pounds were spent, but the people of Queensland sent back to power the man who had proved his honesty in London when he was tempted with all the foTce and power of the Northcliffe press, whispering to him that he would be the second man in Australia if only he would support <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hu.gh.es</inline> in the malign influence which he came back here to promulgate. But he threw it on one side, and bravely crossed the Atlantic rather than return, as in the case of our Prime Minister, in a transport carrying wounded soldiers. And so comes the noonday, with Adelaide's Labourites going out, four in number, and returning with increase of 350 per cent. So, too, will the evening arrive, when the Commonwealth Government and the party opposite dare to face the electors. Honorable members were in the House when I offered the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cook)</inline> the chance of putting up a fight in a capital city; or, if not he, then his leader. I made my offer so that they might do that here in Melbourne. And, what is more, if any other Ministers along that bench care to take up the gauntlet, I shall be going to my committee to-morrow night, and I will tell them that I desire again to make this offer. Then let us see if any of these gentlemen will care or dare to accept. </para>

And I may say that there aTe some very bloodthirsty men masquerading amongst us in clerical garb and starched collars - men who do not forget to quote, " Thou 3halt not kill," but with respect to whom it would be more appropriate were they to omit the negative and say, " Thou shalt kill." I would not mind that so much, either, so long as they were devoting attention to an enemy who was carrying a weapon in his hand. I trust that all good Presbyterians have read the <inline font-style="italic">Messenger</inline> of 18th January, 1918,. for if that does not contain a strong indictment of the Prime Minister, then, at any rate,' I have never, seen the like surpassed.

He did resign, and, on the plea that no other Government was available - a false plea - he is back in office again, and swallows his solemn pledge with a coolness which is only equalled by Germany's famous maxim about " the scrap of paper." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is now on a level with BethmannHollweg, and we wish him joy of the company he. has chosen. The members of his Cabinet snare in the glory, for they made the pledge a party pledge, and are accessories both before and after the fact. </para>

                    <para>I accuse the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cook)</inline> with having screened Angliss, a supplier of diseased meat to our unfortunate soldiers. I asked the other day if the attention of the Government had been drawn to a complaint that putrid pork was sold, recently, to an unfortunate woman in South Melbourne. The lick-spittle municipal councillors, when they found that the case was against a wealthy man, issued instructions for the withdrawal of the summons. This matter, however, is going to be brought up again, and I hope, when the time arrives; that the ratepayers of South Melbourne will deal with these lick-spittle municipal representatives who were not manly enough to prosecute a man for selling vile and filthy food. What medical man would willingly eat meat diseased with hydatids such as was served to our troops ? I regret very much that the Minister for the Navy, by his attitude, screened a man guilty of such conduct, and that owing to the difficulty I had in obtaining answers to my questions, a slur was cast upon the Melbourne City Council, the impression being that the diseased meat had left the City Abattoirs. Members of that body did all they could to remove the impression, and the  chairman  of the Abattoirs Committee wrote several letters to me, denying the charge so far as it relates to the Melbourne Abattoirs, stating that bullocks' liver is never sent out from those abattoirs for human food. I have no enmity against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Angliss</inline> at all, but when friends told me' that if I dared to speak out publicly on this subject he would take action and make me insolvent, I took up the challenge. I do not say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Angliss</inline> willingly allowed diseased liver to go out from his premises, for just the same reason that while I know honorable members opposite must have money in their pockets I could not prove it. That is the difference between knowledge and proof. What I said was that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Angliss</inline> knew that diseased meat went out from his premises, hanging on the. nearest lamp-post would be too good for him. </para>

                            <para>- Very well, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I shall put it on the notice-paper in the usual form. I realize that your ruling is quite correct, and I have no desire to contravene it. Honorable members, however, will have an opportunity of reading the resolution. Australia rejected the conscription proposals of the Government, and I now enter my protest against the action of the Government in placing a military officer at the disposal of the 'Consul for Italy to arrest those Italian residents who, owing to an unfortunate accident, were born in Italy, and have not become naturalized in Australia. This action is merely an indirect way of conscripting Australian citizens. In my communications with the Italian Consul I have found him to be a highly educated gentleman in every sense of the word. As Consul representing a country that conscripts its men he is, I suppose, obliged to obey instructions; but I protest against Australian soldiers being compelled to carry out the law on his behalf and conscript Italian residents who have not become naturalized iu Australia. These men should have an opportunity of joining our battalions as volunteers. They would then get a fair wage, and would know that their dependants would receive proper treatment. They came here to escape the cursed military system of their own country, and should not be dragged back as conscripts, and while I will always honour a man who in the richness of his red blood offers to go out to fight for Australia, I would never tolerate the damnable military system which the Prussians have placed upon Germany. </para>

Would this Commonwealth Government then be expected to drag every Englishman, Scotchman, Welshman, and Irishman out of Australia with Australian soldiers ? If they attempted, to do anything like that I think they would find that they had bitten off more than they could chew. In connexion with the position in Ireland, let me read for the information of honorable members a cablegram which appeared in the Melbourne </para><para>

                        of the 3rd March, as follows: -
                    </para><para>Newspaper correspondents report the countrywide agitation intensifies daily. The <inline font-style="italic">Westminster Gazette's</inline> correspondent states : - " The  Ulsterites  no longer pretend to support enlistment. A unique spectacle was witnessed at  Ballycastle,  County Antrim, where Orangemen, Hibernians and Sinn Feiners, wearing the insignia of their respective organizations, jointly marched in a procession as a protest. The bands alternatively played "Boyne Water" and Nationalist airs. ' </para><para class="block">I deeply regret the position created -by the Conservative oligarchy in England, where only one man in every six is entitled to vote; where the franchise is the most retrograde in the world - not even excepting Turkey, China, and Japan - and where titles are sold in the vilest way.It is reassuring, however, to know that within the last few days a democratic note" has been struck by the report of the Committee appointed to advise on the proposed amendment of the Constitution for the House of Lords. At present no man is allowed to sit for examination for the diplomatic service unless he has £400 a year, free from any claim upon it. Fancy a young man of eighteen with an income of £400 ! Notwithstanding my wide acquaintanceship. I do not know a young man so situated. When, perhaps, by the kindness of his father or some other relative, a young man can claim his possession of a fortune, and sit for examination, his advance must depend on Court favoritism, and the favoritism of people iu the higher ranks of life, perhaps persons of the <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Cornwallis-West</inline> type. Vile as is the military system of Germany, it is not so bad as this. I resent strongly the fact that the aristocratic Government of Great Britain did not make an appeal to the Irish race. I speak as the son of an English mother who loved her and loves the country from which she sprang, though hating and loathing its franchise laws. The Irish, like the Celtic Welsh and Scotch, are a generous race. Why have they not been given Home Rule? When they have got Home Rule, it will be, "Well, brothers, come and help us in the fight for liberty. You have joined in that fight in every country to which your people have gone, and you will surely help us against the accursed despotism of Prussia." If I am any judge of the race from which I am proud to have taken my name, there will be a larger number of men sent to fight under the voluntary system than can be obtained by any method of compulsion. However, an agreement has been made that the amendment should be put to the vote this afternoon, and I shall never willingly break a fair agreement. But I desire, on the moving of the adjournment, to take advantage of the forms of the House to continue my speech. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is now read by thousands, in place of the hundreds who once read it, and I hope that such readers will turn to the adjournment debate for a continuation of my present v remarks. In taking this course I take no unfair advantage. I am willing that a division should be taken now. My speech will not affect the result of that division. In twenty-eight years of political experience I have never known a speech in Parliament to convert one member who heard it. I once questioned on the subject that grim old man who used to dominate the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> - would that his spirit were here now, then we should have protection and the referendum - and he could not give me an instance of such a conversion, nor have I met a member of Parliament who could say that he had known' votes to be changed by a speech in Parliament. </para></speech>

                        <para>. - I desire to say a few words in regard to the petition from certain Italian residents of Melbourne, which was presented to this House yesterday by the honorable member for Batman. I believe there are two sections of Italians throughout the Commonwealth. One section is disposed to fall in with the wishes of the Italian Consul, but the other section is not quite so ready to adopt that course. I understand that the difficulty is that a number of reservists are being called up - men who have married in Australia. These men have families dependent upon them, and they affirm that if they leave here to serve under their own colours, their wives and children, who will be left behind, will be entitled only to the allowance that is provided by the Italian Go- vermnent, which, of course, is wholly inadequate. I think that that allowance is about ls. 4d. per day. I desire to know whether the Government will consent to make up the difference between the amount that is provided by the Italian Government and the allowance that is made to our own troops. </para>

                            <para>- It is possible that I may have misunderstood my informant. There is, however, some difficulty in the way of these Italian reservists answering the call, and if that difficulty is removed they will be quite willing to leave Australia for the purpose of serving under their own colours. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to give this matter consideration. </para>

Did the Prime Minister take the members of the Ministerial party into his confidence? In regard to the matter mentioned by the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford),</inline> I know that a deputation is waiting on the Minister for Defence this afternoon. I understand that many persons object to Australian soldiers being used for the purpose of handing over Australian citizens to the Italian Consul. They feel that the pay of the Italian soldiers is not sufficient to enable the latter to adequately provide for the wives and families whom they will leave behind in Australia. In the majority of cases, I am informed, these families are very large. I understand that the Italian Government provide the same separation allowance as we do. It is considered however, that unless some additional provision is made these people will be severely handicapped. It is in that respect, I understand, that great anxiety is felt. As a result of the deputation which is going to wait on the Minister, I presume we shall learn- more as to the actual position; but I trust that the Government will go carefully into the whole question, and see that no injustice is done to any section of the community. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to direct the attention of the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> to a weakness that I think exists in the control of our overseas exports. The Shipping Board very properly decides the order of preference that shall be given to our exports, and that decision is arrived at upon the advice of the authorities in England, who know best what England and our Allies want. At the beginning of this week I discovered that a certain commodity which is of value for war purposes, but is not so vital to the Allies as are the things to which the Shipping Board is giving priority of export, had congested very materially in: Sydney. The man controlling the bulk of this congested produce did what, on the face of it, seemed to be clever; he chartered a ship, before it had actually arrived, at a high rate of freight to carry his produce to America, where he could obtain for it a ready sale at a very big price. Upon the arrival of the vessel the Shipping Board said that it must carry wheat. The shipmaster replied that his ship was not suitable for the purpose, and the Shipping Board thereupon had her altered so that she could carry wheat. Then the shipmaster said he would not carry wheat at the price offered by the Commonwealth Government. As the ship is not registered here, we have not been able to force her to carry our wheat for the Empire's use, and the result is that she has been lying idle in Sydney foT three or four months. I suggest that we should make arrangements with the Allied Governments, so that when any ship becomes recalcitrant, so to speak, the Government of the country in which she is registered will come down heavily on the owner or owners, and compel them to observe the Allies' needs. Unless we do that we shall be wasting our shipping in the most ridiculous way. </para>

                            <para>- It was copra, which has some war value, but which, apparently, is not so urgently required at present as wheat. Because the shipmaster would not take a cargo of wheat, the ship is out of commission. I have written to the Prime Minister, but I understand that my letter has missed him. As the matter is very urgent and might easily be arranged by the Prime Minister during his absence from Australia, I want the Acting Prime Minister to get into touch with the Governments of Canada and the United States, through the proper channels, and to ascertain whether we cannot synchronize the control of shipping </para>

I press this question, because I think a very large number of the men must have been greatly disappointed, and perhaps hurt. The feelings of these men, who have battled so strenuously for their country and the Empire, ought to be considered, and it is to be regretted that the arrangements for to-day's march were not more complete, so that this disappointment could have been avoided. </para>

I stated this afternoon, from something I had heard earlier in the day, that I understood the Returned Soldiers Association had the sole control of the procession. I have since heard something that leads me to believe that the Association was not in charge of the whole procession. I endeavoured to obtain full particulars from the Defence Department, but they have not yet arrived. The matter will be thoroughly sifted, and I shall inform the House fully on this subject next Wednesday. </para>

I desire, however, to bring before the House a case which is deserving of inquiry. If the facts are as stated, then the officer responsible for them should be punished. On the 18th March last, at 12 noon, two soldiers called at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Boufiglio's house, 40 Cumberland-place, City, and on being informed by his wife that he was away at work,, they searched the house. Finding that he was not there, they waited outside, one at the front door and the other at the back gate until 5 p.m. In the meantime <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boufiglio</inline> was examined at South Melbourne and rejected. On returning home, he found these soldiers at his door, and upon being informed of their purpose, he showed them his papers. These disclosed the fact that he had already been examined and rejected. The soldiers, however, demanded that he should go with them. One soldier, threatening him with his bayonet, said, " We have been waiting too long for you; and unless you come with us there is this for you." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boufiglio</inline> went with them to South Melbourne, but it was then too late to see the responsible officer, and he was taken to the Domain Camp, where, after two hours' detention, he was released. </para>

                    <para>I wish now to refer to the case in which the privileges of Parliament were invaded and offended by the military. You, . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> did your duty in that case, as every good Liberal would do in such circumstances; but I learn from the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts)</inline> that his property, seized on that occasion, has not yet been returned to him. I take this opportunity of warning those soldiers who did this work, and those who ordered them to do it, that the wheel of change goes round, and that their action will not be forgotten when the public are properly seized of how their liberties were interfered with, and those who, by their votes in this Chamber, supported the action of the military authorities will live to regret the attitude they adopted. A wise old politician, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duncan</inline> Gillies, who swayed the State House in Victoria for many years, once said: "After a long political life, I can say that though honorable members can frequently explain away a speech, a division is a very awkward thing to explain away. Those honorable members who are introducing the system of taking divisions have force be- hind them, though their numbers are few." I forced many divisions in those days, but through the vista of years since those words were spoken, I have come to agree with him. On page 162, in the notes to Marvell's <inline font-style="italic">Satires,</inline> we have the following: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Marvell gave the following account of the affair in a private letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wm,</inline> Ramsden, written, apparently, in February, 1671:- <inline font-weight="bold">"Sir John</inline> Coventry having moved for an imposition on the playhouses, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Birkenhead, to excuse them, said they had been of great service to the King. Upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coventry desired that gentleman to explain whether he meant the men or women players. Hereupon it is imagined that, the House adjourning from Tuesday before till Thursday after Christmas 'Day, on the very Tuesday night of the adjournment, twenty-five of the Duke of Monmouth's troop, and some few foot, laid in wait from 10 art night till 2 in the morning by Suffolk-street, and, as he returned from the Cock, where he supped, to his own house, they threw him down, and with a knife cut off almost all the end of his nose: but company coming made them fearful to finish it, so they marched off. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Sandys, lieutenant of the troop, commanded the party, and O'Bryan, the Earl of Inchequin's son, was a principal actor. The Court hereupon sometimes thought to carry it with a high hand, and question <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> for his words and maintain the action. Sometimes they flagged in their counsels. However, the King commanded <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Clarges and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir W.</inline> Pultney to release Wroth and Lake, who were two of the actors and taken. But the night before the House met they surrounded them again. The House being but sullen tha next day, the Court did not oppose adjourning for some days longer till it was filled. Then the House went upon Coventry's business and voted that they would go upon nothing else whatever till they had passed a Bill, as they did, for Sandys, O'Bryan, Berry, and Reeves to come in by the loth February, or else be condemned, with provisions to prevent their being pardoned by the King. Any such action in future was made felony, and an attack on a member was to be punished by a year's imprisonment, treble damages, and incapacity. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Sandys was the very person sent to Clarges and Pultney. O'Bryan was concealed in Monmouth's lodgings, and Wroth and Lake were bailed by order from the Attorney-General." Marvell concludes: - " The Court is at the highest pitch of want and ( ? wanton ) luxury, and the people full of discontent." . For further particulars see Pepys, and Marvell's  letters to the corporation at Hull for January and February, 1671. Sandys and O'Bryan did not appear, and were accordingly attainted and outlawed. </para>

                    <para>Many unjust things have been said about the revolutionary party now in control in Russia, but I glory in the thoughts that the Bolsheviks have uttered. They are equal to those of the Encyclopaedists, whose writings led to the French Revolution. The words of freedom to which they gave expression are now reverberating  throughout the world, just as when one throws a pebble into water, the ripples will spread from where the pebble strikes until they reach the banks, no matter how far distant these may be. I resent the discourtesy that has been shown to the man who, as we understand, represents the Bolsheviks. " Bolshevik is a Russian word meaning "majority." The Bolsheviks are simply the Russian majority. Kerensky was accepted by Great Britain, and surely those who have destroyed Kerensky - a fact which I greatly . regret - must be more powerful than he was. I fear that the discourtesy shown to the representative of the Bolsheviks comes from the aristocratic backing that every British Government has. I repeat that I glory in the thoughts that have been given utterance to by the Bolsheviks. They are some of the greatest thoughts that have ever come from the lips of men, even from those great philosophers who preceded Christ. We can see permeating them the writings of 'Tolstoi. These thoughts are causing trouble in Austria, and were it not for the iron power of Prussian despotism that is devastating Europe to-day, they would permeate Germany. I hate and loathe the Prussian military system, and </para>
                    <para>I hope that, if necessary, the war will be continued until it has been destroyed. When Germany becomes a republic, as I hope it may, we should be prepared to welcome its people as brothers in the great human race, because by their action they will have removed the cursed power of  Kaiserism  and  Prussian autocracy, which unfortunately rule Prussia, and have let loose in Germany the mad dog of war. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford)</inline> has asked as to the allowances made in connexion with the conscription of Italians. I understand that the Minister concerned has just received a deputation on the matter, and has promised to give the matter consideration, in order to see how far he can increase the amount, in view of the domestic circumstances of the men obliged to go to Italy. As to the action of the Government in this matter, I wish to make it quite plain that what we did was at the request of the Italian authorities, who are our Ally, and we cannot shift from that position. To perform an. act  of grace for the dependants of' some of the men is one thing, and to refuse to-  obey the principle of covenants between allied nations is another ; and the Cabinet decided the matter knowing exactly its gravity, and did what it is obliged to do in the true spirit of alliance with an allied people. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kelly)</inline> dealt with the question of shipping. I am not acquainted with the exact details, hut the Minister in charge will investigate the matter at once. I might say, however, that there is one mistake being made, even in commercial circles; about the right of priority for cargoes.It is not that the shipping trade of Australia has laid down any order of priority in loading, but that the British Shipping Board has requested all supplying nations, including the Dominions, to observe a definite rule of priority; and that applies, not only with respect to goods from here to India or England, but also to other self-governing Dominions, including' South Africa. The Imperial Government is better aware . than we are of the actual need of the military and civilian populations, and we are closely observing the rules laid down for us by the British shipping authorities. </para>
