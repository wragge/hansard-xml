In view of the probability of the early discharge of a number of men who have been engaged on naval work,I ask if the matter is likely to receive immediate attention? </para>

                        <para>- I understand that weather forecasts are no longer supplied to the Marine Board at Hobart. The Board has sent to me a letter, in which it says that it trusts that the Government may see its way clear to reconsider the matter, and continue the supply, as the reports are of the greatest use to the shipping community, and very extensively referred to. The Board's offices are situated on the wharf, and the reports are exhibited in a case outside, which has been specially made for the purpose. The Board is of opinion that the discontinuance of the reports will cause great inconvenience to shipping masters, shipping agents, and other persons who are in the habit of consulting them and the maps issued in connexion with them. Can the Minister see his way to re-issue these valuable reports, which are evidently greatly appreciated by the public ? </para>

                        <para>- That must depend on the amount of money made available for the purpose. Without more money, we cannot do more than we are doing. We do our best to supply this information to the Marine Boards and to similar bodies throughout Australia. The reports are sent to the press, to subscribers, and to the Post Offices, where they are published immediately they are received. That is as much as we can do now that the vote for the purpose has been cut down considerably. </para>

Will the Minister of Repatriation take immediate action to see that they are placed on exactly the same footing in regard to securing advances to enable them to buy stock and effect improvements as that upon which the Victorian law places returned soldiers who take up land from the Crown ? </para>

                        has ruled, with great propriety, although honorable members frequently seem to ignore the ruling, that substantive statements involved in questions are improper, and I wish to say, as a Minister, that parenthetical questions, such as those which the honorable member so frequently and so eloquently asks, tend to embarrass the Government. I propose, if I am permitted, to make a statement on the subject of the Wheat Pool before the House rises to-day. In the meantime I may say that I am not sure there will be a Wheat Pool next year unless certain matters are cleared up. I do not propose to allow the Commonwealth Government to be embarrassed by these frequent attacks. Whilst seeking to help the wheat farmers, Ministers seem to be treated as a band of bandits desirous of robbing them. As to whether there will be any wheat scrip in a Pool which is managed in some other way, I cannot say at this stage, but I am heartily sick and tired of the attacks made upon a Government which is endeavouring to discharge an important national function.

                        <para>- The observation in the latter portion of the honorable member's question is unwarranted. No one is being' sweated. Persons who conduct allowance post' offices are paid on the value of the work done. They enter into the agreement with the Department with their eye3 open, and contract to carry out the conditions attaching to it. They are parties to the contract. The Department simply asks them to carry out the agreement into which they have voluntarily entered, subject to the work available or required to be carried out, and the payment allotted for such work. </para>

                    <para>That means that, at the conclusion of the war, a proclamation would issue, and thereupon the War Precautions Act and  the regulations under it would, generally speaking, cease to operate. It is to meet the difficulties ' arising put of that situation that this Bill is introduced. As the end of the war has, to all appearances, now almost been reached, it has opened up to the various Governments problems no less complex than those which arose when the great conflict began. The far-reaching nature of the operations of the war necessitated the exercise of extraordinary -emergency powers, .the administrative intrusion on the part of the Government into areas of finance, industry, production, and distribution never before contemplated, and au interference with the rights of individuals and their freedom of action of a character quite alien to the customs of our race. By the exercise of these" extraordinary powers, there have  been  built up various governmental and semi-governmental activities in the national interest. </para>
                    <para>The problems now before the Government involve the gradual restoration of the community to its normal peace conditions. The aims and intentions of the Government are to govern, as far as possible, without undue recourse to these extraordinary powers during the period of transition from war to peace, and to establish as speedily as possible normal conditions. But the sudden cessation of the activities which have arisen in consequence of the war could not be accomplished with-  out danger to the community, financial ;and commercial loss of a serious character, and a grave disturbance of social and economic conditions. It is quite impossible, therefore, to allow a sadden termination of various Acts and regulations introduced to meet the conditions arising out of the war. To do so would involve <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> community in chaos and disaster. Many of the war activities have become so interwoven in- the commercial and indus trial life of Australia that their sudden termination would lead to endless confusion. </para>
                    <para>To secure the public safety and the defence of the Commonwealth, it became necessary here, as elsewhere, to enact the War Precautions Act, and to delegate to the Executive a very wide discretion in the making of regulations and orders. Under the authority of that Act, a large number of regulations and orders were issued. The main body were framed for defence purposes only, and were supplementary to the powers exercised under the Defence Act. Others were closely allied, but were meant to safeguard national safety and well-being. These dealt with such matters as the control of aliens and enemy subjects, and the prevention of internal trouble and disaffection. Other regulations were passed in the exercise of that wider power of defence as interpreted by the High Court i:i the case of <inline font-style="italic">Farey</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Burvett</inline> (21 C.L.R.), and were meant to safeguard the nation's economic and financial resources, both for local and Imperial purposes. Referring to the nature of the defence power under the Constitution, the Chief Justice <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Samuel Griffith)</inline> said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>I agree generally with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mann's</inline> argument that the power to legislate with respect to defence extends to any law which may tend to the conservation or development of the resources of the Commonwealth so far as they can be directed to success in war, or may tend to distress the enemy or diminish his resources, as, for instance, by the prohibition of trading with him or with persons associated with him. But this definition is not exhaustive. The control of finance or trade may be the most potent weapon of all. One test, however, must always be applied, namely : Can the measure in question conduce to the efficiency of the forces of the Empire, or is the connexion of cause and effect between the measure and the desired efficiency so remote that the one cannot reasonably be regarded as affecting the other..... </para>
                        <para>Applying this well established doctrine, the question is whether the Act and regulation - the validity of which is now called in question - can be regarded as substantial laws relating to defence; in other words, whether the provisions of the regulation can conduce to the more effectual prosecution of the war. ft is not necessary for the Court to point out the particular way in which they can have that effect. But the Court may, I think, take judicial notice of the fact that the past season's harvest was most abundant, and that vast quantities of wheat, far exceeding the possible consumption of the Commonwealth, are awaiting export; while, owing to the operations of war, the supply of freight is deficient. It is obvious that for economical, as well as other reasons, the export of the surplus to the United Kingdom or the Allied nations may be highly desirable for the more efficient prosecution of the war. It seems to follow that any law which may tend, with or without the aid of other measures, to encourage such export, may be conducive to the more efficient conduct of the war. </para>

                    <para>As I read the Constitution, the Commonwealth, when charged with the duty of defending the Commonwealth and States, is armed as a self-governing portion of the British Dominion with the legislative power to do in relation to national defence all that Parliament, as the legislative organ of the nation, may deem advisable to enact, in relation to the defence of Australia as a component part of the Empire. A power which is  commensurate  with the peril it is designed to encounter, or as that peril may appear to the Parliament itself ; and, if need be, it is a power to command, control, organize and regulate, for the purposes of guarding against the peril, the whole resources of the continent, living and inert, and the activities of every inhabitant of the territory. The problem of national defence i's not confined to operations on the battle-field or  the deck  of a man-of-war; the factors enter into every phase of life, and embrace the co-operation of every individual with all that he possesses - his property, his energy, his life itself; and, in this supreme crisis we can no more sever the requirements and efforts of the civil population whose liberties and possessions are at stake from the movements of our soldiers and sailors, who are defending them, than we can cut away the root of a living tree and bid it still live and bear fruit deprived of the sustenance it needs. </para>
                    <para class="block">Each of the three classes of regulations presents problems to be considered by the Government with respect to the termination of the lawful authority upon which they rest, and with respect to the policy aspect as regards the date upon which they should cease. At this stage, owing to the unsettled conditions existing, and the impossibility of predicting the date at which normal conditions will be restored in the community, it is impossible to fix the date at which the particular control exercised in each case can terminate. The decision in each instance will involve the consideration of many factors. The intention of the Bill before the House is to extend the operation of the Act for a period of six months after the proclamation has been issued under the War Precautions Act that war has ceased. The question arises as to when the war can be legally said to end. In the United Kingdom, a special legal committee, consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Atkins, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Roche, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> H. Balfour Browne, K.C, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C</inline> O. Lawrence, K.C, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> A. Russell, K.C, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> F.

Branson, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roland</inline> Burrowes as secretary, was appointed to inquire, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia, ' '</inline> into the legal questions that may arise as to the determination of the date of termination of the war for the purpose of the various Acts, Orders and regulations, the duration of which depends directly or indirectly upon  that  date." In the Commonwealth we have passed a large number of Acts in which that or similar terms are used. This,  committee  in Great Britain reported as to the' date of the end of the war - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>We assume that the war will be ended by a treaty or treaties of peace. In order to arrive at a final conclusion of the treaty, various stages will probably be required, such as' agreements for armistices, cessation of hostilities thereunder, articles of peace, agreement of terms signature of terms, ratification, exchange or deposit of ratification. In our opinion, speaking of legislation generally, the war cannot be said to have ceased until peace is finally and irrevocably obtained, and that point of time cannot be earlier than the date  when  the treaty of peace is finally binding on the respective belligerents, and that is the date when ratifications are exchanged. </para>

                            <para>- It is impossible for us. to say at this stage exactly on what date the war- will end. It may be that the Peace Conference will meet early and come quickly to a decision. On the contrary, the discussions may be very prolonged. No one can predict exactly what will happen, and because of that we must have certainty in law and administration, and particularly in regard to the great financial operations that have been undertaken during the war. It is considered highly advisable that this extended period for the operation of the Act should be given. We have eminent authority for exercising our power of legislation under the Constitution for the purposes of the extension when the war will have' ceased. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it has been the view of the Department all through that we had the power, and that view is confirmed by outside legal opinion. The reason for the extension is partly to continue essential operations and activities which have been carried out during the period of the war, and partly to enable the Government and the various departments to take a most careful review of each of the regulations and activities with a view of deciding which of them can be brought to a speedy conclusion and the exact date to which others should be extended. To enable the necessary careful consideration to be given to this question as to what portions of the War Precautions Regulations should be given statutory authority after the war, the Department of Defence desired immediate action to be taken to extend the operation of the A'ct for six months after the war. </para>

The Minister is making a very important speech, in which he is endeavouring to supply the House with information, but with so many . interruptions it is most  difficult  for him to make himself heard. I have several times called upon honorable members not to interject, and on one occasion, almost immediately after I had called the House to order, 1 counted no fewer than six interjections uttered simultaneously. If these interruptions continue I must ask the House to take serious notice of them. Unless the Chair is to be supported in its efforts to maintain order, I shall have to seriously consider the position. </para>

                            <para>- That is impossible. Questions of policy affecting the industries concerned, as well as questions of law, are involved, and have to be considered. It may be necessary, in some cases in the future, to ask Parliament to extend existing activities and regulations beyond the period contemplated by this measure. In those cases&gt; however, Parliament will be specially appealed to by the Government. There are also other Statutes of an emergency character deal-  ing with patents and other matters, the operation of which will have to be considered. Meanwhile, to advise the Government upon the purely legal aspect of problems arising out of the war, an honorary legal Committee has been constituted, consisting of men of distinction in the profession, who generously have consented to give their services in this connexion, and to advise as to purely legal problems arising out of the cessation of the war. The members of this Committee are - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell, K.C., <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Adrian</inline> Knox, K.C., Professor Harrison Moore, Professor J. B. Peden, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> E. Starke, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> P. Simpson, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> M. Campbell. The Attorney-General for the time being will be the  chairman  of the Committee. In the United Kingdom advantage has also been taken of the assistance offered by members of the legal profession. As regards the regulations under the War Precautions Act dealing with defence matters, many will not need to be continued, or the powers under them exercised. As regards those relating to internment, no definite announcement can be made at present, as it is understood the question of the internment of civilians is one of those matters which will have to be settled at the Peace Conference. The action of the Government with respect to this matter, and upon the question of enemy subjects generally, must be to a great extent guided by Imperial policy. As regards the censorship, the Government has no desire to control this beyond what is absolutely necessary. Until at least peace is signed, some control in the national interest is essential. In the United Kingdom the discussion of peace terms is the subject of censorship. However, the censorship has already been relaxed with respect to shipping and other matters, and the general policy will be to restore as speedily as possible the right of expression of public opinion and freedom of discussion. </para>

                        <para>.- It seems to me strange that it should have been necessary for this Parliament to pass so many amendments of the original Defence Act. I believe that up to the present there have been ten amendments of that measure, and the Bill now under consideration is the twelfth of such amending Bills that have been introduced. The Government have gone so far as to have proposed two amendments of the Defence Act this year. It is more strange still that a further amendment of the Act should be considered necessary when apparently the final flutter of the war is at an end, and the services of the Australian Imperial Force are no longer required in the field. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>If there is one thing which, more than another, honorable members on both sides desire, it is that every honour should be accorded to the men who took their lives and their courage in both hands, arid went abroad to preserve the benefits of the freedom and liberty we enjoy in Australia and throughout the British Empire. I feel sure that honorable members are determined that the men who have gone overseas to fight for this country shall have justice done them. One would naturally suppose that the men who have won their spurs and gained distinction and honour on the battle-field, should take precedence of the " stay-at-homes,'1 the men who are termed in the Imperial Forces "feather-bed soldiers." I do not care what position may have been held by " stay-at-homes " in Australia; they may have been wonderful organizers, but if they had been imbued with the true military spirit no chains would have prevented them from doing a soldier's' duty when such a duty required to be done. Perhaps honorable members do not realize that it is intended by the amending Bill now under consideration to take their seniority away from the men who have won their spurs on the field of  battle, and have done something, not only for Australia, but for the Empire. Are honorable members going to permit such a Bill to pass at the dictate of the Government, merely in order that a lot of " stay-at-homes " may occupy senior positions? Every position in our Defence Force worth having should be preserved for the men who have seen active service. </para>

Surely if men are good enough to fight for us they are good enough to be given positions above the " stayathomes," the men who strut about, as do a lot of women, op the block in. Collins-street on Saturday - the Saturday afternoon feather-bed soldiers. The only way to secure an effective Defence Force is to give positions of command, whether as commissioned or non-commissioned officers, to the men who have seen active service at the Front. Do not let us be hypocrites in dealing with these men. Let us act up to what we have said all along. Every member of this Parliament who has appeared on a public platform in connexion with any war activities has expressed admiration for the young Australians who -have gone abroad and won their spurs, and I feel that when the proposal of the Government is exposed, there is not a member of this House who will permit this Bill to pass in its present form.  </para>

                    <para class="block">I say that no man should be tried for wilful murder except by a civil Court. I remember that, when I was in the Imperial service, one soldier murdered another. After roll-call at night on a Christmas Eve, we were sitting round the fire, when a  gunner who had been discharged from  prison  the day before, after seven days' imprisonment for some minor offence, was approached by a bombardier who had been the cause of his imprisonment. The bombardier tapped the man on the shoulder and said, " It is time you were in bed. Get np quick and lively, and get to bed." The gunner said, " I will shift you, my gentleman," and he pulled the poker out of the fire, charged the bombardier with it, and put it through-, him. . The bombardier died, but the gunner was not arrested by the military authorities for murder. He was arrested for assaulting a non-commissioned officer.. Directly the bombardier died, and a civil, verdict of wilful murder was brought in against the gunner, the military .authorities had to hand him over to the civil power to be tried. That is the course which I say should be followed in such cases. Every one of the offences mentioned in section 98 is a military offence. The war is practically over, so far as the Australian Imperial Force are concerned, and they are being embarked for Australia as rapidly as possible. Owing to the armistice, they are not now engaged, on the field of battle, and in the circumstances. I should like to know why such an amendment of section 98 of the principal Act is proposed at this time? We need, to be very careful in Australia that we shall not have even a semblance of a military caste in our fine, free nation. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. I do not know what we should have done during the first twelve months of the war had it not been for our compulsory training system. It was unquestionably the adoption of that system which enabled us to marshal such an efficient force within a comparatively brief period. I am satisfied that even those who are opposed to war must be proud of the part that Australia has played in this great struggle. Our troops have undoubtedly proved that they are not vagabonds or mongrels. Reading the remarks of the Bishop of Amiens in regard to our Australian Forces, I cannot resist the conclusion that there is something more than fighting qualities at the back of it. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so.' I know that in the  Imperial  service charges of manslaughter were tried by court martial, and the convicted persons were sentenced to imprisonment in a military prison. But murderers were handed over to the civil authorities for trial, and rightly so. I am just as jealous of our privileges as citizens as I am of the privileges which properly belong to the members of our Military Forces. Our men are not soldiers in the military sense. As soon as the war is over they will return to their civil employment. We ought not to treat them as soldiers when once they are back in Australia, except when our Military Forces are called up in defence of their hearths and homes. </para>

                        <para>.  -  I wish, first, to say how glad I am, as one of the soldier members of this House, that the Government have at last seen fit to rectify one of the many grievances of the returned officers of the Australian Imperial Force. I am now referring  to  the proposed amendment of section 20 of the principal Act. Up to the present time returning officers of the Australian Imperial Force, upon joining the Reserve </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Forces,  have been ranked junior to officers in our Citizen Forces - officers who have never left Australia. The proposed amendment will do away with that anomaly, and give seniority to those who have actually fought in the defence of this country. Incidentally, it will abolish much of the discontent .that is felt towards the officers of our Citizen Forces who have remained at home. I have in my mind one specific case - that of a sergeant-major who enlisted for service abroad, and who came back to Australia as a captain, with the military cross on his breast. Upon his return he was obliged to drop his rank and salute officers who had never <inline font-style="italic">left</inline> Australia. That  was  certainly not a proper thing. But under the amendment which is now proposed he will become senior to those officers - a procedure that is obviously just. </para>
                    <para>The only other suggested amendment with which I wish to deal is that which has been mentioned by the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Page)</inline> - the proposal to insert the word " murder " in section 98 of the principal Act. In the first place, I believe that the soldiers of Australia, as a whole, wish to remain,  even during the time that they are wearing khaki, essentially citizens of the Commonwealth. Personally, I am convinced that some of the sentences which have been imposed for military offences under the Army Act have been savage, and for all the bigger crimes committed in the Army I desire to see civil trial substituted for military court martial. In the battalion in which I had the honour to serve I know that men received really savage sentences - in some cases amounting to many years of imprisonment - for crimes that a civil magistrate would have laughed at, and possibly dismissed. In this connexion, I recall one case especially - that of a corporal, who was sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment for striking his superior officer, although he did him no damage whatever, and did not even bruise him. Punishments of that character are altogether disproportionate to the magnitude of the- offence committed. As the members of our Forces serve as citizens, and not as soldiers, it is high time that we had the right of a civil trial for any crime meriting a big punishment in the Army. In regard to murder, one has, in many cases, to consider the circumstances under which it is committed. Upon two occasions which came under my personal, observation during my term of service abroad, men committed the crime of murder under great provocation. In both instances, while keyed up to a very high pitch of excitement, they were ridden down by military police with naked sabres. As a result, some of the military police subsequently paid the penalty with their lives. If the ringleaders in th'is crime had been caught they would undoubtedly have had to stand their trial for murder, and at a military court martial they would not have received the same consideration that would have been extended to them if they had been tried by a civil Court. It has also to be remembered that accused persons in the Army are not able to secure proper representation at their trial. Ninety-nine men out of 100 are not conversant with one-fifth of the provisions of the Army Act, and do not know how to defend them, selves. That is not just to the accused whose life is trembling in the balance. He should have the right to be represented by a man who is trained in legal matters, and who is able to put up a decent fight for the accused's life. There are many other military crimes which are punishable by death. In many instances the man who is sentenced and shot is really not a case for the executioner so much as he is a case for the doctor. In one instance of which I have knowledge - I was in Ypres, in Flanders, at the time it happened - a .young man, .nineteen years of age, who had been conscripted into an English regiment, had been taken into the trenches for the first time. </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>
                        regiment was subjected to three hours of the heaviest drum fire imaginable. It would have broken the nerves, I am sure, of quite three-fourths of the honorable members of this House. The effect .of that drum fire upon the nerves of the lad was so severe that he turned tail and ran. He was certainly not a coward in the ordinary sense, but he had been subjected to such a fearful ordeal that he lost all control of himself, and his- legs carried him where his head did not direct him. He was caught. Immediately after he had left the trenches, the Germans launched a charge, and it was held against the lad, therefore, that he had deserted in the face ' of the enemy. Shortly afterwards he was taken out and shot in the public square of Ypres, in front of the civil population. That is the type of crime which involves a man's execution in the Army, and I am very much opposed to any extension of our military laws which would grant power to execute a man following upon a court-martial. The war is practically over. Goodness knows why the authorities require now to extend the powers they already possess, seeing that the men are on the eve of returning home. We should do away with those hidebound regulations which to-day hold our men down, and will not allow them to speak. God knows that the discipline in. the Army already is strict enough. English soldiers have told us that they could not understand the freedom which we enjoyed; and it is a f act that they are very much worse off. than the men of the Australian Imperial Force. But the Australian soldier, citizen soldier that he is, has not the liberty so long as he is 'in the Army that we enjoy. Despite the fact that the Australian has been charged with lack of discipline, he has fought second" fo none in the war; and I fail to see the purpose of binding him down with further discipline. My personal observations have led me to the conclusion - just as with a great many others - that the soldier under the strictest discipline has proved the poorest fighting man. It is for an obvious reason. When his officers and non-commissioned officers have been wiped out, the man who has been accustomed to the severest discipline finds himself practically useless without a leader. The situation in the Australian Army has always been diametrically opposite. Our . soldiers have been accustomed to doing little odd jobs on their own, and when they have got into a tight corner, where the alternatives have been taking another man's.' life or of his taking theirs, our Australian lads have known just how to go to work. They have required no officers. They require no extreme discipline to show them what to do. T am opposed to any further extension of the grip of militarism upon our soldier citizens.

                    </talk.start>
                    <para>George - that a certain paragraph inserted in a particular. Bill was intended, to convey that the salary of the Governor-General would never be increased. The amount indicated at that time was £10,000 per annum. I said, " That is all very well, and I am naturally prepared to take your word for it; but," I added, " let us have it in black and white. Let us put into the enabling Bill one little word which will assure that the salary shall not be more than that sum." I thereupon moved to omit the word " less," and to insert in its stead the little word "more." An effort was made later to break that promise of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Turner,</inline> when Lord Hopetoun, our first Governor-General, sought to secure £20,000 a year. It was that section in the Victorian State Statute which prevented the addition being granted. I  am inclined to insist here also that we should' have everything in plain English, so that there shall be no mistake, or change of purpose. Indeed., I feel inclined- to give notice of my intention to move a new clause, based upon the Code <inline font-style="italic">Napoleon..</inline> It would be to the following effect: - </para>

                    <para>Probably during the war I have had more conversations with  returned soldiers than any other honorable member. I have cultivated the habit of asking many questions. The majority of those who have attended my office, and have told me their stories, have spoken well of General Birdwood. But from some of them I have been acquainted with another point of view. T am given to understand that he actually desired that there should be power to inflict the death penalty on our Australian soldiers, just as in the case of the Continental Forces. We have just heard of an instance bearing upon that from the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corboy),</inline> who has just won his spurs in this Chamber, and whom I heartily compliment upon his maiden effort. </para>

It will be an infamy if it is embraced in the Statutes of a country like Australia, with its voluntary citizen soldiers. It would be bringing in one of the vilest things which has discredited the accursed German military system. Here we are, at a stage-when fighting has ceased, and peace has been virtually declared; and it is sought to provide for the infliction of the death penalty at this dying stage of the ivar. </para>

                    <para>I have had some experience of courts martial in this State. I could tell a good deal about the case of one unfortunate man, four of whose brothers had enlisted.. One of those lost his life on Gallipoli,' and another in France. 'Still another has not yet recovered from his wounds, and one is missing. A court martial was held in the case of this individual; and honorable members with legal training will agree, I think, that there is generally no appeal from a court martial, unless it be upon the presentation of new evidence. In this particular case, however, the Assistant Minister for Defence at the time caused an inquiry to be held, which overrode the decision of the court martial. At this second inquiry there was a certain Australian general - one of those individuals who has never smelt gunpowder at the  Front. I refer to  General Cuscaden  who ranks as superior to all our returned heroes, and whom even the heroic wearers of the Victoria Cross must salute. I am referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cuscaden,</inline> who remained in Australia, and, because he belonged to the Government House " push " got his advances until he held the rank of surgeon-general - although he had never smelt gunpowder, unless it might have been when he let off a cracker in his own back yard. This man had the infernal audacity to say that the poor wretched person who was then being tried a second time, was fit to be put to work. He was sent for six months to. a lunatic asylum, under observation all the time.' Where is he now? God knows. He had developed the most phenomenal voice I have ever heard. He spoke from my own platform with me on more than one occasion, but I could never permit him to address the crowd for more than a few minutes, since he worked himself up to such a frenzy that he trembled from head to foot. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Sewell,</inline> who has been concerned in the inquiry, told me later that he thought he might have misjudged this man's case. This individual afterwards went to Queensland. There is no doubt that he was mentally unhinged. In that State he spoke from the recruiting platform under another name, and, with the aid of his truly phenomenal voice, he attracted great crowds. One other incident in his story is that he, a married man, found another girl to marry him.  His  illness was such that he could not carry out the functions of a married man with his wife. One day this girl-wife found a letter from his first wife in Melbourne. There was trouble. He thrashed her. They both disappeared. Did she commit suicide? Did he? </para>
                    <para>General Cuscaden said that that man was fit to go out and earn his own living. That was the expressed opinion of an individual whom every V.C. winner must flip his hand to. This is the official who, if he went to the Front, would be laughed at by every doctor in the Imperial armies. There is not one of our returned Army Medical Corps Officers but who is, in fact, the superior of this man. who is their military superior. He would not be allowed to go into the Melbourne Hospital, or the Alfred Hospital, as an out-patient or in-patient surgeon. </para>
                    <para>Let us prevent any legislation such as is here sought, until our fighting men can return and are free to tell us all they know. As for the effort of General Birdwood to secure power to enforce the death penalty in the Australian Imperial Force, I greatly honour the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> in that he sent a message replying that General Birdwood would not be permitted to secure his ends. Are we going to bring in the death penalty now, when the armistice has been signed, when the fighting is over, and when our heroes are on the eve of return? On Monday I shall attend a meeting to welcome home our Anzacs iri. North Melbourne. I shall tell that meeting what the Government are proposing now to do - that the death penalty is to be imposed upon Australian soldiers in the same brutal manner as. with the German armies, and with the armies of other nations. </para>

                            <para>- Before any drastic change is made in Defence legislation, let us wait till all the boys, or a large proportion of them, come back from the Front. They will be able to give us the benefit of their experiences. They may be able to show us that such absurdities exist as too much discipline, too much recognition of officialdom, and too much red-tape. When we know what they have to tell us, we may be able to pass a really good up-to-date Defence Bill. If I am any reader of political events - and I suppose my parliamentary experience is second only to that of the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce Smith)</inline> and the honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chanter)</inline> - that whirlwind of change which has absolutely eliminated monarchy from Europe will in other ways eliminate the powers of the privileged classes, and extend even to Australia, so that anything we do now will probably have to be altered again later on. There is no immediate necessity for this legislation, seeing that the armistice has been signed, a number of the death-dealing destructive brutes of submarines that previously belonged to Germany have already been handed over,- and the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine are actually in the hands of our Allies. Surely in those circumstances this is not a meet time to amend the Defence Act. I quite agree with the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> that men who have actually seen service overseas should rank senior to those who have not done so ; but a provision to that effect could be put in a few simple words. I remember that many men who rose to high rank did not think it worth while to volunteer for service in the Boer war, and when the late Lord Kitchener was here I wrote to him  and asked him if he did not consider that, all things being equal, the man who had seen service should have absolute priority over the man who stayed at home. His answer was that, all things being equal, the man who saw service and proved his patriotism to his country should always have preference. I do not think any honorable member in this Chamber- will gainsay the wisdom of the opinion expressed by that great leader of men. If the Government cannot see their way clear to accept my suggestion, I shall move the amendment I have indicated, embodying the principle of the <inline font-style="italic">Code Napoleon,</inline> as- a new clause. I hope I shall not have to do that, because 1 take it that this is a measure on which there should be no party division, and that we are all united in our desire to give full credit to. the man who has gone to the Front at the risk of making the supreme sacrifice. </para>

                            <para>- I would impress on the Assistant Minister that no medical man or surgeon in active practice can give a full and accurate idea of the nervous diseases which, have been caused by the horrors of this war, or of their effects. Honorable members must have been impressed by the words of the latest accession to the 'House, the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corboy).</inline> I was sorry there was not a full House here to listen to the splendid speech of that young man. If the Government have received definite instructions from the Homeland to put this provision in the Bill, let us be told so. I honour the Government, through the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> for refusing to agree to the death penalty being enforced previously, even though it was recommended by General Birdwood. Honorable members who were in the chamber and heard the cheers with which the Acting Prime Minister's statement was received on that occasion will agree with me that, unless special instructions or orders have come from the Front to the Government -to do this thing, this is certainly a most inappropriate time to do it. If the majority in their wisdom decide to carry that provision, I shall suggest later on, as a way out of the difficulty, the insertion of a proviso at the end of the clause to the effect that, where punishment of that kind is awarded, any man or officer shall have the right 'of appeal to a civil Court. If that is done, I shall not be afraid of the result. If however, the Government have determined to carry the clause as it stands, it will be my duty to divide the Committee on the question whether the right of appeal to a civil Court shall be allowed. That, if agreed to, will mean that every, man found guilty by a court martial under this heading will have the right of appeal, and the opportunity to prove to a civil Court that he is suffering from some nervous affection, such as shell shock, or one of the hundred-.ind-one other troubles that in medical and1 surgical centres are now being traced, although only dimly, to the war. The people outside will certainly be pleased to know that every officer or soldier has the right of appeal, which every citizen outside has, to a Court higher than the first Court that has tried him. </para>

                        <para>. - This Bill affords another example of the very injurious practice of setting" before members a mere series of amendments to existing legislation without putting before them the existing law to which it refers, so that they may clearly ascertain, ' without rummaging among past volumes of Statutes, what the law has been and the effect of the amendments upon it. I have referred to that injurious practice many times in the House, and have had promises from Ministers, <inline font-style="italic">going</inline> as far back as the beginning of Federation, to the effect that, whenever a Bill was introduced into this House involving amendments of existing Acts, members should have the convenience of seeing at a glance in what respect the existing; law was being altered. For a long time, I believe, the expenditure on paper has been a factor in our economy,  but the time baa arrived now when the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. "Wise)</inline> might promise that, ' at all events in his Department, any further amendments of this kind will be so framed that members  can -see at a glance what the law is  that  they are called upon to amend. The honorable member who has just spoken had to look back at the existing law to see in what respect the Act will be affected by one of the amendments put before us in this bald way. </para>

                    <para>So far as the debate h'as gone, there are only two points on which the House differs from' the Minister. One is the inclusion of murder in the jurisdiction of courts martial, and the other is the principle of giving those who have had active service seniority over those who have never been to. the war. The Minister evidently thought at first that the provision in the Bill would effect his purpose, and that appeared to be the impression of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corboy),</inline> whom. I desire to congratulate upon his maiden utterance. I had misgivings when I saw a young man of twenty-one taking the place of a man of seventy-one, with all the accumulated wisdom of his years. I may say now, as probably the oldest parliamentarian in the House, that I was delighted with the honorable member's utterance. </para>
                    <para>The truth with regard to the matter of seniority appears to lie between the rather optimistic view of the honorable member for Swan and the &gt;pessimistic view of the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney).</inline> I do not think the amendment as framed in the Bill will preserve to members of the active service Forces complete seniority over men who have not .been on active service, because it is quite possible that, for reasons upon which we cannot now speculate, some of those who have been on active service may not care, or may not think it desirable, to go into the Reserve. If they do not, my impression is that they will lose the benefit of their seniority. It would be well if the. Minister, in making this amendment of the law, would include a proviso by which the principle laid down in the <inline font-style="italic">Code Napoleon,</inline> quoted by the honorable member for Melbourne, would be preserved, that in. all cases- where, men are of equal rank, the man who has been on active service should enjoy seniority over the man who. is in the Reserve, or in any other branch of the Forces. That would satisfy the honorable member for Melbourne, and carry out .what the honorable member for Swan 'thought was carried out by the Bill. </para>
                    <para>The other question is much more difficult. "We know that courts martial have not, at present, jurisdiction over the crime of murder, and it is sought in the Bill to extend their jurisdiction to cases of that  sort.  I was shown a' case by the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister),</inline> in which it seemed that a man was charged and tried for murder before a court martial, 'but on looking over the papers I see that the court had misgivings as to its. powers, and ultimately convicted the man of manslaughter,, awarding him a punishment which they thought fitted the case in its most serious aspects. There is a great difficulty about this question. " I quite agree with the honorable member for Melbourne that we are not a% favorably disposed towards courts martial as we are towards civil trial. No doubt, trial by jury nowadays is very much abused, and often in the ramifications of society as we know it in a small community men tried before a jury escape justice when they ought not to do so. On the other hand, we all know that in many cases where men are tried by courts martial a military disciplinary harshness is exercised, and humane feeling seems to be altogether wanting. </para>
                    <para>We know from experience that a great many men are so seriously affected mentally by the war that at times they absolutely lose all control of their will-power. The case mentioned by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corboy)</inline> was that of a young soldier who bore all these disturbing influences for 'a  certain time, and then became so affected by them that he literally ran away. Medical knowledge would have informed the military court martial that tried him, that his state of mind could probably be accounted for by circumstances other than moral cowardice. Notwithstanding all the youth had suffered, he was taken out and deliberately shot for having done something which medical men would now say was the natural result of a tremendous psychological disturbance. My leaning is always towards civil trial, though I recognise it cannot be applied to military conditions without a complete revolution in method and judicial arrangement. I should be very willing to see some sort of trial as the honorable member for Melbourne suggested  carried out, "but one has only to reflect on the ramifications of military discipline to recognise that two distinct types of mind and two types of jurisdiction and adjudication must be observed in civil and: military affairs. </para>
                    <para>I understand from the Minister, who made the suggestion just now, that it was proposed to. limit this investment of courts martial with jurisdiction over murder to cases outside the British {Empire. That seems a feasible proposal, because when a man is outside the British Possessions he is outside the availability of a British civil tribunal. I know the honorable member for Melbourne thinks that, as we have done very .well for four years, we ought" to do very well now; but we hardly know how many cases there have been in which justice has suffered by reason of courts martial not having that power when they are outside British ' Possessions. I am quite with the honorable member, and I think that if our minds could be carefully examined  miscoscopically,  I should be found to have as much humanity in me, although perhaps with a more cynical exterior, than the honorable, member himself. I always try to approach these questions in a judicial spirit; and I think if the Minister would limit the investment of courts martial with jurisdiction for murder to cases outside British Possessions where there are no civil tribunals available, it would be quite safe. We do not know in what respect courts martial may have been forced to fail in doing justice by their inability to deal with the questions of murder. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is introducing into the debate an element which I do not think is desirable. I hope, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> now that the war is over, we shall all agree in this House that party feeling ought to be less acute than it has been in the past. We should approach all questions like this with the object of instilling a spirit of brotherhood among the five and a half millions of people in Australia. I hope honorable members will do so, and I point out that a remark of the kind just made by the honorable member for East Sydney does not help us. I know of no reason why Duntroon officers should not have the same opportunity to rise in the Military Service as are afforded to other members of it. </para>

                            <para>- In the case of promotions in the field, the commanding officers, I have no doubt, have not troubled to inquire whether a man went through Duntroon or not. I understand that there is some reason why Duntroon officers cannot rise above major, though some of them may have obtained great honours in the field, and have distinguished themselves in a very remarkable way. Personally, I have no grievance in the matter, but it has been brought under my notice more than once, and I ask the Assistant Minister for Defence whether there is any such rule concerning Duntroon officers, and, if so, why it has been promulgated. If there is not any such rule, it should be known that there is no reason why any young man who goes through many years of training at the Military College should not have the same opportunities of reaching the top as any other man who enters the Military Service of this country. </para>

I think there is room for doubt. We are asked in clause 2 of the Bill to amend section 20 of the Act by striking out the words - but officers of the active Military Forces shall rank as senior in their respective ranks to officers of the Reserve Military Forces. </para>

                            <para>- It includes everybody in the Military Service, and that being so, it does not give preference to men who have been overseas. That is the point. It gives everybody who is regarded as being in the ' ' active ' ' Forces an equal opportunity to promotion. I do not know whether the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> intends that to be so, but I can place no other interpretation upon the Bill read in conjunction with the interpretation section of the principal Act. The honorable member for Swan is quite right in his contention that we should give preference to those who have been fighting for us, but I am afraid that, with the Bill as it stands, those who have remained here in Australia will still have the right to hold choice positions in connexion with the Defence Department. I hope that when peace is signed, we may have a general disarmament of the nations, or, at least, a partial disarmament. That would, of course, largely reduce our military requirements. If we have to continue our defence establishment, we should, in every instance, give preference to those who have risked their lives for our liberties. Preference should be given to all who have seen active service abroad, including those who have served with the expeditions to the islands. </para>

                    <para>It has been stated that the cadets who go through Duntroon College are not permitted to rise above the rank of major. If that is so, a wrong is being done to them which should be righted as soon as possible. There are abroad many men with the rank of major, who, time and again, have led their battalion into the fight in the absence of their colonel on furlough, or because of sickness or wounds, and who cannot rise above the rank of major, because only one lieutenant-colonel is appointed to each battalion. A man may rise from the ranks, through the various steps, to his majority, bub he must then wait for an opening for promotion to a lieutenant-colonelcy, and these openings do not frequently occur, probably because there is not so much risk attaching to the holding of the higher positions. </para>

                    <para>Most of the amendments provided for in the Bill appear to be in the interests of those who are away at the Front. As to the proposal that courts martial shall have the power to inflict the death penalty for murder, I would point out that we have gone through four years of warfare without finding it necessary to give them that power, and it should not be necessary to do so now that an armistice has been signed, and we are within reasonable distance of a peace. The </para>
                    <para class="block">House will be very loath to sanction this proposal, and the Minister should consider before going into Committee whether it is absolutely necessary. Without it, the Bill could be easily "passed this afternoon. But the statements of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corboy),</inline> and of the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce Smith)</inline> must make us very careful in this matter. Many soldiers are not responsible for- 'their actions. In Sydney recently, I met a young fellow whom I knew, accompanied by his little daughter. In welcoming him back, I asked after his health, and he said, " Today 1 am fairly well, but at any moment I may temporarily lose control of myself. Then 1 do not know where I am, or what I am doing; and I have to bring my little girl with me to keep me from getting into harm, t am liable because of shell shock to lose my senses." Cases like these make the wisdom of the proposal of the Minister very doubtful. Surely we can leave this matter alone until our men return.- I trust that the proposal will not be insisted upon. Parliament has always held that the Australian soldier must be tried for a capital offence only in a judicial Court before a jury of. his peers. A" court martial takes always a military view of offences. Its members are not trained to' sift evidence, and although good and capable men, their . judgment is warped by a bias of which they are not conscious. No court martial should have the right to deprive a man of his life. I am certain that many members opposite hold this view. A court- martial should not have the right to take the life of a voluntary soldier - because he is supposed to have committed murder. I use the wor'd " supposed " advisedly, because the man who is on trial for his life may not have been morally responsible for what he did. If moral responsibility for the crime could be proved, there might be some justification for the infliction of the death penalty, but it cannot be proved in the case of men suffering from shell shock. A court martial is not 'a. fit court to try a man for his life. </para>
                    <para>Apart from this proposal, the Bill seems designed to benefit our gallant men who have been fighting for the liberties df this country, and I am sure that the Minister will be prepared to accept amendments tending to make its purposes more clear, and to insure the giving of preference to those who have been on active service. </para>

                            <para>-Strictly speaking, there should be practically no second-reading speeches on a skeleton measure of this description. However, the provision for permitting the punishment of death is a new one so far as we are concerned, and it is more serious now that for the first time in our history we have been brought face to face with circumstances which even medical authorities do not properly understand. I refer to the effect of shell shock on the nerves. . I saw a man get off  a train six months ago <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> all appearances an absolute cripple. He was bandaged, and was shaking as if he had palsy, yet quite recently he drove me along a country road. When I congratulated him upon his apparently fine recovery, he said that 'any sudden noise was likely to affect him.  His  statement proved true when the armoured tank visited his town, for, although he knew that it was coming, he _ collapsed, and had to be carried to his </para>

His  experience shows what will face us with regard to the treatment of our returned soldiers. Punishment for crime during the last fifty years has been considerably relaxed, yet crime has not increased, and, perhaps, in military circles it would not be amiss to revise the code of punishments, and make it fit better into the circumstances of the times so long as discipline is not affected to any appreciable extent. I hope that the Government will advance solid reasons for the innovation which finds a place in the Bill before the House. </para><para>Another portion of the measure deals with men who have won their spurs on the field, and risen to a rank which they did not hold before they left for the Front, having to drop back on their return to their previous rank, and play junior to other men who could have gone to the Front, but did not do so. The fundamental idea upon which our Australian defence system has been built was that advancement in the Australian Military Forces should be by merit, and I hope . that the military authorities will adhere to that principle as closely as they can. If this Bill does not give men on their return the status which they have earned on the field, I hope that before it leaves the Committee stage we shall see that it does, and make this a settled principle so far as Australia is concerned. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- If that is the case, it is not in keeping with the ideas attempted to be put into legislation since I have been in this House, and I am sure that the House will not tolerate it if it can be avoided. I hope that returned men will get the treatment to which they are entitled, and that they will be given preference as far as possible. Simply because he is a returned soldier a man should not be put in a billet for which he is not fitted ; but where one applies for a position alongside another man who has not been to the Front, he should get the preference if he is just as fitted as the other man is to fill it. Men who have left Australia as non-commissioned officers, and risen to higher rank through their merit, patriotism, and soldierly qualities, should be honored as they have been honored on the field, that is to say, they should retain their rank, and be senior to men who have remained at home and earned the same rank. Any preference should be given to the soldier who has gone abroad, risked his life for his country, and done his duty as nobly as. our Australian men have done. </para>

From my point of view that is an altogether wrong principle, which ought to be resisted by the </para><para class="block">House. I think, that every honorable member will agree with the principle enunciated by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corboy)</inline> that those who have gained their rank on active service should be allowed to retain it when they return, and have seniority over other officers who have seen no active service. There is also a proposed alteration in regard to the death penalty. Only the other day one of our leading officers, Brigadier-General Rosenthal, expressed regret that the death penalty does not apply in the Australian Army, and it would appear that the high officers are anxious to have that very extreme power in respect of members of our Forces. I am in accordance with those other honorable members who have expressed ' strong opposition to giving to military tribunals power to impose the death penalty. I believe that the civil authorities should be superior to the military authority in all matters, and, as the honorable member for Swan pointed out, the soldier should at least have the right to appeal to the civil authorities from any penalty imposed by court martial. As the proposed alterations can be dealt with in detail when the Bill reaches the Committee stage, I shall content myself  now  with merely expressing my opposition to the proposed extension of the death penalty and to the imposing of penalties upon soldiers without taking into consideration whether the -offence was committed intentionally or otherwise. </para></speech>

                        <para>.- If my memory is correct, the Defence Bill, which was introduced while the Labour party was in power in 1911-13, contained the same provision in regard to the death penalty as is contained in the Bill now before the House, but the party at that time declined to entertain the proposal, and provision Was made for all sentences to be reviewed by the Executive. Now that the war is practically over, I think that the Ministry would be wise not to persist with this provision. </para>

While the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce Smith)</inline> was speaking in regard to the inability of Duntroon cadets to rise beyond a certain rank, I interjected that the reason was that many of the cadets came from the industrial classes. In order that my remark may not' be misunderstood, I wish to. explain that the original examination papers required the candidate to state the occupation of his parents, and. when the results were issued we found that no candidate whose parents followed an industrial occupation was included in the first twenty-five. I think that later the examination paper was altered. That was my reason for saying, that some candidates have not been able to gain promotion because their parents belonged to the industrial class. </para>

                        <para>.- In common with other honorable members who have spoken, I desire to say how pleased I was to listen to the remarks of the new soldier member <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corboy).</inline> He created a most favorable impression, and I am sure that he will prove to be a decided acquisition to the Chamber. It is my privilege to have had something to do with courts martial. On a number of occasions I was in charge of prisoners who were standing their trial, and whilst, generally speaking, the men had an excellent opportunity of defending themselves against the allegations made against them, yet there were times when the soldier did not receive the consideration he should have had, because those who were trying him were suffering to a great extent, from the same complaint as afflicted the soldier when he committed the offence. Those who have had experience of modern warfare know that it is impossible for a man after enduring privation and shock, as many' of our men have done, to view matters in a calm and judicial manner. I think the Ministry will be wise in dropping this particular clause relating to punishments. </para>

I am sure that there was absolutely no desire on his part to inflict injury upon that comrade; but, unfortunately,  whilst tinder the influence of drink - and his condition was accentuated no doubt by the nerve-racking strain through which he was passing - he fired the fatal shot. He was not responsible for his action. We should be extremely foolish if we were to allow cases to be tried and dealt with by men who themselves have.. to pass through such a time of strain and stress. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">(By leave.)</inline> - It is a matter of considerable anxiety to honorable members that certain contradictory statements regarding the sale of Australian wheat have recently appeared in the press. Hitherto I have not thought it advisable or permissible to give either to Parliament or the public much of the information relating to this matter; but the recriminations and statements have taken such a novel and extraordinary form that I am going to tear aside the veil of secrecy and tell the House the whole story. It is an unusual course, and will involve the reading of some secret messages that have passed between the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Governor-General of Australia. It is usual in such cases to obtain permission by express message from the Secretary of State for the Colonies. In view of the necessity for at once putting this matter in its right light before the public of Australia, I have not been able to follow that course.

On the other Hand, they appreciate political and financial difficulties of Commonwealth Government, and attach importance from their stand-point to unification of control of whole of exportable surplus and of all tonnage available for overseas trade. Provided that latter objects were fully attained, they feel that they would be in position to justify participation in Commonwealth financial liabilities as regards 1917-1918 crop. As regards finance, an arrangement would have to be made to obviate further accumulation of Australian sterling balances here by setting off payments for wheat against sums due by Commonwealth Government to British Government Departments. </para>

At the time, I was very ill, and I am not sure now whether that cable from the Prime Minister is locked up in the safe at the Treasury or in the Prime Minister's office. But I remember very well the substance of it, and it was . to the effect that the Prime Minister had been negotiating with the British authorities, that he regarded the situation as serious, and desired me to confer discreetly with the members of the Australian "Wheat Board, with a view to giving him power to sell to the best possible advantage. Answering that cablegram in its spirit, I sent the cablegram I have just read dated 6th July. I may say  that  the arrears referred to were then, speaking from memory, £47,000,000. If we were to sell all our wheat, and for it the Treasurer were to get nothing but a credit against that amount of £47,000,000, it would seriously have dislocated the finances of this country. </para>

At meeting Wheat Board, 29th August, which I attended, I set out fully present position, mentioning you have been giving matter close attention in Great Britain, but so far without success. I 'referred also to overdraft for -payment for which banks are pressing, and to guarantee for 1018-1919 crop and to necessity for effecting a sale. After discussion, Board unanimously agreed to give you free hand, but asked that you would not sell under 4s. 6d. without cabling me. I told them that Commonwealth Government must for future have sufficient control over preservation methods to be able to give guarantee to Imperial authorities of careful and uniform measures. Board agreed, and you may assure Government that every requirement of their Australian Commissioner will be attended to. I regard sale as absolutely imperative from stand-point finance.

Acting upon express approval of Wheat Board in their telegram, I placed wheat under offer to British Government at 38s. per quarter, and they accepted. The reason why sale has not been definitely made is because of certain conditions British Government wish to insert in contract, to which I take objection, and to certain conditions, including provision for half profits, that I desire inserted, to which the British Government say they cannot agree. I am seeing Chancellor to-morrow to try and get matter definitely settled. If Board is not willing take 38s., I will, of course, refrain from signing contract; but Board must take full responsibility for this, and should be notified that it is quite hopeless to attempt secure higher price from British Government, and there is no other buyer. </para>
                        <para>In my opinion, best thing we can do is sell wheat as arranged. There is no prospect of being able ship quantity available from coming harvest 1918-19 during next twelve months, to say nothing of present unsold surplus. If we can get rid of 1917-18 and balance of 1916-17 surplus, at 38s, and wheat market is favorable, we can, as far as shipping facilities permit, sell new wheat at then market rates, if British Government is prepared purchase present surplus, and give us right to sell new wheat in markets of world. Board should also be notified that, in my opinion, British Government, owing to bountiful harvest in England and large stocks already purchased in Australia, is anxious to avoid completing contract, and will welcome opportunity to break off negotiations. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is all the correspondence of any vital character whatever, in any Government or departmental files, regarding this matter. </para>
                    <para>I want to say, now, two or three things about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Grahame's  statement. I have not yet received a reply, by the way, from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman.</inline> However, the wheels of government grind slowly, but this lot will grind exceeding small. First, as to the statement that we would be doing a smart thing in selling weevilly wheat to Great Britain, I had an interview this morning with the Victorian Minister of Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Oman).</inline> He indignantly repudiated that we should send one bag of weevilly wheat to Britain, and during this day, since our interview, he has confirmed that attitude in the course of remarks uttered when introducing 'a measure before the State Legislature – a copy of which remarks has been sent to me. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oman</inline> also confirmed what he had said in the earlier conversation with myself as to the actual facts as known to the Wheat Board of Australia, and he contradicted emphatically the suggestions and the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grahame.</inline> If there is anything that would poison Australia's reputation or put off the sale of this important staple product, it would be a statement of that kind going to Britain. And I intend, if I am in time, to see that that statement is not cabled to Great Britain, whether the man who made it likes it or not. I would go so far as to exercise the censorship in this matter. We do not want to take down Great Britain ; but we want - in the language of the Prime Minister's telegrams- a square deal. If we can get it, it will be of enormous value to Australia, whether the farmers who are now talking of 5sv 6s., and 7s. a bushel, agree with it or not. </para>
                    <para>There are quite a number of men in the various associations of farmers throughout Australia who think they know much more about the actual position than the Governments who are in receipt of all the latest information possible. And while I do not claim infallibility for this or for any other Government in Australia, I emphasize that information is as important a matter on which to form judgment at this critical time as is anything else. These men have nothing to go on except newspaper  cackle and  gammon. I had' always been under the impression that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grahame</inline> was a clear-headed political thinker; but, apparently, he has quite confused the facts, and does not understand the difference between an offer and a sale. The position is that we have offered this wheat. I have had no word since March last of a sale. If I could have told the House of these things at the time, I would have done so; but business of this kind cannot -. be conducted except with due regard to secrecy, up to the time, at any rate, when agreements are registered. . I point out the difficulty of doing business of this character when surrounded by an atmosphere of rumour, accusation, and attack. The Governments throughout Australia who have been concerned in the whole subject have been constantly subjected to this mode of approach, and tq the suggestion of suspicion and ineptitude, when all the time  I am sure that the Governments, having no axe to grind at all, have been endeavouring solely to uphold the wheat growers' interests. I was not associated with the promulgation of Pool arrangements. I was, like most other honorable members, just a student of the matter inside of Parliament. But from what I have since been able to learn of the different Governments who have handled .the matter - both Commonwealth and State - I make bold to assert that, irrespective of changing parties, the Governments have co-operated with wonderful zeal and effect. And, if we go back now to the best wheat; minds in Australia - glowers, or dealers, or men understanding both ends of the trade - they will admit that, but for this co-operative work, in which the Governments, and the banks, and the growers have joined, wheat, instead of being in the region of 4s. or 5s. a bushel, would have been bought for an old hat. It is just as well that the farmers should understand that. I do not blame the average farmer, because he is the victim, generally, of certain people who try to lead him - commission mongers, very largely, as an honorable member interjects. He is a hardworking man who keeps his nose very close down to the plough, the drill, and the reaper; and he should know that the Governments concerned have not been bent on robbing, but on helping him. In ^.saying that, I give no more testimony to the endeavours of this Government than I do to those of the States concerned who have been handling the matter. </para>
                    <para>Until this particular matter is cleared up by a frank admission on the part of the members of the Board who have made these statements, I shall see that the Prime Minister does nothing further in London to sell this wheat. We cannot go on being treated like pickpockets, . when we . are doing our best as public trustees. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps they are; but, whether they are or are not, there, is a limit to our patience in the face of attacks such as these. I am looking forward, not only to the control and disposal of the wheats that we have in Australia to-day, but to the wheat now on the stem, and in the paddock. And I say this to the grower in any of the four wheat States of the Commonwealth, that if he believes he can attend to this matter better than the Governments, then this. Government will be prepared to help him take charge of his wheat problem himself. In that problem there will be questions of stacking, of preserving, of reconditioning, of shipping, of selling, and of financing. It is a gigantic business, and if the farmer thinks he can do it with a better return to himself, then let him take it on. Any proposition having that object  in view will receive very prompt and also sympathetic consideration on ' the part of the Commonwealth Government. </para>

I cannot say anything worse than that. I am not at present attaching blame to anybody, but am trying to sketch a political situation. After many months of careful thought, I say if there is a better position than the one that the Governments of Australia have attempted to find for the wheat-grower, the wheat-grower ought to suggest it to the Government, and the Government will help him. As to the future Pool, it will depend upon some such understanding whether it is formed or not. I point out to some of the wheat-growing representatives, who are allowing their attention to stray, that, until there is a complete understanding for the new season, there will to no future Pool in which the Federal Government will join. If, however, it is made perfectly clear that the farmer still wants us to go on doing this work, we will do it as well as we are able, and do it, I hope, as I have endeavoured to show, with the addition of true farming representation on the central control body, </para>

I say that, speaking as finance Minister. I think the House will be grateful for this information. If it does not set at rest this atmosphere of recrimination and suspicion, I do not think anything will. If honorable members want to see the documents I have read from, they are at perfect liberty to do so, but I venture to think that I have made as full an explanation as the documentary evidence and records of the Departments will allow me to make. </para>

                        <para>Your telegram to-day. Minister Agriculture made statement in conversation, and not for publication. He said: " Three months ago we. instructed the Prime Minister to sell- " "Instruct" is rather good - " He placed it under option to British Commission, who now were prepared to accept, and the Board, at its meeting on Monday, authorized the Prime Minister to conclude sale for 1,000,000 tons." He added, "The British Government had already close upon 2,000,000 tons in Australia, and it was a good thing to part with wheat at the price, rather than keep it here to be eaten by weevils." - (Signed) Fuller, for Premier. </para>

                    <para>.- I had intended to urge the Acting Prime Minister to give serious consideration to the announcement he made to the House five or six weeks ago, that the States would be asked to appoint representatives to the Central Wheat Board. The reason why there is so much dissatisfaction amongst the farmers is that they compare their position with the position of the wool-growers, who have the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falkiner)</inline> and other representatives on the Central Wool Board, and the farmers naturally think they should have representation on the Wheat Board. Instead of this, we find men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grahame</inline> on it, a very estimable man, who knows nothing about wheat-growing in a practical sense, and various Ministers for Agriculture. Governments come and go, and thus those men are only temporarily on the Board, so that different people constitute it at different periods, most of them being inexperienced. Right from the inception of the Wheat Pools I have urged in this House- </para>

If that is done it will give satisfaction. </para>

                    <para>.- T  wish to direct the attention of the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> to the published report of a statement by Sir Robert McC. Anderson, who, I believe, is called General Anderson. In it he makes an attack upon the two representatives of Australia now in London. No one has fought harder than I have against the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> but I personally resent the action of a man like <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Anderson in descending to the language attributed to him, if he has been properly reported. The statement is quite in keeping with his action on a previous occasion, when he maligned ' and libelled General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Archibald</inline> Murray. Then, to get a little kudos here when he came back, he said that General Murray had declared he would rather lose 18,000 Tommies - Scotchmen,' Englishmen, Irishmen, or Welshmen - than 5,000 Australians. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Anderson has never been man en'ough to produce his proofs, and what do we now find him saying? Speaking in Sydney yesterday, as reported in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of this day, he said - </para>

                    <para>The Federal Government should utilize Colonel Murdoch's services in the clearing up in Britain on behalf of Australia. If it were true that our envoys in England were "not playing speaks," there was all the more reason to employ Colonel Murdoch. It was perturbing to think that, by the folly of two men, Australia might lose her honour and lustre. It would seem that one was  a  megalomaniac and! the other  a  fool, and it was not fair that Australia should be represented like that. </para>
                    <para>I resent that. I have proved as far as I could that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Anderson told an untruth about an English officer, and that he has not been man enough to produce his proofs, and I resent his statement as published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> to-day. I suppose that men with stars on their breasts, men who have won the Military Cross, the Distinguished Service Order, and other distinctions have to "flap-doodle" to a man like that, and I hope the Government will take action in regard to the statements of this fictitious General, because, after all, he is not a General in the true sense of the word, and bring him to book. It might be as well, also, if the Government would inform the House just " how much money this fictitious General is obtaining in the way of salary and allowances, and let us have a clear statement as to the extent by which the country has benefited from his services. </para>
                    <para>Mr.Watt. - After recent experiences, I should feel inclined to inquire whether he has been correctly reported, because I cannot imagine any man saying what is attributed to him in this report. </para>

                <para>I want now to bring another matter under the notice of the Acting Prime Minister. This is the end of the week, and I feel that the days of grace permitted to us by the quarantine regulations are slipping by. The position is exceedingly alarming when a town like Wellington, New Zealand, with a population of 70,000, and with suburbs of 130,000, has lost 600 people by deaths from influenza, and when a place like Christchurch reports 2,500 cases. We should leave no stone unturned to prevent influenza gaining a hold in Australia. The Commonwealth Government should make a courteous request to all the medical men throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth to offer their services voluntarily in order that they might be organized to fight this dread disease should it make its appearance here. As one who has been connected with the Recruiting Committee in Victoria during the whole of the war period, I can commend the services of Captain Dyett as an organizer, and I suggest that arrangements be at once made to publish information throughout Australia, so that the people may know what are the symptoms of this disease, and what to do. I speak with personal knowledge of this matter, because I was connected with London hospitals when the Russian influenza was raging in Great Britain from 1880 to 1888, and when one who was very dear to me died from that disease. The hospitals then were overcrowded. I am not attributing neglect to the present Minister, but I impress upon him and honorable members the seriousness of the position. We have been told that the death-rate from influenza in America exceeds the total casualties from the war. Surely this is sufficient to arouse the Government to action. We have been told also that 80 per cent, of the population of Samoa has been stricken with the disease. It is urgently necessary that more energy should be shown in preparing to fight the disease in Australia. It is now about a fortnight since I asked questions in regard to this matter, and I think that the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett),</inline> who supported me, will agree that we have not had reason to be quite satisfied with what has been done. I hope, therefore, that the Acting Prime Minister will take a hand, though I am sorry to add to the many duties that now fall to his lot, and see that something is done. </para>

                    <para>.- Statements that have been made in connexion with the administration of the Wheat Board and rumours that have been in circulation in the city for a week past must undoubtedly do great harm to one of our most important industries. We cannot allow the wheat-growing industry of Australia to be the catspaw of politicians or any other persons, because  it is the foundation of Australia's prosperity. We cannot for a single moment permit anything which might be detrimental to its interest to continue. Though the statement made by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> shows clearly that, as far as he is concerned, he has had no connexion in any shape or form with it, the action of the Government in censoring certain statements at Ouyen made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Giles,</inline> the farmers' representative on the Wheat Board, have resulted in an unsatisfactory impression being formed. Rightly or wrongly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Giles'</inline> statements were censored. I think that very grave injury was done to the Board itself by that action. It would have been better, I think, if an investigation had been made into the complaint, so that if his statements were not correct, he could have been exposed, and if they were correct, efforts could have been made to remedy them. The position to-day is, I fear, fraught with very great danger to the industry. It has been said for some days past that certain people had prior information, and that there has been a great deal of speculation going on. </para>

I hope that during the next few days the Acting Prime Minister will see whether a scheme cannot be promulgated under which the grower will obtain more satisfaction than he has had in the past. By large Committees consisting of men who are not conversant with business affairs things may not be so well conducted; but, if the producers of each State have their representative on the Board, they will be more intimately acquainted with what is being done, and will get first-hand information, and this will make them more satisfied than they are now. </para>
