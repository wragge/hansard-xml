                        <para>- The attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> the Leader of the Labour party in the Senate, towards recruiting is well known . He and I were the representatives of the Federal party at the Conference convened by the Governor-General. He has, since the Conference, in the press, and, I think, on the platform, advocated voluntary recruiting. The Leader of the New South Wales Labour party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. Storey),</inline> who was also at the Conference, has done the same. Unfortunately <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elmslie,</inline> the late Leader of the Labour party in Victoria, died soon after the Conference, but those who knew him know what he would have done had his health permitted. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jolley,</inline> the Leader of the Labour party in South Australia, and a member of the Conference, has, since it was held, advocated voluntary recruiting from the public, platform, and was, prior to the Conference, and is still, a member of the State Recruiting Committee. The Premier of Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan,</inline> who also attended the Conference as a Labour representative, is at the present time actively engaged in addressing recruiting meetings, as the Minister for Recruiting <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Orchard)</inline> can testify. This week <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> addressed, I believe, a meeting in Queen-street, Brisbane, at which 6,000 persons attended. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier,</inline> the Leader of the Labour party in Western Australia, another member of the Conference, has, since the Conference separated, been ' actively engaged in recruiting work, and I read in the newspapers that the  Deputy  Leader of the Labour party in Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ogden,</inline> was present at the meeting which opened the recruiting campaign in that State, and did his best to get recruits. The names I have mentioned include all the parliamentary Labour leaders of the Commonwealth, and of the six States, and all the Labour parliamentarians who attended the Conference, and in justice to them and to the movement I have made these facts known. </para>

                    <para>- I had no intention of asking the public to draw the inference that has been drawn by the newspaper that has been mentioned. In answer to an interjection, I commented on the vigorous way in which the Leader of the Opposition has always supported voluntary recruiting, and I am sorry that the interjection has caused misapprehension, but that was not its intention. I do not wish to differentiate between members opposite. Yesterday I invited the full cooperation of the House in the matter of recruiting, as I have always done since I took my present position. Later I shall make a statement regarding the sessional arrangements, and I shall invite the cooperation of members, during the parliamentary recess, in the advancement of recruiting in the country. I am sure that the influence of members' speeches will be salutary and will be visible in the recruiting returns. </para>

                        <para>- Yesterday the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> asked, as a third of a series of questions on notice, if it was "the practice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham</inline> to accept one-third of the fees received by the barristers under a system whereby a solicitor delivered to a barrister, say <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.B.,</inline> a brief marked  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.B.,</inline> for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham,</inline> 15 guineas,' and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.B.</inline> will have to appear in the case and hand over one-third of the fee to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham?"</inline> My answer to the question was that no such arrangement was known to the Department. To that answer I wish to add, in justice to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham,</inline> that the practice of delivering to a barrister a brief on behalf of another barrister on active service was adopted in Victoria by the Attorney-General's Department several years ago, at the request of the Bar Council. It is understood that a similar practice has for several years prevailed in England. So far as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham</inline> is concerned, however, this practice has not been applied by the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, at the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham</inline> joined the Navy Department, he held from the CommonWealth several briefs in pending cases. These he surrendered, and the Commonwealth, thereupon briefed fresh counsel quite independently of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham.</inline></para>

                        <para>- Yesterday a question was asked regarding the prayer with which our proceedings are opened each day, and it was suggested that an addition should be made to the form of words used. On several occasions in the past I have suggested that the wording of the prayer should be amended, by the substitution of the word " deliberations " for the word " consultations," which, in Australia, has a meaning altogether dissociated from prayer. I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> whether, . when the Standing Orders Committee is considering the alteration of the prayer, consideration can be given to my suggestion? </para>

                        <para>- I am informed, from a source that is very correctly primed, that there are now 3,000 tons of surplus leather held in the Commonwealth. That leather is worth over £600,000, and tanners and their employees are in a serious position because its exportation is prohibited. The Board of Shipping gave its consent to the exportation of a certain quantity of leather from Sydney by the ship <inline font-style="italic">Llansephen Castle,</inline> but, unfortunately, the order came to hand twenty-four hours after the vessel had left the harbor, carrying away 15,000 raw hides. Will the Acting Prime Minister do something to assist the tanning industry, both from the employers' and employees' standpoint, by allowing the exportation of surplus leather? </para>

                        <para>- The Government is fully aware of the importance of the tanning industry from many points of view in regard to both production and employment. For a considerable time it has been pressing the British authorities to allow greater freedom in the export of Australian leathers to Britain. For some reason, which we have not been able to fully appreciate, there is a practical embargo against such export. Leather is not on the list of priorities that the British Government allow. As the result of further representations, we obtained, on the occasion referred to by the honorable member, a special permission, which I understood had considerably relieved the tanning trade. </para>

The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> this morning, in referring to the interchange which took place last night between the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> and myself, states that the honorable member said there were members of the Opposition who " saw the light " but did not follow it owing to the pressure of a section flying, not the Australian, but the Red flag. It then goes on to say that i " interjected and smiled." That is inaccurate. As a matter of fact, I was laughing at a thought that was in my mind- </para>

In view of the existence in Brisbane of every facility for the carrying out of such repairs, will the honorable gentleman see that the work is done there, thus avoiding a delay of many days during which the vessel could be profitably employed? </para>

The honorable member originated his question upon the report of a deputation which I had received in Sydney at the time of the Premiers' Conference, and I then said I had undertaken to collect from the Department the military objections to the proposal and to forward them to the Highland societies from whom representations had been made to me on the subject. That has been done, and these societies in New South Wales have undertaken, I understand, to endeavour to meet the objections. So far I have not received their answers. </para>

I do not know' that if the Commonwealth were to insure our own boys who are going overseas the result would be to minimize the cost to any extent. I shall, however, make inquiries as to the practice in the United States. I understand that, in addition to or apart from their pension system, they have established some system of insurance of soldiers. I will ascertain the basis of it. </para>

                        <para>. - It is a mere bagatelle to ask for authority to raise another £80,000,000 by way of war loans, but we can easily see that very soon the Commonwealth Government will have an indebtedness of about £500,000,000, and the Government are showing no evidence of any desire on their part to compel those people who can afford to pay to contribute their fair share of the war expenditure. I am not in the habit of making statements which I cannot prove. I am sure that 90 per cent. of the £80,000,000 which will be contributed to the loans which will be author ized by this Bill will be contributed from excess war profits, which have been made out of the community generally and which the Government should get without having to pay interest. This statement of mine may be considered a very wild one, but if the Government had done their duty they would have compelled the people who are making money out of the war to pay for the cost of the war. The Commonwealth expenditure was £28,000,000 prior to 1914, and we were told that the taxation which was imposed to meet that expenditure was excessive, but I am of opinion that it will cost us £60,000,000 to administer Commonwealth affairs when the war comes to an end. If the taxation necessary to produce a revenue of £28,000,000 from a paltry 5,000,000 people was considered too much, how are we to raise £60,000,000 when the majority of our soldiers will return to us in a very much impaired condition, as compared to their virility prior to the war, unless those who are making money are taxed to the fullest possible extent! I can quite understand why a section of the Government's supporters are satisfied, with the position, but it is natural to suppose that there are hundreds of thousands of people supporting the Government who are not well off, and they will have to pay while others who are supporting the Government will go on increasing their banking accounts. I do not wish to weary the House with my impressions on this matter, but it seems foolish to talk of economy, as some conservative politicians and the conservative press teach it, that is, by lowering wages aud impairing the service rendered by Government utilities, when we are borrowing £80,000,000 from people who will make the most of it out of war profits. </para>

                    <para>One matter that should receive great attention from the Government is that of shipbuilding. The necessity for the building of ships has been made apparent every day durng this war. It has been recognised now for over three years. I do not blame any Minister or any Government in regard to the delay that has taken place, but I claim that a Government which makes such a pretence about having a greater desire to win the war than any other Government have had, should have been farseeing enough to commence the building of ships long ago. Instead of that, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> conceived the idea of being able to build these vessels without any interference from unions, and 'to that end he held a number of conferences with representatives of the workers at which some sort of agreement, not a unanimous one, was reached. Yet nothing has been done, because we are told that we can do nothing without material. But when the idea was first conceived arrangements should have been made to get the necessary material. The Government started in a wrong fashion with the unions, and made one of the silliest arrangements possible. In the Government shipyards the rule was laid down that there should be piecework, and to this the unions objected. However, some sort of an arrangement was come to, a number of the unions reluctantly agreeing to the condition. In spite of this, no further progress has been made; and the farce is that, while there is to be piece-work, contracts have been let without calling for tenders. Three firms - two in Victoria and one in another State - have been given contracts at a fixed price for the construction of engines and other necessary parts for the vessels, but not, as ought to have been the case, in open market. Why should these firms - one the Castlemaine Foundry, and another in the Prime Minister's electorate of Bendigo - be selected and given this advantage? The farce is rendered still more glaring by the fact that private firms which are manufacturing other parts, have the work done by day labour, as in the past. Either the contractors are getting special consideration, for some reason that I do not know, or the Government realize that their insistence on piecework will be a failure, especially in certain directions, aud are adopting this plan so as to avoid admitting the failure.  Apparently this sort of thing is to be permitted to go on unchallenged; at any rate, any remarks on the subject from this side fall on deaf ears. If there is a desire on the part of the press to ventilate the subject, the War Precautions Act is put into operation, so that there is no opportunity to show how inefficient the plans of the Government are. We ought to know why the Government are departing from the ordinary rule of letting contracts, and why a system found good enough for private firms cannot be followed in the Government shipyards. Of course, there is a certain strain of parochialism in every man. I have often said that you have only to scratch a man a little deeply to find that he is a Statesrighter ; and no doubt we all have a desire that the places we represent shall have a fair proportion of the public work. Why are firms in my electorate, or in other electorates, not given an opportunity to compete with the firms at Castlemaine and Bendigo? If the Government can adopt procedure of this kind without being called to account, their supporters are willing to stand anything. </para>
                    <para>We are told that the Australian workman is the cause of all the trouble; that the Government had to insist on piecework because the workers here are never satisfied, and always demanding higher wages. On this account, it is said, we cannot construct ships as cheaply here as they are built in America, but that is not a fact, because the wages there are high enough to drive our dear old Conservative employers into fits if they had to pay them. For instance, I have here an American shipbuilding agreement between the California Metal Trades Association and the California Foundryman's Association on the one part, and the Iron Trades Council of San Francisco on the other part. This agreement is intended to prevent industrial troubles, which I can tell honorable members are quite as great in America as they are here. Further, the wages are higher in America, and the demands of the workmen are quite as persistent as those in Australia. Yet in America they are building ships efficiently under the order of things that is desired in Australia. In the agreement to which I have referred, it is laid down - </para>

                    <para class="block">We are told that it is impossible to construct shipping here by the day-labour system, under which the men will not work, and which proves too costly; but in most skilled trades in Australia the wages are not nearly so high as in America. For instance, machinists are paid $5.80, or about 24s. a day; machinist specialists, $4.40; machinists' helpers, $3.96, or about 16s. a day; while, in Australia, the last-mentioned are paid only about 8s. 6d. Pattern-makers in America are paid $7.15, or about 30s. a day, as contrasted with not quite half that amount in Australia. In America, blacksmiths' helpers are paid $4.30; anglesmiths, $5.80 ; heaters, $4.95 ; pipe fitters, $5.80; and so on until shipwrights, boatbuilders, and millmen are paid $6.60, or 27s. 6d.; caulkers, $7.15, or 29s. 3d. per day; and labourers and helpers, $3.57, or 14s.101/2d. a day. Here there is a howl because shipwrights and so on are paid 15s. a day and demand that when they go to Williamstown from their homes in the city they shall be paid their fares and their time in travelling. Further, in America, with such wages as these, ships are constructed more cheaply than in Australia. I fancy that if the dear old gentlemen, the employers of Australia, were asked to pay anything like 29s. 3d. to caulkers they would go into a permanent fit; nevertheless, in America ships are being turned out like sausages, while, as yet, we have made no attempt at construction. I am sorry the Minister in charge of these matters is not present, because I know the other day, when I was making some remarks, he felt that I was attacking him when I ought to be helping him. It is very evident that it is not the fault of the unionists of Australia that our shipbuilding cannot be proceeded with; and there ought to be genius enough in Australia, as in America, to remove the industrial troubles by the simple expedient of not insisting on piece-work. . If the old plan can be followed in America, with the big wages I have quoted, there is no reason why it cannot be followed here. Of course, I know that it was a great conception, on the part of the Government to catch the public ear with the name of the "Win-the-war" party. </para>

                            <para>- The British Chancellor of the Exchequer has to face a more critical House. On his own side are a number of critics, and, although the recent vote of confidence in the British Prime Minister was carried by a majority of 106 votes, I believe that at least 200 members of the House of Commons deemed it their duty not to take part in the division. </para>

                    <para>The Treasurer has not told the country what are our obligations in regard to the war. I find that a great deal of the £S0,000,000 to be raised under the authority of this Bill will be devoted to expenditure which will continue for many years after peace is declared, and which therefore ought to be met out of revenue. For instance, we used to finance from revenue expenditure on the Naval Bases at Flinders, Cockburn Sound, and Port Stephens, but the Treasurer proposes that expenditure on such works shall be met out of loan. Expenditure on the Navy, too, will probably continue for a century, according to the present outlook, and, therefore, cannot be legitimately charged to loan account. By our present extravagant expenditure we are incurring obligations which will make it impossible for us to carry out our promises to the men we are sending to the Front. We have never sat down quietly and considered what we ought to do, in justice to Australia and the Empire, in the sending of men to the Front, and in the financing of our part in the war, presuming that the war will last as long as some people believe it will. Australia is maintaining the whole of its soldiers from the time they are enlisted. Neither Canada nor South Africa is doing that, and it must be borne in mind that we are paying 6s. per day to our soldiers, whilst the soldiers in Great Britain are receiving only ls. 6d. per day. We ought to consider whether we shall be in a position after the war to carry out our duties to the men who go to the Front. We have promised to maintain them, and their dependants, while they are away, and to support them, if necessary, on their return. </para>

                    <para>In Brisbane, recently, the Premier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> had occasion to complain of the action of some returned soldiers. The Queensland Government had appointed to an official position in connexion with the Returned Soldiers Institute an ex-member of Parliament, and surely the fact that a man has been a member of Parliament, but has had the misfortune to lose his seat, is no reason why he should be excluded from a position which he is qualified to occupy. I believe that the gentleman appointed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McMinn,</inline> is duly qualified for the position, but when he presented himself at the Institute the soldiers metaphorically kicked him out. They told him to go. According to a paragraph in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of to-day, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Fry</inline> said at a meeting in Brisbane last night that it was the determination of the soldiers to " show the Government that they cannot monkey with dangerous men." That is a threat of force. Quite recently I pointed out to honorable members that the capital city of Washington was established because some soldiers attacked the State House and posted armed men at all entrances, giving members twenty minutes in which to make up their minds as to whether or not they would agree to the soldiers' demands. </para>

And Professor J. A. Hobson, an economist of some standing, has pointed out that for some years capital will be able to exact a high toll at the gate of industry. </para>

The point I wish to stress to-day is that the war aims of the Government as stated by the Prime Minister, the Acting Prime Minister, and the Minister for the Navy are such as should not be indorsed by this House. Those aims should not be used as an argument for sending soldiers to the Front. If we adhere to the war aims set forth in August, 1914, when we told the world that we were entering upon a holy war, well and good; but if we are to send men to the Front and incur heavy obligations for war aims that are extending from month to month, then it is time that we seriously took into consideration the statement made by the Acting Prime Minister on behalf of his </para>

                            <para>- It is unpopular in this House to say that we should attempt to obtain peace by negotiation, and should not try to deliver what has been termed the "knock-out blow." Honorable members of this House and their followers outside say that whatever may be the occasion for talking peace, it is not the time to do so when the Germanic powers are delivering an- offensive, and we are being pushed back from territory that we hold. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law, has stated that it is possible for an army that has the necessary munitions, and is willing to make the necessary sacrifice of life, to win territory by concentration on certain points. Suppose I agree that this is not the time for talking peace, will our friends, when the offensive has been stopped, as I believe it will be, and another stalemate occurs, say that it will then be reasonable to try for peace by negotiation. </para>

                            <para>- When the British and their Allies were driving back the Germans and Austrians, those who spoke peace were proclaimed enemies of their country. The Prime Minister's vocabulary was full of terms of abuse for them. We, in Australia, are living in a' calm atmosphere, far from the sound of the bursting shells; and, except for the dreadful oppression which sits upon those of us who read what is happening elsewhere, and see our men returning maimed and sometimes blinded, and know the widows and orphans that are being made, there might appear to be no war. Honorable members opposite cannot suggest to me the time when we might try for peace by nego°tiation. They say, " We are going for a victorious peace; we are going to crush the Germans, and to drive them back to Berlin." As I believe that we cannot deliver a knock-out blow, it is my duty at all time3 to ask for an honorable peace by means of negotiation. </para>

                            <para>- Wo have heard of a great harbor in New Guinea that would hold the whole German Navy; but what would the German Navy be doing there? The Consul-General for our ally, Japan, has stated that the Pacific Islands must never be given back to Germany. He says that " it is the strong desire of Japan, as well as of Australia and New Zealand, that these islands shall never be handed back to Germany, because, if they were, the peace of the Pacific would not be regarded as secure from the operation of a threatening and dangerous element." If Germany's possessions are not handed back to her, there will be a cause for future wars. Honorable members say that they want to secure the permanent peace and freedom of the world; but they cannot get that if they are bent on annexing the territory of their enemy.  President  Wilson, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balfour,</inline> and others have said that they are not in favour of annexation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balfour,</inline> the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, has said, " We certainly did not go into the war for what is called an Imperialist policy. We certainly did. not go into the war to get indemnities " ; and  President  Wilson's speeches are full of statements to the effect that America is not in the war for annexations or for indemnities. </para>

                    <para>Those who say that the islands of the Pacific belong to the mainland of Australia will have to admit that, if they applied the same principle elsewhere, the British Islands, which are hardly more than an hour's steaming from Calais, belong to Europe. Ministers either are not serious or they have not fully considered the fact that we have a territory which will take us centuries to develop, and that it would be better to devote our energies to its development than to diffuse them by spending money in other places. The Governor-general, speaking at Arncliffe, in New South Wales, on the 17th March last, said - </para>

                    <para class="block">Then does the Win-the-War Ministry deem itself justified in announcing that we are going to take the Pacific Islands? Another war aim that has been stated by the Prime Minister is contained in the resolutions of the Paris Conference, which provide for preferential trading between the allied countries and the boycotting of Germanic goods for all time. This is an aim which has been given as a reason for continuing to spend money for the crushing of Germany as a reason why we should go on until we administer the "knock-out" blow. All the evidence, however, is opposed to the idea of effect ever being given to the Paris Conference resolutions.

It was said that, since Germany was " squealing for peace," any person in the Allied countries who would talk of peace at that time was either an enemy or a lunatic.

                            <para>- I cannot help remarking that the hilarity of honorable members opposite is quite out of place. We are discussing a Bill to authorize a war loan of £80,000,000. Many of our soldiers are being killed at the Front. and we have to make provision for their dependants. The attitude of honorable members opposite shows that members of the so-called Win-the-war party have very little regard for the welfare of our soldiers at the Front. and think little of the very great probability that we shall not be able to fulfil our obligations to these soldiers when they come back, and that they will be in a position that will bring about civil war in this country.  </para>

The honorable member practically meant that the profit-earning capacity of the pastoralists would be reduced if the price of meat were fixed. We have to remember that while this war is going on, and these large expenditures are being incurred, the rich are becoming .richer and the poor poorer. If we turn to any monthly share-list we find that, in the majority of cases, investment companies, before the war, were poorer than they are to-day. That being so, their shareholders are richer than they were before the war. </para>

To any one who takes an interest in political economy it is startling to discover that, owing to the war, the rich are becoming richer, and that the general masses, who had practically nothing to speak of before the war, are becoming poorer. When confronted with that fact, every honorable member should realize that it is his duty now and henceforth, whether the Germans push back the Allied armies a few miles, or whether we push them back, to urge that our rulers should be prepared to grant the German request for a peace conference. </para>

Of our ability to do this I have no doubt. It is our duty to do it. What were the objects with which we began the war? They were stated by the Prime Minister at a meeting at which I was present. They were summed up in a phrase, very often quoted, " The destruction of Prussian militarism." That is the phrase. Nobody had any doubt nt the time it was used, and I do not think any one has any doubt now as to what it means. It means this, that what we are fighting for is peace now and security for peace in the time to come. That is what it means. </para>

If honorable members would take the time to study the utterances of men at the head of affairs, they would see that a meaning is attached to the phrase that is not given to it in this country. In the matter of militarism there are two contrasts. There is the Zabern incident, where a German citizen refused to salute a German officer and the latter ran his sword through him. Nothing could be more abominable than the form of militarism which leads to that kind of thing. There is another form of militarism, which is practised by us. I love to think of the story told of the late  Colonel Tom  Price when he was in command of a Victorian contingent in the South African war. An agitated British officer approached him one day, paused, and saluted, then took three steps forward, saluted again, and then coming quite close to him said, " <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, I</inline> desire to make a complaint." The colonel said, "What is the matter?" The British officer replied, " I have a complaint to make against your men." " Oh," said  Colonel Price,  ' ' What is it ? " The British officer replied, " They did not salute me." " Now I come to think of it," said Price, " the blighters do not salute me." In the main 1 hope that that kind of thing will characterize Australians for all time. I object to men being compelled by law to salute each other every time they meet. It has the effect of spoiling both men. What has spoiled the Minister, for Defence and made him so absurdly obstinate and vindictive? Nothing but this continual touching of the hat to him. It gives a man a wrong idea of his importance. It gives him what the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> in its references to the Prime Minister, calls " diseased egotism." </para>
                    <para>As to the " war aims," <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Outhwaite,</inline> speaking in the House of Commons, said - ..... 'The war aims of this country, we know now, are not the war aims which were first announced by the Government. It is only a few days ago that the UnderSecretary for Foreign Affairs stated that the secret treaties held good. These treaties clearly show that the Allies from time to time extended their war aims, until now they include vast schemes of territorial aggrandisement. The question to-day, when we are considering finance, is how long will it take us to achieve those war aims, and not the war aims with which we first set out? The treaty between this country, France, and Italy was a treaty of territorial aggrandisement, a treaty for the securing of vast territories for Italy - not only the Trentino, but also the Dalmatian coast, islands in the Adriatic, and even acquisitions in Asia Minor and Northern Africa. They involve the dismemberment of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. How long are we likely to have to fight before Austria-Hungary lays down her arms and submits to virtual unconditional surrender, because that is what the terms of the treaty with Italy involve? And I say, according to the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, it is for those aims we are fighting. Those aims also set out the dismemberment of the Turkish Empire and its partition amongst Italy, France, and Great Britain. Seeing the position to-day of the Turkish Empire, with the secession of Russia from the war, how long are we going to fight until those war aims are achieved ? 2nd then we are told to-day that we have to fight on with the last Englishman and thu last Briush sovereign - or the last piece of British paper money - until Germany has surrendered Alsace-Lorraine, at least, to France. Seeing the war position to-day, as portrayed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, within how many years are we likely to achieve that object. - <inline font-style="italic">(See</inline> House of Commons <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> page 2220, of 7th March, 1918.) </para>

                            <para>- It was brought on by the taunt of the honorable member. He talks about organization. To my mind that should mean scientific Protection for this country, not that organization referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> the other day, when he said that it would be necessary to have a very large measure of Free Trade in England to enable the Home Government to meet the war debt, but a scientific form of Protection which would establish industries in Australia and find employment for our returned soldiers. I thank honorable members for the patience with which they have listened to a speech having for its object the discussion at an early date of peace by negotiation. </para>

                        <para>.- I should hardly have felt it necessary to add my views to those so ably expressed by honorable members on this side had it not been that, as I came into the House this morning, I was informed that some statement I had made was being discussed. I rise partly to explain what that statement really was, and I take the opportunity to say that I intend to vote against the amendment. I do not consider it to be an open amendment; although innocent enough, perhaps, from the point of view of the gentleman by whom it was submitted, it is one which, as shaped, is calculated to entrap honorable members of this side, and place them in a false position. The amendment could not have been conceived with any other purpose, and I am satisfied that just as it has deceived no one in the House, not even honorable members opposite, it will not deceive any person in the whole of Australia. I may say that I am totally opposed to the proposal of the Government to enlist youths under the age of twenty-one without the consent of their parents. At the same time, I wish to give full credit to those statesmen who compose the present Federal Cabinet for the best motives and intentions. My objection to the proposal is simply on the ground that it interferes with parental control. It is quite true that boys of eighteen are being enlisted in almost every country except Australia, but it must be borne in mind that such enlistments in England or elsewhere do not in any way interfere with parental control. In England,France, and the other Allied countries enlistment is compulsory, and does not enable the boy to, as it were, snap his fingers at his parents. In Australia it is optional with young men of all ages to fight for their country and liberties, and, therefore, I hold that when it is made possible for boys of between eighteen and twenty-one to enlist without the consent of their parents we are interfering with parental control. I am totally opposed to the proposal of the Government, even as it has been amended; but, at the same time, I have not the slightest intention of voting for the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition. As I have said, I consider it is moved practically for the purpose of entrapping honorable members on this side and placing them in a false position. </para>

                            <para>- Possibly the honorable member and others opposite have more experience in setting snares than myself, and can speak with authority. However, I wish to thank my friend, the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> who, I regret to say, is not in his place, for having drawn the attention of the House to a statement which I am alleged to have made with regard to the price of stock. I understand that the statement I am supposed to have made is to the effect that fixing the price of meat on a system which was suggested would involve the graziers of Australia in a loss of some £40,000,000 or £45,000,000. I take this opportunity to say that I never made any such statement. The principal authority for the figures I used is a newspaper called The <inline font-style="italic">Farmer's Advocate,</inline> the organ of the Farmers Union of Victoria. What I said was that it had been estimated by competent authorities that the fixing of the price of meat as proposed would result in a reduction in the selling value of the assets of the graziers of Australia by some £40,000,000 or £45,000,000. Honorable members may be puzzled at the distinction which I draw between a reduction in the value of assets and the transference of wealth from one portion of the community to another; but the world is full of instances in which the value of the assets of the people of a country have been enormously diminished without anybody gaining in the remotest degree. I remind honorable members opposite, some of whom take considerable interest in the proceedings of the Bolsheviks of Russia- </para>

                            <para>- I remind the honorable member who cheers me that, while the Bolsheviks may have destroyed the value of the assets - may have destroyed the capital and property of the people of Russia to the extent of hundreds, if not thousands, of millions sterling - not one man. or woman in Russia is at this moment a penny the better off for the destruction. It is possible to bring in measures in Australia which will have the effect of destroying the value of the assets of some of the most industrious, thrifty, and deserving citizens of Australia to the extent of £45,000,000 without making one man or woman in the country a gainer; indeed, we may make the people of Australia worse off, because those whose assets are destroyed provide employment for a large number. </para>

                            <para>- It is grossly untrue - absolutely unsupported by any facts whatever. One man makes the statement, which finds its way into the newspapers or reviews, and a large number of people, who do not think for themselves, repeat and believe it. It has not benn true at any time for the last thirty or forty years; and even if it had been true before the war, it has become grossly untrue since the war. </para>

                            <para>- It cannot be said that the poor have been getting poorer. There is very little evidence that the rich people of the world have been at all enriched by the war; on the contrary, those who had accumulated wealth and substance have lost enormously from a financial point of view. It may be said with a great deal of reason, and with some facts in its favour, that those who are known as the " poor " have been getting richer as a result of the war. I mean that those who have been left behind and take no part in the firing line have been able to earn wages infinitely higher than ever before, and, bearing the cost of living in mind, have been much more prosperous than previously. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Capricornia supported his statement by figures connected with banks and public companies, and I desire to draw attention to some figures relating to such institutions in New South Wales, and printed in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 14th May in a letter from the  Hon.  James Ashton, M.L.C. That gentleman gives the figures relating to six banks and great industrial concerns, and these figures show that, instead of the shares being held by wealthy people, they are, to an enormous extent, held by shareholders with very small individual interests. The figures are so important in view of the .charge made this morning by the honorable member for Capricornia that I think it only right to place them before the House. In the Colonial Sugar Refining Company there are 1,942 shareholders, of whom 1,058 received dividends for the whole year of less than £50 each, only 100 of them receiving over £300. The Bank of New South Wales, another important institution, has 2,107 shareholders, of whom 1,182 received dividends of less than £50, while only 144 received over £300. The Commercial Banking Company has 1,593 shareholders, of whom 924 received dividends under £50, while only ninety received over £300. </para>

The Australian Gaslight Company has 1,599 shareholders, of whom 1,015 received dividends of from 18s. to £45, and only ninety-two received over £270. In Tooth and Company there are 1,341 shareholders, of whom 1,187 receive in dividends £50 and under, and only eighteen receive over £300.- In the Australian Bank of Commerce there are 4,354 shareholders, of whom 2,569 received £2 a year and under, 1,738 received £50 or under, and only one received up to £200. </para>

                    <para>I wish to deal also with the charges that have been made regarding the responsibility for the introduction of tax-free war loans. I remind honorable members that, so far as I have been able to ascertain, war loans free of taxation were introduced by the Government of which the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> was a member, and were continued by the Government of which the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> was Treasurer, and a very good Treasurer, too. Therefore, although it is true that the National party have been responsible for the flotation of subsequent war loans free of interest, it is not true to say that the party, on this side is responsible for introducing the principle of immunity from taxation in connexion with money loaned for war purposes. </para>

                            <para>- No; but it is hardly fair that what are known as the employing, or capitalistic classes, in Australia, should be continually charged with the responsibility of introducing and perpetuating the system of tax-free war loans. The gentleman who has, in the most striking and effective fashion, exposed to the public the disadvantage, from a national point of view, of tax-free war loans, was the  chairman  of the National Bank <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir John Grice).</inline> In conclusion, 1 remind honorable members that this is not the only country in the world that has issued war loans free of interest. The first American war loan, floated in May last, carried 3  per cent, interest; the second loan was issued in November at 4 per cent., and the third loan, recently floated, at 4£ per cent. All those loans are tax-free. </para>

                        <para>.- If there is anything which is mean, contemptible, and despicable, it is the effort of the Government to snare boys of immature age in the net of the recruiting sergeant. And if there is one thing even meaner than that, it is to hear members of Parliament, who know the views of their constituents on this matter, making all sorts of paltry excuses for not voting for a proposition -.which their conscience tells them they ought to support. Of the seventy-five members of this House fifty-three sit on the Government side and twenty-two in Opposition. The Government have a majority of thirty members. </para>

Many of them think they have only to be free of parental control and everything will be well with them. These young fellows attend the public meetings, at which experienced recruiting officers paint the glories of the war, and appeal to their sentiment. The lads at the public meetings are not told the truth about the war. Throughout the length and breadth of the country there is a conspiracy, by the Government manipulation of the channels of public information, both through the press and the platform, to absolutely mislead the young people of the Commonwealth. They are not told the glories and the seamy side of the Avar at the same time. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member correctly describes it. This is one more effort by the Government to introduce conscription by a side wind. It is trying to bring pressure on young men. It offers them mental pabulum which would not be accepted by persons more matured. It persuades young fellows, flushed with excitement, and full of the spirit of adventure, to leave the parental home for the war. Let me read a letter which has come to me from St. Arnaud - </para>

                    <para>I wish to bring under your notice a case which is causing my friend and comrade, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> Tracey, and his wife a deal of anxiety. When the war broke out they had two single sons. The eldest one enlisted, and later was killed at the Front. The youngest one has just turned eighteen years, and at a recruiting meeting here he was persuaded and coaxed to enlist, being told his father's consent was not needed, and that he should go and fight for his country. He did so, and the first intimation his father got was when he saw his son's name in the local paper. We have in this town a Recruiting Committee composed of shopkeepers, commission agents, lawyers, doctors, bankers, and a few others, who have snug, comfortable billets, and the majority of them are eligible for military service. Some of them are well-built, strong men, who would make ideal soldiers, but they do not enlist. It pays them better to make a great show and bluster, using all their energies to persuade and cause boys to enlist, whilst they drive about in their motors, and blow about what they are doing " to win the war." Would you kindly write to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tracey</inline> (you have met him), and advise him what steps to take, if any, to get this enlistment cancelled. You are acquainted with him. He has been our trusted treasurer for the last eight years, and, personally, I think that was one of the reasons a set was made on his boy 'by these cowardly curs, because every one of them knew his brother had been killed at the Front. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tracey's</inline> address is - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Tracey, Navarre-road, St. Arnaud. Surely to God there is a little spark of humanity left even with the Military authorities. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Tracey</inline> willingly let her other son go, and lost him; but I do not think it fair and just that the youngest boy should be forced to go for a deed he did under excitement. He is supposed to go into camp in August; so I trust you will do what you can for our comrade and his wife. </para>

                            <para>- Well, let the honorable member move a motion that he considers honest, and we will withdraw the amendment. He bursts into laughter at the proposal, and other members oh that side do the same. Not only is wrong done by persuading boys of immature mind to enlist without their parents' consent, but wrong is done by causing boys to defy their parents. Many parents are afraid that if they say a word of reproof to a son he may leave home, and this is loosening parental influence and control. </para>

                            <para>- When expressed in £ s. d., perhaps, and they are able to get more out of Australia than some of the natives. There are many good things in Great Britain that we admire, but the great bulk of Australian legislation is a protest against the conditions that exist in that country. Honorable members from Great Britain have depicted to us the factory conditions there, when children of six and seven years of age had to work in the mines. You are not prepared to ask us to support things of that kind. </para>

                            <para>- I do not care how the honorable member may characterize my speech. I can go on any platform in the country and justify it. The honorable member has shown that he does not wish the truth to be spoken : that he is a party to its suppression. He wishes to have a partial case put before our young men. He would not have them enlist with a full knowledge of what they will have to undergo. He would suppress the seamy side, and allow the recruiting sergeants to mislead them. We all have read what happened in Great Britain in the matter of recruiting, men being made drunk with beer or bad whisky, and being got to accept the King's shilling when " three sheets in the wind," it being impossible for them to draw out when they came to their senses. </para>

When I had charge of recruiting in New South Wales no attempt was made to mislead the people of that State, and the enlistment figures were better than ever before or since.

                        <para>.- I had hoped that the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> treading the primrose path of power, lit up by the new light of unaccustomed amiability, would have seen proper to succumb, in a political sense, if not to the arguments addressed to him by the Opposition, at least to the strong feeling manifested by his supporters, both inside and outside Parliament, in regard to the amendment moved by my honorable leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor).</inline> It is to that amendment exclusively that I wish to address myself for a few minutes, reserving to myself the right to speak, at a later stage, on the larger question of the war loan and the purposes of the war. The Acting Prime Minister, speaking only yesterday, begged us to regard this question of the enlistment of minors without the consent of their parents free from party bias. Is it not most significant that, although this question had been ventilated in the press, and that protests had been made from this side of the House, not one member of the Ministerial party ventured until yesterday to say a word about it, although it was common knowledge that many of them were opposed to the Government proposition? When they do address themselves to the question it is only to say that they regret that it has been raised in a way that renders it impossible for them to accept the amendment. In other words, the principle must go by the board because the forms of the House have been availed of in a way that will not permit them to vote for the principle. </para>

                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition asked, " When may we have an opportunity to discuss this question of the enlistment of minors without the consent of their parents"? The reply of the Acting Prime Minister was, " You will have an opportunity when the Defence Estimates are under consideration later on." Eventually my honorable leader availed himself of an opportunity to bring forward the matter. He, in fact, forced an opportunity, so far as he could, in spite of the opposition of the Government and their supporters.  His  action in submitting this amendment was immediately challenged by the Leader of the Government, who submitted that it was out of order. Is it not evident that the Government and their supporters have desired throughout that this question should never come to issue? </para>

He has heard our voices raised in protest, but has paid little attention to them; he has read the press, and has paid much attention to the representations made there by his own supporters. He has read a letter written to the press by my newfound colleague, the  president  of the Australian Women's National League. That letter has impressed him. He has referred in this House to the Australian Women's National League as "that admirable body of women," and no doubt they are. I have no desire to say a word against them, although, politically, they are generally diametrically opposed to me. The Acting Prime Minister, however, has hearkened to their voices, and has come forward with a miserable compromise, which he asks us and his supporters outside to accept. I do not propose to accept it. </para>

                    <para>I do not say that there is any special virtue in the magic number of twenty-one. Some youths under twenty-one are clearly more physically -able to bear arms than are others of twenty-one and over. Notwithstanding the form of medical examination that is supposed to create uniformity, some of the younger classes are much stronger than the older classes. My opposition to the Government proposal does not rest entirely upon the fact that it provides for the enlistment of these youths without the consent of their parents. It rests mainly upon my opposition to the enlistment of very young men for this work, and the obvious tendency to encroach upon youth for that purpose. </para>

Would it not be much more becoming if this honorable gentleman, in middle life as he is, and strong, hale and hearty, as he is, should follow the example of a fellow legislator in New South Wales, and lead an army through the streets and say, " I will take these adults to the Front rather than stay in my place in Parliament and say that, though I am opposed to the policy which has been adopted by the Government, I will still remain in association with it, and draw ray salary from it?"

                    <para>Apparently, this applied, not only to the firing line, but also to the camps prior to embarkation. that the larger proportion of recruits in the hospitals are lads of tender years. Their constitutions are not strong enough to stand the strain imposed when they get in the trenches. These young men are also being sent to the front without sufficient training. The artillery branch is one of the most technical and intricate in the service; but an officer informed me recently that at least 20 per cent. of recruits in the artillery section were between the ages of eighteen and twenty years. I maintain that these lads are not physically capable of enduring the strenuous work of a campaign. Many of them are not receiving proper preparation for the task they will have to perform. I know of a lad of eighteen years and five months who presented himself at Victoria Barracks as a recruit for the artillery section. He was passed by the medical officer on a Tuesday, and having been sent to Camp he received an intimation on the following Friday to hold himself in readiness to go to the Front on the succeeding Tuesday. He was without previous military training or experience. Fortunately he was wise enough to telegraph to his parents, who came to the city post haste, and succeeded in preventing his departure. When attention was drawn, some time ago, to the system of sending inadequately-trained troops to the Front, a good deal was promised by the Minister for Defence, but I regret to say that the complaint of insufficient training of the troops before their departure for the Front still has foundation, and it is largely in connexion with reinforcements. But the system of accepting lads of from eighteen to twenty years of age is one of the most serious phases of our recruiting. It is not fair to send boys to do men's work. The apprenticeship phase of this question should appeal to honorable members opposite. Many of these lads are in the last years of their apprenticeship, and they are called upon to break off their industrial training and go to the Front. Notwithstanding that there are laws in existence to protect the lads by the limitation of working hours, the safeguarding of them against exploitation, of preventible accidents, and against entering into unconscionable contracts, the Government have no hesitation in sending them to the most dangerous, the most demoralizing of all occupations, that of the battlefield. </para>
                    <para class="block">I would not have ventured to use such language, but I repeat, with unction, the honorable member's remark, " the Government have no hesitation in sending them to the most dangerous, the most demoralizing of all occupations, that of the battlefield." </para>
                    <para>The lads should not be permitted to go to the war. Many of these lads under twenty-one years of age have put up a splendid record; but the fact remains that if they are allowed, at this stage of their apprenticeship, to go to the Front, we shall find their industrial efficiency very much reduced on their return; they will not be worth as much to the community as they otherwise would have been. </para>
                    <para class="block">I am not impressed with that argument, but it is significant, seeing the side from which it comes. I compliment the honorable member upon that portion of his argument which dealt with the demoralization of youths of tender years, rather than upon that portion which points out that they will not be so valuable to the persons whose interests he represents in this Chamber when they come back after the war.

                    <para class="block">I digress for a moment to call attention to a significant fact. Yesterday the Acting Prime Minister dwelt upon the alteration that, as a concession to popular opinion, and to the force of our arguments here, has been brought about by the Government. He hoped that no youth would be sent to the firing line without his parents' consent, of course, before he was twenty years of age. He said that no youth could enlist before nineteen years of age without the parents' consent, and that when he did enlist at nineteen years of age he would be two months in an Australian camp before embarkation - God forbid that any boy should be taken away after only two months ! - that thereafter he would be two months on the water, and, approximately, seven or eight months in a training camp overseas, and that then he might be sent to the firing line at twenty years of age. Honorable members will notice how utterly free from the arts of politics the Acting Prime Minister was in his careful adjustment of the time in order to bring it into line with the views of his Minister in charge of recruiting, so that no boy would be called upon to fight until he reached the age of twenty years. </para>

On the contrary, he is strikingly consistent with the views of the Minister in charge of recruiting, who mentioned the age of twenty years as being the limit. Consequently, the Acting Prime Minister has made twenty years of age the limit, in order to save the face, to some extent, of the Minister in charge of recruiting. Quite clearly that is the object of the alteration which has been brought about. </para>

                        <para>The first practical suggestion I have to make is that we are inviting too young men to join our Forces - that the men or boys of eighteen, whom we are allowing to join, are, under existing circumstances, too young. Their constitutions are not formed, their bones are not properly set, and yet wo are asking these youths to do what? Not to go on a summer campaign such as is now proceeding, but to be prepared to enter on, I should say, the most destructive sort of campaign that there could be, , from the point of view of their health. Before many of those who are now enlisting can be actually made use of at the Front, the European winter will be upon us. I have no hesitation in say ing that it is cruel and wrong for us now to engage young men or boys of eighteen to take part in the trenches in the winter campaign that is impending. I say that the age of those who are allowed to enlist at the present time for immediate active service ought to be raised. </para>

                    <para>The speeches I have read are those of honorable members who were directing themselves, not to the question of whether these youths should be allowed to enlist without their parents' consent, but to the question of whether they should be allowed to enlist at all; and I ask the . Government and their supporters to-day whether they think it is right to take advantage of the immature judgment of young men, who either have no parents to advise them, or have parents who do not take the trouble to consider the rights or wrongs of the question ? If it is, as stated by Government supporters, a question of immaturity, it should apply irrespective of the consent of the parents. We have on record some medical opinions, and one which I propose to quote was brought out by a question addressed in another place by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to the Minister for Defence, which shows that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> although a member of the party opposite, was opposed to the enlistment of these youths.

To the most uninitiated it must be clear that this is merely taking advantage of a technical device to evade a very obvious duty. There are many ways in which the question could be decided apart from the amendment before us. We know tha,t the Loan Bill will not be defeated, although I myself, and possibly one or two others, may have an additional word of criticism to say in regard to it. Honorable members opposite know quite well that they could by arrangement with their leader have a decision on the merits of the question. Why do they not do it? Why make this monumental question of the enlistment of boys in this tremendous world struggle subject to this technical, petty, party objection that it is proposed in the wrong way ? Let honorable members opposite choose their own ground, and have the question introduced in their own way, and we will help them. </para>

                    <para>The Acting Prime Minister excused this proposal on two grounds, the first that the Government are following the example of the mother of Parliaments. We have to remember, however, that in a matter of the highest importance in the conduct of the war Australia has already declined to follow the mother of Parliaments. Is our whole policy to be that of following the mother of Parliaments? Is this fo be a mere recording chamber to re-register the decisions of the mother of Parliaments, or are we a Commonwealth charged with the responsibility to do our own work in our own way, as a result of our own deliberations under the conditions peculiar to Australia? If we are a Parliament charged with full responsibilities, we are not governed by what the mother of Parliaments has done in regard to the enlistment of youths. The mother of Parliaments is legislating for boys, or at least young men, who are in the battle arena or on the very threshold of. the campaign, whereas we here are dealing with youths who are to be sent many thousands of miles across the seas. </para>

                            <para>- I am sorry if the honorable member can see no difference in the case of boys who are taken away from their home life and sent thousands of miles across the sea. If anything is necessary to emphasize the wrong in the Government proposal it is the fact that honorable members opposite have never been willing to concede the right to vote on this question to the youths affected. I do not consider twenty-one a magic age, and I should be prepared to lower it in the case of the franchise to seventeen or eighteen, so as to embrace those young men and women who have to compete in the industrial arena for their livelihood, and who are amenable to the laws of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>.- I should not intervene in the debate did I not think it possible that I have a little more personal knowledge of one phase of the question than the majority of honorable members. On the enlistment of boys under twenty-one I hold very definite views, and these I wish to place before the House. I have seen the effect on boys under twenty-one, and on men over forty, when they get into the firing-line, and I say without hesitation that it is a grave blunder to send them if it can possibly be avoided. In the case of Great Britain there is no other possible way, because there the manhood is exhausted. In Australia we have not exhausted our manhood; there are men of the proper age for military service whom we could obtain instead of the boys, and it is our duty to enlist them if we can. Another objection I have to the proposal is that it will mean that the troops at the Front will not be properly reinforced. They will be reinforced, but it will be by men who only in exceptional cases are of any true value and represent the standard of the men who have won the wonderful name of "Anzacs." If the troops are not to be properly reinforced, we may possibly find ourselves living in an atmosphere of false security. We may think we are reinforcing the troops because we give them the necessary numbers, when, in fact, we are doing nothing of the sort, because we are sending the wrong type of men. It is suggested - though there is a difference of opinion, and I do not know whether it is so or not - that the recent improvement in recruiting is attributable to the enlistment of these boys. Whether that be so or not, it, at any rate, shows us a danger that may arise and that ought to be avoided. For that reason, I express my emphatic view that it is a mistake, so long as there are men of suitable military age, to facilitate the enlisting of boys of the age mentioned, who, according to my own experience, supported by the experience of many others, are not of true value when they arrive at the Front. As to the motion and the amendment, I am, as honorable members know, new to the House, and I may say that, as a man brought up in an atmosphere of business, it is quite impossible for me to reconcile a vote on a Bill to give power to raise £80,000,000 with a question of the kind covered by the amendment. I understand that after I have been here some time, and have been "tamed" - I think that is the expression - I shall appreciate a situation of the kind, but at the present moment I do not. I understand that the question before the House is that power shall be given to raise £80,000,000 to carry on the war, and I intend to vote in favour of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - After the speech to which we have just listened with much pleasure, it is the duty of the Government to promise the House that we shall have an opportunity to take a clear vote upon the issue raised by the amendment. It would well become the Government to ask the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> to withdraw his amendment. I have been twenty-seven years in politics, and I, like the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> cannot see the justification for tacking such an amendment on to a Bill to authorize the raising of £80,000,000 by loan. Therefore, I say it is the duty of the Government to relieve honorable members from the embarrassing position in which we are placed today, and to give us an opportunity to record our votes on a specific motion. I hold exactly the same view as the honorable member for Flinders, and I have some knowledge of this matter. Two of my boys went to the war before they were twenty-one years of age - one celebrating his eighteenth birthday in the trenches. I know that their opinions are the same as those expressed by the honorable member for Flinders. They say the ages fixed are too young; that if ten men are sent to do a job which ten men can do, and one man fails, he endangers the other nine. I do not wish to be placed in the position of voting to send to the Front immature boys, who are really unfit to go. The Government know what is thought of this proposal by honorable members on this side, and by the majority of the public, and I appeal to them to do something to remove us from the false position in which we are placed today. I do not wish to vote to put the </para>

                    <para class="block">Government out of office and place in power a Government chosen from honorable members opposite; but the Government have no right to place us in an anomalous position. They ought to give us a better opportunity of expressing our opinions. No doubt the proposal to allow the enlistment of boys of eighteen years of age without the consent of their parents was brought forward with the best intentions on the part of the Government; but it is wrong. It is very easy to criticise Ministers, but we know that they are in a difficult position. A serious call has reached them, and they must do the best they can. But in bringing forward this proposal for the enlistment of minors, they have placed themselves and their supporters who, like myself, disagree with the proposal, in a dead-end. </para>

                            <para>- It is all very well for the Leader of the Opposition to talk. He has not the responsibility which he knows the Government have to carry. It is easy for any of us to criticise, but we want constructive, as well as destructive, criticism. The Government are in an awkward position. The interjection by the Leader of the Opposition was not fair. It must be apparent to any unprejudiced mind that honorable members opposite are not doing the fair thing by the Government, and are not rendering that assistance in recruiting that they ought to give. If they would only engage heart and soul in the recruiting, movement, we should get all the men we require by the voluntary method. </para>

                            <para>- I have already said so. I agree with the honorable member, for I know the particulars of the case to which he referred last night. The honorable member's son was with my boys in Egypt, and he and they had to turn back, and, at the risk of their lives, practically carry to safety youngsters who were not equal to a forced march. We ought not to put men in that situation. To <inline font-style="italic">send</inline> unfit boys is not to reinforce our troops; that is only a pretence of reinforcing them.  Having heard the opinions which have been expressed, it is the duty of the Government to take further action. The Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. "Wise)</inline> is heart and soul in the recruiting movement; his own son is at the Front. I feel sure that he can he relied upon to do the sensible thing by his own boy and the other lads there. If the Government realize that they have made a mistake, let them have the courage to retrace their steps. I congratulate the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> on the speech he made. He has voiced the opinions of older members probably better than' they could have done. I speak from my heart on this matter. Our men at the Front are risking their lives every day, and we ought not to put them in positions of greater danger by sending to reinforce them young men who are not fit to do their share of the job. Of course, in this desperate time, when the fate of the Government is at stake, we feel that we must stand by the Ministry - that is the system of parliamentary government; but it is our duty to speak our minds candidly, as I am endeavouring to do. I heard the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> pay a tribute to the work done by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> in connexion with recruiting. On that matter the honorable member has taken a manly stand, as he generally does on every other matter. </para>

                        <para>. - I quite agree with the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> that at some time or other the question raised by the amendment ought to be submitted to the House free of the embarrassment with which it is attended today. I regard the amendment as a mere trick on the part of the Opposition to catch the Government, and I shall vote against it. I realize the force of what was said by the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce).</inline> I have a son at the Front who enlisted at the age of eighteen. I deprecated his going, but I gave my consent. It is open to honorable members to insist on the Government bringing forward this question again, independent of any other issue. </para>
