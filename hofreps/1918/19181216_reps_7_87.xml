In view of the information to hand this morning that a desperate and almost successful attempt was made by some men to get ashore at Fremantle from a quarantined transport, does not the Minister for Trade and Customs think it highly advisable, and, indeed, necessary, that the healthy men who are being detained as contacts on board the transports should be allowed some freedom ashore, and at the same time be kept in safety by being confined to one or other of the islands off Fremantle? </para>

            <para>- On the 29th November, I asked the Acting Prime Minister a question regarding the premature publication by some newspapers of the Repatriation Department&#39;s report. The matter had been referred to in the Senate on the previous day by a senator from New South Wales, and it had been said that one newspaper in Sydney - I think it was the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> - had not held back the report in accordance with instructions. I ask the Acting Prime Minister if he will inquire why the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> did not obey this instruction, which was observed by the <inline font-style="italic">Register</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> there. The honorable gentleman promised to ascertain the facts, and I. shall be glad if he will let me have them before the Estimates come on, as I wish to say something on the matter? </para>

          <para>Mr.WATT. - The negotiations to which I referred last week, when replying to a question by the honorable member, have not yet been finalized.

That proposal did not receive the favorable consideration of the Government, and no steps are being taken at the present time in regard to any further railway construction. </para>

              <para>The Commonwealth Government does not grant travelling concessions to the relatives of soldiers returned from abroad, whether they be on &#39;leave or invalids. The Defence Department, however, issues railway warrants to the next of kin of members of the Australian Imperial Force returned on furlough on account of their having served abroad continuously since 1914 on behalf of the State Government, who bear the expense. As this concession is a State one this Department cannot extend its use. 2 and 3. This matter is being brought under the notice of the Governments of the several States. </para>

            <para>- It is not clear what the honorable member is referring to. If to the embargo imposed by the Imperial or other -Government on their exports, I am unable to give the information desired. The embargo imposed by the Commonwealth Government restricting the importation of certain goods during the war is still operative, except in regard to soap. The general question of protecting the interests of local manufacturers will receive every consideration. </para>

            <para>- On the 10th December, the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond)</inline> asked the following question :  - </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Will the Assistant Minister for Defence confer with the Minister for Defence, with a view to making a statement in the House as to the exact position in regard to the proposed Gallipoli decoration? </para>
          <para>I am now able to furnish the honorable member with the following information :  - </para>
          <para>It had been proposed to grant a special Gallipoli Star, but serious difficulties arose, owing to strong objections taken not only by members of Parliament and press in England, but by the Dominion troops themselves, to the issue of decorations to the Dominion troops serving in Gallipoli which could not be conferred on their British comrades who shared the dangers and hardships. Extension of this decoration would have involved even more serious anomalies for demands for issue of an indefinite number of further campaign decorations which would have becomeirresistible. </para>

          <para>The above solution removes the anomaly of troops serving in the same theatre of war side by side and not receiving the same reward for their services, and gives to nearly all those who first responded to the call of duty a decoration which will be extremely highly prized, and which hitherto has been confined only to those who rendered this service in France. </para>
          <para>It will also remove the existing anomaly by which the 1914 Star is issued to many thousands of officers and men whose duty kept them at a base in France far away from the fighting line, whereas officers and men who offered their services at the beginning of the war, and took part in the fighting on Gallipoli or Festubert are ineligible for any special decoration. The grant by the King himself of one decoration to British,Dominion, and Indian troops alike will symbolize the unity of the Empire. </para>
          <para>His Majesty&#39;s Government are aware that great importance has been attached in Australia and New Zealand to a special decoration for Gallipoli. In view of the grant of the 1914-15 Star, a special clasp on the war medal will be given for the Gallipoli operations . </para>

          <para>. - Clause 5 is to amend section 12 of the principal Act, and section 12 provides that where there is an increase of capital above the pre-war standard of capital employed during an accounting period, in order to ascertain the taxable profits certain methods have to be resorted to. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">It is provided that there shall be deducted either the percentage standard or the pre-war standard of profits, whichever be the greater. Clause 5 proposes to strike out the option provided for by section 12, namely, that it is competent for&#39; the taxpayer to deduct the pre-war standard of profits so far as increased capital is concerned. This is a very serious innovation,, and it is proposed to date it back to the 1st July, 1916, or twelve months before the section was actually enacted. The effect of the proposed alteration is very serious, and will most  greviously  hurt and penalize those who endeavoured to expand their business by an increase of capital. </para>
        <para>The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> will remember the circumstances under which this option to select the pre-war standard of profits was deliberately inserted by Parliament. In the original Bill introduced by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> who was then Treasurer, it was provided that under circumstances of the kind where increased capital was introduced during an accounting period, the taxpayer should be at liberty to deduct the statutory percentage, and the statutory percentage alone, which was then fixed at 6 per cent., so far as companies are concerned, and 7 per cent, in the case of individuals. When the new Bill was introduced by the late Lord Forrest in August last, there was a new clause inserted providing that the taxpayer should have the option of deducting the statutory percentage, or, if he so desired, the pre-war standard of profits, whichever happened to be the greater. </para>

            <para>- He could exercise the option - taking either one or the other. That provision was deliberately introduced, and passed by Parliament, and was a direct amendment of the provisions of the measure introduced by the honorable member for Capricornia. Business men, manufacturers in particular, have since then relied upon getting the benefit of that pre-war standard of percentage, and have invested their money, profits and otherwise, in plant and in other directions, with the aim and object of expanding their establishments; but now they are told that they are to be denied the advantage of what they have done on the. authority of Parliament and in the ordinary course of their business operations. Besides its retrospective effect, the clause seeks to wipe- out the option given* by section 12 of the Act. Huge businesses will not suffer in any way. The clause will penalize the smaller businesses, the new and struggling concerns, which are progressive in character, and find it necessary from time to time to increase their capital with a view to expansion. I have no wish to repeat the illustrations I gave in dealing with this matter on the second reading. One will be sufficient. A small manufacturer, with a capital of &#163;8,000, was called upon to pay &#163;187 last year under the provisions of the Act as it now stands, but if the Committee agrees to_ this clause he will be called upon to pay &#163;887 for that period. This year, under the Act as it stands, on his present figures and estimates, he would have been called upon to pay nothing in the shape of wartime profits taxation; but if this clause is agreed to he will be called upon to pay &#163;1,000. The clause is a deliberate blow at the industries of the country, particularly the new and struggling ones, and, in view&#39; of the fact that manufacturers, relying on the wording of the Act, felt that they were at liberty to exercise the option of selecting either a percentage standard or a pre-war standard of profits, it will be very unjust to them to give a retrospective effect to this legislation. I urge the Treasurer to strike out the&#39; clause, or, at least, amend it so that it will not operate before the 1st January next. I do not doubt the right of Parliament to make any alteration in the law so far as the future operation of it is concerned, but retrospective legislation i3 vicious and dangerous from every standpoint. It is the retrospective character of the clause against which I particularly protest. It will create many hardships, and will deal a serious blow to industries. </para>

          <para>.- The proposal to delete section 12 aims at collecting a retrospective tax upon a matter which the whole business community imagined was settled, finished, and done with. While no business man would imagine for a moment that a contract with the Government is absolutely binding, and cannot be altered by Parliament, there is an  impression  among the business community that there was a contract with them embodied in the section, of the_Act which it is now. sought to delete from the Statute. Acting on that contract, many firms have dealt with the profits they have made, and which they believed were legitimately theirs. In some cases they have put them back into the businesses by the installation of new machinery, or by the expansion. of their operations. In other cases, part of the money has been distributed in the shape of dividends, which have increased the value of their shares. If section 12 is deleted, totally innocent persons, who have acquired these shares, will suffer an appreciable and severe drop in the value of their stock. If the- provision had ,placed certain people in the community in the position of being able to rob the public by profiteering, the fact that the business community imagined that the Government had made a bargain with them would be no ground for objecting to the right of Parliament to remedy what was obviously wrong; but this has not occurred. The only people to whom the provision can apply are those who have established new businesses. It does not apply to old businesses which can- show a satisfactory percentage on the huge volume of capital in their business prior to* the war. On the second reading, I endeavoured to demonstrate that young businesses, may perfectly legitimately earn 40 per cent, or 50 per cent, on their capital during the first two or three years, and at the same time be selling to the public at the very minimum of profit. Those honorable members who heard my remarks will recognise that there- is nothing vicious in a young business making a large percentage of profit upon its capital. It may not be doing,  so  on its turn-over. It may possibly be making a very much smaller profit on its turn-over than wellestablished businesses are making. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>We are all firmly convinced that it is essential that we should try to helpour young, struggling industries; and we should be very ill-advised if, through the fear that one or two businesses maybe entitled to retain too much profit, we place such a heavy handicap on what we are seeking to create. &#39; For these reasons,. I. think it would be a very great mistake to delete the provision in the Act, and make the tax retrospective for two and. a-half years. Only one thing could justify what amounts,, practically, to a, breach of faith, and certainly to an absolute restraint upon the creation of new industries; and that is, if the Treasurer could demonstrate absolutely beyond doubt that section 12 is giving opportunities to a large portion of the community to carry on profiteering, and practically rob the people. If the  Treasurer  could demonstrate this, much as I dislike the clause, I would be prepared to vote for it, but if he cannot show that, people, having had the opportunity to carry on flagrant profiteering, have not hesitated to take advantage of it, then it would be a grave mistake to create in the minds of the mercantile community the feeling that they cannot rely on anything that is done by Parliament. That .would certainly be the feeling created if this measure is made retrospective for two and a-half years-.. For these reasons I urge the Treasurer to seriously consider whether it is not possible to&#39; avoid the repeal of this section of the existing Act in the manner proposed in the clause under consideration. If he is convinced that an opportunity is afforded to certain people to profiteer - although &#60;the profiteering is not so flagrant as to necessitate retrospective legislation over two and a half years - it might be justifiable to pass this clause, but it should be made to apply from the present time. However, a case must be made out to show that the opportunity for profiteering against which this proposal is directed will lead to a flagrant abuse in that direction before it will be wisdom for this Committee to make this legislation retrospective over a period of two and half years. </para>

          <para>.- When the. Government first passed the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act the managers of. the large established businesses and in-  dustries  throughout Australia -were very pleased, but if the Government succeed in passing this clause as it stands, the managers of the big monopolies in Australia will jump for joy, because the effect will be to at once crush out of existence the small men who are their competitors. It will make the position of the large establishments safe for years to come by absolutely crippling those who have recently engaged in similar industries. I am quite sure that that is not the intention of the Treasurer, but that will be the inevitable result of this proposal. The man of small capital cannot be considered on the same basis as the man of large capital. Every one will agree that in the case of long established firms in a big way of business and big combines a profit of 10 per cent, is a very good return on their capital. Their money has been put into these industries as an investment, and 10 per cent, in their cases is a very reasonable profit io allow. But a man with &#163;5,000, &#163;3,000, or less than that who goes into business takes a very big risk, especially in manufacturing concerns, as he has to buy his machinery and raw material on terms. By this clause such men will be placed at a very great disadvantage as compared with their competitors in a big way of business. I can quote a few cases to show how inequitably this proposal for a statutory 10 per cent, profit on capital will operate in the case of new industries. Under this proposal a man who puts the whole of his profits into the extension of his business - and it may be also money obtained from outside - will have to accept a decreased amount of profit, .whilst men who have restricted their business or have taken money out of it will be permitted to make a greater profit than before. I take an actual case of a company with &#163;5,000, whose pre-war standard of profit was &#163;1,250, or 25 per cent. They added during the years since 1914 to their capital and doubled it. They have now a capital of &#163;10,000. Under the War-time Profits Act as it stands they would be allowed on that &#163;10,000 to make a profit of &#163;2,500, or 25 per cent., before they would become taxable, but under the clause now under -consideration they will be allowed to make only 17$ per cent, before they become taxable. If, instead of adding to their capital, they had reduced- it by about &#163;1,000, the profit which they would be allowed before they became taxable would be &#163;1,150, .or 28| per cent. That is to say, that a man who increases his capital has his percentage of profit reduced to <inline font-style="italic">\1\</inline> per cent., whilst the man who reduces his capital is allowed to make a profit of 28| per cent. Surely the Treasurer could not have anticipated that that would be the effect of the present proposal. Here are particulars of another case. There is a business with a capital of &#163;50,000, and on the pre-war standard their profit was &#163;10,000, or 20 per cent. They increased their capital during the course of the war by &#163;25,000, and under the existing Act they would be allowed to make a profit of &#163;15,000, or 20 per cent., whilst under this proposal they would be allowed to make a profit of only 16| per cent. If they had reduced their capital to &#163;40,000, they would have been allowed under the existing Act to make a profit of &#163;8,000, whilst under this proposal they will be allowed to make a profit of &#163;9&#39;,000, or 22J per cent. So that the man who reduces his capital, who takes no &#34;risks, who even withdraws &#187; capital from a business to invest it in the War Loan or on mortgage without risk, is allowed to escape additional taxation or to make more profit on his reduced capital, whilst the man who puts more capital into his business is hit every time under this proposal. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Another aspect of the case is very serious. Under the existing Act the period to determine the pre-war standard is fixed as the accounting period previous to 4th August, 1914. A number of companies made their balances on the 30th September, two months after the war broke out. Under this Bill it will be assumed that they have made up their pre-war standard of profits and their pre-war capital on the 30th September, 1913. That is the date from which their estimate of capital and profits will count. Here is an example of an actual case to show the effect of this proposal : On 30th September, 1913, a proprietary company had a capital of &#163;3,000. They had added &#163;2,000 profits to that capital  in April, 1914, giving them a total capital of &#163;5,000 on the 4th August, 1914. But in making up their pre-war standard of capital they are not allowed to take &#163;5,000 as their capital, because they had not that amount of capital at the accounting period, 30th September, 1913. If they were allowed to taKe the actual capital that was in their business on 4th August, 1914f into consideration, they would escape with a tax of &#163;75, but under this Bill they will have to pay a tax of &#163;322 10s. on their actual capital. Surelyin the face of a case of that kind the Treasurer will not persist in this amendment of the existing Act. </para>
        <para>The retrospective effect of this proposal has been emphasized by previous speakers, and, therefore, I will not dwell upon it. But it has always seemed to me that the Parliament put it to the mercantile community that it was intended to tax them under certain circumstances on certain standards, and gave them to understand that beyond that they were safe, and might use any profits they made in extending their business, putting in new machinery, opening new branches, and giving increased employment. It is, therefore, very unfair that when men have disbursed their earnings in extending their businesses the Government should come forward two years later and inform them that a large proportion of the money, which they told them two years before they might use to extend their industries, must be paid over to the Treasury. </para>

            <para>- Nearly every one of them have been doing so. Men in a small way of business, such as retail butchers or grocers, will turn over their capital twelve or fourteen times a year. A retail butcher can buy meat in the wholesale market every day. I could mention dozens of businesses in which the capital is turned over twenty times in a year. If the Bill taxed a man on the turn-over of his business, there might be some justice in the measure; but to tax profits on capital seems to me the most monstrous proposal that has ever been introduced into this Parliament. There is another phase of the problem which will retard progress. Under the Bill, a company or firm is only allowed a certain amount for management expenses. I know of a number of firms which, during the course of the war, have extended their businesses by opening branches. I know of three or four Sydney firms that have opened branches in Melbourne, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa. .</inline> They have taken in extra partners, but under this Bill they will not be allowed any more for the management of their businesses, although they have to pay more on this account. One Melbourne business firm which opened up a Sydney connexion, thus incurring higher management expenses, is not allowed to deduct more than the statutory amount. The Act is prejudicial to the inauguration of new businesses; it is killing industry; killing enterprise, and is preventing employment. If this Bill goes through with the clause under consideration in its present form, it will mean absolute disaster, I believe, to a majority of those business firms that have grown up within the last eight or twelve years. If it is persisted in - I hope the Treasurer will not persist with it - it will mean absolute ruin, and retard the extension of businesses, damage the industrial life of Australia, and injure the prospects of employment for our men coming back from the war. </para>

That was, in a measure, retrospective: but this Bill, with its gifts and fines, is all retrospective, and I put it to a number of Sydney  commercialists,  who waited on me, that if I am to &#39; cut&#39; out the imposts because of their retrospective nature, I must cut out also the concessions and gifts, because they, too, are retrospective.

            <para>- The honorable member would destroy it root and branch, but we prefer to water it in order that it may bear decent fruit in the meantime. I trust that honorable members will realize that, having taken the stand that we will not abolish this Act for this financial year, that is to say, that it must run the course intended that it should- run - until the termination of hostilities, or the 30th June supervening - we must set to work to improve the measure. That has been my job. I am not exactly an apprentice hand ; I am an improver. I have made as many inquiries as I have been able to in the time at my disposal to see, apart altogether from the, complaints made about the principle of retrospection, what the incidence of this phase of the measure would be. It is true that it has hurt progressive businesses more than businesses that have stood still. I realize that, because I have had a number of illustrations bearing on this point. It is clear that the business man who has stood still with his capital during the currency of the war period will escape unless he has been doing extraordinary profiteering or increasing the rate on his overturn, while the man who, by the absorption of recurring profits into his business, seeks to progress, finds that his margin of profit on the additional capital is maximized at 10 per cent. The difficulty, however, is not merely the question of unfairness in levying two rates upon the same man, but in respect of the distribution of profits where <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> distribution has taken place, perhaps, without constitutional warrant, but in good faith. It is difficult, and in some cases impossible, to get that money back. In the case of partnerships which have been dissolved I can invent no means whatever to make sure of getting that money back from the hands into which the dividends or distributions have gone. And I find the same difficulty with respect to trusts which have been wound up, where the beneficiaries have been the recipients of such moneys. I do not know whether such cases can be met. </para>

The honorable member said, &#34; What about those people who purchased shares on the basis of the return of a higher percentage on new capital <inline font-style="italic">1&#34;</inline> As to such cases, I do not think we can write an absolute indemnity to all those who deal with investment stock, or stock relating to speculative enterprises; but there are some people, of course, who have a perfect right to claim that, having bought on the higher return, and with a reasonable expectation of their shares still returning the higher percentage, this measure will be, to a certain extent, robbing them. </para>
        <para>Those considerations have led me to review the measure, not from the standpoint of the inequality of the principle, but of seeing whether it will severely injure business. And I have come to the conclusion that it would cause, perhaps, more injury than the revenue &#34;would demand if I dated the whole proposition right back to the original period, namely, the 1st July, 1916. But the longer I live at the Treasury the more I am impressed with the necessity for gathering in a large sum of money for public requirements. And I take it that no Treasurer is worth his salt who does not endeavour to make every tax yield fairly, but fully, that which the Legislature expected of it. I am not prepared to give up this section for this particular financial year. We should operate this 10 per cent. arrangement upon new capital; but I am prepared to submit a clause to the effect that the arrangement suggested shall operate as upon assessments from the 1st July, 1918. If honorable members care to accept that, it can go through without discussion, but I would not be justified in yielding up revenue which can be fairly gathered in for this financial year by accepting the suggestion of the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> that my proposal now should have relation to the average of the three years under consideration. </para>

        <para class="block">It was explained fairly fully by the honorable member for Wannon a few nights ago that, under the existing law, large amounts of capital may be held separately and severally by partners in a partnership. Especially is this so in the case of land which cannot be used by a partnership in estimating the total capital upon which the tax is levied under the principal Act. One case which has come under our joint notice will serve to disclose the injustice of the present law. It is a case inwhich three persons hold estates separately to the value of &#163;60,000. These persons decided to enter into a partnership in order that they might work this &#163;60,000 worth of landed estate. The new capital put into the partnership amounted to &#163;20,000. Under the present law the &#163;60,000 worth of land held by the partners in their separate and individual estates cannot be calculated as a part of the capital upon which the tax will be based under this Bill. I know that the Commissioner of Taxes has made an attempt to meet, in part, cases arising under this very unjust section of the principal Act. I understand that certain regulations have been framed under which it is permissible to capitalize either the amount of the rental or the grazing value of the land, such capitalizationbeing based on the length of thepartnership or on the lives of the individual partners themselves. The legal members of the Committee will readily understand how the calculation is made on. the lives of the individual partners. Either the rental value is assessed on the basis of the term that each partner is likely to live, or what may be regarded as the total period which will be covered by their joint lives, is divided by the number of partners, and thus an estimate is arrived at of the capital value of each life for the purposes of the partnership. Alternatively, the grazing or rental value of the land is estimated on the basis of the length ofthe partnership. These regulations indicate that the Commissioner has endeavoured to meet such cases in a way which will give a certain amount of relief. </para>
        <para>But honorable members will admit that if the landed estate of the whole of the individual partners is pooled for the purpose of earning income, the whole of that capital should be allowed in assessing the total amount which must be paid for taxation purposes. The amendment, therefore, aims at insuring that, where property or capital in a landed estate is used by the different partners to earn money under a partnership, the whole of that capital shall be allowed as capital of the partnership upon which an allowance of 10 per cent. shall be made before any tax under the principal Act is demanded. That is the object which the honorable member for Wannon seeks to achieve, and it is one with which I thoroughly agree. Had he not anticipated me, I certainly should have submitted a similar proposal. I have merely to add that the honorable member himself would have been present this afternoon to have moved this amendment but that he has been unfortunately detained at a meeting in the country. </para>

          <para>. -  This is a problem to which reference has been made at various stages of the Bill. Consideration has been asked for the man who, instead of putting capital into a business, puts land into it which earns profits - profits that under this Bill will be liable to excess profits taxation. The suggestion has been made that we should value the land at its real value, however  that result might be arrived at, and credit such value as capital in the same way that we credit as capital stock placed by a man upon land. That has been a problem which the Taxation Office has been endeavouring to solve for some time. The danger present has always been that of evasion, as the result of men putting one large estate into severalty, and operating it jointly, thus escaping one tax by means of bogus distribution and getting the benefit of another tax such as this by a pretence of joint holding. But it is perfectly clear that the injustice to <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> co-operators or partners in these cases ought to be attended to, if we can, without undue leakage of the tax, allow for that kind of partnership. I have consulted the Commissioner of Taxes, with a view to ascertaining whether he can devise a means of meeting the case. He has advised me that we may safely adopt a new clause - not upon the lines recommended by the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers),</inline> because that clause provides no machinery for properly dealing with the matter, but a clause on the following lines : - &#34;7a. Section seventeen of the principal Act is amended by adding at the end thereof the following sub-section :  - (5.) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, the capital of a partnership&#39; which, for the purpose of its business to which this Act applies, uses, rent free, land purchased or in process of purchase by a member of the partnership, or in which a member of the partnership has an estate for life or a leasehold estate, shall include - </para>

            <para>- Nevertheless, great injustice will be done in some cases if the two measures are not brought into conformity. &#39; Take the case of a partnership the income of which is &#163;1,800 a year, divided equally between two partners who draw &#163;900 each. If under the War-time Profits Tax Act such partners were taxable as they are under the Income Tax Act they would have nothing to pay, because only incomes exceeding &#163;1,000 are taxed. </para>

            <para>- There are cases which they will not meet. It is not just that a man whose sole income is from a partnership, and does not exceed &#163;900 a year, should be taxed at the same rate as if he were receiving &#163;1,800 a year.

        <para>Income Tax Act, they would have nothing to pay. If there were three partners drawing equally from a business having an income of &#163;1,800 a year, that is, each receiving &#163;600 a year, they would be taxed to the amount of &#163;133 each, or if the tax is raised to 75 per cent., to the amount of &#163;200 each. That is not fair. Since the Commissioner of Taxes levies income tax on partnership incomes at the point of distribution he. should levy the war-time profits tax in the same way. I shall be glad if the Treasurer will do something to remove this anomaly. </para>

          <para>- I brought the position of auctioneers . under the notice of the Treasurer, and understood from him that they will be exempt. When I spoke to him regarding partnerships generally, and urged consideration, he pointed out that very often, instead of there being only two, there were quite a number of partners. I think that the Treasurer can be relied on to give consideration to the small man, and is endeavouring to make the best of a bad job. In my opinion, the Bill should have been kicked out altogether, as it. will not touch the real profiteers. I hope that the honorable gentleman will remember that there are businesses, not in the nature of agencies, which may furnish very hard cases. -Proposed new clause agreed to. </para>

            <para>- I mentioned that at an earlier stage. The fundamental principle of a War-time Profits Tax Bill should be the taxing of all profits made during the period of the war in excess of the. pre-war standard. Where that principle is recognised, it is -reasonable to apply such rates as 50 and 75 per cent. to the excess profits, but there are many cases in which, while the profits during the first year of the war exceeded those of pre-war years, in subsequent years losses were incurred, and persons have been taxed on the profits of the first year without being given any consideration for the losses of subsequent years. Until the war is ended it will be quite impossible for a large section of the commercial community to know whether or not they have made any excess profits. They have purchased large stocks at very high prices. There has been an artificial prosperity, and they have paid this taxation on the profits they have made. But. their warehouses are filled up with stock purchased at war-time values, and they&#39; must now realize it on a falling market. The result will be that, although they made some profits in the earlier part of the war, they must inevitably make heavy losses in disposing of their war-time purchases. It is surely unfair that the losses, as well as the profits, should not be taken into consideration. If we can agree upon the principle that only those profits in excess of the general average made during the war shall be taxed, there can be no objection to this proposed new clause. The Imperial Act includes a similar giveandtake provision. I urge that this clause is fair and reasonable, and should be accepted. Our Act provides for a system of pre-war profits based on an average of three years. It also allows a man the choice of three pre-war years. The tax provides for a pre-war capital. The mere accidental fact of whether a man makes a profit or a loss should not be taken into consideration during the war period. The average profit extended over the whole .period of the war should be taken, and any excess compared with the pre-war profits is all that should be liable to taxation. </para>

In every other direction we have remedied it, but I am not prepared to accept the amendment. As the honorable member has very properly said, it would mean an averaging of the profits over the whole of the war period. That would involve re-adjustments in all past assessments as far as they can be re-adjusted, and a further final adjustment at the end of the time to cover errors in adjustment made at the end of previous bookkeeping periods. The mover of the amendment suggests that it will really tax the profiteer; in my judgment, it will not. If there are any of that species about still - and all Governments have been after him., and failing, more or less, to get him - - </para>

            <para>- He is more than a shadow, but he is fleeter than the honorable member. What the amendment means is this : A man 4may sell at heavy .profiteering rates for two or three years, but in subsequent years he may not be able to get full stocks, and it may not be his fault that he does not continue the profiteering. In the years 1914-15 and 1916- 17 he may have levied a heavy toll on the people, but, because he is not able to get full business on his turnover for 1917- 18, all his profiteering is to be forgiven him. He may for three years have profiteered heavily but because he makes losses in the next year and a half, all his evil is wiped out by his neglect to get stocks or his inability to trade. As a means of catching the profiteer, the amendment does not recommend itself at all, and, from the stand-point of the revenue, the Act might as well go by the board if the clause be agreed to. The Taxation Office assures me that huge and incalculable amounts which would have to be remitted or written down, and, as Treasurer, I am not prepared to do that at this stage. I remind honorable members who quote the Imperial, Canadian, and other Acts of this kind that there is no Act quite so liberal in its general provisions as the Australian Act. I have been told by an honorable member of this House, who has had occasion to study the principles and the incidence of the Imperial Act, that it is Heaven to live under this Act and Hell to live under the other. </para>

            <para>- I know they are; then why draw an analogy? The English Act provides for a lower rate of return for capital. Our Act has liberalized that allowance to 10 per cent. The&#39; Imperial Act allows an exemption of &#163;200; under our Act the exemption is &#163;1,000. On top of those advantages, the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> asks  for the general remedial provision which is embodied in the Imperial Act. In Great Britain there are not the great seasonal fluctuations that characterize Australia, and business is more regular. We have made in our Act special provision for taking up the slack. We have given the pastoralists all sorts of concessions. We have inserted a hardship clause and1 a drought clause, and a number of other advantages which the British Act does not confer. If honorable members desire to insert in this Bill the averaging provision that is contained in the Imperial Act, I am prepared to accept it with the other machinery of that Act, but I am not prepared to accept the amendment under any other conditions. </para>

          <para>&#39;.- This proposed clause applies to every type of business. I do not know enough about the pastoral industry to be able to express an opinion regarding it; but, so  far as ordinary commerce is concerned, I see the greatest danger in passing an averaging provision at this stage. Whether when the Act was originally passed it would have been wise to have had such a provision is a matter of opinion; I think, possibly, that it would have been fairer to the general trading community, but it is certainly too late to insert any such provision now. If that were done, the whole commercial community would be involved in chaos. </para>

            <para>- The commercial community has traded for three and a half years without any averaging clause, and the amendment proposes that for the next six months we shall trade under an averaging provision. The armistice has been signed, and we believe the war is over. Many merchants have enormous stocks, and the general belief is that in the near future, although not immediately, the value of those stocks will fall considerably. The immediate result of the passing of an averaging clause now would be that every merchant and trader who has big stocks would shift them at any cost, because&#39;, not they, but the Government would foot the bill. The effect of that might be admirable, so far as individual traders are concerned. In my own business we have a stock of nearly &#163;750,000, and I would be delighted to shift it, but if we and others did that we should wipe a lot of smaller traders out of existence. If the Treasurer is really enthusiastic about doing something to assist the commercial community in regard to averaging, and this amendment were: made to apply up to June, 1918, some of the dangers I have suggested would disappear. But, in all seriousness, I do urge upon honorable members very careful consideration before voting for an averaging clause when the tax has only six months to run. If they agree to this proposal, they may involve the community in commercial chaos. </para>

The position of pastoralists in the droughtstricken areas of Australia is well known ; and I understand that the Treasurer has a full knowledge of the difficulties and disabilities under which pastoralists, small and large, have to labour in such circumstances. In view of the promise of the Treasurer that the whole matter would be considered byhim, with a view of bringing forward a new proposal, or accepting the amendment of which my honorable friend had given notice, I shall not discuss the question further, but shall be glad to learn what are the intentions of the Government. </para>

It is designed to meet the position of pastoralists who have been engaged in the industry for only five or six years, and prior to the war made no profits, but who during the war period have been making fair profits and have been compelled to pay this tax. I have supplied the Treasurer with a statement taken from the accounts of a pastoralist who has been in the industry for only six years. During the pre-war years he made no profit, but in the first year of the war he made a profit. He had from &#163;7,000 to &#163;20,000 invested in the enterprise, but in the pre-war years did not earn interest on his capital, or anything for his own services. In the first accounting period, however, he made a profit of &#163;4,800, and was taxed to the extent of &#163;2,050. </para>

            <para>- When I mentioned this matter last week the Treasurer said I was asking for something on behalf of a section of individuals in the pastoral industry that was not allowed to any other section of the community. I would remind him that it is allowed to all business people under sub-section 14 of section 15. On Friday last I referred to a statement setting out that one pastoralist in the three years immediately preceding the war showed aloss of &#163;950, and that in the first accounting period he showed a book profit of &#163;1,500. He wrote to the Department urging that since he had only made a profit of &#163;1,500 in the first accounting period, and showed a loss of &#163;950 in respect of the immediately preceding three years, he should be allowed to deduct that loss from his profit made during the assessment period. That request was refused, although, under subsection 14 of section 15, the Commissioner has power to make such, a concession to business people. All that I urge is that the concession should be extended to persons so situated in the pastoral industry, or that they should be at least allowed to earn 10 per cent. on the capital employed by them without being liable to this tax. The Department in Western Australia fixes values for taxing purposes from 6s. to 9s. per head for lambs, according to the district in which they are raised, and from 37s. 6d. to 52s. 6d. for calves, although the owners may not  be able to get anything like that price for them when they proceed to sell.- It seems to me that the policy of the Government is to allow a man who makes a profit of &#163;15,000 out of an option on a mining proposition to escape this taxation, whereas a pastoralist struggling under the adverse conditions I have mentioned receives no consideration. If two brothers were left &#163;5,000 each and one of them went into the back country and put his money into a pastoral proposition, taking all the risks and privations attendant upon such a venture, he would have to pay this tax, though, possibly, he may not have made any cash profit. If the other brother put his &#163;5,000 out on mortgage on city properties, and commenced business in the city as a commission agent, taking no risk or responsibility, he would be free of this tax, no matter howl large his income. Is that a. reasonable policy to pursue ? It is preposterous, and if I do not obtain any concession for these people, I shall fight the Bill through the third-reading stage and try to block it. It is damnable that concessions should be made to people living in Melbourne or Sydney who can come here and get the ear of the Government - it is extraordinary that a man who starts in a business as a broker or agent in the city, and lives on his wits, may make &#163;15,000 or &#163;20,000 and escape the tax - while the man who goes into the back country to fight nature, even if he cannot show anything more than a book profit, has to pay the tax. He may have to borrow the money with which to pay it. This is a matter of great importance, and I hope that the Treasurer will see fit to do something to give relief to a class more worthy of it than any other in the community. </para>

          <para>. -  I think that concessions have gone quite far enough. We have met the case of the pastoralists as reasonably as possible, and this amendment asks us to go beyond bounds altogether. .First of all, the wording of the amendment leaves it to be supposed that any losses occurring in pre-war years are to be allowed during the war period. </para>

            <para>- No, they are not. There are certain classes of pre-war years, three in number, but in certain cases there are six when abnormal conditions operate. I think the honorable member could, with some degree of reason, or less unreason, have confined his proposal to the three pre-war years. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member has had much more time than I to refine this wonderful amendment, but I must say that I am not able to see any alteration in it since it was first submitted. It has serious defects, and its principle in itself is wrong in view of what we have done elsewhere in the Bill. We say to any other business man that, if he made losses during the three pre-war years, he may account for them and deduct them before he pays taxation on war-time profits; but we do not say to him that we will give him credit for 10 per cent, during the time the capital was not earning profits in pre-war time. Yet that is what the honorable member desires in the case of the pastoral industry. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member apparently forgets that we have gone further out of our way to meet the pastoral industry during this revision of the Act than we have to meet any other class of business. We have inserted a clause dealing with hardships, by which, in the same way as in connexion with a land tax, the Board may reduce or remit altogether if, by reason of drought or adverse seasons or conditions, the returns from the land used for the purpose of the business have been seriously impaired. That is a wide and sweeping amendment, and, in addition, a clause has been inserted, at the suggestion of the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Page),</inline> empowering the Commissioner to take into account, and allow a percentage on, pastoral properties that are liable to severe drought and the capital of which is liable to be seriously decreased or wholly lost through drought. </para>

I am inclined to think that you do not realize what it will mean to my company as fully as you might. It means that if the war terminated at once, it will coat us in the locality of&#163; 70,000 tax, whilst we will have worked five years for nothing at all to establish, the business, and a further seven years for practically a bare 10 per cent, on capital, as the pre-war paid-up was only &#163;4,001, The Government propose to take &#163;70,000, and leave my company &#163;21,000 to &#163;25,000 for our twenty-one years&#39; strenuous work.

          <para>My company commenced business in 1908, experimented until 31st August, 1911. That balance showed a net loss of &#163;2,875 17s. 8d., as the statement which I gave you attached to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allard&#39;s</inline> letter will show. We worked strenuously until 31st August, 1914, at which date we were fortunately able to wipe out our losses and get on the right side of the ledger. This was the first year, mark you, that any profit was distributed. That means we had five years of dead-horse to work off. </para>
          <para>The Act provided, in section 16, sub-section 12, that the last pre-war trading year shall be the balance before the 5th day of August, 1914. Now, our 1914 balance showed &#163;9,371 15s. 9d. profit; but the above provision in the Act cuts us out by the fact of our balance being on the 31st of August. We overlapped the allowed time by twenty-seven days, and we were prevented from the benefit of this year&#39;s profit&#39; in our pre-war standard, and caused us to have to accept a 10 per cent.&#39; basis. </para>
          <para>So, after seven years&#39; struggle, out of. the first profit of any note, we were called upon to pay nearly &#163;8,000 by this so-called wartime profit tax. Mark you, if this were our only loss, it would not be so serious, but the pre-war standard remains unaltered, whilst the law exists; and, on the same basis for 1916-17, we will be called upon to pay nearly &#163;12,000, and yearly after, accordingly. </para>
          <para>I can assure you that if there had not been a war on we should have been able to sell at least another 1,000 cars during the war period to date, and would have made a better average of profit on each car ; but, owing to the factory supply shortages, together with dearth of shipments, our requirements were cut very short, and are still. </para>
          <para>There are a very large percentage of businesses that balance between 30th June and 30th September, owing to it being a slack time of the year. If the law were amended to allow of the inclusion in pre-war standard of the 1914 balance, providing there were not any abnormal profits made in the last month or two, this would relieve a number of hardships with young and struggling businesses. </para>
          <para>This law, in my opinion, should never have been applied to this country, as we have no war profits to speak of, in the sense that Europe and America have had by the huge supply of Army and Navy requirements, such as ships, guns, ammunitions, and war stores. </para>
          <para>Trusting I have made myself clear in this matter, together with what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allard</inline> said in his letter, and to give you something further to guide you, I am enclosing copies of the assessment sheets for the war-time profits tax paid bv us outside of income tax, which was &#163;7,841 &#34;ls. Cd. </para>

        <para class="block">We have endeavoured to induce people to establish the manufacture of motor bodies in Australia. This gentleman went into the business, and prior to 1914 sustained losses. Then just as his business began to pay, the overlapping of twenty-seven days after the outbreak of the war leads to his having to contribute over &#163;7,000 in the shape of war-time profits tax. Surely we are not going to take our pound of flesh from a man who establishes a new industry? </para>

            <para>- No. Mcintosh and Sons have established a motor tody building business, one of those industries we ought to foster. We may not be able to manufacture goods as fancy-looking as those which can be imported; but, so far as quality is concerned, they are as good as any that can be produced in other countries. There are members of the Committee who are better able to speak of manufacturing industries than I am, but the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond),</inline> who was returned to this Parliament as a Protectionist, apparently does not know&#39; anything of the conditions of a great factory established in the State from which he comes. He says the man whose case I have mentioned is an importer, but he is an importer only of raw material, as are those engaged in many other industries. I hope that the Treasurer will take a favorable view of this matter, and. if he cannot go as far as we should like, will be prepared to do something to relieve persons engaged in these and similar industries of undue pressure under the Act </para>

          <para>.- 1 am afraid that the honorable member did not speak from his book, though he spoke very well, as he always does. He spoke rather  from  his heart than from his head. Let me say what the real  difficulty  is in dealing with this matter. I have not, of course, investigated all the cases that have been submitted in documentary form to the Treasury. That would be a herculean task, and would occupy several months. This is a proposition emanating, probably, from a firm, whose date of balancing accounts fits in awkwardly with the provisions of the Act. They had a good year ending on the 31st August, 1914, and they desire that that should be taken as a prewar year. &#39; But that cannot be done under the Act. The same thing applies to all firms who balance late in August, in September, October, or November. There are a multitude of such cases of firms and individuals whose dates of balancing do not synchronize with the dates provided for in the Act. If we opened the door to meet the circumstances of a particular firm balancing upon a particular date we would have to open it to meet the circumstances of scores or hundreds of others. I am not prepared to do that. </para>

            <para>- The dates have been well ind truly laid under the Act, .and on those dates all our assessments have been based, and will be for the next three years. All that cannot be altered now. It might be suggested that we should exclude a certain number of days from the 4tb August, 1914, up to the 31st August, and assume that profits made within those twenty-seven days should not be taxed. If we did that we should have to accept statements of sales, and would have great difficulty in making certain that we did not allow profits to escape which should be brought under  taxation. </para>

          <para>.The amendment seems to me to represent a fair proposal, but I see the difficulty which its exact wording would create, and which has been mentioned by the Treasurer. If we opened the door to meet the case of a firm balancing at the end of August, a firm balancing on the  1st September would demand a similar concession. If we provided for the case of- a firm balancing on the 30th September, a firm balancing on the 1st October would expect to be included. I think, however, that it would help very greatly to meet the difficulty which has arisen if the Treasurer could see his way to adopt the principle of taking the number of months in the year which fell outside the war-time period, and on the profits during those months, estimate the average profit for the rest of the year. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">The Treasurer has suggested that that would be impracticable if not impossible, but, from a very considerable experience of business, I say that it would be neither impracticable nor impossible, but that it would be simplicity itself. There is a very strong argument in favour of the adoption of that principle in the fact that the Act already provides for its application in other circumstances. In the case of certain businesses the Act contemplates taking a period up to a time when the war started, and, by the operations for that time, adjusting the profit over the whole twelve months. It applies only to businesses recently formed, but there would be no difficulty. at all in the application of the same principle to meet the cases which the amendment is submitted to relieve. The Act provides that where, owing to the recent commencement of business, there has not been one pre-war trade year, the pre-war standard of profit shall be taken to be an amount proportionate to the period of twelve months of the actual period during the pre-war period, during which the business was carried on. That is the very thing which I am suggesting can &#39; be applied with simplicity in this case. If a man was trading for only nine months before the declaration of war, the Act says that it is perfectly simple to take accounts for that nine months, and add one-third to the profits made during that period to estimate the profits from the twelve months&#39; trading. That would be a fair principle to apply, not merely to meet the circumstances of the particular case referred to by the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Page)</inline> - because we cannot consider particular cases - but of a number of firms in a similar position. They are certainly entitled to get the benefit that is given to other firms. It is not fair to exclude some businesses from benefits conceded to others under the Act. I should be prepared to support an amendment on the lines I have indicated. </para>

            <para>- I have not apologized yet. I say that the Treasurer feels it to be his duty to get all the cash he can under this Bill; but, to my way of thinking, he is adopting a method which is not a fair one. I know nothing of the particular case to which the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Page)</inline> has referred, but I do know that, in the case of many firms who balanced six months after war was declared, their accounts included little or nothing of war-time profit. There was a period of stagnation in trade between the 4th August, 1914, and the beginning of 1915, and most businesses during that time made losses and not profits. The purpose of the Act is to secure war-time profits made unfairly at the expense of the community, and surely when the Act is before us for amendment, and it is admitted by the Treasurer that it requires amendment, we are entitled to consider a proposal to meet the circumstances of those who were carrying on business for nine, ten, or eleven months of the year prior to the outbreak of the war. The suggestion made by the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> is an eminently fair one, and I think the amendment now before the Committee is also fair. If the purpose of the Act is to derive revenue from those who have made profits out of the war, it is clear that those who made profits prior to the 4th August, 1914, did not make them out of the war, and should not be taxed on them. I want to put it on record that, though the Treasurer has refused to consider it, I regard the amendment as meeting a legitimate request, and will, therefore, support it. </para>

          <para>.- When the original Bill was before the House I wished to move an amendment of this sort, but owing to the result of allnight sittings, I was precluded from doing so. The Minister in charge of the measure, seeing the justice of my proposal, said he would give it consideration when the measure went to another place. The Bill was, however, rushed through in another place also, and my proposal did not get the consideration which it deserved. I think that the principal objection urged against it was that as soon as the war broke out, at the beginning of 1914, everything appreciated in value, and people made large profits in consequence. Of course, we know that that was not so, and as the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> has pointed out, there was a slump in business for some time. </para>

            <para>- I recognise that the Treasurer has made concessions and it is unfortunate that the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Page),</inline> coming before the Committee in the way it does, obscures the fact that there are hundreds of other cases of companies, not so highly capitalized as that to which he has referred, which are just as hardly dealt with. </para>

            <para>- This seems, on the face of it, such a palpably fair amendment that I thought the Treasurer would accept it. I know of thousands of cases in which the Act has operated very harshly in imposing taxation on businesses established shortly before the commencement of the Act. Businesses that were fortunate enough to balance on the 31st July are all right, because their last year&#39;s profits are counted as the pre-war standard, and the businesses which balance&#39; six-monthly are not so hardly hit; but the man who balances every twelve months, and comes in a little after the pre-war accounting period, has been very hardly hit. The Treasurer is not showing his usual readiness to recognise a case in which an injustice is being done. I trust that, even now, he will meet us generously in this particular case. </para>

          <para>.- I do not know whether the * Treasurer caught the remarks of the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> or the quotation, from the principal Act, showing that exactly the same principle as the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Page)</inline> wishes to introduce here is actually in operation. With his extensive business knowledge, the honorable member for Flinders says that it is a comparatively easy matter to adjust the prewar standard if there have been nine months running&#39; before the war period. There is an average income for those nine months, and it is very easy to average over the remaining three months, which are covered by the war period, at the nine months&#39; rate. I add my request to the others made to the Treasurer, as this matter seriously affects new businesses and employment in Australia. &#39; I trust that he will take the question into consideration, as has been suggested from both sides of the Committee. </para>

          <para>. - I also urge the Treasurer to give this question further consideration. He tells us that it is too late, and that it means ripping up the Bill. I cannot see how it is going to do that. It affects manufacturing businesses. We have made extraordinary provisions in this country to try to give employment to our people. The motorcar body manufacturing industry has become a tremendous one. I am given to understand that the injustice that  is  being done is preventing the employment to-day of 300 - skilled Australians who have been trained here*. Consequently, this legislation prevents a very large  industry  from being established. We are not asking, the Treasurer for anything new, because a similar provision  is  already in sub-section 6 of section 16 of the principal Act. The Treasurer&#39;s own business experience must show him that it is very easy to apportion, say, eleventwelfths of a year, or, if necessary, threefourths of a year. This particular man, after five years&#39; struggling and striving, at a big loss of money and energy, establishes an industry that we have been trying to foster in this country. He uses Australian materials, and employs cur own people; he has to use very big capital, and run a great deal of risk, as  is  shown by the number of failures that have taken place in these motor concerns. After years of loss, he has succeeded  in  establishing the industry, and then, m the very year that he begins to make up a little money - although not all his  loss  - the war starts, and, unfortunately for him, his balance-sheet comes out at the end of August. The war started on the 4th August. Is he to be deprived of a fair accounting period because of those twenty-seven days? Is that consideration to cut him out of ordinary justice? I quite agree that the Treasurer must have some standard to go by, and cannot alter it to suit every man&#39;s balance-sheet; but from the commercial stand-point  it  ought to be very easy to meet a case like this. The honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> who is an authority, tells as that the thing is done every day  in  commercial circles, and can be very easily done in this case. Our own knowledge of commerce, however small it is, shows that there should be no difficulty. Why should not a man be allowed eleventwelfths of his year ? This request should not be opposed, because our policy should be, &#34;Let justice be done, even <inline font-style="italic">M</inline> the heavens fall.&#34; </para>

            <para>- No. I am quite prepared to catch the profiteer, but the Treasurer knows that this provision does not catch him. It may catch some profiteers, but it catches more inoffensive business men, while &#39;we know that some of the richest profiteers, who have made fortunes since the war started, have said publicly that they will not have to pay a penny of this tax. What is the good of the Treasurer talking about our having our &#34;tongues in our cheeks&#34; when he knows that profiteering has been going on all the time ? Any business man with ordinary common sense can see that this Bill perpetrates an injustice. In the case of this particular man, the injustice is not only for one year, but his prewar standard will be taken as a basis of computation for all his taxation. I do not blame the Treasurer for not interviewing people - he has too much to do, and has too many peoplewaiting to see him; but he will not show his usual good judgment if he is not prepared to meet this man in a fair and reasonable way. </para>

            <para>- This man&#39;s case is typical. Why should I not bring it forward ? He does not go behind a hedge; he puts his balance-sheet before members of Parliament, and shows his hand to them. He shows his losses, and his profits, and the struggle that he has had. We ought to encourage that sort of candour. There is nothing under the rose. All his cards are on the table. It will be a monstrous injustice if his case is not met. This is a monstrously unjust Act, but I do not blame the Treasurer for it, because it was a legacy to him, and, in spite of what he has said to me, I state frankly that, in my opinion, he has improved the Bill. He has made the best of a bad job, but if he will meet this case he will make the job a little better. No doubt there are many hard cases that cannot be considered by the House. This man has had the enterprise to put his case before members in black and white. Probably, as the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> says, a number of men suffer in the same way, and the Treasurer should certainly be able to do something to meet them, even if an amendment has to be made in another place. All we ask for is ordinary common fair play. An honorable member who has had a practical commercial training says that it is a very easy thing to do. </para>

            <para>- If we allow that sort of thing to happen, we are not worth our salt. We ought to insist on a change, if we believe that an injustice is being done. We should not be told that we are embarrassing the Government. We are not here to prop up or pull down Governments, but to look after the interests of the taxpayers. This man has had the candour to tell us that he is making many thousands. He runs the risk of that statement having a bad effect on honorable members, because we are inclined to hit the big man very hard, if we can, as the honorable member for Maranoa says. But this man has not cloaked his profits. He states clearly and emphatically that if we refuse to make  an alteration because it does not suit our system of accounting or averages, we shall be doing him a gross injustice, and penalizing him to the extent of thousands of pounds, while at the same time we1 allow many profiteers to go scot free.I appeal to the Treasurer to put aside the little feeling which he seems to be showing in this matter. I know that he is anxious to get on with the business, and I am prepared to sit here and help him; but I ask him to look into this case, and take advice as to whether he cannot make a change. Personally, this man does not matter a button to us. There must be dozens of similar cases in which persons cannot make themselves heard in Parliament. If we do not meet these hard cases,  we  confess that Parliament is impotent to do justice. </para>

            <para>- Then the position has arisen which I foresaw and foreshadowed last week, when it was proposed to sit longer hours and allow new business to be taken after 11 o&#39;clock at night. When the Iron and Steel Bounty Bill has been disposed of, and the Defence Bill is called on, it will be found that some members who are interested in that measure have gone away, not having the slightest idea that it would come on to-day. They thought the Committee would go on dealing with the War-time Profits Bill, which has now been put over rather hurriedly and somewhat dramatically. I am glad of the intimation from the Minister for Price Fixing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> as to what the Government propose to take next, because we should not be left in the dark. The Government have a right to deal with the business in their own way, but honorable members are liable to be called out of the building on business for an hour or two, and may not know under the present arrangements what is likely to be done. There are some Bills that I am interested in. It is my intention to oppose the Chief Justice&#39;s Pension Bill - No. 2 on the notice-paper. I have taken the trouble to look up the votes of honorable members and Ministers when this question was previously before the House, and I find some of the Ministers were at that time opposed to the principle. If the business on the notice-paper is to be altered without the knowledge of honorable members, the Government could practically clear off the whole of it in their absence. But we have a right to know the intention of the Government in regard to alterations of the order of business. I thank the Minister for telling us that after the Iron and Steel Bounty Bill has been disposed of the Government intend to deal with the. Defence Bill - No. 8 on the business-paper. </para>

          <para>. -  I support the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> in his protest concerning the action of the Government. I have come to the conclusion that it is nearly time the Government gave up trying &#39;to conduct the business of the House at all. The incident we have just witnessed seems to indicate that the sooner the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> comes back the better it will be. </para>

            <para>- I said that the sooner the Prime Minister comes back the better, for I would like to see the business of this country carried on. You will agree, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that when the businesspaper is placed before honorable members they are entitled to see the items discussed in their order. We were all led to believe that item No. 1 - the Wartime Profits Tax Assessment Bill - was important enough to occupy first place and be dealt with but we are now informed that the Government intend to deal with the Chief Justice&#39;s Pension Bill. </para>

            <para>- I am quite sure, sir, that if you were where I am now you would not agree with the action of the Government, and you would take a great deal longer than I am talcing to express your view. It is the duty of the Opposition to oppose, and, without for a moment suggesting that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is in agreement with me, I take advantage of this opportunity to direct the attention of honorable members to the fact that the Government propose, instead of proceeding with the business in the order set out on the notice-paper, to consider a proposal to pay a pension, and to delay the consideration of the Estimates, involving an expenditure of over &#163;100,000,000. </para>

I could understand a postponement of debate upon the Ministerial statement, though I should like to draw attention to the necessity for an early consideration of that matter, in view of the announcement made to-day by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> that he had taken the extraordinary course of removing a Minister from office without the consent of the Prime. Minister, who is in England. All the circumstances point to the need for a consideration of this matter before we deal with the Iron and Steel Bounty Bill, in connexion with which the Minister suggested that, as it was a simple proposal, the Government proposed to deal with it first. </para>

            <para>- Asides in the House are very dangerous. The honorable member making an aside must always assume that the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporter will record the statement. Does the Minister mean to say that the Iron and Steel Bounty Bill and the Defence Bill are of greater urgency than the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill? Let the Minister be candid, and admit at once that a crisis has arisen on the Government benches. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> left the House a few minutes ago in a petulant mood. Where are his supporters? Where are the Win-the-War party that sits behind the Government? Why are they not here now? </para>

            <para>- I admit that; but I am not speaking of the insurgents. I am referring to those staunch, dumb, and docile supporters that sit behind the Government. When one of them, like the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Poster),</inline> ventures to make a few remarks, the Acting Prime Minister turns and rends him; but the honorable member for Wakefield was afterwards paid some small compliment, and everything was all right again. </para>

            <para>- It should not be postponed unless the people concerned are warned. In this case honorable members who have prepared speeches expecting the Government business to be called on in the order set down on the notice-paper, are placed at a great disadvantage. Many of them, perhaps, have gone down town to attend to urgent private business, and when they come back they will probably be disappointed to find that the Iron and Steel Bounty Bill and the Defence Bill have been taken in their absence. They may desire to move amendments in connexion with these proposals, but the Assistant Minister has submitted a motion, which seems to be deception almost in the nature of the thimble and pea business now you. see it and now. you don&#39;t. Now you see the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill under consideration, and how you see the Chief Justice&#39;s Pension Bill. And now you don&#39;t see it, because it has &#39; been . put under some other thimble. The odds are ten to one, and perhaps longer, that we shall not be able to say what particular measure will be under consideration at a. quarter to 8 to-night. </para>

            <para>- That would be a sensible proposal if the Minister in charge would agree. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> one wants the War-time profits Tax Assessment Bill, and no one, I imagine, wants the Chief Justice&#39;s Pension Bill, so it would be a businesslike method to bring forward the Estimates, and let the Corner party and the rebellious members point to the wickedness and maladministration of the Government. I am sorry the Acting Prime Minister is not here, as I do not want to nay anything very unkind in his absence, but, although he was subjected to a good deal o&#163; adverse criticism, I do not think he should have displayed petulance, because, after all, honorable members have been very kind to the Government. I am sure the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> must at times have felt compelled to rise in his place and make a few observations in criticism of the Government. The Acting Prime Minister ought not to have displayed petulance this afternoon, and I am sure that when he has had time for consideration he will be sorry that he reported progress. We were all doing very well indeed. He should not have been so severe upon the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chapman).</inline></para>

            <para>- I am sure, sir, you will admit that, in the interests of good government, much depends upon maintaining the order of business. The Acting Minister for Tirade and Customs has come forward with the proposal to postpone some most important measures until we have dealt with a trifling: &#34;amendment of the Iron and Steel Bounty Bill; and after that it is proposed to consider the Defence &#34;Bill, though I think honorable members will remember that the Acting Prime Minister informed us that the Government did not want the Defence Bill before Christmas. </para>

The Senate has amended the clause by the addition of a proviso with regard to the Minister laying an authorization before Parliament. Clause 3 formed the subject of much discussion when the Bill was before this Committee. I advanced the reason then that circumstances might arise-- </para>

          <para>.- This is a matter of laying a regulation before Parliament. I ask the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman),</inline> who has been in this Parliament from the beginning, how many regulations have been even discussed - let alone disallowed - among the many thousands which have been laid upon the table. I recall that the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford)</inline> gave notice several years ago, with regard to the disallowance of certain regulations.  His  notice of motion was never reached upon the business paper. He had no &#34; look in &#34; at all, although he sought, by other means, to initiate a discussion of the same matter. Unless there is to be something more than this proviso we might as well be without any reference to the Minister&#39;s authorization at all. It is true that the Senate might be in a position to discuss and object to certain regulations laid before it; but the trouble is, so far as this House is concerned, before we had reached the stage of disallowing any regulation laid before us the imported material could be landed in Australia, and the manufacture of the product completed. If there is one fundamental principle in the Bill at all it is that Australian raw material shall be used in this manufacture. If we obtain sheet bar steel from overseas the finished product will have little of an Australian character about it. There will have been no Australian coal employed for the production of coke, no Australian limestone, no Australian iron ore, and no Australian wages paid. If we were to inquire into the whole process, I dare say it would be found that the rolling of the sheet-bar steel and the galvanizing and corrugating processes would not represent more than one-eighth of the actual wage-sheet covering the production from start to finish. </para>

        <para>The real reason for Parliament proposing to give thisbounty is, first of all, that the article shall be produced in Australia, andthat Australian raw material shall be used. I stated during the second-reading debate, that the proposal should commend itself to honorable members, particularly in view of the fact that at present so little overseas freight space is available. Apparently, the idea is that the space which would be required for importing galvanized iron will be saved, but that there will be shipping space enough to import the sheet bar steel. </para>
        <para>The Minister has advanced as the reason for the insertion of this proviso, that it will have the effect of preventing two firms in Australia from obtaining a monopoly. The Minister, by the very figures which he himself employed, showed that the quantity of galvanized and corrugated and black sheets used in Australia would be more than could keep one blast furnace going. </para>

          <para>. - I hope the proviso will be agreed to. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> was quite correct, so far as his argument proceeded; but when a bounty is being granted so as to create an industry, there mustbe some provision that those to whom the bounty is being given will not establish a monopoly and be placed in a position to freeze out any manufacturer who may begin operations in one of the other States. Suppose that a factory were started in Williamstown, or at some place in South Australia, or in Hobart. Suppose that the Broken Hill Company were to become interested in the business themselves. Does it not seem quite possible that that firm-, by not having the material to supply to others, might freeze out manufacturers in one of the other States? </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The amendment relates only to action to be taken in a case of necessity. I cannot imagine any Minister using his authorization unless there were absolute need for the importation of the sheet bar steel. Parliament is giving a bounty which for some time will tend to foster monopolies, and it is safe and wise to provide that if a monopoly is brought about to the detriment of manufacturers in another part of Australia, the Minister should have power to say, . &#34; Unless you supply these manufacturers at reasonable prices we shall take care that they secure supplies from  elsewhere.&#34; The amendment introduces a very proper precaution, and I cannot understand the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition in objecting to it. </para>

          <para>.- We have had such a sickener of regulations that it is a marvel that the Government can find a supply of paper to issue fresh ones. The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams)</inline> is apprehensive that some local firm may create a monopoly. How long have our rural producers been compelled to endure Free Trade monopolies which have been foisted upon them ? If there is to be a monopoly, I would prefer that it should be one in which Australian labour and Australian materials are being combined for the production of an Australian article. But have we no other method than that proposed in this proviso of dealing with monopolists ? Parliament would be quite right, of course, in taking necessary precautions. </para>

        <para class="block">In submitting this motion I would remind honorable members that our Judiciary Act makes no provision for the granting of pensions. But section 84 of our Constitution provides that officers transferred to the Commonwealth from a State shall preserve all their- existing and accruing rights. Now, the first Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia came over from the State of Queensland after he had served as Chief Justice of that State for ten years. Under a Queensland Statute passed in 1893, the salary of the Chief Justice was fixed at &#163;3,500 per annum. That Act was incorporated with the Queensland Supreme Court Act of 1874, section 5 of which provided that - </para>

        <para class="block">When the Chief Justice of Queensland became Chief Justice of the High Court he had served ten years on the State Sup/ema Court Bench. Had he remained in Queensland in that exalted office for another five years, he would have been entitled to retire on a pension of one-half of his salary. He was appointed to his present position on the 5th October, 1903, so that he has filled the office of Chief Justice of the High Court for fifteen years. Seeing that he gave up his position in Queensland with its accompanying rights and privileges to become the Chief Justice of Australia at the same salary as he was then receiving, I submit that it is only reasonable and just that he should be granted a pension, and placed in a position similar to that which he would have occupied had he remained in Queensland instead of accepting service with the Commonwealth. </para>

He came to Australia at the age of eight years, was educated at the Maitland .High School, and, passing to the Sydney &#34;University at the age of fourteen years, graduated there as Bachelor and Master of Arts after a brilliant scholastic career, distinguishing himself in classics and mathematics, and winning the Mort Travelling Scholarship. </para>

He afterwards held various portfolios until 1879, when he became Leader of the Opposition. He was Premier of Queensland from 1883 to 1888, then Leader of the Opposition again, and subsequently, from 1890 to 1S93, Premier, Chief Secretary, and Attorney-General of the State.

In 1901 he was made a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, an honour that he richly deserved, and, in 1903, he was appointed first Chief Justice of the High Court of the Commonwealth of Australia. </para>
        <para>The Constitution of the Commonwealth created three fundamental institutions - the Parliament, the Executive, and the Judiciary. Of these the last named occupies a unique position, as it is the interpreter, or - as an American Judge has put it - the guardian of the Constitution. It is the duty of our Judiciary to determine in the conflicts that arise out of the exercise of the rights of sovereign powers of Commonwealth and State. It was recognised when the first High Court Bench was appointed that we needed a strong and powerful Judiciary, and that the best men that Australia could command should be obtained. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> E. O&#39;Connor &#39;were appointed, it was felt throughout the legal profession and among the community generally that they would form a Judiciary which would administer justice impartially throughout the Commonwealth, and hold the scales of justice f airlyin the settlement of questions arising between the Commonwealth and States. All eyes turned toward <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel,</inline> the new Chief Justice, who was appointed to preside over the Court because of his ability, learning, knowledge, wide range of experience, and great strength of character. </para>
        <para>Without desiring to pronounce judgment on a living record, I can safely assert that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith has realized the high expectations of those responsible for his appointment to the Chief Justiceship. There was need of a strong man for the position, because the High Court had to be organized and set going as part of the machinery of the Constitution. It. was not long before the Court was properly started on its career. We were only then beginning to realize what our Constitution meant. Honorable members who were in this Parliament in 1901 know the pain and effort that were given, and the ability that was shown, in the first years of Federation, in converting the piece of parchment which was our Constitution into a living organism for the good government of the people of Australia. Critics outside sometimes dis- parage our public men, but when the history of Australia has been impartially written, it will be acknowledged that no other Federation in the world can show greater progress and development, or greater ability, in the settlement of national problems, than was shown by the Commonwealth of Australia in the first, twenty years of its existence. Many questions arose upon which the High Court was called to adjudicate, and it was for the Justices to interpret the instrument of government under which Parliament was working. When the judgments of the Court are quietly and fairly studied, the enormous difficulties of the Justices, and the pains they took, and the ability they showed in their interpretation of the Constitution, will be appreciated. In  the framing of these judgments the Chief Justice played an exceedingly conspicuous part. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline>Griffith was responsible for tlie introduction of many laws that are still on the statute-book of Queensland. As a member of a Colonial Conference he gave proof of abilities which marked him out as a statesman of the Empire, and as a member of the Drafting Committee of the first Convention he was practically responsible for the framing of the draft Constitution on which our present Constitution is based. When in Parliament he showed himself to be a wonderfully skilful draftsman.  His  was a keen, analytical mind, and he had a wonderful -gift for discerning the trend of debate, crystallizing the views of members, and embodying them in a clear piece of legislation. These abilities were again seen in his work in the Federal Convention of 1891 . He rendered invaluable service to Australia by the part he played there. . </para>
        <para>While on the Queensland Bench he took up  the  subject of law reform, and the criminal code which he drafted is a model of perfection. He spent a great deal of time and research upon it, and in practical working it has been found one of the most useful codes that is known. </para>
        <para>I will not&#39; remind honorable members further of the services which this great man has given .to Australia during the past forty-six years. When the history of this country is written, his name will be recalled with pride as that of a great British subject, who, in the Dominions overseas, played an important part in the building of the Empire. </para>

          <para>.- I have never had a more painful duty to perform than that which I am about to undertake. But when the Government submit a proposition of this kind, even though the mover surrounded! it by . a very eloquent tribute to a very able man, I nave to consider what is my duty to the general public in the Capricornia electorate, whom I represent, and to the people of Australia. As the Ministry have chosen to bring this motion forward as a personal matter, it is most unpleasant for me -to be compelled to consider it from a personal stand-point, and to discount the eloquent tribute that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> in proposing the motion, has seen fit to pay to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith. I agree with all that he said about the intellectual brilliancy of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, about his great erudition as a scholar, his remarkable attainments as a lawyer, and also the distinguished position he filled as an Austraiian politician. I admit all those qualifications; but, in the phraseology of the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine),</inline> &#34; he has been on a very good wicket.&#34; The Minister has pointed out that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> played a very important part in the public life of Aus-, tralia. In the political arena in Queensland <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> was a great protagonist, and if he had chosen to remain in public life no doubt he would have continued to show that he had pre-eminent qualities that entitled him to be a leader amongst his countrymen. But he did not choose the thorny path of the politician; he chose the primrose path. He left the politics of Queensland, and was translated to the position of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. He represented to those who desired him to accept that appointment that it would not pay him to do so at the salary then attaching to the position - &#163;2,500, I believe. There may have been political reasons for removing him from parliamentary life.; he was a most dangerous opponent. </para>

            <para>- In addition to the salary of ?3,500, he was given credit and the gratitude of the people for having taken the position. Brilliant as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> has been in the past, for the last few years he has not been the keenest  intellect on the High Court Bench. An attempt was made by the Prime Minister to induce the Queensland Government to regard <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> as a transferred officer, and the offer was made that if the Queensland Government would pay portion of the pension the Commonwealth Government would pay the balance. Finding that the Queensland Government would not agree to that suggestion, the Commonwealth Government now come forward with this audacious proposal to grant the Federal Chief Justice a pension of ?1,750. As a proof that the Chief Justice has not been the keenest intellect on the High Court Bench for some years, I instance the report which he submitted, as a Royal Commissioner, as to the monthly quota of men required as reinforcements. How did he proceed ? Did he, as a Royal Commissioner ought to have done, call for evidence from witnesses who were capable of saying whether the Prime. Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was speaking the truth when he made statements regarding the need for reinforcements, which everybody now must admit were grossly exaggerated?

        <para class="block">Was that done because of any promise made bythe Prime Minister regarding a pension? I can assure honorable members that it is not pleasant for me to have to say these things, but when the Ministry bring forward this motion as a personalmatter, and at such a time, I must do my duty. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline>Griffith chose the primrose path; a handsome salary, and the honour and prestige which attached to the position of Chief Justice of the High Court. A man can devote himself to no more noble work than the service of his country, whether as a shire councillor, municipal councillor, member of a State Parliament, or member of the Federal Parliament. Whatever may be said in disparagement of public life, whatever men may do to lower their high office, I maintain that service given to the country as a legislator is equal in importance to the service given by a Judge. Yet there is no pension for a member of Parliament, or even for a Minister of the Crown. There is no pension for the man who makes the law, or for his widow and children. Do honorable members know that the widow of an ex-Postmaster-General is earning her living as a typist, and that the widow of a former member of this Parliament maintains herself and children by working as a laundress and cleaner? All honour to both of them. &#39;They are acting well their part, and therein the honour lies. When the Ministry come forward with a proposal to pay a pension of. &#163;1,750 per annum to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir &#39;Samuel</inline> Griffith, I am reminded that for twenty-five years at least - ten years as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland, and fifteen years as Chief Justice of the High Court - he has been in receipt of first, a salary of &#163;3,000, and then a salary of &#163;3/500 per annum. In addition he has received, I suppose, at least &#163;500 per annum as expenses. If it be whispered to me, as a reason why. we should pay this pension, that he has financial obligations, I say that, out of that sum of over &#163;S0,000 which he has received during a period of twenty-five years, he ought to have made provision for his old age. Recently the Government were asked whether, in view of the increased cost of living during the last few years, they would consider the question of increasing the old-age pension by 2s. 6d. per week, and what was their answer - &#34; In view of the state of the finances, an increase in the rate of the old-age pension is at the present time not considered justifiable.&#34; </para>
        <para>This proposed grant of a pension to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith was decided by this Parliament years ago. In this House a proposal was made that a pension should be paid to the Justices of the High Court, and by twenty-nine votes to twenty, the motion was defeated.

          <para>I do not see why a Judge with a salary of &#163;3,000 should get a pension any more than a post-office messenger with a salary at &#163;100 or &#163;200. A Judge has a better chance of providing for his old age than the average working man. </para>

Some one may whisper that he has financial obligations. If he was so foolish as to incur financial obligations in a desire to get suddenly rich, or for any other reason, that very fact should go against his appointment to the High Court or any other Bench.

          <para>.- The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> twitted me this afternoon with the fact that I am a silent member, and I have very largely to plead guilty to the charge. But I am a fairly attentive, and, I hope, a not unintelligent listener iri this House; and, further, I hope that my silence is the silence of modesty, and not always the silence of ignorance. I should preserve my usual demeanour, even in regard to this proposal, were it not that I feel I cannot remain silent, seeing that I intend to vote against the proposal of the&#39; Government. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Like the honorable member who has preceded me, it is with the greatest diffidence that I take up my&#39; present attitude. It is only because I feel compelled by my conscience to do so that I shall oppose the proposal now before the Committee. I think that,, from my point of view, the position can be very simply put. It is not necessary to canvass the qualifications of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith. By common consent he is an ornament to his profession; he possesses great natural endowments, with fine legal attainments and very wide experience. In his own State, before be was offered the position of Chief Justice of the Commonwealth, he had risen to the very top of the tree, and was, I suppose, head, and shoulders above his fellows, both in the sphere of politics and in the world of law. A distinct and definite offer was made to him of the highest legal position in the Commonwealth. . There was no monetary inducement for him to accept the offer - indeed, the acceptance of it meant a financial loss to him. But one remembers that the position he was offered was one of very great honour, such as no man would lightly set aside. I, for one, have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, conscious as he was of his mature powers, and keenly alive to the important duties that would attach to his new position, felt that in accepting it he would be able to render very valuable service to the Commonwealth. That conviction, I believe, was largely the determining factor in inducing him to accept the position. </para>
        <para>The terms of the offer that was then made to him - because it was a distinct and definite offer - were very specific. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith was offered the position of Chief Justice of the Commonwealth at a salary of &#163;3,500 a year and no pension. That was distinctly understood. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith accepted that offer with his eyes open, and knew exactly what .he was accepting and what it involved. For fifteen years he has filled his high office as, I think all will agree, with the most conspicuous success. He has fulfilled his part of the contract, he has faithfully done his duty; but I maintain that the Commonwealth has also fulfilled its part of the contract. He rendered service and he received the reward he had stipulated he should receive. For fifteen years, also, he has been engaged in work which, although intellectually exacting, was, I feel sure, performed by him with the keenest possible pleasure. He has all the time been working under conditions that tend to make a man&#39;s work a real pleasure. What were the conditions? First of all, the Chief Justice has been doing work that was well within his powers; and that is always a great satisfaction to a man.  His  work was, as I say, very exacting and very important; but he was conscious of his power, and he felt that the work was always well within that power. In the second place, the work was congenial to him. He had been trained to it all his life - had grown up with it. He is a thoroughly .trained and skilled lawyer, and, therefore, the work from day to day, and from year to year, was perfectly congenial. Then, I think every reasonable man will admit, he was receiving for his labour adequate remuneration. In the last place, he had security of tenure; and that is, a great thing. If a man feels that his office is secure, it gives him solid satisfaction. </para>
        <para>The fact that the Chief Justice occupies a high .and responsible position entitles him to no more credit for faithfully doing his duty, than is due to the humblest servant of the State who renders honest, conscientious service. If that be so, I should like to know on what ground this proposal of the Government can be justified. That is my difficulty. It is such a proposal as this that brings us hard up against a painful fact - a fact that, to my mind,- is a standing reproach to our social system.  I mean the fact that there are in our community men and women who are engaged in &#39; a hand-to-hand struggle with poverty, and who are living continually within measurable distance of actual want. I desire at this stage to cite one or two cases along the lines indicated by the last <inline font-weight="bold">speaker (Mr. Higgs).</inline> Every one of us, as members of Parliament, if we had not the experience before, are each day of our lives brought into contact with painful cases; and I shall cite three from the rank and file. We are asked to give this pension to a man occupying an exalted position; and the cases to which I shall refer are those of people in humble walks of life, who are fighting the battle of life manfully. I have not chosen extreme, but just ordinary every-day cases. A fine stamp of man, forty-seven years of age, waited upon me, and I learnt that he bad a delicate wife and seven children, the youngest of whom is sixteen months old. He had an accident in a saw-mill,  by which hia right hand was mutilated, and he lost the use of it.e He applied for various positions, but on each occasion was rejected because he is unable to use his right hand. Efforts were made to get him an invalid pension, but this was refused on the ground that he is not incapacitated ; and I have his letter here asking me for my assistance in getting him employment. The second case is that of a . fine type &#34; of woman, with a son at the Front who has been wounded twice. Her husband, a good, steady man, was an assayer who got poisoned by fumes, and is now unable to follow his calling. He is anxious to get work in a warehouse, or something of the kind, but has not been successful, and the wife says she does not know what they will do, for the home will have to be broken up. The third case is that of a young rejected soldier, who was taken on two years ago as a messenger in the Defence Department at 15s. per week. At  the  end of the year his wage was raised to &#163;1, and at the end of the second year to&#62; &#163;1  5s.; but he has just now been given notice that, being over twenty-one years of age, he cannot be kept on. A few months ago, his father was drowned, and bis mother is broken down in health. He has been helping to support his mother, and is now at his wit&#39;s end to know what to do. These are the kind of cases that come before us for our consideration every day. Now, I say that, for people such as these, life is a stern battle, and though they are fighting bravely, many go down in spite of themselves. The community has not yet recognised its obligation to extend a helping hand to such as they. </para>
        <para>There is another class in our community - our soldier men, who have been fighting another kind of battle in the great world war. To them we have incurred &#38; deep debt of obligation. I have the honour to be  president  of a pathetic little association composed of men who lost their sight in the trenches. They are on the very threshold of life, and will have to face many years of darkness,&#39; as they are fine, healthy young fellows. Many of them have just married, and yet they will never have the pleasure of looking into the face, of wife or child. They are handicapped to the end of their lives as wage-earners. Some of us have been trying to have their position improved, and we have made a proposal that they shall receive a pension of &#163;4 a week; but we are practically told that the country cannot afford this. </para>
        <para>I am not going to labour the question, because I only desire to give reasons why I cannot conscientiously support the proposal of the Government. The community should be just before it is ;generous. We ought to face and recognise our real obligations to the rank and file of our people who have gone down in &#34;the battle of life - who have been worsted in the fight - through no fault of their own. There is something radically wrong with a system that produces cases such as I have described - where men, honest, deserving, and anxious to work, cannot get work to do. We ought to recognise our obligation to all such. If the proposal before us were in any way part of a scheme for a general recognition of those obligations of ours - part of a scheme for making provision for those who have been temporarily or permanently worsted in the struggle of life - it would have my solid support. But, because it seems to be an instance of a tendency too common to pay regard to the claims of those in high places - to give to him that hath, while taking away from him that hath not even that which he hath - I am compelled to give my vote against the measure. </para>

          <para>.-^1  regret that I did not have the opportunity of hearing the speech of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom);</inline> but I have learned from honorable members that he did not say very much about the principle of the measure. No matter what honorable members say, or how they may try to fool themselves, this case will be quoted as a precedent. It is the thin end of the wedge. I compliment the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> on the splendid speech he has made, and the stand he has taken on this question. There are about half-a-dozen members in the chamber to-night .who can remember the debate which took place in 1903 on the Judiciary Bill. It could not be said on that occasion that those who were opposed to the payment of pensions to Justices of the High Court were doing so because the name of any individual was mentioned. The honorable members for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler),</inline> Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford),</inline> Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Page),</inline> Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins),</inline> the present Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> and I voted against giving pensions to the Justices of the High Court. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> voted for them, and as he and the Minister for the Navy are away overseas, they can pair on this matter as, apparently, they are doing on every question. The Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> and the honorable members for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman),</inline> Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce Smith),</inline> and Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spence)</inline> voted in favour of pensions. </para>

This House deliberately, and the Senate subsequently, objected to the proposal to give pensions, and thereupon the salary of the Chief Justice was fixed at &#163;3,500, and the salaries of the other Justices at &#163;3,000 each. Two gentlemen who were afterwards appointed Justices of the High Court were members of the House at the time the Bill was passed. One of them <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr..

I approach this matter from the point of view of the principle of the measure, and the precedent it will establish.

        <para>Every metropolitan member could duplicate over and over again the cases mentioned by the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell).</inline> .Probably every honorable member could mention similar cases. Last week, within 2 miles of this House, a poor woman, who was in such awful circumstances when her boy died, probably through her not being able to obtain the necessaries of life, that she could not pay for burying the child, and was compelled to wheel his dead body in a perambulator to a public gardens, where she laid it down so that it could be seen by a passer-by. The honorable member for Fawkner will realize that if the cases he mentioned could occur in Albert Park, Prahran, or Hawksburn, there are still more pitiable cases in the poorer suburbs of Melbourne. Here is one case for which I can vouch. A man who has been a total abstainer all. his life, and has followed the hardest class of work, navvying  and stoking, has been stricken down at the age of forty-eight years, and&#39; has been in the hospital for six months. He has a wife and six children. Honorable members who have been through the struggle know what happens in such circumstances. They know that the wife is compelled to go out and seek work. The honorable member has mentioned the case of a lad who has. been dismissed at twenty-one years of age because otherwise he would have to be given a higher rate of wage. Last week a boy went into camp with the Yarra Borderers, and when he returned to his work he found that he had been dismissed, and that another boy had obtained his position. When I made inquiries by telephone, the firm told me that when the lad was put on he was informed that he would be dismissed when he reached the age of eighteen, because if he remained with them after reaching that age they would be obliged to ,pay him a higher rate of wage. I asked the mother whether I would proceed any further in the matter with- a view to the Defence Department having the firm prosecuted. I would like to see some of these firms prosecuted if they dismiss youths who go into camp for military training. </para>

            <para>- The boy was working with the firm until he went into camp. He reached the age of eighteen &#39;years while in camp. The firm&#39;s excuse was that they had told him when he was engaged that he would be dismissed on reaching that age. I am not able to verify their statement from the boy, and the mother says that it is not worth while going on with the case, but I would like to go on with it. I have another case on the same lines. Strange to say, the representatives of both firms concerned hold high official positions in the employers&#39; organizations of Australia. I shall not mention any names until matters are taken further. I have given the other firm the opportunity to reinstate their former employee. It is more my desire to get these youths employment than to have any one prosecuted. It is difficult for any young man to get employment to-day, because many of the firms say that there is no chance for them owing to the demobilization of the recruits in camp and the return of men from overseas. I agree with the then honorable member for Corinella  (Colonel McCay),  who said in this House that he did&#93; not see why a Judge,  with a salary of &#163;3,500 a year, should get a pension, any more than a Post Office messenger with a salary of &#163;100 or &#163;200. Let us compare the pensions proposed to be given under this Bill with the pensions that returned soldiers, men who are crippled, are getting. </para>

            <para>- I will apologize, but the honorable member cannot prevent me thinking as I do of his conduct, and of that of honorable members opposite. When the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was seeking for the soldiers&#39; votes, he made the statement, which appeared in the publication <inline font-style="italic">All for Australia,</inline> that it was the intention of the Government Jo raise the soldiers&#39; pensions to &#163;2 per week. When the late Treasurer (then <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest) was asked whether there was any truth in that statement, he said it was the first he had heard of it; but there is no doubt that there was a deliberate promise made by the Prime Minister, when looking for the votes of the soldiers overseas, that their pensions would be raised. The honorable member for Illawarra speaks of a pension of 30s. per week, but not 10 per cent, of even those who are crippled and maimed get a pension of 30s. a week. </para>

        <para>I wish to make it perfectly clear that I have nothingat all to say against the Chief Justice of the High Court or any other Justice on the High Court Bench, but I do say that at the present time, in view of the state of our finances and in view of the answer given by the Acting Prime Minister within the past week to another request, this pension should not be granted. An honorable member asked the Acting Prime Minister whether he was prepared to increase the old-age pension beyond 12s. 6d. per week, and the answer given was that in September, 1917, the old-age pension was raised to 12s. 6d. per week, and the Government could not, in view of the present state of the finances, raise it again. I say deliberately that many of the persons in receipt of old-age pensions are tetter entitled to an increase of those pensions than is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith to the pension proposed to be granted to him under this Bill. I will go so far as to say that throughout the country there is not one old-aged pensioner who is not better entitled to an extra 2s. 6d. per week than is the present Chief Justice of Australia to the pension of over &#163;30 per week proposed to be voted to him under this Bill. I hope that honorable members will support the amendment, and will agree that this is not the time to adopt an absolutely new principle in opposition to a previous decision of this Parliament deliberately turning down a proposal to grant pensions to the Justices of the High Court. </para>

          <para>.- In my view, questions of finance or of economy do not enter the consideration of this matter at all. The comparisons made between the&#39; amount to be paid under this Bill and the conditions of oldage pensioners are very wide of the mark. The principle underlying the Bill is the pensioning of our Judges, and I subscribe to that principle, whether it applies generally or to an individual case. I believe that the Judges in all the British Dominions have a reputation second to none in the world. Even the people of other nations admire British Courts as being beyond the possibility of corruption. If there is one thing of which the British people have a right to be proud, it is the character of the British Judiciary throughout the Empire. </para>

            <para>- I think it necessary to use my head in dealing with this question. We have men of the highest calibre on our various Benches. So far as the High Court is concerned, it is quite true that at the outset of Federation, before there were any Justices of the High Court in existence a vote was taken as to whether they should be entitled to pensions. A good deal has been made of the fact that the decision of Parliament was that there should be no pensions attached to their positions; but what was the vote on the matter? It was a vote of tweny-two to twenty. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member need not try to put that game up on me. In my opinion, the biggest farce in this Parliament is&#39; the arrangement made for recording pairs. There are twenty-five or thirty members present this evening, and if a division were taken, we should find the names of all the representatives of New South Wales in the pair-book, though they would not know how they were going to be made to vote. A vote of twenty-nine to twenty represents forty-nine members out of a house of seventy-five. I think that on one occasion there were seventy-six members of this House. </para>

        <para>The Judges of the State Courts are entitled to pensions. There are men who have a long run at the Bar, and who extract huge fees from a suffering public, and amass great fortunes. They are indifferent about the receipt of a pension, as they have sufficient money to enable them to do without it; but there are other men, possessed of great legal ability but of no business capacity for the successful investment of money, and the position of a Judge to which there is attached a right of pension may appeal to them. If such a man, however eminent, were offered the choice of a seat on the High Court Bench of Australia, or the Supreme Court Bench of a State, the one carrying a pension and the other not, which position do honorable members think he would take? The fact that no pension was fixed in 1903 is met by the further fact that the Government say to-day that it is wise and necessary to grant &#39;a pension. Whether it will establish a precedent or not, is a matter of indifference to me, because I believe in the principle. </para>

            <para>- In nearly every case where public servants came over from the States to the Commonwealth, they carried their pension rights with them. Whether a man is appointed as a Judge of a Supreme Court, or of the High Court, he is appointed for life, and can retain the position practically as long as he pleases, so long as he does not come within the disqualifications, which are exceedingly few, and up to the present not one of our Judges has fallen within them. So long as he remains a Judge, he continues to draw his salary, and there is jio provision in the Act to take it from him. On&#39; some of the State Benches Judges have sat long past the years of their prime, and the public have had to suffer considerable inconvenience in consequence. In one State, I believe, an Act was passed to amend that condition. In another State, where pensions exist,, the total amount payable is limited, and the sum being drawn out by those who had retired already left so. little for others that Judges remained on the Bench longer than in all human fairness they could be expected to perform their duties efficiently. If we want to maintain the highest traditions of the Judiciary of the British Empire - and our Judges have absolutely nothing to look forward to, or hope for from any individual, or Government, or Parliament, when their time is up - we shall help materially and secure greater efficiency also by placing on the statutebook an Act authorizing the payment of the pensions to which they should legitimately be entitled. </para>

          <para>.- The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> has offered a very valuable contribution to the debate. He said he had been twitted with not speaking very often. I have heard the honorable member on several occasions, and can testify that when he does speak, it is on a subject that he understands, and on which he gives the House light and leading. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> outlined, in introducing the Bill, the life of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith. Most of us,  though much younger, have made ourselves acquainted, by reading and in other ways, with the career of that high and esteemed gentle-&#39; man. Everybody admits that he is a brilliant man, and has given good service to this country as a Judge; but I do not know what that has to do with the question now before us. We are asked to introduce here a principle against which this House, in 1903, deliberately set its face, by twenty-nine votes to twenty, on a non-party division; because I find, on looking up the division list, that members from both sides voted for and against. The question should be still a non-party one. The issue should be whether we approve of the principle of paying pensions to men who occupy high and exalted positions. Whilst the Minister outlined the life of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, he gave no reason to justify the Committee in carrying a proposal to give him a pension. If we give him one, and deny it to any other Judge occupying a position on the High Court Bench, we shall be doing the others an injustice. As times goes on, the other Judges will feel that they are no longer capable of carrying out their duties,, and will ask to be relieved. If we grant. a pension in one case we cannot deny it in another, where a man has given his services to his country as a member of the Judiciary Whatever is decided in this Chamber this evening on this question should settle the principle for all time. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> pointed out, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith was a Judge in Queensland when his present position was offered to him, and the debate in this House took place prior to his appointment. Every one, including <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, knew that there was to be no pension. Nevertheless he decided . to give the Commonwealth the benefit of his talents, and he was paid &#163;3,500 a year for his services. That is a substantialannual income for any man. I should say that a man accepting a position. ,of( that kind would reason out that he would be able in a given number of years tei, provide for old age,, and save sufficient for that purpose. For fifteen years he has presided over this Court, and during that time he has drawn no less than. &#163;52,000. Surely no one contends that out of that sum he has not been able to provide for himself for the rest of his life, if he has to retire? He is a keen man, and I have no doubt that he does not require this pension, but for some reason this proposal is brought before us. I cannot imagine that he would ask for it. He has completed his contract. He is free to continue on the Bench if his health permits, and if he finds that it does not, he is free to retire. When we are talking of economy, if we bring in measures of this kind, granting pensions to men in highly-paid positions because they are about to retire, the great mass pf the people will find fault, and they will have a right to do so, seeing that there are thousands of people who are unable to make ends meet. That is not a good thing for the future of this country </para>
        <para>I agree with the honorable member for Fawkner that it is about time the Parliaments of this country set themselves to devise a scheme whereby everybody in the community, if unable to get Work, would be at least sure that the wolf would be kept from the door. No man in this country who is prepared to work should have want knocking at his door.  His  wife should not be put in the position, because her husband is unable to find work, of being unable to provide necessaries for herself and children. That <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> the thing that is sapping the moral life of this community. Any degeneracy that takes place in the race is, to a large extent, due to poverty. Whilst we make no provision for those who are so situated, we can scarcely regard ourselves as &#91;entitled to make extra provision for those in, higher places. Conditions generally for the mass of the people are continually getting worse, and no step is taken in the direction of lifting them out of tlie rut which they are being fast pressed i-oto. They have no say in lie matter, because it is the system of society they  live  under that is putting them in that position. If we are going- in for pensions for certain individuals, we should do something for the. masses, because we should not allow anybody to want. </para>
        <para>The only argument put up by the Minister for the granting, of a pension to this gentleman was that  he  was. virtually a transferred officer. </para>
        <para class="block">The position is vastly different from that occupied by the ordinary public servant, because it was clearly understood by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith that the posi-tion  carried no pension rights. He entered into the contract on that understanding. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith was, at that time, a Judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland. He had pension rights, and that fact is advanced as another reason why he should be entitled to a pension from the Commonwealth. But I maintain that there is no analogy between his position and that of the ordinary public servant, who has worked for years at a much lower salary, and has earned certain emoluments upon his retirement. Parliament decided that the position should not carry with it a pension. </para>
        <para>The honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> argued that if we do not grant pension rights, the occupants of the Judicial benches may be compelled to remain there until they are practically imbecile. But there is another side of that picture. It is possible that many men, if they knew they could get practically half their salaries by retiring, would relinquish their judicial duties long before they were entitled to. What was. the effect of the law introducing pensions for Judges in New South Wales? It is well known to many honorable members that when that Bill was passed one Judge, who had sat on the Bench for only a few months, elected to retire, and for a great number of years received a pension of &#163;1,350 a year. It cannot be said that a Judge, getting &#163;67 per week, as in the case of the Chief Justice, could not have been able in about fifteen years to save sufficient to provide for himself if he elected to retire. And yet we are asked to agree to a proposition to pay him over &#163;32 a week upon retirement, although his contract contained no provision for a pension. </para>

            <para>- With regard to this question of thrift as applied to the workers, I have no doubt that other honorable members have had an experience similar to my own, and have had many -calls to meet cases, of distress in their particular districts. Although we are now asked to provide a pension for the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth, there is a tendency to forget some of those gallant men who have rendered yeoman service to the Empire on the other side of the world. Unhappily, some of these men have had difficulty in getting pensions. I do not charge the Pension authorities with neglect, because, as a rule, they are sympathetic officers; but pension rights in the cases I refer to depend to a large extent on medical testimony, and I have found that this is not always satisfactory. Moreover, the Act provides that before pension rights can be recognised it must be established that incapacity has been the result of war-like operations, and ever since men have been returning from the war I have been pleading for consideration for special cases. I know of one man who took part in the Messines operations. As a result of cold weather he contracted rheumatism, rendering his return to Australia necessary. He was unable to follow his usual avocation, but has been denied pension rights on the ground that his incapacity was not in connexion with war-like operations. It seems strange that while difficulty should be encountered in cases like this, Parliament should now be asked to grant a pension to a Judge who has been drawing a very high salary, and who was quite prepared to accept the position without pension rights in any shape or form. </para>

        <para>Before we talk about bringing in pensions for Judges, let us endeavour, as far as we possibly can, to assist those whoare in dire distress; such persons as those gallant men to whom I have referred, whose earning capacity is not equal to what it was before they enlisted. After we have done this, we can then think of providing for those in higher places. There is no justification whatever for this proposal. If the Chief Justice had remained in politics - the Minister states that he devoted many years to politics in Queensland - he would not have had any pension upon his retirement. Probably he would have gone out of politicsin the ordinary course of events, and no doubt would have returned to his profession. He was a very eminent man in the legal world, so it is probable that he would have built up a lucrative practice again. But he had the confidence of the people, and accepted an offer made by the then Queensland Government to become Chief Justice of that State. Subsequently he was appointed by the Federal Government as Chief Justice of the Commonwealth on a fixed salary, with no hope of a pension. </para>
        <para>This question has not been raised since 1903, when Parliament decided against a pension. Now, in the last hours of this session and in a thin House, with half the members away, important legislation like this is sprung upon honorable members. I do not approve of it. There is talk of getting half-a-dozen important Bills, as well as the Estimates and Supply, through in the next four days. I venture to say the Government would have been wise to allow this matter to stand over until we re-assemble in the new year, when there will be a full House and ample opportunity for its consideration. It appears to me that this proposal, with some other measures, is to be smuggled through. That is what the action of the Government amounts towith half the members absent. </para>

        <para>We would not be justified in passing this proposal in the last hours of the session and in a thin House, because the Senate has two or three measures to deal with to-morrow, and will then get this proposal later.

In view also of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith entered into his contract with the Commonwealth Government for the Chief Justiceship of Australia without any. pension privileges, this House ought to decline to pass the Bill which is to be introduced. If, however, the House does approve of it, the Bill should not be passed in its contemplated form. The principle should be made to apply to all Judges, because there will be no justification for denying the same privileges to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich, formerly a Judge in New South Wales. In addition, every other Judge will be equally entitled to a pension. They all do similar work, and they all belong to- the Judiciary. </para>

          <para>.  - When this matter was introduced in 1903 Parliament was able to discuss it impartially and impersonally. We should have been able to do the same to-night, but the Government left us no choice. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> in introducing the motion, emphasized the personal aspect of the whole case, as his speech was nothing but a glorification and eulogy of the present occupant of the Chief Justiceship. If this is a principle, it should have been discussed without reference whatever to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir iSamuel</inline> Griffith, the present Chief Justice. The Minister  is  entirely responsible for the fact that it has been reduced to a personal question. I have not a word to say against <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith personally. He ought not to have been discussed; the Minister should not have mentioned his qualifications at all. If we are to accept the principle now, in contradiction to the action of Parliament in 1903, we must accept it on the ground that it will apply not only to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith but to every other succeeding occupant of the position. </para>

            <para>- I am sure that the Chief Justice was not averse to the receipt of the salary, or to being told that he was an able man. For ten years he occupied the position of Chief Justice of Queensland, during which period he rendered excellent service to the people of Australia in assisting to frame its Constitution. Then, the Chief Justiceship of Australia was created, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> was offered the position.. He had to consider whether to stick to the Queensland Chief Justiceship, with a pension following, or to accept the Chief Justiceship of the Commonwealth, with no pension attached. Any honorable member who recalls the circumstances will agree that it was a fact that he was lauded from one end of Australia to the other, because of his public  spiritedness in sacrificing a certain pension in Queensland and accepting the Chief Justiceship of the Commonwealth, which carried no pension. </para>

The Government have not told us why they propose to grant a pension.

        <para>When the original Bill was before this Chamber in 1903, the reason given for the granting of a pension was specified. Clause 53 stated - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>A Justice of the High Court, if disabled by permanent infirmity from the . performance of the duties of his office, shall be entitled to retire upon a pension, to be continued during his life at a rate- </para>
        </quote>
        <para>Then followed several divisions of those rates. The reason there set out for the granting of pensions was disablement by permanent infirmity, as a result of which a Judge would be unable to satisfactorily perform the duties of his office. It is interesting to read the reports of that debate. The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce Smith)</inline> stated, in supporting the proposal to grant pensions, that it was sometimes an&#39; advantage to have a pension, because a Judge might develop some permanent infirmity which would render him incompetent to perform his functions as a Judge; wherefore, some inducements should be offered him to- resign. The honorable member added that if no pensions were provided for, it would be open for any Judge to remain on the Bench long after he had become incompetent^ through infirmity, to do his work faithfully and well. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> Smith continued - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Parliament would be much more ready to take steps to remove a Judge when they knew that a pension was provided for in case of his lacking ability, through illness, to properly perform his duties. I submit, therefore, that it is fair that Judges- who have arrived at an age within five years of the recognised allotted span of life should be offered an inducement to retire from the Bench, and make way for younger men. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Then the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> stated- </para>
        <quote>
          <para>In England, of recent years, complaints have frequently been made in the public press regarding in cases the senility of the Bench. It has been repeatedly urged that it is very advisable to afford its Justices an opportunity to retire. It is said that they sometimes get livery, impatient, and somewhat petulant in their declining years, and that owing to the fact that <inline font-style="italic">pro rata,</inline> pensions had not been granted, Justices who ought to have retired have not done so.  </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That is the general tenor of the arguments advanced by the lawyers who were in that Parliament and are in the present Parliament, concerning why pensions should be granted. Their point was that it was necessary to grant pensions to get rid of Judges who had become incompetent. Is that the reason which the Government now have for proposing this pension, namely, that, through infirmity, the Chief Justice has become incompetent to discharge his functions, and that it is necessary; there1fore, as well as wise, to get rid of him? There are some who will be prepared to say &#34; Amen &#34; to such a proposal. </para>
        <para>The statutory rule that officers should retire from the Public Service at the age of sixty-five would not be ill-applied to Judges of the High Court. Human intelligence has its limits, just as has human strength ; and when a man gets to the age of seventy-three - as is the case with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Walker Griffith - he may have quite exceeded his intellectual usefulness to the nation. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> has had ten years&#39; occupancy of the Chief Justiceship of Queensland, at a salary of &#163;3,500 a year. He has had fifteen years as Chief Justice of the Commonwealth, at &#163;3,500 per annum - a total, during the twenty-five years, of &#163;87,500, drawn from this country. In addition, he bas been granted &#163;4 4s. per day travelling allowance for every day that he has been on tour. And, considering that his position has been permanent, free from worries, free from all dangers of interruption, from all dangers of strikes, and of disturbing elections, and with no broken time, and no stoppages of pay, it is nothing more or less than a public scandal that the Government should now suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith is in such a financially impecunious position that it is necessary for the country to come to his aid and grant him &#163;33 a week to do nothing. He has enjoyed a salary of &#163;67 a week for twenty-five years, in addition to his allowances. </para>
        <para>I am not impressed with the amendment of the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> to the effect that this is not the time to grant such a pension. I say o that there is no time when such a position as the Government are now advancing could be justified. Members of Parliament in 1903 may have looked upon the matter from a different aspect than honorable members to-day. In those days they were able to regard it from a freer point of view; but the arguments then used were so strong that, both in this House and in the Senate, there were honorable members who refused to ally themselves with the principle then enunciated. It has been recognised throughout the Commonwealth administration that no pension may be granted to public officers. That has been a governing principle. No member of the Public Service is entitled to retire upon a pension; and in the Public Service it is insisted that officers shall provide for their own retirement ; we compel them to insure their lives, or to purchase annuities^ and the like. Suppose that we applied that same principle to the Chief Justice, which we could have done quite as honestly and justly as in the case of ordinary members of the Public Service. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith would have been called upon to make an annual expenditure of a fairly heavy character, in proportion to his salary, in order to provide himself with an annuity, and we would have avoided this proposal to provide the Chief Justice with a pension. However, such a provision has been left as a matter for his own judgment ; and the salary which he has received has afforded ample scope with which to provide himself with a retiring allowance - a pension which would have been a godsend to many thousands of people in Australia. </para>
        <para>How can we, at this time, justify such an expenditure as is proposed, when so much urgency exists for the payment of a living wage to the people? Honorable members were told* that this was to be a financial session, and we have been waiting all through the session for .the financial proposals of the Government. I congratulate this &#34;financial&#34; Government, this &#34; economy &#34; Government, this &#34; Winthewar&#34; Government, on having disclosed something of their financial proposals at last. It is a case of greasing the fatted pig, of giving to those who. have, and of taking from those who have not. </para>
        <para>May I ask the Government to consider this position. I shall quote <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> as my authority. He tells us, in the War Census Income Returns, that there were only 381,558 persons in Australia who were earning &#163;156 per annum, - or &#163;3 a week- and upwards. That left 1,760,106 persons who were earning less than &#163;156 per annum ; and, out of that number, there were 315,000 - nearly as many as the total of those who were earning over &#163;156 - who were receiving less than &#163;50 a year. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> points out that, of the total wealth in the community, those who were earning over &#163;156 per annum owned &#163;124,567,000 of the total net incomes of the community; leaving to those earning under &#163;156 per annum &#163;115,596,000. And, as for those earning under &#163;50 a year - less than &#163;1 a week - the total of their wealth was only &#163;10,000,000 out of the grand total of &#163;240,000,000 annual income. </para>
        <para>There is no getting away from the unfortunate and regrettable fact that large numbers in the community are in circumstances of want and distress. Honorable members will have seen a paragraph in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> this evening. On the principal page it is related that a woman asked the police to lock her up. She was an old woman, shabbily dressed, and she told the police she had slept in the gardens of the city, and that the only food she had was what she could beg. The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> has given other illustrations. We are all inundated with letters from soldiers and soldiers&#39; wives who are suffering what they deem to be hardships. Only the other day I received from a woman in Toowong the following communication: - </para>
        <para>I have been told to put this before you. My husband has been away three years and two months. Because he absented, they are to punish me and the two children by stopping all my pay; so now I can starve. I have no money, as I have a sickly child, and it takes all my money to pay my bills. I have a. bad leg myself, and cannot go to work. </para>
        <para class="block">I receive dozens of letters of a similar character, and so does every other honorable member. When we try to get special pensions granted to meet such cases, we are told that our requests cannot be entertained, owing to the imperative need which exists for economy. Take the case of the blind soldiers as an example. The rate of pension payable to blind and incapacitated soldiers is outrageously low and unsatisfactory. Yet the Government will not do anything to remedy it. Similarly, we cannot get any assistance granted to soldiers&#39; wives and children who are suffering in a thousand different ways. </para>
        <para>Here I want to say a word or two on behalf of our soldiers who went to New Guinea. Many of them have returned the victims of malarial fever. We are all acquainted with the intermittent character of that fever, and some of us have asked that part pensions shall be paid to these men - pensions, say, for five or six days a month, upon which they are unable to work. But the Government will not listen to the suggestion. They say that this is not the time to give it consideration. Why, then, do they choose this time to grant a compassionate allowance to the Chief Justice of the High Court? </para>
        <para>One reason which was urged in 1903 why the Justices of the High Court should be pensioned was that they should be relieved from fear of want. In order to place them above temptation, it was recognised that they should be thoroughly well paid. As honorable members are aware, in connexion with the original proposal, the question arose as to whether the Justices of the High Court should be paid a larger salary, with no pension, or a less salary, with a pension. After giving the matter the fullest consideration, Parliament decided in favour of paying them a good salary, in order that we might get the services of the best men. In the circumstances, I am compelled to ask who are the greater - the men who make the laws of this country or the men who administer them ? The Prime Minister of Australia, who, more than any other individual, has in his hands the making or marring of this country, does not receive a salary in excess of about &#163;1,800 a year, and has no pension rights. Moreover, no Prime Minister has yet dared to suggest that he should be paid a pension He has to submit himself to the verdict of the people every three years. He has to undergo privations and to work in a way that no Chief Justice has ever worked, and, in addition, he gets plenty of abuse for his pains. I repeat that the lawmakers, who are responsible for the conduct of affairs in Australia, do not get pensions. Nobody has ever suggested that they should get them. </para>

        <para>Mr.FINLAYSON. - I think that it would. But here is the case of a man who is set high above even the law-makers of this country.  His  duty is to interpret the laws that we enact. He draws a salary nearly six times larger than that paid to members of Parliament, and more than double that which is paid to Cabinet Ministers, who have to work hard, and are responsible for the administration of the Departments. Yet not one of these persons receives a pension. </para>
        <para>If <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith has not asked for this pension, why do the Government propose to grant it ? If he has given no intimation of his intention to retire, why is this motion brought forward ? Do the Government propose to grant him this pension to induce him to retire? Have they somebody else whom they wish to appoint to the honorable position which he fills? One naturally desires to know more about this proposal. I refuse to believe that all that Ministers have in their minds is a consideration of the financial interests of the Chief Justice of Australia. Of course, it may he that he is financially embarrassed- that he has been unfortunate in his speculations. If so, he is no worse off than are many other men. Why is it that these well-paid individuals are always the first to ask for charity from the public? Here is a man who has drawn &#163;87,000 from the people of Australia, and the Government now ask us to give him a compassionate allowance. </para>

That is the average pay of eight or ten working-class families. &#34;We have to choose between a compassionate allowance to the Chief Justice and the giving of a little bit extra to the working classes of the community.

        <para>Ministers may say that, as the Chief Justice is seventy-three years of age, he cannot have many years to live. That is not the question. By voting for a pension we* shall establish a precedent for paying pensions to certain men in certain positions for certain reasons. Let us know where this will lead us. We should not look at the case from its individual aspect, but as it will affect others. There are many officers who. have rendered in their sphere as great services to the Commonwealth as the Chief Justice has rendered in his. Is it fair to those men to distribute largesse in one direction and to refuse it in another? There is no argument that would justify the payment of the proposed pension. </para>

            <para>- That is so. But the pension system was adopted in those States prior to Federation, and when the Commonwealth Parliament fixed the salaries of the Justices of the High Court it refused to provide for pensions. Many of those who were members of this Parliament at the time had been members of State Parliaments, and probably it was their knowledge of the ill-effects and unreasonable results of the pension system that caused them to refuse to apply it to the Justices of our High Court. There is a tendency to-day to curtail these privileges, and had the State Parliaments the opportunity, an attempt would be made to cut down the pension list and leave to each man the responsibility of providing for his declining years. </para>

          <para>.- I find myself in some little difficulty in regard to this proposal. I am an advocate of the pension system, and have done what I could to popularize it. I favoured the institution of old-age pensions long before that was a subject for practical politics, and I urged the increasing of the rates paid even when the Labour Government was giving the excuse that is now given by this Government - that it had not the money. </para>

            <para>- Yes, after pressure. It took a long while to get them to do it. We have not been asking this Government for an increase so long as we were asking the Labour Government for one. I am in favour of the extension of the pension system, because I think that it is a sound system. When a man has rendered service to his country, whether in the highest or in the humblest position, he should not be kept working until he falls into his grave. My difficulty arises from the fact that one Judge of the High Court has been singled out for a pension ; I understand that it is not proposed to give pensions to all the Justices of the High Court. </para>

        <para>The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> overlooked the important fact that to do what is right to a man in a high position does not necessarily involve the denial of what is right to men in lower positions. The honorable member also overlooked the principle that should govern our consideration of these cases. It is not proper to say that to pension a Judge is to do a wrong to those members of the community who are not getting pensions. Our Judges safeguard the liberties of the humblest in the community as well as of the highest, and the privileges that we enjoy are largely at the discretion of those to whom we intrust the interpretation of our laws. It is one of the first considerations of a Democracy, that the interpreters of the laws should be in a position of the utmost freedom to decide according to their judgment, without fear, favour, or affection. They should not have the fear of poverty, nor the fear that a Government may visit upon them its displeasure for some judgment they have given. On similar reasoning it is wrong that a Government should nave it in its power to improve the position of a Judge. When a gentleman accepts a&#39; seat on a judicial Bench he should be debarred from promotion to the position of Chief Justice, because such promotion would depend on the Government of the day, on whose causes the Judge who sought it might have been adjudicating. We saw something of what a proposal of this kind leads to when, in the course of this dehate, the insinuation was made that the Chief Justice of the High Court of the Commonwealth is being offered this pension for political services rendered. I do not think that many people in the community will accept that suggestion. </para>
        <para>My dilemma is this, that if I vote for the pension I shall vote for the violation of what I believe a sound principle in regard to the. judicial Bench, namely, that uo Judge should be the subject of any Government favour. Yet, if I vote against it, I shall vote against the principle of pensioning Judges - a thing I regard as essential to the good working of one of the most important institutions of a Democracy. Something has been said about the effect of pensions. A Judge is not able to carry on the business of a financial investor. If he gives that attention to the oases that press for his decision that is required of him, he has very little time for the supervision of investments. I think pensions necessary in order to secure for the service of the people the most efficient men available. In appointing a Judge we ask gentlemen who are earning considerable sums at the Bar to lay aside their private practice. We desire to attract to the High Court Bench and to the service of the Commonwealth the best talent available. Every industry, every interest, and every person in this country are dependent in some measure  upon the decisions of that tribunal; and we must be able to offer to our Judges, not conditions that might attract men in the ideal world to which we hope all Democracies are advancing, but conditions equal to those which exist in the. proffession of the law to-day. In this matter, we are in competition with the States. At the time he was appointed to the High Court, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith had a position of greater emolument in the Supreme Court of Queensland. The&#39; present Chief Justice of that State, although receiving a salary less than that of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, has a position which is superior from a financial point of view, because he has the certainty that when he retires he will be provided for for the remainder of his life. </para>
        <para>The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> alluded to the American Bench, but he omitted to tell us that it does not matter to the Chief Justice of America whether he is on the Bench or off it; he .gets the same salary when he retires as when he is in occupation of his position. That is an ideal principle for a Democracy to follow. When a man feels that his powers are waning, and that he can no longer give the best service to the State, he should be able to retire without suffering financial loss.  The position of the American Chief Justice is on all-fours with that of the  Speaker  of the House of Commons, who on retirement loses only &#163;1,000 of his official pay of &#163;5,000 per annum. We should place our Judges in such a position that they are able to do that which they think ought to be done without fear of incurring any financial loss. We should place the High Court Judges in such independent circumstances that they may decide every matter without fear, favour or affection, and without apprehension that their decisions may prejudice the Government against them; and we ought to secure the best men, who will be attracted, not&#39; only by the honour and dignity which the position carries, but bv the knowledge that their old age will be provided for. </para>

          <para>. - It is with some diffidence that one approaches this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith has a great record, and has enjoyed a great salary. He has had every  advantage that a man of culture and intelligence could have, and he has certainly distinguished himself in many ways. I find that he has benefited the literature of the future by the following publications: <inline font-style="italic">- Notes on the Australian Federation : Its Nature and Probable Effects</inline> (paper presented to the Government of Queensland) ; <inline font-style="italic">Notes on the Draft Federal Constitution formed by the Adelaide Convention 1897 ;</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Some Conditions of Australian Federation,</inline> Presidential Address, University Extension Council, 11th June, 1896. Moreover, he found time in his leisure to translate into English verse in the measure of the original, the immortal works of Dante Alighieri. I believe he is the only person who has ever translated the work in that measure. May his memory reap the reward of that merit. </para>

A sum of &#163;5,000 is provided each year to cover the expenses of six Judges, and I have teen informed that they each get &#163;4 4s. per day as travelling allowance. How many workers who are keeping families would like to get that &#163;4 4s. per week?

        <para>In any ease, is this the time to spend money on a pension like this ? Have we not been told by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> that we must economize and increase the taxation? We know that if the widow of a soldier has more than five children, the sixth, seventh, and eighth must live on nothing. A pension allowance is made for each child up to five, but if the unfortunate widow has more than five children she gets no allowance for the others. The Defence Department only pay 3s. 6d. per week for each child. When a man is sent to gaol the State allows his wife more than that for the maintenance of her children. It is proposed that we shall offer this man &#163;35 per week by way of pension. In the United States of America a big pension system was introduced after the Civil War, and in the early nineties I presented to the State Parliament of Victoria figures showing that we paid, by way of pensions to public servants in this State, more than double the amount paid in New South Wales, and more than was paid by way of Public Service pensions in the remaining Australian Colonies and </para>

If he is reduced, to penury - if, as the result of speculation, he has been ruined - then I am willing to give a month&#39;s salary to assist, him. He has written his name wide in the annals of literature- by his translation of Dante&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Inferno.</inline> If <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith has not been instrumental in having this proposal put forward, then the Government, who call themselves his friends, are besmirching his escutcheon; and that I should resent. I shall vote against the proposal, which,, if carried, I warn honorable members, will be keenly remembered outside. In these times; when girls, with a few shillings per week, have to pay somuch more for their clothing, and the price of wool is higher than that of completed stockings before the war, a proposal of this kind ought not tobe put forward. If the proposal were to make the old-age pensions &#163;4 4s. a week - the daily expenses allowance to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith - I should welcome it. Unless the Chief Justice has been impoverished by misfortune, this proposal is an infamy and a scandal. </para>
