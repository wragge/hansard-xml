I have since learned that a boat will load next week at Melbourne - I do not know at what other ports - and I have asked those who axe responsible for the utilization of the insulated meat space to see me to-morrow, with a view to considering how far it may be possible to meet the new conditions which are intensifying in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The selling price of butter throughout Australia is 149s. 4d. per cwt. The Government has taken into consideration the circumstances of the recent sales to the British Government, and has decided to make the difference between the local price and the export price the same this year as it was last year, and, as a consequence, the local price will be raised  &#189;d.  per lb., or 154s. per cwt. The price per cwt. to the Imperial Government is 175s. . </para>

Is the honorable gentleman aware that the Minister who introduced the Bill stated that, although he had looked through the Commonwealth Bill, he had seen nothing in it which led him to believe that the Commonwealth was taking steps to secure uniformity between the Commonwealth and the States in electoral matters? In view of the fact that this Government is pledged to bring about such uniformity, if possible, will the honorable gentleman forward such facts to the Queensland Cabinet as will make it impossible for them to be without the knowledge that this Government is anxious to bring about uniformity? In view of the urgency of the matter, I ask him if he will do this immediately, so as to possibly prevent the passing of legislation which might hinder the desired end? </para>

                        <para>- I think that the Queensland Minister is mistaken as to the contents of our Bill; indeed, I do not think that he has had an opportunity of going through it yet. It is very difficult to see all the points on which uniformity is provided for. Three electoral officials agreed upon certain lines of drafting for the securing of uniformity, and the whole subject was considered at a Conference held in 1915, at which all the States were represented. We have taken, as far as possible, the common opinion of the States, and drafted a Bill which may be to a great extent a standard for adoption by the States. If the honorable member would like information in regard to any point upon which uniformity might be aided, I will be glad to get it for him, although to cover all details of administration it may take a week or two to do so. Whatever information is required - in fact, has been made available - in regard to the possibilities of uniformity will be supplied. </para>

                        <para>I wish to draw attention to the poor provision made at the Norwood Post Office for the payment of pensions to old people and invalids. All day long there is a stream patiently awaiting their turn. As the room holds only about a dozen, the rest have to stand outside in all sorts of weather, as there is not the slightest shelter of any description. It is a shame to keep old people, invalids (including soldiers who have &#34;done their bit&#34;), and women with children in arms, waiting so long under such trying circumstances. No matter at what time one goes, the result is the same. As many business people collect for invalids, this loss of time means a lot to them. The two officials are in no way to blame, as they are working at high pressure all the time; and, with invalid soldiers returning every week, their duties become heavier. One way out of the difficulty would be to make a separate day - old-age pensions one day and soldiers and invalids another. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member refers to cases in which furlough has not been taken within the twenty years prescribed, and where, according to the provisions of the Act, it cannot accumulate; that is to say, a public servant may take six months&#39; furlough at the completion of twenty years&#39; service, but if he does not do so, he cannot secure twelve months furlough at the conclusion of forty years&#39; service. The matter is now the subject of correspondence between the Departments, primarily between the Department of the Prime Minister and the Public Service Commissioner, but I do not think that it has reached finality. However, I will inquire into it. </para>

                        <para>- I did see the report, hut I did not take notice of it, because the Government had previously dealt with the matter. In view of the ra&#62;pid developments in the theatres of war, and what we then  hoped  was the prospect of an early peace, or, at least, an armistice on proper conditions, Cabinet decided to suggest to the Prime Minister the advisability of remaining in Great Britain until it was seen what these developments would lead to. No definite date can be assigned for the return of the Prime Minister or the Minister for the Navy, whether it be Christmas or any  other  time. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad that the honorable member acknowledges frankly, for the first time, that his information comes from an unreliable source. So far as my memory serves me as to the report obtained from the &#34; unreliable source &#34; to which he refers, ho has not even interpreted it in a reliable way. I am not aware that any newspaper has reported me as having said that I was looking forward to some kind of Imperial Federation, I made an allusion to the prob- lem ahead in regard to the future governance of the Empire, but did not commit myself definitely to any form that might eventually foe evolved. The question, however., is not urgent, and can well await notice. If notice is given of it I have no doubt it will be phrased, by command of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> in a more courteous way than it was in its closing sentence, as put by the honorable member. </para>

As a matter of fact, a return has been prepared showing all the necessary particulars, and every opportunity is given to returned soldiers to take up land there. I think the honorable member must be referring to a particular instance, for I do not know of more than one case of a returned soldier being refused land, and that was a case in which the bidding was under the assessed rental. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the honorable member, and a number of others who are interested in what I call this &#163;10 restriction, are aware that it has formed the subject of much correspondence between the Government and those concerned. The basis of the agreement has now subsisted for about two years, and although not satisfactory to the country woolbuyer, it appears to be quite satisfactory to the Central Wool Committee. What other arrangements have arisen as to advances between city and country brokers or buyers, I am not prepared to say, because I am not familiar with the facts; but I shall obtain the information, and furnish it to the honorable member later. </para>

                                is reported to have stated - &#34; In 1916-17 a suggestion was on foot that the whole of the statistical work of the Commonwealth should be concentrated in the hands of the Federal Bureau. This was subsequently abandoned, because the Commonwealth could not do the work nearly so economically as this State. In the Federal Estimates presented recently &#163;38,000 was set down to meet the expenses of the proposed transfer. The Commonwealth Treasury contemplates spending &#163;19,000 on carrying out work hitherto done by the New South Wales office for &#163;8,000, so that an increase of 240 per cent, would be the result of the transfer of the function from the State to the Commonwealth. This proportion seems to hold good in many such comparisons.&#34;

                    <para class="block">It is not correct to say that the proposal was abandoned because the Commonwealth could not do the work as economically as the State. At the Conference of Premiers held in Adelaide in May, 1916, a resolution was passed expressing the desirableness of the amalgamation of the Statistical Bureaux of the States and Commonwealth, and inviting each. State to give consideration to this subject. In July of this year I received a letter from the Premier of New South Wales, stating that, after consultation with the States, it was proposed not to take any further steps to give effect to the resolution. It had previously been pointed out that the Commonwealth could do the whole of the statistical work for Australia and effect a considerable saving, as it would mean that the whole information could be obtained in ten publications instead of fifty-six. This in itself clearly indicates a large saving in printing alone. There is no foundation whatever for the statement that the Federal Government, in anticipation of the change, placed &#163;19,000 for New South Wales on the Estimates for 1917-18 (while under State control the Department cost &#163;8,000). No provision of that nature has been made in recent Commonwealth Estimates. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to make a few remarks concerning the Royal Commission which investigated Navy and Defence administration, and to advance reasons why the vast sums of loan money set out in this Bill should not be expended. The gentlemen who comprised that Commission are well known. They are - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> G. McBeath, chairman; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Chalmers, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Verco. These gentlemen have presented a very scathing report upon the conduct of the Navy Department, but whilst giving them credit for the courage which prompted them to say as much as they have said, it appears to me that they have not gone quite far enough. In pointing to grave irregularities, for example, they have neglected to mention the names of the gentlemen - Cabinet Ministers or otherwise - who must be held responsible for those irregularities. For example, in paragraph 5 of their report they say - </para>

                    <para>The control of the Navy Department by a Board of experts, with the Minister as President, is undoubtedly sound in principle. Instances have been furnished to us where a Minister has incurred expenditure either without reference or in opposition to the Naval Board. </para>

I am sure that Messrs. McBeath, Chalmers, and Verco will admit the reasonableness of the demand that they should furnish the people of Australia with the name or names of the Minister or Ministers who were guilty of such irregularities.

                    <para>In addition to the primary reason referred to above, for the non-success of the Naval Board in its administration, the then Minister supplied a further contributory factor by issuing the following instruction on the 7th April, 1915: - &#34;Each member of the Naval Board will have the right to bring matters for which he is primarily responsible direct to the Minister, or he may send routine matters to the Minister through the Secretary. Each member bringing any matter forward shall make his recommendation in writing thereon, and may ask, in addition, that the opinion of pome other member of the Board be obtained, or that the recommendation and subject-matter be referred to the whole Board. The Minister will either approve or not approve of recommendations, or defer consideration, refer to other member of the Board, or refer to meeting of whole Board.&#34; </para>

                    <para>Admiral Henderson stated that one of the most important provisions in the formation of a Navy is the &#34; selection and appointment of a Naval Board, which, by the reputation and qualifications of its members, will command, not only the confidence of the Commonwealth, but will possess also the confidence, loyal sympathy, and support of the Navy it administrates.&#34; It might reasonably have been expected that the members of the Naval Board would have been sufficiently handicapped in carrying out their duties under the conditions already mentioned without themselves creating a further hindrance to their operations. We regret to find that the relations existing between the members of the Board have not been such as to be conducive to the efficient working of the Board&#39;s system of administration. </para>

It is incomprehensible that a Department spending &#163;7,000,000 per annum should endeavour to conduct its affairs without the services of an expert to scrutinize all financial proposals and to insure that due regard is being paid to economy. The members of the Board have from time to time directed attention to the disadvantages under which they have laboured in this respect. Shortly after our appointment the present Minister sought our advice on the subject, and explained that the Naval Board was divided in its opinion regarding the most suitable officer for appointment as finance member. </para>

In- certain cases O&#39;Donoghue misappropriated funds actually due to the Department, and in these instances the fact that he was enabled to continue the frauds over such an extensive period indicates the existence of faulty methods in the departmental system. In other cases, he was successful in inducing certain firms having dealings with the Department to pay over to him moneys to which the Department had no claim.

We would like to know, and the Commission should have told us, the names of those firms who were so credulous, unsuspecting, and innocent - such babes in the commercial wood - that they never suspected this subordinate official who came asking for huge sums of money. </para>

If they came to me as Treasurer, they would come with the approval of the officers of the Department. I am prepared that my observations in connexion with the accounts of the Defence Department shall be inquired into. There are certain documents in the Department of the Treasury in which the Auditor-General drew the attention of the Treasurer to certain irregularities om the part of an officer in the Defence Department. I am speaking now from memory, but I insist that I know nothing of the O&#39;Donoghue frauds. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister is blaming me for those frauds, because, if I knew anything about them, I was as responsible as anyone else. I know nothing about them, however ; and, in my own defence, I repeat that the Auditor-General drew attention to certain irregularities in connexion with an officer of the Defence Department, whose name, I think, was Kitts. I trust that I am doing that person no injustice in mentioning his name; but I am under the impression that that is correct. As Treasurer, I asked why those matters had not been brought before me earlier. I believe the Auditor-General had signed his letters upon the subject during the month of April, and I do not think I saw them until July of the year in question. Of course, it must be said for the officers that at the time an immense amount of work was going through the Treasury, and this letter was not referred to me personally, but to the Secretary. I think that when the Auditor-General has occasion to take exception to the work of any particular officer, and addresses a letter to the Treasurer on the subject, he should mark it &#34;personal,&#34; so that the Treasurer would be bound to see it. However, I drew the attention of the Minister for Defence to the matter, and asked if the Department were going to continue this man in their employment. </para>

                        comments do not impeach in the slightest- degree the absolute and literal correctness of the paragraph in the Commission&#39;s report. Indeed, the Department&#39;s records tell their own story in almost precisely the same language. It could not possibly be inferred from the report that the &#163;7,000 was a &#34; final &#34; payment. On the Department&#39;s own admission it was anticipated that deductions of &#163;15,000 might have to be made from a claim of &#163;27,688, so that at the time when the &#163;7,000 was paid the Department itself thought it was liable for at least &#163;12,6S8. The reference to the total claim of the contractors, viz., &#163;.177,330, has no bearing on the point at issue, lt was never suggested that the sum mentioned in the Commission&#39;s report represented the full amount of the contract for fitting up transports. It is self-evident that a large part of the differences between the Department and the contractors must have accrued during the earlier stages. It is impossible to imagine that such a serious discrepancy could have arisen in connexion with the last transactions only of a contract which involved payments of &#163;177,330. The gravamen of the Commission&#39;s report is that there must have been * lack of method and system in dealing with claims for services rendered,&#34; and the Ministerial statements have furnished no evidence to refute that charge.

                <para>It is useless, therefore, for the Acting Prime Minister to go about making speeches to the effect that the Government are exercising a wise economy when they are allowing this kind of thing to be carried on. It is no reply to say to ex-Ministers, &#34; Well, you were in office,&#34; because this Ministry came in to alter things. We were told by the Prime Minister, who is now making such insulting speeches abroad, that we had returned to responsible government, inferring, or course, that under the Labour system of Caucus rule, and election of Ministers by Caucus, there was not responsible government. When the change came, the Conservative papers also declared that we had returned to responsible government; and I now point out that while we have responsible government, with a majority of fifty-three to twenty-two, these things are allowed. I agree with the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> that there appears to be a deplorable lack of a proper sense of responsibility about the members of the House, who do not scrutinize sufficiently the expenditure of moneys. </para>

Its whole history is most unfortunate. The New South Wales Government passed over to the Federal Government a worn-out article, and then created a first-class article to compete with it at less than half what they got from us. I am not blaming the New South Wales Government so much for what they did as I blame those who were responsible for advising the Federal Government of the day that the amount should be paid. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately it is not. It does not matter what Government was in office at the time so much as it does whether we should go on squandering money on a machine which every member knows is incompetent to do the work which we are asking it to do. Take the building of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> alone. It cost far more than twice as much as a similar ship constructed in the Old Country. </para>

                        <para>- I believe so. The matter requires serious consideration. The House is asked session after session to pass enormous sums to try to patch up this incompetent, useless, worn-out machine. It is time we took a stand, and said, &#34;It is better to dismantle the whole thing, start afresh, and get a new up-to-date dock yard where we can do our work.&#34; No one will be bold enough to say that that dockyard can ever be made a thoroughly good one. </para>

Yet we are passing hundreds of thousands of pounds for the construction of Bases which a good many believe will be obsolete and useless when we have finished them. </para>
                <para>Exactly the same applies to the Arsenal. I do not want to repeat what has often been said here about the rifles we are turning out at Lithgow.

                        <para>- With me, it is not a question of what Government is in office. Ministerialists, members of the Opposition, and those who take a more independent course, must accept individually their full and complete share of responsibility for every item we pass. I am not one of those who hold that, because a member sits on the Ministerial benches, he is relieved one iota of his individual responsibility, any more than is a man sitting on the Opposition benches. </para>

                        <para>- The fact that Ministers take no notice of what is said, or that a majority holds a different view, does not relieve a member of the responsibility of expressing his opinions. I am glad that this feeling of individual responsibility is growing among members. Should a division be called for on the Naval Bases item, I shall vote to hang up that expenditure for the present and I shall vote similarly against the Cockatoo Island Dock expenditure and the general Arsenal expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- I know that the Acting Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> is absent because of a deputation which is waiting on him, but I should like to tell the Minister who is at present in charge of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> that the shipbuilding proposals of the Government should be made clearer. In a statement read by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> at the beginning of the present series of sittings, we were told that the Government intended to introduce a Bill to deal with the labour problem connected with its shipbuilding enterprise. The Acting Minister for the Navy had said previously that it was the intention of the Government to contract itself out of the Arbitration Act so far as shipbuilding was concerned . If that is done, Ministers will be looking for trouble. Complaints about conditions are now being, made by the Australian Society of Engineers, and workmen belonging to other unions are complaining of certain statements of the Minister, which, he says, can be explained. He is alleged to have declared that shipbuilding is not going on well because the employees are raw at the work. Shipbuilding has not been done in Australia to any great extent. We have heard of &#34;building castles in the air,&#34; and we seem to be largely building ships in. that way ; at any rate, there is a lot of talk and very little being done. </para>

                        <para>- If I thought that it was doing well, I should not run it down. A retrograde step will be taken by Ministers if they contract themselves out of the Arbitration Act. Parliament has declared that every person shall have the right to appeal to the Arbitration Court, and the Government should make access to that Court more easy. Industrial turmoil and trouble arises because of the difficulty of approaching the Court. If the Government is doing right in contracting itself out of the Arbitration Act in respect of shipbuilding, it should logically contract itself out of the Act in respect of all enterprises connected with the defence of the country. Do Ministers intend to set up one rule for themselves and another for private employers? If they do, they are looking for trouble. I trust that wiser counsels may prevail, that access to the Court may be made easier, and that the machinery of arbitration may be simplified. There is great room for improvement. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> has spoken of the need for closer supervision of expenditure. The Budget and Estimates of expenditure were put before us about a month ago. Since that time we have passed several pages of Works and Buildings Estimates, the expenditure provided for amounting to &#163;454,951, and we are asked now to deal with several more pages on which the expenditure provided for is &#163;1,242,194, and between these two sections of the Estimates is another section, in which the expenditure of &#163;78,914,809 is provided for. Probably a little before Christmas, at the tail end of the present series of sittings, and at an early hour in the morning, when few members are present, we shall be asked to deal with these proposals in half-an-hour or so. The question may be stated from the Chair &#34;that the remaining pages of the Estimates be passed.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- It is certainly no better. It has a huge majority, and its supporters recently passed a new Standing Order further limiting debate, under which a certain time can be allotted for the discussion of any particular piece of business. Sufficient time should be allotted for the discussion of the Budget to enable the expenditure proposals of the Government to be fairly considered. The honorable member for Capricornia has suggested that the Auditor-General, because of his age, may not be strong enough to stand up to Ministers. </para>

We should have a statement from the Government as to whether or not that allegation is true. Probably the Auditor-General has not been strong enough to stand up to the Government, and insist on getting the assistance which he says is absolutely necessary. Some honorable members have suggested that the amounts in the schedule of this Bill should be subdivided in order that they may be dealt with separately. I shall support honorable members in every effort tha&#39;t will permit of a fuller and fairer discussion of the various items. </para>

                    <para>.- There are some items in the Bill to which I strongly object, and I am sorry that the Government have not acted &#39; with more consideration and foresight in regard to the Arsenal. They are proceeding in the same old unbusinesslike and slipshod style. A small amount for the Arsenal is placed on the Estimates, but the Government have no idea of what the ultimate scheme is to be. We had the same experience with the Small Arms Factory, and a dozen other Government undertakings. I am not opposed to the Arsenal ; on the contrary, I am very earnest in regard to it, and all other matters of defence. But I am anxious that these works should be started properly in the interests of efficient defence, and in the interests of the taxpayers. I know the history of some defence works, and I am of opinion that if they had been carried out as an ordinary business company would carry out any big undertaking, we should have got mach better value for our money, and the factories would be in a far more efficient state than they are to-day. The Small Arms Factory is an instance. Money was placed on the Estimates for the Factory, and Parliament was given certain information. The so-called experts of the Defence Department submitted reports as to what the plant should be, and what the rifles would cost. Machinery was supplied to the Factory in accordance with those reports, and to-day it is being operated by about twice as many hands as the American contractors said it would need. Moreover, the rifles being produced at Lithgow are not being used by our troops abroad. There may be a good reason for that, because I understand that, since the war broke out, the Imperial authorities have adopted an improved pattern of rifle.  At  the same time, the Factory is not producing anything like the number of rifles it should be producing, and, generally, the establishment is not coming up to expectations In every instance, the buildings cost more than we were led to expect. </para>

                        <para>- I am alluding to the Small  Arms  Factory merely as an illustration of what may happen in connexion with the Arsenal. Millions of pounds will be involved in the housing scheme, and in the erection and equipment of the Arsenal; and we are starting in the same old piece-meal, slip-shod fashion. There has never been a proper business investigation of that proposition, and the Government cannot tell the Committee where we shall be ultimately landed. I intend to oppose the item for the Arsenal, on the ground that there is no need to proceed with the work until the war is over. Whether there will be a need  for the  Arsenal after the war is a question that should be determined by the best military authorities in the Empire. We can well afford the ex,penditure of a few thousand pounds on preliminary investigations in connexion with a project of such magnitude, if such investigation will insure that we get a proper scheme. Honorable members can see, at Newcastle, what the Broken Hill Proprietary Company have been able to do in two years. It took the company a long time to get the scheme under way, but they engaged the best experts in the world, and investigated the proposition in a thoroughly business-like way. When at last a commencement was made with the work, they knew exactly what they would get for their expenditure. There is no reason why a  Government  undertaking should not be carried out  in  the same way. </para>

                        <para>- Sooner or later, we shall find a way of making the Government toe the mark in regard to this matter. It is time that country telephones and postal facilities should be treated on a special basis. I am sure the people would not; begrudge the money to make good a small deficiency in the Postal Department if that deficiency has been caused for the sake, of stimulating production, and fostering settlement in the back country. Instead of chipping off a little- expenditure here and there, and obtaining a surplus by saving money in a piece-meal fashion, the Postmaster-General would do better, in the interests of the country, and would meet with the approval of Parliament and the people, if he were to adopt a .policy that would give the requisite facilities to the producers. What matters it where the money goes, so long as production is increased, and the back-blocks are settled and developed? Unfortunately, the Postmaster-General looks at every proposal from the pounds, shillings, and pence point of view. He calculates the expenditure and the receipts, and insists upon having a surplus. Let us by all means have business methods in the Postal Department, but these country services constitute a special case. Money for them must be found somehow; and if the Minister cannot get it otherwise, he must cut down some of the facilities which the cities now enjoy. The cities are not helping by production to pay the interest on the public debt. If Australia is to pay its way, it must encourage an increase, firstly, of primary production, and then, of secondary production. </para>

                        <para>- They will listen in due time. I do not desire to say anything in criticism of the Cordite Factory. I believe that it is doing very good work; but, having regard to the present stage of the war, I am doubtful whether it is necessary to expend money for new works and extensions at that establishment. If the works are necessary, of course, they must be undertaken; but I do not see any urgency in these proposals, and it might be wise to allow them to stand over for some time. We have reached the stage when the Government must cut off all expenditure that is not absolutely necessary. Definite steps must be taken in the direction of economy; and if the Bill includes provision for any work that can be postponed, that work should be postponed. I hope the Government will set an example in economy; if they do not, they must be prepared for some very drastic criticism. </para>

                    <para>.- On reading the proof of the remarks which I made on Friday, more particularly in regard to Naval Bases, I found that it might possibly be inferred that I included the present Director of Naval Construction in the general condemnation which I applied to the state of affairs that has prevailed in the matter of Naval works for some years past. So far as I know, this gentleman is in every respect a capable and conscientious officer who has undoubtedly effected a considerable improvement on the condition of affairs that he inherited when he took over the position, but he is heavily handicapped in endeavouring to obtain efficiency and good work in the Departments under his charge. The lesser positions have been filled in many cases as a matter of Ministerial patronage. There are men still in the Department &#34;who owe their billets entirely to their association with Ministers. It is not a fair condition of things for the gentleman who is responsible for carrying out the work. </para>

I plead with the Government to give us a greater degree of efficiency than we have at present. Men who hold positions in connexion with work which is being carried out by the Commonwealth Government have admitted to me privately that they are unable to secure that efficiency for which they are entitled to look, and that if they make any bother about it they only bring trouble upon themselves.

The Government expect honorable members on this side to support them by agreeing to this expenditure, but I cannot give support to the proposed expenditure on an Arsenal. There are other items to which I am equally opposed. It is about time that honorable members began to realize that the fault in regard to a good deal of excessive expenditure is not confined to Ministers, but that they are also responsible for it. For years past a few of us have insisted on the necessity for economy in different directions, but very little regard has been paid to our pleadings. Honorable members who are anxious to insist on doing their duty by keeping a watchful eye on the expenditure of public money must do more than talk. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see the necessity for pressing on with some works, particularly the Arsenal. The financial condition of this country is such that the House should investigate every item of expenditure before it gives consent to it. There is trouble ahead if that course is not followed, and the responsibility will rest, not only on the Government, but also on every honorable member. I do not propose to  carry that responsibility, and I shall oppose every item of expenditure on work that is not urgently or immediately necessary. If I know anything of the temper of the House, for the first time in the history of this Parliament very many honorable members intend to take up the position that they will only consent to public expenditure, whether from loan funds or from Consolidated Revenue, upon works that are not only necessary, but also immediately and urgently required. Before we adjourned on the last occasion, there was a very strong feeling, particularly on this side of the House, that, at the present juncture, when, as we hoped, we were approaching the end of a war which has capsized military and naval theories in almost every direction, it might be inadvisable to undertake the construction of an Arsenal. </para>

                        <para>- They gave the opportunity during the last week. But we have not had a reasonable opportunity to consider the Estimates in chief during the last ten years. In two cases the Estimates were dealt with in the year following those to which they related. Year after year for the last ten or eleven years the Estimates have been submitted for our consideration in the dying hours of the session. Such a system ought not to continue. The Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> has not assured me that all public works which should properly be carried out by contract will at least be submitted to the test of public tender. The history of the work of this Parliament during the last ten years shows that in connexion with Commonwealth expenditure day labour has had a fairly good trial, and has cost the country from 20 per cent, to 50 per cent, more than the contract system would have done. Department after Department is dealt with by a Royal Commission. And with what result? </para>

                        <para>- The investigations are all right. But what happens afterwards ? i <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. RICHARD</inline> FOSTER.- Quite so. No action is taken on the reports of these Commissions. In nearly every case the investigations made by a Royal Commission have disclosed a scandalous state of affairs. Again and again it has been shown that public works under the day labour system have cost us from 25 up to 50 per cent, more than they ought to have done. In some instances they have actually cost us 100 per cent, more than we should have had to pay for them. I invite honorable members to examine the reports of the Public Accounts Committee and the Public Works Committee with regard to the application of the day labour system to the construction of our Naval Bases, and. to the statements made in that regard from time to time by the  Chairman  of the Public Works Committee <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. Gregory).</inline> It is a scandal that honorable members individually should be satisfied merely to listen to these stories of ;extravagance and to allow things to go on as before. I have been directing attention to this question for the last ten years, and have come to the conclusion that we shall never get on the right track until we resort to the public tender test. What is the use of appealing to the people to subscribe to our war loans&#39;; and of increasing taxation almost to the breaking point, while at the same time we allow this scandalous system of administration to continue year after year. Have honorable members considered the report of the Commission appointed to inquire into the administration of the Department of the Navy, or the report of the Commissioner on the Federal Capital? Have they considered the last report of the Public Accounts Committee in regard to tha Naval Bases? They know what is going on, but they take no action. In this respect the supporters of the Government are as bad as the Opposition. They ought to know better, and should act in the light of the knowledge they possess. </para>

                <para>If we had had a Supply and Tender Board, some of the misappropriations that have occurred, and much of the want of method shown in connexion with our various Departments would not have happened. After years of agitation the Government allowed the Public Accounts Committee to inquire into the question of the establishment of a Supply and Tender Board. The Committee took evidence in the various States, and found that the Supply and Tender Boards operating in some of them were doing magnificent work. The Committee recommended the creation of such a Board for the Commonwealth, but that recommendation has not been adopted. We have a purchase Board in one Department, and a purchase Board in another, but we have not a Supply and Tender Board, although it should have been established years ago. I, for one, shall not vote for another Loan Works Bill until we are assured of a proper system of administration. I challenge the Opposition to show that day labour has not been not only a failure, but a scandalous failure. I have no desire to do away with the day labour system altogether, but I wish it to be put to the test of public tender. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The findings of both the Public Accounts Committee and the Public Works Committee should be of a judicial, and not of a political, character. Their decisions should be according to the evidence, and not according to what might suit any one political party. The reports of those Committees should be submitted to Parliament in accordance with the requirements of the Acts under which they are constituted, and the House should have an opportunity to discuss them. </para>

                <para>A few months ago the Minister for the Navy was asked whether the building of the Arsenal was absolutely essential, or whether, in view of the new experiences of the present great conflict, it could not stand over until after the war. I observe that this question was renewed in the House a few days ago, when a statement by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> was put forward to the effect that he had asked the Admiralty if the work could not stand aside till after the war, and that the reply was that a certain initial part of the work should be undertaken. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member &#39; belongs to a party with a majority, and if the Government policy does not suit him, he can vote against it. I know, However, that he will not do that. He says that all works that are not absolutely necessary should be stopped. But who is to be the judge ? Are individual members or the Government to judge? </para>

                        <para>- I am addressing my question, not to the honorable member who interjects, but to the  Chairman.  What does the dictum of the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Poster)</inline> mean ? It means that all public works are to be stopped. Did the Government put that issue before the country at the last election? They pledged themselves to carry on public works, and rightly so, for public works cannot be stopped at a time like this. We all believe in economy, but it is not economy to stop all public works. </para>

                        <para>- That is another matter. If we are to build ships successfully we must, as I say, have up-to-date machinery, and the purchase of &#163;20,000 or &#163;50,000 worth of machinery for Cockatoo Island will cheapen the cost, and render the work reproductive. I cannot understand honorable members condemning the Government for expenditure which will have such an effect. </para>

A new firm starting to build ships, especially cruisers, full of machinery, cannot be expected to compete with old-established firms in other parts of the world. It will be noted that the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide,</inline> now nearly completed, has not been half the time on the stocks that the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> was; and that is because of the slips and other appliances all being ready.

                <para>I notice here an item of, I think, &#163;45,000 for the Perth General Post Office. I do not know that that work has ever been submitted to the Public Works Committee, and my opinion is that no expenditure of the kind should be undertaken until the work has been considered by that body. The Postmaster-General has a habit of grouping a great number of works together, and I ask whether that is with a view to evade the submission of works to the Public Works Committee. If that be so, it is a policy of which we cannot approve, for we ought to carry out the Act of Parliament under which the Works Committee is constituted. </para>
                <para>Generally speaking, I am prepared to support the Government in their works policy, which is a right and necessary one under our present circumstances. If we enter upon a policy of rigid curtailment we shall not be doing the best for the country. We shall have thousands of soldiers returning to Australia, and the best employment for them will be on public works of a reproductive and beneficial character. That is a much better way of assisting the soldiers than hand- ing out pensions or doles of charity. I trust that the Government will continue a vigorous works policy, in order to keep the wheels of industry moving. </para>
                <para>Lt.-Colonel ABBOTT (New England) &#91;5.53&#93;. - It is proposed to spend &#163;1,242,000, largely for naval and military defence purposes, and I am not here to criticise expenditure on such defence works, seeing that we are now in the midst of a war. I assume that the Government are carrying out those works in accordance with expert advice and opinions received some time ago - that the Minister for Defence would not have the audacity to go on with such works in the absence of advice from military authorities. </para>

                <para class="block">South Wales. If honorable members will consult the Budget-papers, they will find that,, already, no less than &#163;471,000 has been spent on the Victorian sub-Base at Flinders. It is proposed, under this measure, to provide an additional amount of &#163;190,000; and assuming that this vote be passed, and the money spent, there will at the close of this year have been no less than &#163;661,519 expended on the Flinders Naval Base. In exactly the same category, and intended to serve identically the same naval purpose, the establishment of a Naval sub-Base at Port Stephens was recommended by Admiral Henderson. It is recognised by all unbiased authorities that, as a harbor, Port Stephens is equal to, if not better than, Port Jackson; and it will be admitted that that is saying a good deal. If the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> were not at present temporarily in the Chair, he could substantiate what I am saying with regard to the harbor facilities afforded by Port Stephens. There is a depth of 42 feet of water there right up to the foreshore, and 60 feet in the basin, and no dredging would be required there at all. The facilities afforded there are greatly superior to those of Newcastle Harbor. Here we have a natural port recommended by Admiral Henderson as a sub-Base, and yet whilst, up to the end of the present financial year, no less than &#163;661,519 will have been provided for the Flinders Naval Base, the total amount expended so far at Port Stephens is &#163;41,000. There is a vote of &#163;25,000 provided in this schedule for the purchase of land at Port Stephens, and, assuming that it is agreed to and expended, there will then have been spent on this subBase only &#163;66,236. I ask honorable members why, if Admiral Henderson&#39;s report is to be relied upon, the Naval Base at Port Stephens is neglected, in order that the money available may be spent upon other sub-Bases. </para>

He recommended that these works should bs gone on with, and his recommendation has been given effect to in the case of the Naval Base at Flinders. If it was good for Flinders, and I assume that no contrary expert advice has since been received, why has the establishment of a Naval Base at Port Stephens been neglected, and why are the Government today merely asking for money to purchase land there? </para>

                <para>We do not know what will happen after the war. We should be self contained in the matter of defence, and it is quite probable that we shall have to be. I do not propose to criticise the expenditure in connexion with the Arsenal, the production of T.N.T., the Cordite Factory, and so on, because I believe that it is essential that we should manufacture all the explosives we require. We do not know what international complications may arise after the present war, and the transport of munitions from the Old Country or from America to Australia may present a very serious problem. When our boys return from the war, we may be faced with international complications, and it is quite possible that we may not be able to secure the measure of help and assistance from the Old Country that we have previously enjoyed. We should endeavour to be self-contained in the matter of defence, and in order that we may be so it is essential that we should manufacture rifles and all munitions of war required in Australia. </para>
                <para>I recognise that the establishment of an Arsenal is necessary. I should like to remind honorable members that our boys when they went to the Front took certain equipment with them, but on their return they do not bring back the rifles and other equipment they took away. If in twelve or eighteen months&#39; time complications arose here calling for the defence of Australia, how many rifles would there be in the hands of our boys ? How many batteries of artillery are there in Australia ? We have military trainees coming on and many men returning from the Front. I sincerely trust that a very big proportion of them will return in a condition to render service, and I know they will be found game enough for the work of defending Australia. But what will be our position if we have no batteries of artillery and an insufficient number of rifles ? We cannot expect that all the rifles we require can be turned out in the small establishment at Lithgow, and when they are turned out there, as was mentioned by a previous speaker, they are not quite up to the standard we expected. </para>

                        <para>- I understood the honorable member to say that the rifles manufactured at Lithgow are not suitable for active service work, and that they are not used in active service. I wish to say that the rifles manufactured at Lithgow at present are fit for active service. They have been altered considerably during the last twelve months. The statement is made that the factory is not producing nearly the required number of rifles in proportion to the plant. The increase in the output of rifles which has taken place during the past six months is 200 per week. This increase of output has been accomplished with 200 hands less than were previously employed, and the cost of the rifles at the present time compares very favorably with the cost of rifles manufactured in any other part of the world. The Small Arms Factory at Lithgow at present manufactures, machines such as lathes at less than the cost for which they can be produced in America. </para>

                        <para>- I do not object to public expenditure if the money is expended judiciously. It seems to me that at the present time the Postmaster-General * is spending practically the whole of the amount allotted to his Department in the cities, and is not giving the country districts their due share of expenditure. I have travelled, not only through my own, but also through other electorates in the past six months, and in all the country centres I have visited, I have found that discontent exists amongst postal officials and residents because of the inadequate telephonic and telegraphic facilities provided. In many farming centres there are no such facilities provided. In others one may find a little wayside office erected at a cost of 10s. or 15s., with insufficient accommodation for two persons. When applications are made to the Postmaster-General to have these offices remodelled, the reply given is that the revenue derived from these particular centres does not warrant the expenditure. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Some time ago, I brought this question up in connexion with a notice received by two country postal officials that they would be required to find fresh premises for the post-office, as the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department had decided to hand over the buildings they occupied to the Home and Territories Department. This occurred in two mining centres where a large amount of money goes through the post-office. I sent two petitions into the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department on the matter, and while my communications were formally acknowledged, I have had no definite reply, and do not know whether these matters are under consideration or not. I have carefully noted the employees in some of the post-offices in country centres, and have come to the conclusion that some of the larger country post-offices are practically baby farms.- I noticed that in many cases the great majority of the employees were boys of from thirteen to fifteen years of age. They are doing what I term men&#39;s work, and are paid at the rate of about 15s. per week. If you require to send a telegram from one of these offices, you will have two ot three little boys surrounding you, and making all sorts of busy inquiries. It appears to me that postal affairs should not be committed to the care of these young lads. It may he the desire of the Postmaster-General to economize; but to me it does not seem true economy to employ lads of thirteen or fourteen years of age to perform the work of mien. </para>
                <para>I come now to the payment of old-age and invalid pensions. Upon the days on which these pensions are payable, it is a common sight to see perhaps thirty or forty old men and women lined up round a post-office, where they are kept waiting, perhaps, from 10 o&#39;clock in the morning until 4 o&#39;clock in the afternoon. The fault does not lie with the postal officials. They do their best in the circumstances; but they are so overburdened with work that these aged and infirm men and women are frequently compelled to hang around post-offices for a period of seven hours. </para>

                        <para>- At the Bathurst Post-office recently I saw some twenty or thirty old men and women waiting to  receive their pensions. I saw them there at 10 o&#39;clock in the morning, and at 4 o&#39;clock in the afternoon of the same day an old man was still waiting to receive his pension. The conclusion  wa3  thus forced upon me that the present system of paying these people is a most incon-  ivenient  one. It has occurred to me that all the trouble to which invalid and old-age pensioners are now subjected might be overcome by forwarding their pensions to them through the post. Some of those people are obliged to walk 4 or 5 miles in order to receive their pay. </para>

                    <para>Mi-. NICHOLLS. - Country postal officials are not being adequately paid for their services. I desire to see a portion of the &#163;220,000 that is allocated to the Postal Department under this Bill expended in country centres. In various places men are engaged in postal duties from 6 a.m. till 10 p.m. for a wage of from &#163;35 to &#163;75 per annum. Mail contractors are carrying mails a distance of 18 miles three times a week, and an additional 8 miles once a week, for &#163;75 a year. Whenever applications are made to the Postmaster-General for increases of pay to these contractors, the departmental reply invariably is that the revenue is not sufficient to warrant it. Upon one occasion an allowance postmaster resigned his position on account of his inadequate remuneration, and the  Deputy  Postmaster-General thereupon intimated that unless a person could be found to discharge the duties of the office at the same salary, the post-office in question would be closed, and, as a matter of fact it is closed to-day. In another instance, because the revenue derived from an allowance office fell slightly below the remuneration of the postal officer in charge of it, the Department decided to close it. This sort of thing is happening every day in country electorates throughout Australia. I contend that country residents are entitled bo quite as much consideration as are residents of our cities. </para>
                    <para>The next matter to which I desire to direct attention has reference to a postal officer who was receiving a certain allowance, but who, because he did something in opposition to the wishes of the Postmaster-General, was dismissed. I refer bo the case of Alderman Wallace Henderson, J. P. </para>

                            <para>-Then I shall reserve my remarks under that heading until a future occasion. In conclusion, I desire to impress upon the Postmaster-General the necessity for spending more money in providing postal facilities in country districts. Throughout the length and breadth of Australia great discontent exists to-day. I hope that, in the near future, the Postmaster-General will do something to benefit the residents of our rural areas. </para>

                        <para>.- I have listened with interest to the statements that have been made on behalf of the Ministry in connexion with the establishment of the proposed Arsenal. We have been told that,, after the war, we must be prepared for contingencies, and that it is therefore essential that we should agree to these Estimates. Do honorable members realize that we are now being asked to repeat in connexion with the Arsenal the farce which was perpetrated in connexion with the establishment of the Military College at Dun-  tr001&#93; and of the Naval College at Jervis Bay ? In both those cases the first buildings which the authorities set out to erect were the last which were required for actual occupation! Similarly, the money provided on these Estimates includes an appropriation for the erection of &#34; residential quarters.&#34; I well remember my first visit to the Military College at Duntroon, when I found the landscape considerably added to by a number of very fine residences that had been erected for various officers. These residences were constructed of solid brick and concrete, a-nd. possessed elaborate fronts. They were not too good for the officers who ultimately occupied them, but the money expended upon them might, at that stage, have been much more profitably devoted to the organization of the housing of the cadets at the College, and to providing the general utilities connected with that institution. In the same way, at Jervis Bay, the energies and genius of the Department now so appropriately presided over by the Minister at present representing the Government in the Chamber <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> set themselves to the erection of residences for the Commandant  of the College and for the various other officers - all before arrangements had been completed for the accommodation of the boys, or for the general requirements of the College itself. And now it is the same with the Arsenal. </para>

                    <para>We are told that the Minister has been approaching the British Admiralty, and has ascertained that it is necessary to go ahead with the Naval Bases. I am inclined to think that, since the Australian Government treated the Admiralty some years ago with insultingly scant courtesy in connexion with the most matured judgment which had ever been given by experts of the Old Country to the Commonwealth, the Admiralty does not take these matters quite so seriously as some of us, perhaps, imagine. With respect to Naval Bases, the whole trend of the world today is to establish Naval Bases in front of the country intended to be defended. When Germany&#39;s naval preparations began to alter the balance of sea power in Europe, the British authorities did not start upon the erection of fresh Bases at Land&#39;s End, but got to work in the North Sea, as near to Germany as they could place themselves. Similarly, Germany established her great Naval Base at Heligoland - not at the other end of the </para>
                    <para class="block">Baltic Sea,butin front of the country which she sought to defend, and not behind it. So it is with all the other Great Powers. The Naval Base in Western Australia and the other at Westernport were part of Admiral Henderson&#39;s scheme, and were bases that were looked upon as being invaluable to Australia if she should become involved in war with any country which intended to make naval raids upon us, or to raid our trade routes. The Westernport Base is a torpedo base, intended to protect the trade routes off Melbourne. The other base is regarded as a refit base for ships whose duties would be to protect our trade routes with South Africa and India. Its strategical value is its value in relation to those trade routes. Since the present war began, the question of whether the matter of our trade routes was to represent Australia&#39;s especial danger has been decided. After this war, if there is to be a special danger to which Australia may be subjected, it will emanate from nearer to this country than the continent of Europe; and it will not be west or south of us. If we consider any development of power, say, in the Republic of China, which might at some day - we hope never - become a menace to this country, the bases required for our protection would be away to the north of Australia, as far up as we could get along the lines of communication. I am not speaking from my own kindergarten basis of knowledge, but have consulted men who are regarded in England as the very best informed along their particular lines of interest. And this problem was always put in the same way to me. The Australian Naval unit itself was designed as a class of ships which was to work in conjunction with a similar naval class provided by New Zealand and the Mother Country. The whole purpose of that combined unit was that it should be fast enough, homogeneous enough, and strong enough - using three bases available north of Australia - to evade capture by a stronger enemy. Until that unit was destroyed it would be difficult for any enemy to invade Australia. And it would be difficult to destroy that fleet because, with its speed and relative size, multiplied by the ports which it could use, it would be a greater force than the enemy could afford to use against it; not greater than the enemy&#39;s full strength, but greater than the strength which the enemy could provide if it detached its forces into three in order, say, to blockade those three Bases. Can any honorable member point to any modern country which has established its naval bases as far away from its probable enemies as could be well managed ? </para>

                            <para>- Yes; and that scheme was based on the potential danger to Australia, at that time, of the only Great Power likely to become an enemy of Australia, Germany. Admiral Henderson&#39;s scheme was based on the possibility of that enemy taking the high seas and raiding our commerce routes. That situation now, however, has completely evaporated. Is Germany to be permitted to remain in the same position with regard to the high seas as in the past? Certainly not. Possibly, the whole situation concerning the high seas will be altered, and the Mother Country intrusted with the sole power of policing the seas in the interests of mankind. </para>

                            <para>- Before I leave the subject of the Arsenal, I would like to say that the question of location having met with the indorsement of high military authorities, has not, to me, been satisfactorily cleared up. I know the idea of erecting the Arsenal inland, despite the enormous increased charges of production, was at first put forward by a very active, his enemies might say almost obstinate, but certainly a public-spirited civil servant. He seems to have carried that proposition through all its stages, his objection to Newcastle being the belief that, for some mysterious reason, it might not be possible to carry on activities there if ever this country were again involved in war. With regard to that, I can only say that I can hardly imagine this country maintaining the struggle for any length of time if the great cities of the coast, or even if Sydney and Newcastle alone were in the hands of the enemy. If honorable members will look at the constitution of Australia, economically and industrially, they will realize that the loss to Australia of those areas would be far greater in war than the loss of Westphalia would be to Germany. Any one who has studied the outside countries of the world in this respect will see that, if the industrial centre of Westphalia, including Essen, were in the hands of an enemy, it would be impossible for Germany to maintain the struggle for more than a few weeks at the most. </para>

                    <para>If. then, there is an objection to a work of this nature being established at Newcastle, it should be located at some other natural centre - at Melbourne or Sydney - where the details of production could be economically maintained. I would urge on Parliament not to authorize its establishment in the bush, where there is no labour market, no raw material, and where the cost of production, therefore, must be enormously increased. </para>

I challenge any Minister who knows his job to say that if it is established at the Federal Capital a whole gang of men would not be utterly demoralized and upset if one or two absented themselves. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. All these places are specialized centres for labour. Honorable members must know that the proposed Arsenal will- not offer any inducement for the establishment of a large industrial centre. It would have to depend for casual labour upon centres of employment many miles distant, and which would be totally inaccessible, with the result that the output of the Factory Would not be economically main&#39;tained. I only want to repeat what I have said in the House before. I do not wish to weary honorable members, but 1 ask them to look into the figures connected with the Lithgow .establishment, and especially the actual gas and coal con sumption necessary for the output of rifles. If they do so, they will find that, owing to the increased price of coal, the cost of turning out rifles on the Murrumbidgee must be at least 4s. or 5s. per rifle above Lithgow costs. </para>

                    <para>And dealing now with the subject of experts, I am reminded that the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foster),</inline> before the dinner adjournment, was talking about Royal Commissions and their reports. We have had many Royal Commissions, especially in connexion with Defence matters and public works, and this country has all along allowed a farce to be perpetrated in connexion with these reports. The manner in which the report of the very first Commission of Advice was handled probably explains why the Admiralty is not giving us, in my humble judgment, that serious advice which, otherwise, we might have expected to get. The Commission to which I refer was in connexion with a scheme propounded by Admiral Creswell, and referred to the Admiralty for advice. The Admiralty characterized the scheme as utterly fallacious, and indicated that the gentleman who propounded it did not seem to be <inline font-style="italic">au fait</inline> with naval developments. The Admiralty may, or may not, have been right; but, at all events, it was our highest court of appeal in naval matters. But what happened? When the report came back to Australia, the Government referred it to Admiral Creswell and some of his colleagues to see what they thought of _ the Admiralty! We have had other Royal Commissions in connexion with public works, and one in which the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Webster)</inline> and the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archibald)</inline> were interested was presided over by &#187; gentleman of great ability. That Commission sat for many months. And what happened ? </para>

                            <para>- As events turned out, it did, prove a waste of public money, because the report brought against the officers was referred back to them for their opinion ! The report of the Defence Department Royal Commission, composed of the very best men obtainable on the business side, was also referred back to the &#34;brass hats/&#39; who are still there, to say what they thought of the Royal Commission! What happened, also, in connexion with the report on the Navy Department? My honorable friend, the Acting Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> cannot be held responsible for what has happened in the past; but &#39;the report of that Royal Commission is hardly flattering either to the Minister of State or. the Department. Cabinet sat on its recommendations with all the affection of a hen sitting on a nest of eggs, from which she hopes to obtain something creditable to herself. Cabinet has decided that the recommendations cannot be accepted <inline font-style="italic">in toto,</inline> because the Department cannot be removed from direct Ministerial control. The gentleman who, according to the ordinary tenets of parliamentary government, is responsible for what happened in that Department, is still there, offering us advice as to what we should do in connexion with these naval works! I can only say that this policy of deliberating about the report of a Royal Commission when it does not suit the Government, and clamoring about it when it does, is a fraud upon the Australian public. So far as I am concerned, I will always hold that when a report is brought in absolutely condemnatory of the whole administration of a Department, it is the duty of the Minister responsible for that Department to retire from the Government. This is what Ministerial responsibility means. I should imagine that in wartime we would endeavour to secure greater efficiency than at any other time, but the morale of this House has fallen so low that- </para>

                            <para>- I have heard that before, and I have no doubt the Minister believes what he is saying; but <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> believe, also, that if the Admiralty authorities were approached at a time when they are not harassed with the pressing and immediate problems of the waT, they would  be able to study local problems, and give a different answer. It seems to me that we do not realize that the British Admiralty are at the present time bearing a strain to the limit of their endurance. At the outbreak of war, and when the Imperial authorities were organizing makeshift factories for the manufacture  of shells, we asked England to send out a whole establishment for the making of shells here. We estimated that we would be able to make 200 shells a week, and I point out that this output could be fired by any one of the field guns in ten minutes! Is it any wonder, therefore, that the British authorities did not provide the establishment? Every one of the men employed on such a work would be of more value in England, engaged in the oversight of the makeshift factories which were then being organized. Even if we&#39; could have turned out 20,000 or&#39; 200,000 shells a week, we could not have given equal service to Great Britain at that time. I think it is absurd to expect the Admiralty authorities to turn aside from the problems now confronting them to tell us whether or not we should go ahead with Westernport or the other Naval Bases, because the necessity for them is being decided in Europe. Whatever Bases we want in Australia will not be of that kind and for that purpose. Of that I am as satisfied as that I stand here, and it is for that reason alone that I oppose these items in the schedule. </para>

                        <para>.- I strongly support the arguments of the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kelly)</inline> as to the need of going slow in the construction of Naval Bases. Of the total amount of &#163;2,175,633 covered by the schedule, the Navy Department wants &#163;770,500, and the Military &#163;276,500, leaving a balance of &#163;1,128,633. Thus the Naval and Military Departments alone require nearly half the total amount. The Murray waters scheme, a most important developmental undertaking, takes &#163;99,000, the east-west railway &#163;300,000, redemption of Northern Territory loans &#163;339,000, and the Postal Department &#163;220,000, or a total of &#163;958,000, leaving less than &#163;200,000 for such important matters as the construction of railways in various parts, the acquisition of post-office sites and wireless stations, and the erection of lighthouses on the Australian coast, one of the most urgently important works imaginable. Is there any real justification for the proposed new expenditure on naval and military works? We are asked to vote under this Bill for naval purposes &#163;770,500, and a number of additional items under war loan expenditure, including &#163;500,000 towards the construction of the Fleet, are required by the same Department. </para>

                    <para>The defence of Australia is near and dear to the heart of every member of the community. There is no party and no politics about that matter. It is a national and patriotic duty that appeals to every Australian. But we have already expended millions, and propose to continue to spend millions, and one wonders what for. Against whom are we preparing for defence? Which nation is likely to invade us and threaten our security? Prior to  the  war it is well understood that we were in imminent danger from Germany,  but  if  our  anticipations about the end of the war are realized, the danger of invasion by Germany will have disappeared. I  cannot  believe that at the end of this war we shall leave Germany in such a position that, even if her fleet is intact, she will be a menace to the security of any part of the British Empire. The naval bases and wireless stations on which Germany had to rely if she had designs against Australia previous to the war have gone, and no European nation is to-day in a position, either in connexion with the trade routes, or coaling stations, or refitting stations, or naval bases in any part of the southern seas, to threaten Australia to any serious extent. After this war I do not think any European Power will be in a position to threaten Australia. </para>

                            <para>- If there is any justification  for  the proposed expenditure on naval works, it must be against other Powers. Who are they? Until very recently we may have had a feeling of insecurity in regard to our eastern Ally,  but  we may, to some extent, at any rate, consider ourselves fairly immune from invasion by that nation. If any people have the facilities for invasion, certainly Japan has. She is the only nation possessing bases in the Pacific that might possibly threaten Australia, but I am not  prepared to argue to-night that danger threatens .us from that quarter. We have been protected by Japan during this war. Our transports have been conveyed by Japanese warships, and we have had positive assurances, both from the Imperial Government and from Japan, that that Power has no ulterior designs against this country. The danger cannot threaten from China, because China has neither a navy nor a mercantile fleet, and to land an invading force in Australia would require a very large fleet of transports. There is no other nation from which we may apprehend danger. The war will so exhaust the nations financially and otherwise that there will not be much likelihood of a recurrence of war for the next ten or twenty years. </para>

                    <para>I can put up a good case to show that no danger . need be apprehended by Australia, and that the expenditure of this money as a precaution against invasion is a precaution against something which is not likely to happen, or, at any rate, is not in sight for the next ten years at least. Are we, then, to go on with this expenditure of &#163;1,000,000 per year at the very least? In this Bill we are to spend &#163;770,500 for naval works, and another &#163;500,000 is required for the Fleet, making &#163;1,270,500 in all. This expenditure is more likely to increase than decrease, because naval and military items have a particularly bad habit of continually increasing, as the following figures show: - In Germany in 1.905, the army expenditure was &#163;35,000,000, and in 1914 it was &#163;68,000,000. In Austria it increased from &#163;13,000,000 to &#163;24,000,000; in Russia from &#163;39,000,000 to &#163;66,000,000; in France from &#163;27,000,000 to &#163;48,000,000; and in Great Britain it stood at &#163;28,000,000. Germany&#39;s naval expenditure increased from &#163;11,300,000 in 1905 to &#163;23,000,000 in 1914. In Austria the increase was from &#163;4,000,000 to &#163;7,500,000; in Russia from &#163;12,000,000 to &#163;26,000,000; in France from &#163;12,000,000 to &#163;25,000,000 ; and in Great Britain from &#163;33,000,000 to &#163;49,000,000. We were told that that increased expenditure was necessary -to preserve peace. One of the absurd arguments that this war has exploded, I hope once and for all, is that to be prepared for war is the surest guarantee of peace. Surely with all those increasing armaments, and that increasing expenditure, peace should have been so absolutely certain that nothing could disturb it. Yet Ave know in our hearts that the very fact that this continual preparation of one nation against the other was going on was the one thing which brought  about  the terrible calamity that afflicts the world to-day. We were continually reminded that these huge accounts for naval and military expenditure were necessary to establish our security as a nation. The argument is put forward on behalf of this Bill that the security of Australia demands this expenditure. I do not believe the security of Australia is threatened, or that it will be seriously threatened at the conclusion of the war. In fact, our danger will be less at the conclusion of the war than it was at the beginning. I believe our security will be established for the next ten or twenty years because of the exhaustion of the nations, and the fact that no nation can lightly enter again  upon  a war such as the invasion of Australia would lead to, because of the protection afforded us by the British Navy. We can, therefore, fairly look to at least ten years of security ahead - which is putting it within very narrow limits. </para>
                    <para>Before the war the national debt of Australia, which was then considered enormous, was about &#163;290,000,000. It is estimated that by the time the war is concluded it will have increased to at least &#163;800,000,000, .and I have heard &#163;900,000,000 mentioned. That to a  popu&#39;lation  of 5,000,000, with the enormous amount of developmental work ahead of us, is simply staggering. At 5 per cent, it will mean an annual interest bill alone of &#163;45,000,000. Is it possible for 5,000,000 people to meet such a charge, and go on expending huge sums for purposes of which the necessity is not apparent, and for a defence that is not immediately necessary? It means that for &#169;very man, woman, and .child in the community &#163;9 per year has to be found for interest alone. It means, therefore, that every productive unit in the community will have to produce &#163;45 per year to pay our interest bill, and in addition we shall have to carry on the ordinary work of the country, including the huge developmental processes which are of such immense importance. It is too much to ask the people of Australia to bear this huge financial burden and also to provide money- for development. If during the next five years we could divert  into  reproductive channels the &#163;1,000,000 that it is proposed to spend annually on naval work, what a difference it would make to this country ! If, instead of sending a stream of golden sovereigns across the sea each year, we spent the money in developing our territory and securing its full benefits, the results would be wonderful to contemplate. If for the next ten years, instead of spending unnecessarily &#163;1,000,000 a year on naval works, we used the money to build railways and to open up the land in other ways, we should reduce our financial burden, and at the same time increase our ability to bear it. The military expenditure is almost as serious as the naval expenditure. I feel that we cannot allow our defence system to crumble to pieces, even though our position may seem fairly safe; but it seems to me unnecessary and unwise, in face of the burdens that we have to bear, to spend money on new naval establishments, &#39;arsenals, depots, and the like. </para>
                    <para>The two Departments in regard to which we can and ought to save are the Military and the Naval Departments. In every country the expenditure on the army and navy is notoriously large and wasteful, and, to a great extent, the result, not of necessity, but of scares and panics, deliberately engineered by certain persons for their own purposes. </para>

I do not ask him to accept my word in these matters, but I hope to direct his thoughts into a line of investigation that will show him that the armament firms of different countries are associated - British shareholders being interested in French and German firms, German shareholders in French and British firms, and French shareholders in British and German firms. </para>

                    <para>If in the next ten years the money which it is now proposed to spend on naval works were diverted into reproductive channels, the effect would be marvellous. The chief objection to the proposed expenditure is that it is unproductive. The money for which we are now asked is for wholly new works. In addition, there is the money that is required for the upkeep of the Fleet and of the ordinary naval establishments. </para>
                    <para class="block">That runs into an immense sum. For this huge expenditure we get nothing in return. It will to ten or twenty years, and, should some of those opposite have their way, 100 years, before Australia gets rid of its present financial burden. But were the money spent on railways and in opening up the country, how different would our position be! The Northern Territory is regarded as a huge burden, but it is a land of great possibilities, and requires only the building of railways and the providing of transport services by sea to become reproductive. I believe that the expenditure of &#163;2,000,000 or &#163;3,000,000 in the Federal Capital Territory would be a good investment from a commercial point of view. We cannot develop that Territory now, because of the shortage of money. Honorable members on both sides advocate the stoppage of expenditure in the Federal Capital Territory because of the shortage of money. We can ease our people of a heavy financial weight without danger to Australia, and secure tremendous advantages by the development of the interior if we divert this money from naval works to useful purposes. </para>
                    <para>I look forward almost with trepidation to the economic position which will follow this war. What are we going to do for the men who are coming back ? We have a repatriation scheme, and have voted money for repatriation, but no one has yet been courageous enough to fix a limit to what will be required, or to what we should pay. We are not prepared to say that repatriation shall cost us so much and no more. We recognise that whatever may be necessary must be found to properly treat and place the boys who come back from the war. What could we not do with the money that it is proposed to spend on naval bases and military works if it were devoted to repatriation purposes? No doubt the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> finds himself in serious difficulty at times because of the condition of the Treasury. It is essential that the funds at his command should not be pared down. On the contrary, they should be generous, so that the returned men may enjoy every opportunity. </para>

                    <para>. - When this Bi&#93;l was in Committee of Ways and Means a fairly general desire was expressed by honorable members that the load on certain classes of 3d. tickets should be lightened. Honorable members on both sides advanced the argument that the entertainments of children on Saturday afternoons should not be penalized at this stage of the war. I have given consideration to that matter, and although it will involve a loss of revenue, the amount of which is not easily determinable, I am about to suggest an amendment which I think will meet the objections of honorable members. It is as far as T can go, and when I say that, T think honorable members will recognise that it is not a matter of individual idiosyncrasy, but that the Treasurer has to carry a certain amount of responsibility for the preservation of the revenue at this time. I am anxious that the Committee shall recognise the amendment as a concession to what may be regarded as the legitimate entertainment of one section of the community, and not press foi&#39; any further concession. In that spirit, I move as an amendment - </para>

                    <para>- Honorable members on the Opposition side were courteous enough to inform me that they proposed to move certain amendments, and they sought my opinion. I was not prepared at that stage to give any definite advice, but after investigating the matter, I told them that, in my opinion, no amendment would be in order. The question raised is one of great importance, and, foreseeing the probability of this point arising, I took the opportunity of looking up various authorities and cases bearing on the matter, and, as a result of my studies of the principle involved, I desire to make the following statement to the Committee in giving my ruling. </para>

                <para>As regards the question of a right of a member to move in Committee on a Bill an amendment of rates of tax agreed to by a preliminary Ways and Means Committee, and adopted by the House, the latest decision on the subject is that given by a Temporary Chairman on the 20th September, 1917 <inline font-style="italic">(Votes and Proceedings,</inline> page 128), who ruled an amendment out of order on the ground that the question had been previously negatived by the Committee of Ways and Means when considering the resolutions on which the Bill was founded, and that the House has subsequently adopted the Committee&#39;s report. </para>

He further said that it was not in the province of the Committee to consider the policy embodied in the votes; the Committee had to consider the details of the Bill to see that they were correct.

Amendments &#39;to the Bill which _ are not covered by resolutions of the Committee of Ways and Means or other Committee of the whole House, are out of order. </para>

                <para class="block">It seems to <inline font-style="italic">me</inline> perfectly clear, from the foregoing extracts, that a Committee on a Bill cannot reverse or in any other way alter a decision of the previous Committee which has become a resolution of the House itself; otherwise, of course, no purpose would be served by considering in Committee of Ways and Means such a subject -as the present Entertainments Tax Bill. AH the time spent in that Committee in debating the proposal would be practically wasted if this Committee could re-open the whole subject and deal with it in quite a different way. It would mean that no finality would have been reached when the House adopted the report of the former Committee. Generally speaking, the parliamentary principle is that a Committee on a Bill cannot alter a matter agreed to by a previous Committee and adopted as a resolution by the House. I therefore rule that the amendment is not in order. </para>

                        <para>- I would vote for it in order to reduce the taxation on the children. If a child goes to a picture show forty times a year, paying in the aggregate 10s. for admission, it will have to pay 3s. 4d. as tax, whereas the tax upon a person who goes to a race, meeting and pays 10s. for a ticket is only lOd. The proposal is altogether inequitable. The Government are &#34;giving it&#34; to the children where the chicken &#34; got &#34; the axe, that is in the neck. </para>

                        <para>- I was no longer a member of that Government when the Entertainments Tax Bill was first framed, and had I been a member of a Government which proposed a tax like this, I would have opposed it.&#34; Apparently honorable members opposite have. made up their minds that they will vote for any tax proposed by the Government which they keep in office, even to the extent of levying per cent, -on threepenny tickets, although no alteration is proposed in regard to higher-priced tickets. The Treasurer has told us that the entertainments tax is expected to yield not more than &#163;205,000 this year, without this Bill, but that if this measure is passed an additional &#163;275,000 will be derived from the taxation of the lower-priced tickets. Estimates are sometimes framed on the highest scale. </para>

                        <para>- Last year the revenue from this tax was &#163;240,000. It is anticipated that there will be fewer entertainments this year, but that the taxation of the lower-priced tickets will considerably increase this amount. However, I object to the proposal to penalize the poorer sections of the community. I raised the same objection in regard to the increased postage rate. The Government have deliberately omitted to impose any increase in the cost of telegrams, telephones or lettergrams, but have increased the postage rate on letters, which are the means of communication used by the poorer sections of the community. Honorable members opposite all voted for the bachelor tax, with- the exception of the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lynch),</inline> who opposed the third reading of the Bill. In regard to this tax upon children&#39;s tickets, one or two of them opposed the second reading, so that they could say to their constituents, &#34; We were opposed to putting a tax of 33^ per cent, on children while we exempted all the farmers from the war-time profits tax.&#34; </para>

If honorable members opposite believe in the bachelor tax, why have they not the backbone to compel the Government to impose it? The Government propose to collect pennies from children while allowing men whom they regard as responsible for their being in office to get off with only 20 per cent, on land values. I do not .believe in the incidence of this taxation. It is not in the best interests of the community. </para>

To carry out the Government&#39;s proposal to its logical end, the girl who goes into a dressmaker&#39;s establishment should be asked to pay for the privilege of buying a dress; a person entering a butcher&#39;s shop should be asked to pay1d. a pound for the privilege of buying a pound of chops, and the person who enters a barber&#39;s shop should be asked to pay 1d. for permission to be the barber&#39;s customer. I do not think the Government have given proper consideration to this measure. They have simply asked the head of. a Department to map out a Bill, and have accepted it as submitted to them. It is not a logical measure to charge those who are least able to pay for amusements per cent., and ask those who can afford to pay for the higher-priced seats about a quarter of that percentage. Those who have handed down their names as statesmen have always made the taxation rest mostly upon those who had most to spend, and least upon those who had little. If a child attends a picture show every week in the year, paying 3d. on each occasion, it will be called upon to pay 17s. 4d., of which 4s. 4d. will be taxation. The thing is infamous. Talk about child snatchers! This is &#34; kid &#34; snatching. I ask the Government to withdraw the Bill, and make the incidence of the tax fairer. I must vote against the proposal to tax 3d. tickets to the extent of 33 per cent. If a vote of the people could have been taken upon this proposal, no Government would have dared to submit it. If the Government are determined to put a tax of 33 per cent, on 3d. tickets, let them make the tax proportionately heavier on the higher-priced tickets. I should have welcomed even the small concession which the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> was prepared to make, and I regret that our Standing Orders stood in the way of its submission. </para>

If they put a 33 per cent, tax on the 3d. tickets, it will be four times as heavy as that charged on 10s. tickets. We have a graduated system of taxation in connexion with the income tax and the land tax. </para>

                <para>We all recognise that the children of Melbourne and suburbs gave us a magnificent demonstration in connexion with the arrival of the French Mission in Melbourne. They gave what some members of the Mission told me was one of the finest shows they had seen in any part of the world. The children were brought out to entertain our distinguished visitors, and surely when they desire to go to an entertainment we do not wish to tax them. Their parents are not all rich people, and most of them cannot afford to pay big prices for an entertainment. The abolition of the tax on the lower-priced tickets would not involve any serious loss of revenue, and whatever loss did accrue could be made good in another direction. If the Treasurer will not withdraw the Bill, will he promise to have the amendment made in another place. </para>

                        <para>- I suggest that if those who provide films are in any doubt as to what will amuse the children, they might inquire of the honorable member, who, no doubt, would be prepared to provide films of his own. If an entertainment be provided such as is provided for children in my own electorate on Saturday afternoons, such a clause  a9  I suggest would meet the circumstances; it only requires a generous application. </para>

                    <para>.- After this little by-play, we ought to get down to serious business. The suggestion just made, coming from the quarter it does, has already had its proper value placed upon it. I shall not reiterate the arguments used against this clause, but simply say that I am with those who are against taxing the children. Without dealing with the amendment that has been ruled out of order, I may point out that the method suggested would only partially relieve the situation, and create a .bigger anomaly than there would be if we left the Bill as it is. All the children of the community do not live in the cities, and there are no matinees that I know of anywhere except in the cities.. The proposal that has been made would benefit only a certain section, and, while I would not oppose that section having a benefit, there is an element of unfairness to which I object. To confine this relief to Saturday afternoon entertainments would not relieve the children of the poor, because these matinees are mostly in places which the children of the poor never reach. The benefit would simply extend to those who can afford to pay, and_ be at the expense of those who would still have to pay the higher price under the amendment. We are informed that a considerable revenue will be lost if this clause be omitted altogether, and that very omission shows the inequity of taxing 3d. tickets. I hope that the Government, in their desire to afford relief, will act in such a way as to benefit not only one section, but all sections of the community. </para>

                    <para>.- It is with a good deal of regret that I rise to address myself to this question, because I feel it very keenly that in this National Parliament we have not a Government better able to manage the finances of the country. I made some remarks about &#34; financial muddlers,&#34; and those remarks are more than justified by the exhibition of this evening. The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kelly)</inline> has told us that we ought to deal with the . matter in a straightforward manner, and I agree with him. But why have not the Government and their experts - why has not the Government Caucus - dealt with it in a straightforward manner? We cannot think that a measure of this character was never brought before the Caucus. I was told the other day that the Labour Caucus is heaven, while that of the Liberal party is hell, so I suppose there must have been a hell of a noise when this particular  proposal was considered. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has put himself in a very humiliating position, and one not worthy of the Government which he leads. We always suppose that the Government give mature consideration to all taxation proposals before they are submitted, and yet Ave have now an attempt to justify the Government&#39;s position by a proposal to give the children an advantage of a two hours&#39; entertainment on the Saturday afternoon. It is quite evident that this is a class tax, and it is in an endeavour to remove the stigma which must attach to a Government proposing a measure of the kind that we have this amendment suggested by the Leader of the House. As a matter of fact, the action of the  Chairman  of Committees in ruling the amendment out of order is a perfect god-send to the Government, seeing that it has saved them from further humiliation, and from making themselves a laughing-stock. It is pitiable to find the head of the Government, and the Government itself, so devoid of financial ability. Why did the Government not come down, first of all, with other proposals on the business-paper, such as the land tax and the income tax. No. They prefer to test the House on a proposal to tax the children of the poor to the extent of 33-J per cent. When I find the Government &#39; of a Democracy submitting a taxation proposal to penalize the children, I &#39;begin to ask myself whether I did not make a mistake when, in the early days, I strove to secure the reform of one man one vote. We know that the children have no votes; but I believe that the impression which this legislation will have upon the adults of Australia will be such that, at the next election, the Government responsible foi it. will be sent into the cold shades of Opposition. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I am not anxious to secure a seat in this House as the result of the faults of the Government; but I am anxious that the little children, who receive .so much instruction from these picture shows, shall not be deprived of the opportunity to attend them. I am anxious that our children, in the coming generation, shall maintain the high standard set up by our Australian troops abroad, which has made Australia a model for other countries to follow. I desire that my grand children shall have better opportunities than I had, and I certainly never thought that it would be necessary for me to stand up in the National Parliament of this country to protest against the imposition of a 33-J per cent, tax on children&#39;s entertainment tickets. </para>
                <para>The supporters of the Government have, during the last four years, had quite unusual opportunities to secure a due contribution to the revenue of the country from those who possess wealth. It is the persons who have made phenomenal profits during the war who should be called upon to bear the bulk of the taxation which the war has rendered necessary. There is not a Government in any other country in the world that has left undone those things which ought to be done in the way that this Government has. I said some time ago that the time has arrived in Australia for the adoption of a systematic method of dealing with our finances. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> seemed to agree with my statement, and the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce Smith)</inline> said he was glad to find that there were honorable members on this side who believed in such a thing as systematic financing. We have muddled through with quite unimportant things in this House, and have not given the finance question, which is the greatest of all questions in government, the attention it deserves. The press organs supporting the party opposite, and especially the Melbourne newspapers, have been hammering at the Government day after day in the endeavour to induce them to adopt scientific methods of finance. We have piled up a loan indebtedness of &#163;600,000,000, and the Government are still asking for more loan money; and now they propose, in order to raise the revenue necessary to pay the interest on our loans, that there shall be a 33-J per cent, tax upon little children&#39;s tickets. This proposal is on a par with that submitted by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jensen)</inline> to deal with the tobacco industry by the imposition of an additional licence-fee. </para>
                <para>It has been pointed out by the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> that much of this taxation will have to be paid by the children of our soldiers. It may be said that the bulk of the taxation proposed by the Government will have to be borne by our soldiers. If they are prepared to go on with this measure, they will be only putting another nail in their political coffins, and perhaps I should rejoice at that. At the last elections no honorable member on the Government side would have dared to say from a public platform that if the party he supported got into power, they would impose a tax on the entertainment tickets of little children. This is a proposal for which the Government has received no mandate from the electors, and it is really an evasion of their election pledges which, in my opinion, constitutes a serious crime. I am convinced that the stand I am taking in opposition to this Bill will meet with the approbation of the people. </para>
                <para>The Government may, in this matter, hope that something will be done in another place to save the situation. I am one of those who believe that the Senate is not entitled to interfere with taxation. In the New South Wales Constitution, which is the oldest Constitution of any British Dominion Outside that of the United Kingdom, and which was framed at a time when there was a property qualification, when the principle of one man one vote had not been adopted, and there was no Labour party, it was laid down that the Legislative Assembly should alone have the power to tax the people. Although provision was made for a second Chamber under that Constitution, care was taken that it should not have the power to interfere with taxation. The power of the Senate is limited in the same way, and the Government cannot transfer their responsibility to that Chamber. It may happen that, having the next elections in view, the Government majority in the Senate may deal with this measure in such a way as to preserve the existence of the Government. </para>
                <para>I believe that honorable members on this side are justified in interposing every possible obstacle to the passing of this measure. It is quite true that we may be &#34;gagged&#34; if we attempt to do so; but we should stand up against this proposal. The price of wool has gone up from 6&#189;d. to 15d. per lb. ; our flocks have risen in value by from 50 per cent, to 100 per cent. ; farmers, who, at one time, were glad to get 2s. per bushel for their wheat, are now receiving 4s. 9d. per bushel. </para>

                        <para>- I was endeavouring to show that this is a quite unnecessary tax. If the Government were able to say that they had exhausted every other means of raising revenue, and were, therefore, compelled to tax the children, there might be some justification for this measure; but we know well that they have not exhausted other means of taxation. In Great Britain it was found that the taxation of luxuries was a mistake, and that the proper course to adopt was to tax incomes, so that people would not have money to spend upon luxuries. That is the scientific way of dealing with the matter. It is certainly more scientific than this proposal to tax children, and the increased postage rate which has been adopted. These miserable attempts to deal with the finances of Australia make me shudder. The Treasury bench is occupied by men who have no true conception of sound principles of taxation. They are satisfied to tax the poor man&#39;s tobacco and his beer. I hold that the Government have unexampled opportunities for levying taxation at the present time, and that it is nothing short of folly to delay effective action in this regard until the incomes of the people have been materially reduced, as they will be, after the termination of the war. Whatever may be the opinion of honorable members opposite regarding my utterances, I have expressed my views on this Bill with the utmost candour, in the hope that I shall rouse them to a full sense of their responsibilities, and cause them to devote greater attention in the future to economic questions. Not only in Australia, but in every part of the Empire, an attempt is being made to devise a more scientific method of taxation. </para>

                    <para>.- The Acting Prime Minister  (Mi-.  &#34;Watt) has submitted a. proposal which he affirms is a great concession to the opponents of this Bill. What is that concession ? Picture shows are open on six nights a week, and he wishes to abandon the tax of Id. upon tickets for the admission of children on Saturday afternoons, that is, at matinees. Now, in my own district half of the picture shows do not open on Saturday afternoons. The attendances are largest at the evening performances. Consequently, the alleged concession is no. concession at all. </para>

                        <para>- My own view is that the concession is not worth consideration. But if the Government desired to amend their own Bill, surely they should have been satisfied, before submitting the amendment, that it was perfectly in order. The honorable member for Capricornia, as an old parliamentary hand, was quite justified in raising the point of order which he did. </para>

                    <para>.- If the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> does not know how to carry on the business of this Chamber he must be taught. He ought to be familiar with our Standing Orders. Had I consented to the procedure which he endeavoured to adopt, my action might have recoiled upon me at some future period. But if the honorable gentleman is in earnest in his proposal to exempt children who are apparently under twelve years of age, he can withdraw this Bill and submit a fresh measure within the course of a few minutes. We all know perfectly well that in connexion with almost every taxation measure it is customary to appoint a Committee of two Ministers to prepare and bring in a Bill giving effect to the resolution of this Chamber. No difficulty need be experienced in that connexion, but from the expressions of honorable members opposite one can gather how&#34; afraid they are of meeting the mothers of the children whose picture-show tickets they  aTe  prepared to tax. Consequently, they now desire to shield themselves behind the point of order which I raised, and which it  waa  my duty to take. That will form a very flimsy shield for their action in endeavouring to tax the children of the poor. It has been rightly said that there is great anxiety on the part of the Government to pass this measure to tax children 33 per cent. But what has become of the proposals to raise the income tax? And are we to hear nothing more of the proposition for increasing the land tax? I do not think the amendment foreshadowed by the Government is of great importance. Where there may be 10,000 children who would reap some benefit by that concession, there are 100,000 children who would secure concession if the amendment were accepted as was proposed at an earlier stage. I emphatically protest against the Bill. </para>

                    <para>.- The incidence of this tax is unequal, bearing, as it does, too heavily on the smaller ticket. It is disproportionate; the Government have admitted that by the proposed amendment.

                    <para>. - Under the present system, where tickets of a denomination of1s. are taxed, the Government provides those tickets free of cost to the picture show proprietors. I understand that, for some reason best known to himself, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> did not care to receive a deputation from master printers and others on this subject. But I would like him to take this factor into consideration, because the Government will now be required to print hundreds of thousands more tickets. The latter are printed at the Government Printing Office, and all are practically of uniform colour, which fact is apt to lend itself to considerable fraud upon the picture show people. </para>

                <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                <para>The Distillation Act, like the Excise Act and the Beer Excise Act, is one of the original measures passed by the Federal Parliament. Experience in administration has revealed defects which have accumulated to such an extent as to render it highly desirable that, to facilitate business, the Act should be amended. The amendments proposed are mostly in the direction of granting increased facilities to distillers and the public generally. The amendments made by clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill provide, for example, for the exemption of stills not exceeding one gallon capacity from the provisions of the Act in regard to licensing, &#38;c. The Act requires that any chemist or student desiring to purchase and use a small glass still for scientific or experimental purposes must obtain permission to purchase and a licence to use such still. There are great numbers of these experimental stills in operation, and their use does not endanger the revenue. Owing to the cost of running them and the small capacity for output, their product could not possibly affect the Excise receipts. The present requirements have resulted in much friction and inconvenience to the public, and it is proposed to exempt such stills from the provisions of the Act. Provision has also been made for an extension, in proper cases, of the period within which application for renewal of a licence and the payment of the annual fee may be made. Under the present Act, should a fee not be paid by the 31st December in each year, the licence and the security bond given in respect thereto both lapse, necessitating fresh application for a licence and fresh security. The Christmas and New Year holidays, coming just before the date on which the fee becomes payable, frequently result in the matter being overlooked by the licensee, and while the . formalities then necessary before a new licence can be issued are most irritating, inconvenient and expensive, in view of the very serious consequences to the revenue that would be involved in any informality in the matter, the Department cannot afford to waive in any degree a strict compliance with the terms of the Act. The provision now made for an extension of the period will overcome this trouble, and is inserted wholly in the interests of the distillers and vignerons concerned. Provision has also been made to overcome  difficulties in the way of distillers who desire to transact business not contemplated or provided for when the original Act was drafted. For instance, under the existing Act, a distiller, when forwarding his goods under bond to another district or State, can do so to a licensed Customs warehouse at such destination only. This may prove highly inconvenient, as he may desire to remove his goods to some port where the purchaser will pay duty on the goods as landed at the ship&#39;s side, thus obviating the expense of transfer to a licensed Customs warehouse. The amendment proposed will make this possible. Another restriction in the existing Act which is being modified is that requiring every pipe or tube used in a distillery, when placed below the surface of the ground, to be enclosed in a wooden case capable of being readily opened, so that the pipe or tube may be exposed to view. An amendment is being proposed in clause 10, to enable the Comptroller-General, in special cases, where no possible danger to the revenue is involved, to waive this requirement. The opportunity has been taken, when these matters are being dealt with, of affecting other amendments of a minor character which will have the effect of facilitating the administration of the measure. </para>

                    <para class="block">Two important amendments only are contained  in  this Bill. The first relates to the improper use of methylated spirits. Apart from its use for human consumption, in the form of potable spirits and alcoholic beverages, and in medicines, &#38;c, alcohol is used very largely in the arts and manufactures. Whilst the use of alcohol for human consumption is a proper subject for taxation, and is so dealt with in the Customs and Excise Tariffs, it is necessary for the welfare of industry that alcohol for industrial purposes shall, subject to a proper safeguarding of the revenue, be made available as freely and cheaply as possible. For the protection of the revenue, therefore, spirit for industrial and scientific purposes is made available free of Excise duty when denatured by admixture with certain nauseous and poisonous substances, which render it unfit for drinking or internal use. Whilst the spirit so denatured (or methylated, as it is commonly called) is free of Excise duty, the untreated spirit is subject to an Excise duty of 16s. per proof gallon. It will be apparent, therefore, that the substitution of the methylated for the untreated spirit would be a highly profitable transaction for any dishonest person. The denaturing substance mostly used is wood naphtha, the principal active constituent of which is methyl alcohol. . T,he presence of methyl alcohol in any substances can be readily detected by chemical analysis, and is <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> evidence of the use of methylated spirits. In a recent prosecution brought by the Department in connexion with the use of methylated spirits in the preparation of a medicine for human use, the evidence submitted to the Court showed the presence of methyl alcohol, the chief constituent of wood naphtha. The Court ruled, however, that as methyl  alcohol,  though the. chief, was only one of the constituent parts of wood naphtha, and that as wood naphtha was the methylating substance mentioned in the regulations, the evidence showed only that part of a methylating substance was present, and for this reason the prosecution failed. As this decision breaks down the main defence of the revenue against the improper use of methylated spirits for purposes for which  exciseable  spirits should properly be used, the Act is being amended by altering the definition of &#34; methylating substance to include not only any principal substance specified in a regulation as a methylating material, but also any fractional part or ingredient of any such substance. The amendments relating to this matter are contained in clauses 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The other amendment is concerned with the safeguarding of the standard and reputation of Australian brandy. The Spirits Act provides that any spirit described as brandy must have been distilled wholly from grape wine. In the ordinary acceptation of the. term, grape wine is regarded as wine obtained by the fermentation of the juice of crushed grapes. It has been found, however, that it might also be construed to mean the product obtained by treating currants or raisins with water and fermenting the solution. The amendments proposed in clauses <inline font-style="italic">2d</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">e,</inline> and in clause 3, remove all ambiguity in the matter by defining brandy as having been made from &#34;wine the fermented juice of fresh grapes.&#34; The other amendments contained in the Bill are of a minor character, and require no comment at this stage. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to bring under notice the recent election in connexion with the Committee of the Commonwealth Button Fund. I met the other day <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Woolcott,</inline> a lady to whom I have spoken only once in the last three years, but who has done splendid work, as every honorable member who has watched the fund from its inception must know. She was honoured by the King with a title that she very well deserved. She was in control of the fund from its commencement, but for some strange reason she was treated with scant courtesy at the recent election held in the Melbourne Town Hall. I desire as the member for Melbourne to thank the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> for nominating her with <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Deakin</inline> to be on the Committee. Old politicians like myself could get some hints as to trickery or guile in the way of elections from the particular election I have referred to, if we so desired. I have here a card giving a list of eighteen names as a ticket for election, as follows: - <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. James</inline> Alston, Councillor H. J. Barcelo, Councillor J. Dennis, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Campbell</inline> Douglas, Councillor R. J. Hardy, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. V.</inline> E. Henderson, Lady Hennessy, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A</inline> Harston, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Levy, Mr. W.</inline> J. Murrells, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> B. McCutcheon, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> E. O&#39;Connell, Councillor Edward O&#39;Donnell. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. J.</inline> K Troup, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> S. Woolcott, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. A.</inline> S. Woolcott, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Winter,</inline> and Councillor J. Waxman. On that list only <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wax-</inline> man and <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Alston</inline> managed to secure election. Some have informed me that their names were put on the ticket without their permission. Another ticket, which was successful in returning sixteen out of the eighteen members of the Committee required was as follows: - <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Brodie</inline> Ainsley, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Herbert</inline> Brookes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. W.</inline> W. Cabena, Alderman W. W. Cabena, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Callaghan, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> Fink, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Fairley,. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Hewison, Mr. H.</inline> M. Lee, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Leeper, Mr. W.</inline> A. Love, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> J. Roberts, Councillor F. J. Skinner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Carty</inline> Salmon, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. J.</inline> T. Staughton, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> J. G. Turner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williamson,</inline> and Councillor Willis. Of that list, the only two who failed to secure election were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Fairley and <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Hewison.</inline> I understand that afterwards the Committee formed an executive committee of nine, and immediately elected as vice-presidents the two who had been rejected at the five-shilling ticket election that had been held. Thus I maintain that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fairley</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Hewison</inline> were brought in by a subterfuge. There is not a single representative of the workers on the Committee as elected. One of the successful candidates has a financial past that would make many people doubt whether he is a suitable individual to be there. I make that statement with a full knowledge of the seriousness of what I am saying. He has a great power in the press, and has seen fit to use what I might call his curly-wig style to secure his objects. Although in the past he has thanked me for having enabled him to get into Parliament, I most strongly resent what was done at this election, on behalf of everybody concerned. From the very first days of the war I have asked that all these funds should be under the control of the Audit Department. I repeat that now, knowing as I do, that men have been prosecuted in New South Wales for defalcations. I strongly resent what has been done in connexion with the button fund, and will not let the matter rest where it is. I believe that the Acting Prime Minister sent a letter to the Town Hall giving the names of the two people who were to be put on the Committee as representatives of the Commonwealth Government, but I am told that the Lord Mayor, who should have withdrawn those two names from the election, did not do so, although he knew what was in the Acting Prime Minister&#39;s letter, nor did he let those in the Hall know it. I understand that the State Government have nominated two members to the Committee - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Solly</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norman</inline> Bayles, and that the latter has declined to act. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Solly</inline> is the only representative of the party I belong to on the Committee, although there should, of course, be no parties in this matter. I mention it merely to show that the people in whom I have the most confidence have been nominated by the Federal and State Governments. I hope what I am saying now will be made public. I do not want to take the platform on the matter, for fear of injuring a good cause, but I am not content with the Committee as elected. I call it a fake Committee, elected in a faked way. I am not saying anything against the present Lord Mayor of Melbourne, in whom I have full confidence. </para>

Why should the ladies and young girls who stood in the wind and rain through all seasons to do this good work be asked just at the time of the election, in order to put a certain party into power, to pay 5s. each to secure the right to vote? Surely after giving their services day after day they should have been entitled to a vote! The Federal franchise system could have been adopted, if necessary. The gentleman I indicated previously is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> Fink. </para>

It is not clear from the Minister&#39;s answer whether either of those faiths has been responsible for the practice of any deceit to evade the payment of passage money. We are entitled to know the facts, because if there has been any deceit or fraud practised,  no matter what church is concerned, the persons responsible should be severely punished. </para>

                            <para>. -  Have any complaints reached the Department of Defence about the conduct of the Citizens Camp at Liverpool? I have had the most serious complaints from a very wide area about the way in which these young men have been treated, and the distaste for military service and militarism generally that has been instilled into them by reason of the conduct of the Camp. The matter comes to me from men in such authority that, in the interests of compulsory service, a full inquiry should be held by some officer not concerned in the arrangements for the Camp. </para>
