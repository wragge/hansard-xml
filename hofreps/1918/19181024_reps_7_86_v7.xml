                    <para>- Last week I called attention to the probable effect of a new regulation issued under the War Precautions Act, which requires the written consent of the Treasurer to the construction or erection of buildings. I then expressed the view that the regulation might be held to apply to the erection of buildings intended for homes, which are urgently needed at the present time; but the Minister for Works  and  Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> expressed the view that it did not so apply. I have since received a communication from the solicitor to a building society, who points out that building societies and land companies erect houses for sale, and fears that . this regulation is meant to apply to such buildings. If the Acting Prime Minister could make a statement on the subject, it would dispel certain doubts. </para>

                        <para>- In reply to a question asked by me some time ago, a statement was presented showing the distribution of War Loan advertisements. It was generally agreed by honorable members that it would be too expensive to print the information in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and the Acting Prime Minister promised to make available to each member a copy of it. Can I have my copy to-day? I would remind the honorable gentleman that this is Grievance Day. </para>

I then pointed out that the New South Wales Government had, early this year, provided homes at peppercorn Tents for such widows, and suggested that, in order to stimulate the State Governments generally to assist in this work, information as to what had been done in the various States should be set out in the shape of a return.

                        <para>- I desire to ask a question about the overseas shipment of meat under Imperial contracts. For some time past shipments have been confined mainly to Queensland, where the supplies were plentiful. Now, however, conditions have altered, and there is an exportable surplus in other States. Will the Acting Prime Minister make representations with a view to assuring those concerned that the available space will be equitably apportioned amongst the States, particularly to Victoria, where there have been no shipments for some time, and stocks are fast accumulating? </para>

                            <para>- After a .conversation I was privileged to have with the honorable member yesterday on the matter, I have been able, in consultation with the shipping authorities of the Commonwealth  and the agricultural authorities of the States this morning, to ascertain the exact position so far as they are able to tell it to me. It appears that the market is suffering from a great deal of fear - I speak of the Victorian market for mutton and lambs chiefly - that drought conditions will force sales, and that there will be no possibility of either shipments or cold storage. That, as it appears tq me, is almost an obsession on the part of many producers. So far as I have been able to ascertain, there is in the cold stores of Victoria a total theoretic available capacity for 1,600,000 carcasses, as we at present store them in cut condition. There is roughly a fourth of that space, representing 400,000 carcasses, occupied, leaving three-fourths, or space for about 1,200,000 carcasses, unoccupied. So far as the authorities of the State of Victoria are able to ascertain, that is being filled, or will be filled in the next month or so, if conditions continue as they are, at the rate of 160,000 carcasses per week. It is estimated, therefore, that, if no relief in shipment takes place, the stores will be filled by about the middle of December. The shipping arrangements are such, according to promises already made of insulated space for this part of Australia, that that time may be extended by shipping relief to about the middle of January. That is as far as we can see ahead now; but, after considering all the facts elicited by my inquiries this morning, I have cabled to the Prime Minister asking him to do two things - first, to ascertain if it will not be possible in Britain to get more insulated space for Australia, in view of the seasonable and possible drought pressure; and, secondly, to see whether it is not possible to get mutton sent to Egypt. I do not know whether honorable members quite appreciate the difficulty in this connexion. So far, we have been able to ship only beef, which is the ration for the British Army. It seems extraordinary that men reared on sheep should be compelled to eat beef ; and I see no reason why mutton should not form a part of the rations in Egypt and Mesopotamia. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is able to do what I have suggested, it will relieve the situation a great deal, without prejudicing the beef districts of Australia. I expect to get the Prime Minister's reply inside a week. </para>

                    <para>Mr.WATT. - I caused further inquiries to be made shortly before lunch, and I now have information to the effect that the calculation of 160,000 carcasses per week, upon which the date to the middle of December is based, is in excess of the actual capacity; that is to say, the killing capacity of the trade, in respect of both labour and space, will be much below that figure. </para>

It is plain that that number cannot be slaughtered and dealt with, and that will mean an extension of the calculated date by possibly a month or more. That should give further assurance to the holders of stock. </para>

                        <para>- The Government has fixed the maximum price for meat. It was not intended to follow the market in every fluctuation, but to fix twice a year a maximum price between given dates in the export and non-export season. Pending the co-ordination of frozen and canned prices I do not anticipate any adjustment of existing maximum rates. </para>

                        <para>The question of whether a new applicant can be connected depends, in many cases, on the daily load curve of the supply undertaking, and is a technical one on which the chief engineer is best able to judge, but no objection will be taken to the chief engineer consulting fully with his council before making decisions, and it is, in fact, presumed that in cases of doubt as to whether an applicant should be connected or not, this is done. Moreover, the council has control over its own, officers. </para>
                        <para>Most supply undertakings constituted under a State law are not allowed by such law to discriminate, but no breach of the law is involved in this case, as the War Precautions regulations legalize the actions taken under them. </para>
                        <para>The authority given under the War Precautions regulations to the chief engineer enables him to conserve existing unused capacity (if any), and any capacity resulting from the installation of new plant during the continuation of the regulations for purposes of national or economical importance. </para>
                        <para>In the case of refusal to connect, an appeal to a Director of Munitions is provided for in the regulations, and in this way it is felt that no industry really essential is likely to be refused a supply of current. </para>
                        <para>The regulations, as far as is known, have not in any way increased the difficulties of the Sydney Council, as is implied by this question, but it is known that for a lengthy period before the War Precautions regulations were passed on the 18th September, the Sydney Municipal Council, of its own accord, had refused to connect a large number of consumers owing to shortage of power, plant, and essential apparatus. </para>
                        <para> In fact, the shortage in Sydney was one of the determining factors which led the Government to give powers of discrimination under the War Precautions regulations, so that industries which should get power would not suffer  at  the expense of consumers who could, without serious inconvenience, dispense with additional connexions. </para>
                        <para>The Sydney Council, not having had for a considerable time sufficient generating plant, and having, long before the incidence of the regulations, imposed of its own accord restrictions on new connexions, it is not understood how the War Precautions regulations can either inconvenience or hamper the industries of Sydney, as their sole object is to enable a supply to be given to essential industries. </para>
                        <para>Generally, in connexion with the whole matter raised by these questions, it is desired to point out that a conference of the supply engineers of the six capital cities was recently called, and, as a result of that conference,  a  schedule of requirements for new plant for  a  period of about two years was drawn up, "and  the Commonwealth Government is now in communication with the Ministry of Munitions in England, through the High Commissioner, with a view to - </para>

                        <para>Twelve copies of each application for priority certificate are required to meet the requirements of the British Ministry of Munitions. The Ministry of Munitions, through the High Commissioner, asked that four copies of each application should be forwarded, together with a duplicate set by second mail, in case the first set was lost. This makes eight copies. One copy is filed in the office of the Director of Munitions, and three copies are sent to the applicants. The High Commissioner hands three of his copies to the Ministry of Munitions. The Ministry of Munitions indorses the decisions on the application and disposes of the three copies as follows: - </para>
                        <para>One duly indorsed copy is filed in the office of the Ministry of Munitions. </para>
                        <para>One duly indorsed copy is returned to the High Commissioner. </para>
                        <para>One duly indorsed copy is sent to the agent, manufacturer, or buyer in Great Britain. </para>
                        <para>The four duplicate copies are forwarded to the High Commissioner by second mail, in case the original mail has been lost in transit. Of the three copies returned to the applicants, one is for their file and two for forwarding by successive mails to the manufacturers or to their principals or buyers in Great Britain. The application forms take the place of letters between the Directorate of Munitions and the High Commissioner, between the High Commissioner and the Ministry of Munitions, and between the Ministry of Munitions and the buyers or agents in Great Britain. There is, therefore, really a considerable economy in paper. The fact that duplicates have to be sent by the second mail accounts, of course, for five of the copies. </para>

                        <para>. - I am diffident about approaching a matter that I wish to bring before the House, but I feel that ' it is my duty to do so. We are expecting a number of Anzacs to arrive in Australia, very shortly, and the community are considering what shall be done to afford them a fitting welcome'; but if the arrangements are anything like those for the reception which has hitherto been accorded to men who have returned from the Front, the Anzacs will not have very strong feelings of regard for those who receive them. An individual named Commander Brewis is in control of the embarkation and disembarkation of soldiers. He has carried out this task for some time, yet he is the most unsuitable man who could be in charge of it. Unfortunately. the position is complicated by reason of the fact that the Commander is controlled by the Naval Department, whereas the soldiers with .whom he is dealing are controlled by the Military Department. When one endeavours to secure better facilities for welcoming soldiers on their arrival he is met by the dual control of the two Departments. I admit that the Departments have endeavoured to meet my representations, but I have never been able to get any redress from the autocratic and imbecile actions of this individual who is in control of embarkation and disembarkation work. Finally, I have had to appeal to the Acting Prime Minister. and the reply I received from him was that nothing could be done. Naturally my request was forwarded to Commander Brewis, and equally naturally his reply was that no better arrangement could be made. I advise honorable members to go- to Port Melbourne on a day on which soldiers are embarking or disembarking. There is always an enormous crowd of wives, children, and other dependants, as well as friends and relatives, of the men, and it is not an easy matter to make proper arrangements for dealing with them, although a great improvement could be effected by using a little common sense. The people all gather in one long row, and they remain seated there for hours. </para>

                            <para>-- The same difficulty would .arise there. The .people take their meals with them, and sit down and wait for hours until the soldiers disembark. I have been at Port Melbourne on two occasions when boats leaving for the Front got away before the friends and relatives of the men could get down the pier, but this, we are told, cannot be avoided. On one occasion I saw two vessels leaving the wharf at the same time. The friends of the departing soldiers had no informa- ti on as to the particular boat on which they would find their dear ones, and when the gates were thrown open women and children rushed pell-mell down the" wharf in a frantic effort to locate them. Many could not do so and became hysterical. Sometimes the friends of the soldiers are not on the wharf for more than five or ten minutes before the steamer casts off. </para>

                    <para class="block">If the man who controls the arrangements will have no regard for their feelings the Department should make a change. This officer says that without discipline it would be impossible to control the crowd. We all recognise that, but my contention is that more common sense might well be displayed in carrying out the arrangements. Is it fair that the friends and relatives of soldiers leaving for the Front should be kept behind a barricade nearly a quarter of a mile from the point at which the outgoing vessel is berthed ? </para>

Iri that assertion he displays his own lack of ability. It may be said that I am taking an unfair advantage of this man, since he cannot reply to me; but I am not dealing as unfairly with him as he deals with the friends and relatives of soldiers leaving for the Front.

                    <para>To illustrate the attitude he takes up, I would mention that quite recently a deputation of ladies, representing the Port Melbourne Reception Committee, waited on me to complain that, although they were temperance workers, he had charged them with taking intoxicating liquors to the men. These ladies, who are doing a magnificent work, were naturally indignant. They do their best to deliver as quickly as possible to the soldiers as they come ashore the little comforts they have for them ; but no proper provision is made for their convenience. These ladies are not all supporters of mine ; many of them for years have voted against me, and no doubt will continue to do so. I recognise, however, that they are doing good work, and it is up to me and to Commander Brewis, as well as others, to assist rather than to retard their efforts. They have spent thousands of pounds in providing comforts for the soldiers. They are placed in a sort of enclosure distinct from that in which the friends and relatives of returning soldiers have to wait, but when the rush takes place their catering arrangements are completely upset. They asked to be given a place where they could avoid the rush, but this request was refused by Commander Brewis. They provide comforts for the returned soldiers of every State, and it would be an easy matter for this " Kaiser " to provide them with better facilities to carry out their work in connexion with the disembarkation of our troops. </para>

                            <para>- There can be no doubt of that. These ladies leave their home duties, and wait hour after hour on the wharf to welcome returning soldiers. Very often a vessel does not arrive at the advertised time, but the ladies remain on duty ready to provide the men with small comforts, and to give them a welcome home. My attack is not directed particularly against the present Government; the same trouble existed when the Labour party were in power, and even then I could secure no redress. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> the present Minister, was also Minister for Defence in the Labour Administration..

                    <para>If this trouble occurs every time a few men return, is it not likely to be accentuated when large bodies of troops are returning week after week, and, perhaps, day after day? We shall have to obtain the services of another disembarkation officer when the troops are returning in numbers, because I am satisfied that Commander Brewis will not be able to cope with the work. He has, indeed, shown no aptitude for it. I admit that without control of the crowd there would be absolute chaos, and it is possible that up to a certain point the authority rests, not with Commander Brewis but with others. If that is so, he should tell us; but knowing him by repute as well as by experience I throw upon him the responsibility. The Minister for Defence should long ago have removed him from his present office if the Navy </para>
                    <para>Department was not prepared to do so. It has been stated that the returning Anzacs are not to be disembarked at Port Melbourne; but, no matter where they are landed, if there is 4he same lack of facilities for their reception as has been evident at Port Melbourne, the result will be chaos, because it has to be borne in mind that not merely friends and relations of the returned Anzacs, but a great body of the community will be present at that disembarkation to show the feeling of the people towards the Anzacs. I warn the Government not to leave the  arrangements  for the disembarkation of the Anzacs in the hands of the gentleman who now controls the disembarkation of returning soldiers. If they do, they will have trouble, and they will deserve the condemnation which will follow. 1 wish to say a few words with respect to the treatment of persons looking after the orphan children of soldiers at the Front. A man may enlist, and leave behind him a wife in good health, and three or four children, and after he has left Australia his wife may die. I can instance one case where a soldier left behind him a wife and three boys of 11, 12, and 13 years of age. . The. mother died, and her relations took charge of the- boys. When the mother was alive, she received 28s. a week from her husband, ,14s. separation allowance, and 10s. 6d. per week, or 3s. 6d. for each -of the children. All that her relations, who are now looking after the children, are allowed to keep them is 30s. per week, or 10s. per week for each child. There is no one in Australia who can keep a growing boy of thirteen years of age, feed him', clothe him, and house him for 10s. per week. In this case, the woman W.10 has taken charge of these boys has naturally some feeling for them as a relation, but she. has other obligations of her own to meet. Is it a fair thing that the Government of this country should ask a woman to assist in keeping the children of a soldier who is fighting for us at the Front? In these circumstances, if all the wives of men at the Front were to die, the Government would snake money out of their deaths. T de not say that' the Government approached the consideration of this matter from that stand-point, but that is the actual  position  all the same. The woman who has to look after these children should receive the same amount as the mother received to look after them. </para>

                            <para>- I may inform the honorable gentleman that I have made such applications in thirty different cases, and not one of them has been granted. If the local patriotic committee think fit, they may allow a certain amount to the woman taking charge of a soldier's children in such . circumstances. Unfortunately, it is sometimes the case that the women composing local patriotic committees, though they mean well, have a somewhat extraordinary idea as to the amount of money upon which another woman can keep a house. They would not apply the same conditions to themselves. I- might be allowed to say, in passing, that if we hand over the wellbeing of women to other women, we shall not get the results we desire.  I know that in very few cases of this kind assistance is given by Local Committees. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. It is_ the duty of the Government to look after this matter. To have to look after three boys of 11, 12, and 13 years of age is alone enough work for any one woman. There are some people who believe that a woman can look after a family and go out and work as well, but I am sure there is no member of this House who will say that 30b. a week is sufficient in these times fca keep three growing; boys, and clothe and educate them. You could purchase a suit for a lad of thirteen years of age for 25s. some time ago, but you could not do it for twice that amount to-day. It is the duty of the Government to see that no cause for complaint on this score shall continue to exist. The Government have no right to make money out of the deaths of the wives of soldiers. The sooner they look into this- matter, the better for their credit and for the relatives of men fighting at the Front. </para>

The Government cannot make people believe that there is any difference in the feeling of mothers.  It is probable that as the mothers of ex-nuptial sons have had such a fight in life for them, they, are more endeared to them on that account. Under the Pensions Act, these mothers are not allowed the same pensions as are the widowed mothers of sons born in wedlock. It is a disgrace to us that this should be so. I have made complaints on the subject to the Treasurer and the Treasury officials, and certain promises have been made. </para>

I do not blame the present Government for it any more than I do the members of the House, but it exists, and ought to be obviated. There are not three members in the House but would say that these mothers deserve to be placed in the same category as a widowed mother. If anything is to be done it should be done quickly. If an alteration of the Pensions Act is necessary, let it be made. I think there is sufficient scope in the powers of the Commissioner to enable him to do what is necessary, if the Treasurer says that the Government are willing. </para>

                    <para class="block">Maxwell) was brought to me before he was elected. A sergeant of police and his wife reared a son of the wife's late sister from six weeks old. When he grew up, he was in a bank at Donald, Victoria, earning enough to keep himself decently. He went to the Front when the call came, and was there three years. Two years after he left, the foster-father died. The lad then began to assist his foster-mother. There had been no need for this before, although he had always left certain money to be drawn by her, which she had been banking for him. When her husband died, she found that her financial position was not as good as she had expected, and she had to use the money allowed by her foster-son to live on, instead of banking it for him. He was killed, but because she was not dependent on him when he went away, she can get no pension. If he had been here to-day, he would have been keeping her, yet the Department will not recognise her claim. It seems incredible to people outside that these cases should exist, but it is so. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins,</inline> the Pensions Commissioner, always meets one as far as he thinks he ought to go. He has certain powers and can exercise his own judgment to a great degree. I have induced him to see eye to eye with me on many occasions, and he has established precedents which were not thought to come technically within the Act when it was passed, so that I am making no complaint against him. After all, he is only an official, and has a certain responsibility regarding expenditure. He may feel that he ought not to depart from well-defined lines; but we in this House make the laws, and must consider these questions. Will anybody claim that that foster-mother is not entitled to relief ? The young fellow did not know that she was not his mother until he was going to the Front. </para>

                            <para>- In this case the foster-mother was not dependent on the man when he left. If the war had not taken place, however, she would have been now living in the same house as her foster-son, because he would have carried out his obligations. Now she cannot get a pension, because she was not dependent on him before he left, and because she is not in penury. If she could have proved that she had not a cent she might have received some assistance, although even then not as a right. To all intents and purposes, she is really a widowed mother, and should be treated as such. These matters will have to be considered by some Government at some time, and, to my mind, action ought to be taken at once, as the numbers of such cases will continually grow. </para>

                    <para>We have heard a good deal of the question of the stoppage of pay to dependants because of the desertion of the breadwinners at the Front. I understand that the State 'Governments have decided not  to contribute half the amount. They are quite justified. I have always said that the States try to grab from the Federation all they possibly can, and that the State Departments which perform work for the Commonwealth Government have always got their full .pound of flesh and something more, regarding the Federal Government as a good milch cow. But there is no doubt that on this question it was the Federal Government that tried to throw on the State Governments the onus of something that it should have paid for itself, because it has the whole control of the war. The Commonwealth has reduced the borrowing capacity and the sphere of taxation of the States, yet it is now trying to throw on the State ' Governments the responsibility of financing something with which they have nothing to do. . But for the war, there would have been no restrictions upon the borrowing powers of the States, or on their sphere of taxation. It is, therefore, the duty of the Federal Government to finance this matter instead of asking the States to do so. From what I have seen in the press of yesterday and to-day, it is apparent that finality has been reached so far as the States are concerned in the matter. </para>
                    <para class="block">There ought. to be finality so far as the Commonwealth Government are concerned.' I do not intend, on this occasion, to discuss the causes of desertion at the Front. Suffice it to say that the men are not to blame for it. To me it seems peculiar that any doctor attached to the British Army should allow a man to be imprisoned for desertion under certain circumstances. It is quite possible that many of these men have shirked fighting, but that is not the fault of their dependants. In most cases, however, their action has been the result of the trials to which they have been subjected at the Front. Consequently, they ought not to be punished, and much less ought their dependants to be punished. Who is the author of the treatment which is now being meted out tq these dependants? Is it the Treasurer, or the Minister for Defence? Honorable members should insist on getting information upon this point. The Government most certainly ought to be called upon to advance better reasons than have been assigned for their non-observance of their manifest obligations in this connexion. What sort of things are we that we should punish children - who are incapable of looking after themselves - for some offence alleged to have been committed by their fathers at the Front? These are matters which, I hope, the Government will deal with at the earliest opportunity. If they attempt to solve this problem satisfactorily they will receive the hearty co-operation of honorable members upon both sides of the House. This is not a party question by any means. </para>

                    <para>I wish now to say a few words in regard to the price of meat. I am well aware that the man on the land grows meat primarily for profit. I quite recognise that he desires to make as much profit <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> lie can out of his enterprise, just as the worker, who consumes that meat, endeavours to obtain as high a wage ' as he can. But when the Minister for Price Fixing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> fixed the price of meat a few weeks ago, a very substantial reduction immediately took place in the number of stock brought to the market. That was not because fat stock were not available, but because the stockowners wished to defeat the system of price fixing at its very inception. They at once raised the cry that the fat cattle required were not in the country. As a result, for about a week some of the butchers in Melbourne could obtain no meat at' all. At that time we were assured that the shortage of supplies in the market was due to the fact, that there were not the fat cattle and sheep that were required in the country. </para>

                        - The poor grazier  affirmed that he had no fat cattle and sheep with which to supply the market. When those who think with me declared that this was not a fact, and that the stockowners were withholding stock from the market in order to defeat price fixing, our statements  met with a point-blank denial.

                        a representative of the stork-raisers in the same sense that I am a representative of the workers, inquired what arrangements the Government proposed  to make- to enable the freezing chambers in Australia to receive more carcasses than they had been receiving, owing to the glut of fat sheep in the market. I thereupon asked, " Where were the fat sheep three weeks ago?"

                            <para>- I am fat all the year round. This is a very innocent Government. It believed the graziers and salesmen when they stated, six weeks ago, that there was no fat stock. It has thus had an example that those men do not tell the truth. The next time the Government proposes to fix prices it should insist that the stork be  brought  into the  market,  ' and otherwise prohibit export for the next twelve months. That would soon bring the stock-owners to heel. I  amf,111 v  aware that we cannot pass a law to force stock-holders to sell. One might:  just  as well try to make men work by Act of  Parliament. But there should be a law that, if the parties concerned -will not permit their cattle and sheep to be sent into market and sold at fair market sates, that same stock should not be permitted to be exported. </para>

While 'all his fellows were saying there were no fat sheep available for the market, they could have found them readily -enough for export. What is more, they would have exported the best - as they always do. It is the duty of the Government, when growers of meat are trying to corner the market for their own interests, to stop the export either of live stock or of frozen or tinned meat. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> when Minister for Trade and Customs, soon found a method of meeting a similar situation. He stopped the export of butter and of meat. Then there was that huge gathering in the Queen'sHall, a few months ago. And when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor's</inline> name was mentioned they howled at it. </para>

                            <para>.- I have complained so often in this Chamber with respect to the administration of the De fence Department that I am loath  again  to bring forward the subject. There is  not'  the least doubt but that the Department, through ineffective administration, has cost the country many hundreds of thousands of pounds more than need have been expended. But now some effort is being made to make good the. waste of those hundreds of thousands; and, unfortunately, it is by exploiting relatives of soldiers at the Front, merely to the tune of - a few pounds here and there. Those few pounds are insignificant so far as the gross expenditure of the Defence Department is concerned, but they loom very large in the eyes of those unfortunate persons who are met with certain demands which they are totally unable to pay - poor women who are cut down in their living expenses to a sum which brings the  blush  of shame to any one upon making acquaintance with the circumstances. I shall give one or two specific instances. The first refers to the case of the wife  of  a soldier who enlisted in Australia, who was a British reservist,  and who, therefore, was entitled to the Imperial allowance in' addition .to his Australian pay. When the woman went to- the Department to have her allotment and separation allowances settled, she stated all the circumstances. She was granted an allotment of £3 13s. a week. She thought that was too' much, and said so at the time, but was told by the official concerned that it was all right. She therefore accepted the money. That situation remained for some time until the woman received an intimation that her allotment of 6s. lOd. per day had been reduced to 2s. 9d. because of overpayments. She could not understand that, and was ' certainly unaware that any overpayment had occurred. Upon inquiry, she was informed that £153 had been overpaid, and she was actually asked if she could  refund  the full sum forthwith ; and, if not, what arrangements she proposed. The woman protested that, the money had naturally been expended upon domestic accounts, and that she could not refund anything. Straightway her allowance was reduced to 19s. 3d. per week. She pointed out that she could not live on that sum. After a while she received an intimation to the effect that no further action, was being taken to recover any amounts which had been overpaid to dependants of Imperial reservists, pending the receipt of instructions from head-quarters in Melbourne. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    <para>Naturally she hoped for a better state of  affairs as the result of having the matter remitted to Melbourne for reconsideration, but subsequently she received notification that her allotment would be further reduced from 2s. 9d. to ls. 9d. per day. </para>

                            <para>- I have another case. A soldier, also an Imperial reservist, enlisted, and in a few months was promoted to the rank of sergeant, and soon after to that of quartermaster-sergeant. His wife explained that she naturally expected her allowance would go up, but instead of that, about eight months afterwards, she was informed that she bad been overpaid £14 10s. She had to refund at the rate of 10s. per pay, and it took her about twelve months to do  so.  When she asked why these deductions were made from her pay, she was informed that, after deducting Imperial pay from the Australian pay, she was only entitled to about 2d. a day from the Commonwealth Government. She goes on to say that the Department had stopped her allowance of <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> lis. 2d. per fortnight, and she had nothing to come but 33s. Gd. per week from the Treasury. It was impossible for her to carry on, so she had to apply to the Patriotic Fund for assistance. These people put themselves in the hands of the Defence officers, and in perfectly good faith take what is allotted to them. If, afterwards, some mistake is discovered, they naturally feel aggrieved at being called upon to make good the amount of overpayment. I do not think the Department is entitled to act in this way._ </para>

                            <para>- The whole attitude of the Department towards the unfortunate wives and dependants of soldiers requires revision. These matters should be dealt with in a more sympathetic manner. I think that even if a mistake is made inadvertently by the person drawing a soldier's pay, the Department ought not to penalize the dependants subsequently; but, it is intolerable that they should be made to suffer for departmental mistakes. I trust the Assistant Minister will make representations to the Minister for Defence, and see if an end can be put to this scandalous state of things at the earliest possible moment. </para>

You see, for the six months I was in prison I have had entered in my pay-book £37 in debt. That means I would have to go two years without drawing a penny before I would be clear. But I signed a paper to certify that you and our children are dependent on my money. ... I was only nine hours absent from my quarters and resisting the police. I have been informed that none of my allotment will be stopped from you. </para>

                            <para>You can see by these papers I have been reduced in my pay14s. a fortnight. It leaves me now to keep three big school girls and myself on £4 l1s. a fortnight. In fact, I cannot do it. As you know, the cost of living is so high. Not only that, but I and also one of the children are under medical treatment; in fact, it was <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hughes,</inline> of Victoria-street, North Melbourne, who sent me down to see you. £3711s . is a terrible fine to put on a man for nine hours' absence without leave. That happened in 1917. My husband has not received a penny since, although he has been in the firing line ever since, and not been given an hour's leave. I think we are under German rule. A man leaves his dependants thinking they will be well provided for. If he makes a mistake in three years and three months' service abroad, it is not only he that suffers, but his dependants also. </para>

                        </continue><para>Here is another matter. Certain rapacious landlords are endeavouring to exact from the dependants of soldiers more rent than they have been charging in the past. I give credit to the Crown Law officers for certain action that they have taken, but there is too much circumlocution. A communication sent to the Attorney-General's Department is referred to the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> who administers the War Precautions regulations, and he, after perusing the correspondence, sends it back for action to be taken. A case has been brought before me in which a widow, who has been living in the same house for twenty years, during which time she has paid about £800 in rent, has had her rent raised.  Her  two boys were reared, if not born, in this house, but both left Australia to fight the battles of their country, and both fell at the Front. The landlord who owns the terrace in which this house is, put a few touches of paint on the premises, and then notified the tenants that in consequence of this slight improvement their rent would be raised from 14s. to 19s. 6d. per week. I advised this woman neither to pay the increased rent nor to move, but to refer the landlord to me. I gave a similar case to the Government at the beginning of the month, but so far I have received no satisfaction. It was laid before the Crown Law authorities, who referred it to the Defence Department, and it was then referred back again to the Crown Law authorities; and I am now told that when it is satisfactorily adjusted I shall be told. One suggestion I have made is that policemen should be instructed, if they hear of any such cases, to make inquiries and report to the Federal authorities, so that immediate action may be taken ; but under the present red-tape methods, with all the circumlocution, weeks elapse before any proper steps can be taken to prevent ejectment. We may rest assured that if a woman has occupied a house for twenty years, she is one of the best of tenants, just that class whom all landlords are anxious to obtain. </para><para>There is another complaint I have to make in the hope that the Minister will take some action. I am informed, on very good authority, that certain legal gentlemen are requested by the Department to investigate cases of the kind, and that some of these even take the side of the landlord, and urge the' tenant, for the sake of peace, to quit the premises quietly. It ought not to need this strong " Win-the-war " Government, with a majority of two to one, to remedy this state of affairs. It should not be difficult to ascertain the names of house agents in the metropolitan areas, or to announce to the press that landlords who attempt to evict the dependants of soldiers will be brought to book. It. may be that some of the officials are winking at these transactions, and thus causing avaricious landlords to be a little more bold in their methods of extortion. </para><para>A matter that affects the public generally is the increased cost of living. I am pleased to read that the New South Wales Government, which is called a National Government, is making arrangements whereby cheaper meat may be dispensed in, at all events, the metropolitan area. The following newspaper paragraph will explain what has been done: - </para><para class="italic">
                            <inline font-style="italic">New South Wales Scheme.</inline>
                        </para><para class="block">Sydney, Wednesday. - For a long time the </para><para>State Government has been closely considering whether it should take action to control  and  cheapen the supply of meat in the metropolitan area. It was learned to-night that  a  large and comprehensive scheme had practically received the indorsement of the Cabinet, representatives of the pastoral industry, and most of the large retail meat distributing firms. It  is  believed that if the scheme  is  put into operation it will have the immediate effect of lowering the price of meat to consumers, by eliminating practically the whole of the heavy middlemen's charges, which have now to be paid. In a nut-shell, the scheme, which is practically complete, and almost ready to be announced,  is  that the Government shall purchase the whole of the stock now killed at the State Abattoirs, and take  a  monopoly of supplies to distributing retail butchers. This will mean that there will be no private slaughtering  at  Homebush, and no commissions or over-riding charges to be paid. If the scheme is adopted, the Government will sell to retail butchers  at  proclaimed prices. It is not proposed to interfere in any way with the export trade, which is the natural influence governing the ordinary prices of meat. The probable development of the new scheme will be the provision of greater State facilities for freezing and other ordinary meat works activities. </para><para>It is pleasing to see that the New South Wales Government, headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman,</inline> an ex-Labour man, who has associated with him an ex-member of this House in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fuller,</inline> have made up their minds to evolve a scheme of the kind. </para><para>I do not say that the price paid by the consumer is solely dependent on the prices charged by those who raise the stock, for between the stock-raiser and the consumer there is a considerable amount of handling, which has to be paid for; and this, as in the case of other commodities, enhances the value. There is a lack of organization, which ought to be attended to if the cost of living is to be reduced. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- It is one way. What I object to is the operations of certain middlemen. The New South Wales Government propose to deal with the proprietors of private slaughter-houses, and with those who have the distribution of meat to the butchers' shops. The stockraiser consigns his stock to market auctioneers, who take their whack of commission; and there are other expenses  involved before the slaughtering takes place. Then, as I have said, between the slaughtering and the delivering to the butchers' shops there are other charges. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know an honorable member on this side who is unfavorable to increased production, for that is what we need, not only on the land, but in our factories, or there will be a very poor lookout when' hundreds of thousands of soldiers return to Australia. Unless we have better organization - and it is now far in arrear - we shall be the worst off amongst the belligerents. There must be increased production to provide work and necessaries of life, not only for the 5,000,000 people now here, but for the additional millions who will be born in Australia or come overseas. Without such preparation and organization we shall not be able to offer such inducements as are offered by Canada, where, in the face of the most awful war the world ever saw, the immigration figures are magnificent. During the war thousands of people have gone to Canada to settle, although, in my opinion, climatically and otherwise, the Dominion cannot compare with Australia. </para>

                                <para>- In my opinion, there is more Government interference in other countries than there is here. However, the New South Wales Government, which is of similar composition to that of the Federal Government, has seen fit to join in a combination to supply meat for the metropolitan area. It would have been much better if the Federal Government had taken this matter in hand throughout the country. In this, no doubt, it would have been necessary to enlist the sympathy and support of the State Governments, but something could have been done by co-operation. The New South Wales Government are doing, in the case of the meat business, what they have done in other directions; they are trying in their own way, to " dish " the Federal Government, and prove to the people of that State that the local Government, and not the Commonwealth Government, is their saviour. There is no doubt that the scheme in view will, if carried out, prove of benefit to the people ; and I point out to the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> that it is not only the consumers and the Government who are doing this, but that the pastoralists are joined with them. </para>

Nearly all the complaints I have received from the dependants of soldiers are of the character of the letter I have read. Fancy the Government cutting down the pay of soldiers' dependants in these times of high cost of living ! </para>

                                <para>- It is the fault of the Government. The Government are sitting quietly by while soldiers' dependants are being ejected from their houses by rapacious landlords. What are 'they doing to make the burden of living lighter for soldiers' dependants and others? This is a matter that should be considered by the Government before anything else; they should do everything possible to give help to these very deserving people. I leave these three points to the consideration of Ministers and honorable members, and I hope that, before long, there will be some sign of. reform. We are always promised that a matter will be considered;but, while it is being considered for months, the people are suffering. Let the Government be a Win-the-war Government, not only in name, but also in deed. </para>

                            <para>.  - I support the honorable member for Maribyrnong in his scathing indictment of a Government who profess to look after the interests of the soldiers, and who promised not to desert their dependants. We have repeatedly asked the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> whether he proposed to put a stop to the Government practice of depriving soldiers' relatives of their allotment money in cases in which the soldiers have deserted. The Acting Prime Minister, by  his  manner and speech, indicated  that  he  knew  very  little about the matter,  and  on  many occasions  when  I  and  others have  asked him  whether  the  Government proposed  to  stop  the  unholy practice of punishing relatives for  the  offences or mistakes of their soldier husbands  and sons, he has asked  for notice. But I find  that the  Acting Prime Minister  knows all  about  the  subject. The other day I  asked  for  a <inline font-style="italic">precis</inline> of  the  correspondence between  the  Commonwealth Government  and the  State Government  in  reference  to an  application  by the  Premier of Victoria in connexion  with three  families, who  are  relatives of soldiers  at the  Front,  and  are  in  destitute circumstances. I have  the <inline font-style="italic">precis</inline> now, and  I find  that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lawson,</inline> the  Premier of Victoria,  in  a letter addressed  to the  Acting Prime Minister,  dated the 8th  August, 1918,  said - Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir,</inline></para>

In the opinion of this Government, the matter is one entirely for Federal action. In any case, however, it is desirable that some clear understanding should be arrived at on the subject. I shall be glad, therefore, if you can see  your  way to make a definite pronouncement as to the dependants in question as a Federal responsibility. </para>
                        <para>The Acting Prime Minister forwarded to the Premier of Victoria a copy of a circular letter which he had addressed to the Premiers of the other States on the subject, and it is such an interesting and self-condemnatory document that I crave the indulgence of honorable members while I read it in its entirety - </para>

                            <para>I desire to inform you that, consequent  upon  representations in the Victorian Parliament, the Premier of Victoria recently communicated with me, and asked that a definite pronouncement be made as to whether the Commonwealth Government accepts responsibility for providing for the dependants of members of the Australian Imperial Force who are absent without leave. The present practice of the Defence Department as regards soldiers absent without leave from the Australian Imperial Force Camps in Australia is to stop payment of allotment and separation allowance on and from the day on which the soldier is reported as absent without leave. </para>

                        <para>That  is  from a Government which, through  its  Prime Minister, issued  a  personal  letter to the  relatives of  the  soldiers, pointing out  that  they were concerned in the result of  the  last general  election because there were Win-the-war party candidates presenting themselves for election who would not desert the soldiers or their dependants. When the soldiers left these shores, they went to fight, and possibly the relatives consented to their going. Their wive3 and relatives were dependent for their subsistence upon the allotment money which 'they were to receive, and the present Government, who made that promise, which was mainly responsible for their winning the election, now turn round and state deliberately that it is the practice of the Department to stop the payment of allotment and separation allowances on and  from the day  on' which a soldier is reported as absent without leave. The honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> in what I consider a theatrical manner, interrupts  speakers on this side with asseverations that the present Government are not responsible for the stoppage of allowances. The honorable member, if he is in his senses, if he is not acting a part, must know that the present Government are responsible for this action. The circular letter continues - </para>

Twenty-eight days after the man is declared an illegal absentee, which is forty-nine days after he was first absent without leave, the Chief Paymaster, London, advises the District Paymaster concerned by cablegram to cancel the allotment. </para>

                            <para>The District Paymaster immediately notifies the allottee of the date on which the allotment will he cancelled, allowing for a period of at least .thirty days from the despatch of the cablegram from London. This means that the allotment is cancelled seventy-nine days after the member was first absent witheut leave. If the soldier is apprehended, the allotment, if to a dependant, is reinstated at the minimum rate. It must be borne in mind that when a member is absent without leave he forfeits all pay, and, consequently, the amount of the allotment paid to the allottee constitutes an over-payment, which is recovered from .the soldier on apprehension. </para>

If on the desertion of the soldier his dependants were entitled to claim support from the Commonwealth Government, that would be putting a premium upon desertion, and practically placing the dependants of the soldier who deserted in a better position than the dependants of the soldier ' who, having completed his contract with the Government,  is  discharged " Services no longer required." In the one case all claim ceases, whereas in the other the soldier would be rewarded for deserting by the Government accepting the responsibility for the support of his dependants for the rest of their lives. Such a condition of things would be disastrous in  its effect on the discipline of the Forces. </para>
                        <para>That is a specious and contemptible argument.

I presume that the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister),</inline> knows the truth pf what the honorable member for Ballarat says, namely, that in this terrible war men are subjected to such fearful shocks on the battlefield that their mentality is disturbed, and many of them are not responsible for their subsequent actions. There are a hundred different ways in which a soldier may become absent without leave, and. he ought not to be held criminally responsible - until deliberate desertion is- proved. Yet the so-called Win-the-war Government, apparently after full consideration, deliberately set' out to deprive the wives and mothers of soldiers of the allotment money they ought to get. </para>
                        <para>It will be observed that due care is taken to see that the dependants are notified before action to terminate payments is taken, and that sufficient notice is given to enable them to make other arrangements, or, if necessary, to  apply  to the State authorities for assistance in the same way that other persons similarly situated have to apply. </para>
                        <para class="block">One would not hear worse language from the most wicked and contemptible solicitor, who, acting for some rack-renting landlord, was urging reasons why he should evict some poor tenants. What do they say' These poor unfortunate dependants of soldiers are given due notice that the Department are about "to determine the allotment made to them," and that they may appeal as paupers to the various State Departments and secure a charitable allowance. And this comes from the Acting Prime Minister, speaking on behalf of his colleague, the Minister for Defence, who has surely had sufficient experience of the war, and ought to have been able to learn his job after four years' experience.

When, however, they cease to be soldiers, such allotments of pay and allowances cease, subject to the procedure outlined above, and they and their wives and families have no further claim upon the Defence Department. </para>

                                <para>- Any one who is not a profiteer, or does not desire to continue profiteering during the war, must be anxious to see the end of the war. We were led to believe by the events that were happening, even a few days ago, that it was about to end. Indeed,  extraordinaries  were sold in the streets of the suburbs, the newsboys calling out "Peace Extraordinary!" and every body not only hoped, but also fully believed -that the war was about to terminate. We all felt that the Germans were beaten, that they could not possibly hold out, and that Turkey was desirous of gaining peace. We knew that Bulgaria had given in, and we heard reports that Bolshevism was feared in Germany. Indeed, everything seemed to point to the conclusion of an early peace. But two- days ago, I observed the following article in the daily press - </para>

If there is such a difference of opinion, I sincerely hope that the Allies will get together quickly. Surely if three or four nations are fighting against a common enemy, they ought to be able to arrive at an understanding as to what they are fighting about, and as to the terms upon which they will cease fighting. I deplore that the Government have announced in a recent speech delivered by the Acting Prime Minister that they have asked the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> to remain in London for a period. </para>

                                <para>- This, really, is a. serious subject, and the honorable member will forgive me for smiling at his suggestion. I have taken the view, and I hope that I take it with due calmness and without any antipathy, that the speeches of the Prime Minister in the Old Country have done more harm than good. I have repeatedly produced documentary evidence - and I also have the evidence of the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> and that of a returned soldier, who is a member of the Victorian State Parliament - that the speeches in which he has urged a permanent boycott of Germany, refusal to trade with Germany, and the wiping of Germany off the map, have been translated into the German language, and circulated in the German trenches, as well as throughout Germany, in order to convert the German pacifists into jingoes. These speeches have had the effect of solidifying the German nation and of causing them to continue the fight, when they might otherwise have thrown up the sponge. These speeches were certainly most unwise. If some foolish German were stalking through this country threatening that Germany would deprive us of our raw materials, and wipe us off the face of the map, would not his utterances be most effective in stirring up our people to do more than ever in the war, and to put a stop to any talk of peace negotiations? These speeches by the Prime Minister urging the boycott of Germany and the establishment of a self-contained Empire have, as I think I can prove, done harm in the Old Country. </para>

The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> takes exception to my view that Protection and Free Trade are very much matters of temperament; but I am prepared to prove it. A Free Trader wants to buy, say, his shirts for ls. each, if he can obtain them for that price, from India; whereas a Protectionist imposes a self-denying ordinance, and compels himself to pay 6s. or 7s. for such a* garment. </para>

Solidarity of the Empire, he said, would depend, not only upon the strength of the racial and lingual ties and the affection springing from the sacrifices of the war, but on trade defence. He hoped that the nations of the earth would settle their disputes before a great international tribunal which would be established to enforce the terms of peace, and banish war for. ever. Were we ready for peace? He candidly did not think so. He strenuously urged a development policy which would provide the settlement and remunerative employment of millions of soldiers, and munition and other workers.

                                <para>- I think that the Prime Minister's statements last quoted justify <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> M. Robertson's criticism of that gentleman. He points out that there is a certain indefiniteness about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> proposals. I, too, say that there is indefiniteness about his proposals. He allows it to be believed that he is a Protectionist, but he has already told the public that he does not pin his faith to Tariffs, hut to organization. He also says that what we want is a self-contained Empire. He has said to the people of England that what is wanted is that the raw materials should come from the Dominions to Great Britain, and, manufactured, be taken out to the Dominions by our mercantile marine. That is a policy the adoption of which would destroy Australia. If we are to be merely hewers of wood and drawers of water, and if our industries are to be confined to the pastoral and mining industries, what is to become of Australia, and how are we to attract population to this country? The Government have a right to tell us what is their policy with regard to. Empire trade. Is it the policy enunciated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> that we are to be a part of a self-contained Empire, which means that we are to trade with ourselves only? That policy cannot be defended or sustained for a moment. We have within the Commonwealth at the present time General Pau, representing the great, chivalrous French nation. But if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is to be believed, we should be a self-contained Empire, and that means that we are to give facilities to the coloured-labour populations of the Empire, in India and elsewhere, to trade with us that we are not prepared to give to our Allies, including the French nation. </para>

                                <para>- The Paris Conference resolutions, which thoughtful people condemn as impossible of realization, and as resolutions which, together with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> speeches, have helped to smother the pacifists of Germany and to unite the German people solidly in an effort to fight for their very existence, propose the boycotting of German and Austrian industries for all time. I point out to honorable members who are still obsessed by the Paris Conference resolutions that it will be impossible to prevent the German and Austrian nations, with their 120,000,000 of population, securing an outlet for their industries. The German people are admittedly the most scientific people. </para>

                            <para>- I take it that it means that each nation is to have the right to determine its own Tariff, and that there shall be no hostile Tariffs against any of the nations sitting round the Peace Table and agreeing to the terms of peace. Each nation will have to protect itself. If we deny the right of any nation to protect itself, what will become of local self-government and self-determination, which find a place in the President's proposals ? My point is that the Prime Minister is making speeches in the Old Country that are doing no good. If time permitted I could refer honorable members to a local opinion of the right honorable gentleman appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Industrial Australian -find Mining Standard</inline> of a recent date.

                            and his colleagues here should be  warned. If our absent Prime Minister is permitted to return to Australia having neglected or failed to right the wrongs which have crippled the expansion of our woollen and leather industry,, he and his brother Ministers will stand deeply discredited, and lastingly disgraced in the estimation of every Australian citizen acquainted with the circumstances.

                            <para>- -.Honorable members would scarcely permit me to read the whole article, which occupies two columns. To take the most mild view of the Prime Minister's speeches in the Old Country, he is wasting his time in trying to induce the people of the United Kingdom to adopt Protection, even if he believes in it himself, which I very much doubt. At a Congress of British trade unions, a previous motion in favour of Free Trade was, I learn, re-affirmed by the following vote: - For Free Trade, 2,214,000; against Free Trade, 591,000. That is out of a voting strength of about 8,000,000 on the present register. I cannot understand how a Labour man can be anything but a Protectionist, because he calls upon his employer to pay him a rate of wage which in civilized countries must be high enough to enable him to bring up his family in comfort. That cannot be done if the products of the employees are to be subjected to the competition of the serf labour of Fiji, India, China, or anywhere else. </para>

                        <para>.- I am wondering whether there will be a full discussion on this measure, in view of the fact that the right of honorable members to discuss grievances before Supply has just been taken away from them. I am also wondering whether the Government, having introduced and passed a new standing order to curtail debate, intend to put it into operation on this question. The Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn),</inline> or, in fact, any member, can move at any time that I be no longer heard. </para>

                            <para>- When the Minister introduced it, he said it was a Bill to amend the Electoral Act. I interjected, very wrongly, no doubt, that it was introduced by the party which, on the Minister's own figures, held ten or eleven more seats than it was entitled to according to the votes polled at the last election", and that it was introduced for the express purpose of trying to wipeout the Labour party. My opinion is that it has been designed by the Minister and the Cabinet for the express purpose of trying to injure the party on this side of the House. </para>

Why do not Ministers embody a similar provision in this Bill? If their action upon that occasion was a right one, it is equally right now. If any of the persons who were then disfranchised merited that treatment, they merit no better treatment to-day. The fact that the Government do not provide for their disfranchisement in this Bill proves that their action on the occasion in question was a wrong one, as we stated it was then. </para>

                            <para>- When this Parliament met in January last, I protested against the disfranchisement of Australian citizens, and I protest against it now.' If there are citizens in our midst who have done any wrong, disfranchisement is not the way in which to deal with them. A greater punishment should be imposed upon them. But if nothing can be proved against them, they ought not to be disfranchised. In my own electorate I do not think there were ten persons who were disfranchised under the regulation issued by the Government. On the occasion of the previous referendum it is true that some electors were obliged- to vote under what was known as " section 9." In the division of Yarra only about a dozen electors had their votes challenged under that provision, and the majority of them proved to be Britishers. I believe that practically every vote which was questioned on that occasion was ultimately allowed. </para>

Instead, they are to be invited, in connexion with elections for the Senate, to place crosses in the squares opposite the names of the candidates for whom they desire to vote, and, on the same day, in connexion with elections for this House, they are to indicate on their ballot-papers the order of their preference for the various candidates.  </para><interjection>

                            <para>- We do not use two methods simultaneously. The Government profess to be desirous of securing uniformity, and yet they propose that the electors shall employ two entirely different systems on the one day. Can such a method, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as making for uniformity? For the Senate elections, electors are to adopt the existing system of voting, but for elections for this Chamber they are to employ a sort of win-and-place method. The Bill further provides that where there are only two candidates for an electorate, and the elector has clearly indicated his choice, no matter by what means that object has been achieved, his vote shall be regarded as a formal one. This will be seen by reference to one of the provisions to clause 134, which reads - </para>

                        the Tasmanian system is altogether different from that which is embodied in this Bill. The Bill, in so far as it aims at achieving uniformity, lamentably fails. I believe that the Electoral Commission, of which the honorable member for Moreton was  chairman,  and the honorable member for Melbourne
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney),</inline>
                        the honorable member for Denison
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith),</inline>
                        and the honorable member for Wakefield
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foster)</inline>
                        were members, recommended the adoption of a uniform system of voting at elections for this Par- . liament. But this Bill gets away from that ideal. It provides that, in connexion with Senate elections, the existing system of voting is to be adopted ; whilst at elections for the House of Representatives, the preferential system of voting is to be employed. Then it is proposed that where only two candidates are seeking election for a seat in this Chamber, the elector may please himself as to whether he uses the existing system of voting or not.

                            <para>- I am quite aware of that. I know that in the Maloney McEacharn disputed election case, the High Court decided that if a ballot-paper was marked in such a way as to clearly indicate the intention of the voter, the vote should be allowed. That practice has been followed by presiding officers ever since. Clause 134 lays it down that a ballot-paper shall be regarded as informal unless it has been properly initialed by the presiding officer. There are penalties which may be imposed on officials. Nevertheless, I have known cases where a great number of votes have been declared informal because officials had not initialed them. </para>

                            <para>- The sub-clause dealing with that position does not alter the existing law. If I remember rightly, in 1902 we copied a number of clauses' into our legislation from the South Australian Act. But I do not see why voters should be disfranchised by the neglect of an official. There was some such occurrence in the electorate of Wide Bay, in which the honorable member representing that constituency <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> was closely- interested. At one polling booth there were over 200 papers concerned. Possibly, it was a matter of ignorance on the part of the officials or of their becoming mixed between the requirements of the different Acts. </para>

                            <para>- That was the instance 1 have in mind, and it was only right that since there was no fault on the part of the electors' ' concerned,- their votes should be treated as formal. In Victoria, the practice is to initial, ' and to number, but in some of the other States, including New South Wales, I believe, they do not initial at all. </para>

Thus -we may get a man who has .been trained in one system, and who fails to initial a. paper, as the result of which an elector is disfranchised through no fault of his own.- That sort of thing can become very serious. There are some electorates where votes are cast in .a proportion of five or six to one in favour of certain candidates. In some booths within my own electorate, as high as seven to one has been noted. If there are official mistakes, why should the electors be disfranchised ? I read portions of the report of the Royal Commission, but I am not sure whether that body dealt with this phase of the question. That a ballot-paper can become informal through no fault of the voter,* but through an official's blunder, is a situation which should be remedied. I understand that there is a penalty- attaching to such errors on the part of officials. </para><interjection>

The only way to end the illegal employment of motor cars on election days is to compel electors to vote. It is no good saying that motor cars are used only in districts where electors have to be conveyed long distances. It is where polling booths are close together that the greatest number of motors are at work. I admit that there are not many used in my electorate. At the last, elections I was wishing they would send out a great number of cars to my opponent. </para>

                    </continue><para>Another point with respect to compulsory enrolment is that in certain electorates there are great numbers of alterations made in the electoral roll during the course of one year. I have been told by responsible officials that in certain subdivisions of Melbourne's metropolitan electorates there have been alterations amounting to 60 per cent, of the total electors within twelve months. In some subdivisions this, does not matter, very  much. If people fail to observe the law, they are taken to Court and fined a  nomi»  nal sum, ls. or 2s. 6d., the Department, and quite rightly,- 1 think, not pressing for a heavy penalty, as compulsory enrolment is a comparatively new system. In some subdivisions, when electors move from one place to another, they do not go to the trouble of obtaining a transfer. In one part of my electorate, a street, - only about" half as wide as this chamber, divides two subdivisions, and so, if electors shift across the road, very often they neglect to transfer. I believe that, on the whole, the Commonwealth rolls are better than the State rolls,  though  I can only speak for my own State, as I do not know much about the rolls in the other States. I think the Victorian rolls for the districts of Richmond and Collingwood are better than the Federal roll of the division of Yarra, just after the police have, completed their collection of names; but that when three or six months have elapsed, the </para><para class="block">Commonwealth roll is much more accurate. I approve of the linking up of the machinery of the Postal and Electoral Departments, though in this matter I disagree with some of my friends-, 'both inside and outside the House. In my opinion, the system requiring letter-carriers to give notice of removal is the correct method, but they should go further. When a letter-carrier ascertains that a new family has moved into his round, or in the ease of a boardinghouse, that a new lodger has taken up 'his residence there, instead of merely notifying the Returning Officer of these changes, he should be supplied 'with cards to deliver to such persons, notifying them of their obligation to enrol, and that failure to do so will render '"them liable to prosecution. Prosecution of defaulters should not necessarily follow on the furnishing of names to the Returning Officer, because very often, either from forgetfulness or through want of knowledge, electors fail to realize their responsibility in this matter. I understand that each year there are at least l,000j000 alterations to our rolls. </para><interjection>

                            <para>-Not long  ago,  in the office of the Divisional Returning Officer for Yarra, I had a look at one page for a subdivision in my electorate, and found that out of sixty names on the page, there were no less than forty-five alterations in less than twelve months. In view of this, I think it is very difficult indeed for a Returning Officer to keep a clean and up-to-date roll. The Minister, in the course of his speech, said that every postman had a case of cards in which Joe recorded changes of address, and that this enabled the Divisional Returning Officers and the Registrars to keep the rolls up to date. </para>

                            <para>- It is very difficult to keep the rolls up to date, and but for the difficulty about the shortage of paper, I would suggest that, in addition to the ordinary roll, the authorities should compile a street roll, so that electors could be traced more readily. This would mean practically a duplication of the whole of our rolls, but it would make for better administration. The Returning Officers themselves have their card index in which the names are kept, not in alphabetical order, but in the order of streets, which I think is much the better way. On the question of redistribution,I think the Minister said that the Bill provides that if, in one-fourth of the divisions of. a State, the electors are more than one-fifth under or over the required quota, there shall be a redistribution of seats. <inline font-style="italic">Sitting suspended from 6.28 to7.45 p.m.</inline></para>

                            <para>- I was under the impression that the redistribution of divisions in the States was compulsory, but I understand from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> that it is not. It is possible that when our men return from the Front the relative numerical strength of the electorates will be altered, and that the metropolitan electorates will be more affected than the country electorates. </para>

                            <para>- In the early days of this Parliament, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, who was then Leader of the Opposition, resigned as a protest against the refusal of the Government to take the necessary action for a redistribution. At that time, some divisions contained less than half as many electors as other divisions. The Minister has told us that in New South Wales there are now seven divisions in which the population is more than a fifth above the quota, and two in which it is more than a fifth below the quota; that of seven South Australian divisions, two contain more than a fifth above the quota, and one more than a fifth below it; and that in Western Australia there is one division with a population more than one-fifth in excess of the quota, and another with a population more than one-fifth below the quota. </para>

                            <para>- As I have said, the Minister does not propose to interfere with the voting power of individuals, but he wishes to alter the electoral machinery. I said, at the outset that I am not in favour of any alteration until our soldiers have returned. The honorable gentleman says that there should not be a redistribution, because the relative population of the divisions is likely to be altered shortly, when some of the States may gain, and some may lose. It is possible that at some time the membership of this House will be reduced to seventy-two. </para>

Western Australia, I understand, has now a population which entitles her to a representation of five members by right of numbers. That being the case, the number of divisions ought to be reduced to seventy-four, some State other than Tasmania losing a representative. Probably, every honorable member is hoping that his electorate may not be' affected, and so long as the middle is not cut out of the Yarra electorate, I shall be satisfied. </para>

Any elector who wishes to vote by post must declare that he or she is ill, not that he or she may be ill. We know what happened on the last occasion that postal voting took place. In Committee, I shall give some figures connected with the exercise of the postal vote in the past. In the Kooyong division, the number of postal votes recorded was ten times the number recorded in the Yarra division just across the river. These postal votes were not all cast by mothers of newly-born children, or prospective mothers, because the birth-rate of Kooyong is only about half that of Yarra. In my opinion, if voting is to be allowed outside a polling booth, it should be done before an electoral official. We make the Electoral Department responsible for the carrying out of the law, and every vote polled should be cast in a polling booth, or delivered to an electoral official. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I do not want any alterations until the soldiers come back, and I have already told the Minister that I am not in favour of preferential voting. Behave the fact that, under the auspices of this Government, there have been conferences of electoral officers with a view to uniform rolls, and so forth, and yet this new system is proposed. In Victoria, at the present time, there are three systems of voting in operation. There is marking with the cross in the case of Federal elections ; preferential voting for the State Legislative Assembly, and crossing out undesired candidates at municipal elections. I do not know whether preferential voting applies to the Legislative Council of Victoria or whether, indeed, there are any elections at all for that body. </para>

I suppose most honorable members have had cases of error brought under their notice. I know of one in which a young lady got married, and it turned out that her Christian name and married surname was the same as that of her mother. The young woman applied to the Department for registration of her new name, but the Department, to make sure, struck off not only her name, but also that of her mother. This was only found out by the parties concerned at election time; but even if it had occurred twelve months before, we know that very often the printed roll is two years old, while there may have been 75 per cent. of alterations. The printed roll used at the last referendum ten months ago was the one used when we were elected to this House. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Yes ; but I ask that no one shall be struck off once the writ is issued. In my own electorate a letter- carrier, who, in consequence of the war, had, unfortunately, suffered mentally, was the means of striking 300 names off the roll; not one of these names ought to have been removed. On the matter being brought under the notice of the authorities, the whole of the names were reinstated ; but we can understand what might have occurred in a more sparsely populated constituency. These names were struck off after the writ had been issued, when it is impossible for a person to have his name placed on the roll. If, after the writ is issued, it is impossible to place a name on the roll, it ought to be impossible to strike a name off. </para>

                        <para>.- The amendment of the Electoral Act is, I think, recognised by all as being no party question. I am at a loss to understand why this Bill is brought before the Chamber at this particular time. It would have been better to wait until later on in the life of this Parliament, for, after all, there is no immediate prospect of an election; in all probability most of our boys will be back from the war before there is another political contest. If it is necessary to amend the Act, we ought to consider the question from the population point of view; and a re-adjustment of seats in accordance with the Constitution, and other electoral reforms, should he worked out at one time, iu the light of the knowledge that we shall have when our men return home. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The only question of importance in the Bill is that of preferential voting. The Act at present in force is, I think, giving every satisfaction so far as the conduct of elections is concerned. I am not sure that the introduction of a new method of voting will not complicate the position for the voter.  My own idea is that we shall find a largo number of informal votes. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has pointed out, the Government have, talked about the necessity for uniformity in the rolls, and yet they seek to introduce a new system, which, so far as I can see, can result in nothing but confusion at the ballot-box. </para>

                    <para>There will be . a good deal of discussion on the subject of postal voting. On the occasion of the last amendment of the Electoral Act there was a very keen debate on this point. I claimed that it was essential to provide every facility for all electors to record their votes, and in Committee I proposed an amendment which I thought would meet the case, as far as was legitimately possible. I do not believe that the postal-voting system is in the best interests of the country. Beyond doubt it was abused in the past, and, that being so, I feel confident that it will be abused in the future. </para>

                            <para>- I base my statements on the official returns. At the general election in 1906 the postal votes totalled 29,249. In New South Wales there were only 6,219 postal votes. That is the most populous State, and surely it will not be contended that there are more cases of sickness in other States than in New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing with postal voting. In Victoria there were 14,049 postal votes, chiefly in the metropolitan constituencies. Will any one contend that there were over 14,000 sick people in Victoria, almost exclusively in the metropolitan area, as against 6,219. in the whole of New South Wales? </para>

                            <para>- Of the total number of postal votes recorded in Victoria 6,241 were by males and 7,704 by females. The votes by males were almost as numerous as the votes by' females, and I am sure that all of them did not represent cases of sickness. The same abuse will happen if we renew the postal voting provisions. If we are desirous of conducting our elections on proper lines, how can we revert to a system that has proved unsatisfactory? </para>

At the same time, I believe that facilities should be given for every individual in the community to record his vote. The question we have to consider is how we are to do that without leaving an opportunity for a repetition of wrongful practices. I hope that when the Bill is in committee some amendment which will provide the requisite facilities without opening the door to abuses will be moved. </para>

                    <para>Another amendment I wish to urge is the abolition of the candidate's deposit. Probably I shall not get much support for that proposal, but if we are to have preferential voting we should permit every individual to contest a constituency who thinks that he has a right to do so, without requiring him to provide any deposit. After all, the deposit is a property qualification. In connexion with our municipal councils and other institutions, we have endeavoured to abolish property qualifications, and to allow everybody the freest opportunity to contest an election. </para>

But I contend that there are plenty of men, who have every qualification to enter Parliament, provided they can get a sufficient number of electors to vote for them, but who do not possess £25, or even 25s. Under the present system many men will not run the risk of contesting an election because they must forfeit a deposit if they do not poll a certain percentage of the votes. </para>

That provision deprives the Commonwealth of the chance of getting, perhaps, some of the ablest men in the State Legislatures. There are many able men in State politics who, but for the risk of falling between two stools, would be prepared, at the request of their constituents, to contest a Federal electorate. </para>

                        <para>.- Some of the provisions of this Bill are incomplete. It would not have been produced had it not been for the adoption of the principle of preferential voting by the party sitting on this side of the Chamber; but the principle as incorporated in the measure is very incomplete and ineffective. If it is to be at all complete and effective, there should be no bar, handicap, or impediment in any shape or form to any person going to the poll who believes that he is capable of securing the support of the most of the people in a given constituency; but there is nothing in the Bill imposing a penalty on organizations who conduct in advance a pre-selection which robs the special preferential provision of its efficacy. There is nothing to prevent either party represented in this House from setting out in advance of an election to hold a preselection, and put the hall-mark upon a candidate ; and that is . a most effective bar against other candidates going to the poll. In this way, the whole object of the Government in establishing preferential voting will be rendered nugatory. </para>

                            <para>- We all know that any person who complies with the provisions of the Act can go to the poll; but what is the use of a person going to the organization which returns the honorable member, and then nominating for election  by the electors, if some other individual is chosen at the pre-selection ballot? Let us face the position earnestly. I would rather not see the provision in the Bill than have it there without proper safeguards; and at a later stage I propose to test the feeling of the House on the matter by submitting an amendment seeking to impose a penalty on any organization setting out in advance of election day to pre-select a candidate, and thus debar other persons from entering the field. If we are sincere in our effort to provide an open field for all candidates, then no person should suffer the handicap that, in advance, his claims have been tested and rejected by his party. </para>

                            <para>- There is no party question about this. We must either give a clear, open field for candidates to go to the poll unhandicapped, or permit the continuance of the practice that has long prevailed on both sides of this Chamber, by which the two great parties in this country set up their organizations and machinery, and utilize their funds with the object of determining in advance of an election what candidates shall run in their interests. I maintain that no man should go to the poll having his chance predetermined against him by his party. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware that it was the settled policy of the major section of the party on this side of the Chamber, but a definite promise to introduce the policy previously agreed upon was announced just prior to that election. I believe that the honorable member for Flinders would have won the seat against a dozen candidates, and I was one who personally objected to the announcement which was made, but at any rate the events surrounding that election gave an indication of the disabilities suffered by reason of the fact that the preferential voting system was not in force'. The Government, in accordance with their promise, have come down with a Bill which is designed to remedy that state of affairs, but they have absolutely failed to provide the one safeguard needed, and without which the Bill will not be effective. I am anxiously awaiting a statement from * the Minister. </para>

                            <para>- But the Minister fails to provide it. He has already shown that there are two great parties in this country possessed of the machinery for controlling elections, and part of the practice of both parties is to predetermine the chance of their candidates at elections. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it is, and the adherents of the two parties are morally bound to support the candidates upon whom the pre-election choice has fallen. In those circumstances, what chances have other candidates of being elected? Therefore, we do not secure free electoral opportunities. I am quite conscious of the fact than any person can go to the poll after paying a deposit, and get enough electors to sign his nomination paper. </para>

                            <para>- There is an old story about providing the birch to beat your own back, and I think some of us in supporting this- Bill, which provides for preferential voting, are forging a weapon that will be used against us. I approve of the restoration of the postal vote with adequate safeguards, and the tightening up of electoral machinery, so that on election day those whose names have been improperly left off the rolls will have an opportunity to vote if they can satisfy the officers that they should have been enrolled. In many respects the Minister, by means of this Bill, proposes an improvement on our present electoral machinery; but I do not think that the provision for preferential voting will be effective, or that it will achieve the object that the Government have in view. </para>

                        <para>. -  I agree with those who have said that the most important part of this Bill is that providing for preferential voting. The honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> suggests that we should put a stop to the practice of pre-selection of candidates by parties. If that system were abolished, it would do away with a lot of trouble for some people, and many associations which now send out to candidates circulars asking whether they are in favour of prohibition, and various other matters, would find themselves no longer able to take such action. It must be recognised, however, that there are only two parties in Australia to-day. Certain returned soldiers are endeavouring to create a third party, but I am convinced that when our returned men go to the poll, they will" vote Labour or Conservative, just as they did before. Some of them, perhaps, have changed their views, but the great majority will vote as they did before they went to the Front. I do not believe that there will be a returned soldiers' party as such. Some may attempt to form such a party, but if it is formed, it is a certainty that it will attach itself to the most Conservative section. The honorable member for Wannon, in urging that there should be no pre-selection of candidates by ' the different parties, has lost sight of the attitude taken up by the great newspapers, who tell the electors who are " the real Mackay." Is he going to stop that sort of thing? </para>

Happily that day has passed. The Labour party beat tie newspapers in that regard, and wrested from them the power they had so long held to dictate to the people whom they should return. Is there any political machine that is half as corrupt as are the newspapers in their attacks upon politicians? .They are supposed to be the guardians of the people; but they try to dictate to the electors what political policy they should favour and whom they should return. The honorable member for Wannon should be  careful  not to trust himself to the tender mercies of the newspapers, which select only such candidates as can he moulded to their own desires. I am sure the honorable member would not like anything of the kind. </para>

                            <para>- After all, why was the party system brought into existence? Parties were formed because it was found that individual members of Parliament did not carry 'out the pledges made by them when on the hustings. Men were returned to Parliament independent of party ties, and were well able to look after themselves. The outside public became tired of this sort of thing, and formulated the system of pre-selection. The day of the independent candidate has gone for ever, and rightly so, because the independent man was always able to look after his own personal interests. Where the Ministerial and Opposition parties were almost evenly balanced, the independent member could claim, what he wanted. Parties were formed to enable policies to be created. There could be no sound legislation without some preconceived ideas of policy. In the old days, the Prime Minister, or some great leader whom many people believed to have a monopoly of the brains of the community, was left to formulate a policy for the people; but that system has also gone. The people know that in Australian politics to-day there are only two parties. If there is to be no preselection of candidates, men will be returned to this Parliament without any policy apart from their own individual opinions, and we shall have a most curious House, consisting of seventy-five men, each with a separate policy. What a time we should have! What juggling there would be for positions! We would have in Parliament men whose politics were as far apart as those of the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce Smith)</inline> and the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine).</inline></para>

                    <para>To return to the question of preferential voting, I am convinced that, under  such  a system, the position of electors on voting day would be worse than ever. It is only now and then that the general public have an opportunity to record their votes. They enter a polling 'booth with_ all the solemnity imaginable, and are instructed in sepulchral tones as to-, what they are to do. They then adjourn to a little cuddy-house where, practically in the dark, they endeavour, with half an inch of pencil, to record their votes. Even those who understand the present system have to be careful that they do not make a mistake. What, then, will. be the position of the general body of voters if we have preferential voting? In view of the fact that we have only two political parties in the Commonwealth, is it worth while to adopt a system which must lead to an increase in the number of informal votes? The Government have a majority; I suppose the numbers are up, and honorable members opposite will carry this proposal. We have been threatened with it for some time, and whilst I am against it, I admit that it is not as bad as another suggestion that has been made to cut the States into separate constituencies for the return of members of the Senate. That would be pure gerrymandering if it were carried into effect. </para>

                            <para>- I did not hear the. honorable member's remark. It will be remembered that the smaller States claimed equal representation in the Senate with the larger States. They did so because they felt that otherwise the larger States would dominate the Parliament, and the rights of the smaller States would be frittered away. They demanded that each State should have the same representation in the Senate, and any attempt to alter that would, in my opinion, be corrupt. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members will remember that when in this Chamber a preferential vote was taken for the selection of the Federal Capital site innumerable mistakes were made by members of this House, who were supposed to understand all about voting. In Labour leagues with which I am associated I have known informal votes to be recorded by men and women thoroughly familiar with the preferential system of voting. If we establish a system which will lead to an increase in the number of informal votes recorded we shall not get the true opinion of the people expressed at the polls. I again say that the preferential system is not necessary for Federal elections when there are only two parties in Federal politics. </para>

                    <para>On the subject of postal voting, I may inform honorable members' that there are many in the Labour movement who believe in that system. It appears to offer great facilities to voters. It is suggested that the system should be specially useful in a constituency with a high birth rate, but it is a remarkable thing that, in my own constituency of Melbourne Ports, which has the highest birth rate of any constituency in Australia, the lowest postal vote was recorded. While I believe that we on this side lose many genuine votes through the absence of postal voting, we are convinced that the other side gain by corruption if postal voting is allowed. That is why I am against it. I remember an election that took place in South Melbourne for the Legislative Council about six years ago. Two well-known men, both Conservatives, were the candidates. At 7.30 on the night of the election I heard one man say, "I voted eighteen times," and another said, " I voted nineteen times." Both candidates were guilty, but one man knew more about electioneering than did the other. I did not blame the candidates so much as the very energetic and tricky electioneering agents who were running the election for them. Where there is political corruption on one or both sides, honorable members will agree that it is well to prevent it if we can.  So I say that, although we will lose many genuine votes by not having postal voting, that is better than the corruption which takes place under the postal voting system. If arrangements could be made to prevent corruption under the system, I should be glad to accept it. One thing that would obviate the necessity for voting by post would be to have a greater number of polling booths. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that the number has been increased, and that the Electoral Officers have always been quite willing to consider the creation of new polling places when they have been applied for. I am quite satisfied with the conduct of elections by our electoral officers. Our principal electoral officers and  deputy  returning officers must hold some political opinions, but I believe they are animated generally by a desire to perform their duties impartially. Where it is pointed out to them that polling booths are necessary, they are prepared to consider their establishment, but they are restricted by the consideration of expense. In my own constituency there is one section where the people have to go nearly a mile and a half to record their votes. </para>

                            <para>- I know that in some of the country constituencies people have to take a holiday to go to the poll. I quite recognise the disadvantages which country electors labour under, but environment must be taken into account, and whilst people in the country think it  noth-ing  to ride, drive, or walk 2 miles to the nearest neighbour, it is not so in the city. It is remarkable to find that postal voting was availed of to a greater extent in cities than in country constituencies. It is strange that in Western Australia, with its enormous area, there was less voting by post than in Tasmania. </para>

                            <para>- I understood that there were only 900 postal votes recorded in Western Australia, but in view of the difference in area, assuming the honorable member's figures to be correct, there should have been many more postal votes recorded in Western Australia. I do not object to the facilities afforded by postal voting. My objection to the system is that its adoption has been proved to lead to corruption. </para>

                    <para>I want to say something about Deputy Returning Officers. It is remarkable how some men, when vested with a little authority, allow their partisan feeling to influence their actions. On one or two occasions I have had to complain of certain officers. I consider it the duty of an electoral officer to assist in every way he can to secure a poll with as few informal votes as possible. To secure this end political parties issue voting cards, showing how supporters of their respective parties should vote. Some people believe that that practice is wrong, but I can see nothing wrong in it. I know that one deputy returning officer tried to prevent people taking these voting cards into the polling booth with them, and he stopped some voters from doing so. That man was interfering with the rights of people. It is actions of that sort which bring about informal votes. When people get into a polling booth they ought to be given all the assistance possible to" enable them to vote as they wish. I am afraid that we should get a most peculiar outcome from a system of preferential voting with seven or eight candidates for a seat, and the electors being asked to number them in their order of preference. I fear that 'the result would not express the real opinion of the people.  </para>
                    <para>I regret that no mention is made in the Bill of the question of giving the franchise to the inhabitants of the various Federal Territories. It is a disgrace to Australia that they have no vote. ' They pay taxes, and have to conform to the  laws,  but they have no say whatever in making the laws or assessing the taxes. </para>

                            <para>- They ought to have. One could understand the delay if it involved great difficulties, but there should be no difficulty about it at all. There is nothing to stop the Government at this stage from proposing a clause that will give the inhabitants of the territories a vote. .There is .nothing to prevent them joining the Northern Territory to the electorate of Grey, to which it originally belonged. The people in the Federal Capital Territory could vote in. Eden-Monaro, from which I believe the Territory was excised, or they could be attached to some other electorate. The people of Lord Howe Island vote in the electorate of East Sydney to-day. Why cannot the people of Norfolk Island do the same, and why cannot the people of Papua be tacked on to some State to give them representation? Surely all these people have the right to vote ? They are Australians the same as we are, but by a peculiar set of circumstances they have been wiped off our electoral rolls. It must not be forgotten also that they are claiming representation. Another way out of the difficulty would be to give the whole of the Territories one representative, say, in the Senate. Some people claim that they should have a representative here, but they are not numerically strong enough to be entitled to that; still they have the right to vote somewhere. Has the Minister in charge of the Bill ever considered that question? </para>

                            <para>- The old moral law still holds - no taxation without representation. I admit that more is expended on the Territories than the inhabitants pay in taxes, but they are flesh and blood and have a right to representation somewhere. To-day they have no man who really represents them. I worry the Minister a good deal about the Northern Territory, but there is no affinity between the Northern Territory and Melbourne Ports. I do not know many up there, but I have been conducting correspondence with them, and endeavouring to influence the Minister to do certain things. They ought to have a representative of their own to whom they can write, because then they could put matters more forcibly. Why should they have to go round looking for somebody to represent their views for them ? It is unfair, un-British, and immoral that any man or woman should be subjected to any law in the formulating of which they had no say. As there would be so little difficulty in making the necessary arrangements, I wonder it has not been done long ago. At one time I had a motion on the notice-paper to give these people representation, and appealed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> month after month to allow me an opportunity to move it, but I could never reach it. The Minister must admit that something should be done in this direction. </para>

                        <para>.- The Bill, as a consolidating measure, fills a long-felt want, and for that reason, hut for that reason alone, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> deserves to  he  congratulated for introducing it. But as a measure designed to bring about that blissful state of uniformity of which we hear so much, it falls very short of perfection, to say the least of it. The Minister has on several occasions reiterated his desire for uniformity. In 1902 he spoke in this House as follows : - </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>I look forward  to  the time when, through delegation of powers solicited by the Federation, and granted by the States, we shall have in the Commonwealth and States one Electoral Act and one principle of division, involving, as they will, one suffrage, one set of officers, one roll, one mode of election, and one code to secure the purity of elections. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>I quote that paragraph to draw attention to the fact that the Minister, introducing this Bill, stated his whole-hearted desire for uniformity in 1902, and has reiterated it in this  Chamber  no less than three times during the past two weeks. Again, in answer to interjections, he said that the States were waiting for the Commonwealth to give them a lead, and that this Bill was a lead for uniformity. If the Bill is passed in its present form, the Government will not bring about that desired effect. Rather, they will retard the prospects of uniformity in electoral matters in Australia. What right has the Government or the Minister to expect the States to adopt uniform electoral laws when the Government themselves are the greatest offenders against the principle of uniformity? At the next election, voters will be given two sets of directions, which they will have to learn. They will have to be very careful not to indicate their preferences in the election of senators. </para>

                    <para>The Government propose to make a vital alteration in our method of voting at a time when 400,000 electors are absent from the Commonwealth. The reasons assigned for this alteration are many, and some of them possess a sinister significance. I am of opinion that the organizations of the party opposite have come to the conclusion that, in view of certain events which have transpired during the life of this Parliament, it would be a good thing for them to drag a red herring across the trail. Already members of that party have decided to bring a new machine into the field. By means of that machine - the Soldiers' party - which is really a portion of the tail of the National machine, they intend to give a second shot to the National candidate. </para>

                            <para>- The soldiers' organization, besides advocating the preferential system of voting, is advocating proportional representation. The Farmers and Settlers' Association, and all the other organizations which are closely allied to the National party, advocate, not merely the preferential, but the proportional, system of voting. My honorable friends opposite will doubtless disobey their masters up to a certain point. They will go to the step marked " preferential," but they will not go to the logical extreme of proportional representation. Indeed, it will be found that the Labour party is much more in earnest in regard to preferential voting than are my honorable friends opposite, because the former practises that system in most of its preselection ballots, which the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> intends to do away with. </para>

                    <para>The most extraordinary thing about those who make the preferential system of voting and proportional representation the last word in electoral reform is that they always argue that when these systems are adopted political parties will probably disappear, and that certainly the pre-selection ballot will disappear. No matter what system of electoral reform is introduced - it may be any one of the 300 variations of proportional representation - political parties will not disappear, for the reason that they are not concerned with electoral systems. Parties were not brought into existence because of the system under which representatives are elected. "While there are poor people, while there are people who are sweated, and who cannot afford to purchase proper food and clothing for their children, while combines exist, and while profiteering flourishes, there will always be two parties in politics. </para>

If I am not speaking the truth it will be a very easy matter for him to disprove my statement by quoting from the policy announced by the honorable member for Flinders.

                    <para>There are several features in this Bill which are objectionable from my stand-point. The proposal to restore postal voting opens the way to the same corruption as existed when that system was previously in operation. In 1911, when a referendum was about to be taken in connexion with certain proposed constitutional alterations as applied to industrial conditions, I happened to be shearing on a station above Brewarrina. There were some twenty of us working in and about the shearing shed. We applied for our postal ballot-papers, and in due course received them. The station manager was also a justice of the peace, and after the mail had arrived one evening he sent us word that everything was in order, and that we could go and record our votes. I was about the third or fourth man to record my vote, but prior to entering the room I was informed that I would probably be asked which way I intended voting. When I did enter the room I was handed a blank ballot-paper, and was just about to mark it, when I was asked by the station manager how I intended to vote. </para>

                            <para>- I supplied it publicly to the Electoral Office at the time, but that particular gentleman did not receive any rebuff from that office. I have simply related an experience of my own in this matter. Many honorable members have heard of similar happenings. What happened to me in 1911 and to many others who follow up the shearing industry, will undoubtedly happen again under this Bill. I am quite willing to recognise that there should be a system which will permit of the infirm and others who are unable to visit a polling booth on election day, exercising their franchise, but its exercise must be hedged around with proper safeguards. This Bill, however, in its present form, does not provide those safeguards. Postal voting is a very fine thing for the party which represents the wealthy classes, inasmuch as the great preponderance of postal votes will always come from the country - from stations, farms, &amp;c. By reason of education or experience, the station manager or the station owner in the country is usually the individual from whom information is sought. If he is a good party worker - as most of these individuals are - he will see that every possible vote on his farm or station is polled for a certain cause or candidate. We know what took place under the old system. It was rotten; it was corrupt. lt stunk in the nostrils of the people, so it was altered. </para>

                        <para>. - I propose to touch upon one or two points which have been raised during the debate. I have voted on both sides with regard to this question. When I was in the Labour party, at the time when the subject was before it, I supported compulsory voting. We abolished the system of postal voting. That was never satisfactory to my mind, nor is the system of compulsory voting. I do not see how it can be brought about in Australia, because there is no strong opinion outside of Parliament in favour of it. It is all very well, for honorable members who represent close and compact constituencies, such as that I represent, to advocate any proposal that would be eminently satisfactory to those constituencies. But we should not lose sight of that great section of the Australian people who are doing the best work in all the land - the pioneers in our out-back country. Consistency does not worry me vastly upon a subject such as this. We must frame an electoral system that will deal justice to settlers in our outside country. Facilities should be certainly provided for these people, and I do not see how it is possible except under some system of postal voting. My honorable friend, the member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has always consistently advocated the giving of an opportunity to vote to the sick and infirm, and this, I again point out, can only be achieved by means of the postal vote, any difficulties in connexion with which can be overcome at the Committee stage. I am not wedded to the provisions in the Bill relating to this matter, but I intend to see that some such facilities are provided. I admit that there is always an element of corruption about the postal vote, but I think that if the consideration of the matter is approached in a non-party spirit, we shall be able to so safeguard the principle as to reduce any possibility of corruption to a minimum. </para>

                            <para>- I have always been in favour of the system requiring a deposit from candidates. I do not think it has ever kept a poor man out of Parliament, because if a man has any chance of election, and is respected, he is bound to have plenty of friends ready to put money up for him. If a man cannot provide a deposit, in nine cases out of ten it is because he is a fanatic - a man who thinks that the world will never be right until he gets into Parliament. So far as possible we ought to safeguard a con.stitutency from the possibility of having an election forced upon it by men who have no earthly chance of election. </para>

                    <para>I note that, the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> is somewhat dissatisfied with the measure because the Government do not intend to make preselection an electoral offence. As a matter of fact, I think myself that preselection will go on, and ought to go on, because I have always been a strong party man. In the English-speaking world there has always been party government, and there always will be. Gambetta, the celebrated French statesman, said that party government is government based on the formation of men's minds. One man, by education, birth, environment, and position, may not take a very hopeful view of the future, and naturally would be of a conservative temperament, while another man, under the same conditions and circumstances, would take a hopeful view, and would always be in the front rank of the advanced political party. This principle applies all over the world, and, according to Gambetta, is the origin of the party system. I invite honorable members, if they care to study this subject, to turn up the works of </para>
                    <para class="block">Benjamin Kidd, the greatest authority in the world to-day on the principles of projected efficiency. He lays it down as a principle that the progress which the English people have made during the last century is due to party government. . There has always been the reform or advanced party, and whenever the people have got tired of it, that party has gone out, and another has taken its place. But the secret of the success of our party government lies in the fact that a succeeding party Government never reverses the progressive legislation to which party government has given effect. In this is to be found the secret of the strength and solidarity of the British Empire, and indeed, of European civilization. Honorable members, if they are well informed on this subject, must realize that the doctrine of projected efficiency will do more for the future than anything else. For these reasons, I stand for party government and party organization. </para>
                    <para>But what will be the effect of this measure.'* A party may not be in touch with the people, and other candidates, quite distinct from any party,, may be brought out with a really good chance of beating purely party men if the public are behind them. As ah illustration of what I am saying, I may ask what would be the position of the Liberal party in England but for the Nonconformist vote? </para>

                        <para>.- In addressing myself to the measure, I wish to preface my remarks by saying that, to my mind, it is only playing with the principles of Democracy to introduce a Bill of this character under the pretence of increasing the power of the Democracy, by making representation more democratic. If political Democracy Were what honorable members opposite were aiming at, they would have proposed the introduction of the initiative, the referendum, and the right of recall. There is no political Democracy while party system is in existence. No country can claim to be democratic where there is, not a true reflex in Parliament of the ideas, aspirations, and wishes of the people. If we had true political Democracy, as distinct from industrial Democracy, there would be no such thing as party government; we should have the initiative, the referendum, and the right of recall, and the Government would be elected by the representatives of the people. I look for something more than political Democracy; I look for industrial </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member recently objected to being termed a dumb dog. I was about to remark, when this unruly representative of the capitalistic' class interjected, that if honorable members opposite desired to give the people true representation, and to establish political Democracy, they would not ask us to waste our time with a measure such as this. Had they proposed the initiative, the referendum, and the right of recall, they would be entitled to the credit of attempting to give the people a political Democracy. The Government would be selected by the representatives chosen by the people, and the people would have the power to recall such representatives as failed in their duty. </para>

                            <para>- I was about to say that if the Government and their supporters were in earnest, we would not be discussing Bill's of 'this character, but Bills that would vitally affect and alter the whole basis of parliamentary institutions in this country by giving the mass of the people outside the real power of initiating legislation. What is proposed is that which has characterized parliamentary institutions since their inception. The British House of Commons is known as the Mother of Parliaments, and in the development of parliamentary institutions in the British Empire and elsewhere we have seen a gradual transference of political power from one class to another. That has gone on from the time of William III., when party government was instituted, and Ministers were first introduced into the House of Commons. By extensions of the franchise, power has been shifted, first from the aristocratic to the commercial and moneyed classes, just in proportion as they acquired that economic power which determines political power. The various Reform Bills from 1832 have, as I say, - transferred the power from the landowning classes to the commercial and moneyed classes, and then the Bill of 1867 enlarged the franchise, and gave power to the lower middle classes. So the process has gone on until, when the war broke out, there were something like 12,000,000 voters, who, as Carlyle said, had the right to a one-thousandth part of a talker in the national palaver. It is now proposed in Great Britain to add something like 10,000,000 more voters, giving a total of, I think, about 20,000,000 or 22,000,000. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to bring under the notice of the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> the terrible stress which tenants. are suffering at the present time by the unjust claims made upon them by certain landlords. The House will remember that on a previous occasion I spoke of one Jewish gentleman who  owns many  houses in the community, and who, when I represented the difficulties of the people during  waT  time, agreed that he would not increase the  Tents  of his tenants. There is another type of landlord, however; and the case I now desire to mention is that of an old lady about seventy years of age, who, by letting a few rooms, manages to obtain her own shelter for nothing.  Her  landlord, John Anderson, of Elizabeth-street, Coburg, raised her rent 10s. a week, and a few weeks afterwards raised it by another 10s. Honorable members, I am sure, will forgive me if I call this rack-renting man a scoundrel. I find that he has broken the law, and I intend that he shall be prosecuted, because tomorrow I shall forward the necessary information. He raised the rent by still another 10s., although this old lady had been his tenant for fourteen years. I have seen her rent-book, and I have found that the man, as I say, has broken the law. She endeavoured for a time to pay the £3 a week, and then she came to me  in  her trouble. I sent her to  a  legal gentleman, who, in his sympathy, advised her not to pay the increased rent, but to go to a magistrate and explain that, although her lodgers would accompany her, she could not get another house. Any honorable member who has experience of this large city knows that, at the present moment, it is most difficult to rent houses. One agent kindly said that he could let her have a house of five rooms, and to that house the unfortunate old lady has gone. I thought that this landlord might be a Christian, and I wrote the following letter to him: - </para>

I do ,not know if you are a Christian or not, but you will feel mighty mean when you die and face your Maker. I know this unfortunate lady has tried to find another house, but she cannot, and it will be absolute ruin if you go on your way. Are you aware that she is over seventy years of age?

                    <para class="block">This is not an isolated case. It is unfortunate that in a community such as this the authorities, in their efforts to do good by condemning houses and pulling them down, create a scarcity by not providing other houses. However, there is no justification in war time for such conduct as I have described on the part of a landlord, and I ask that, under the War Precautions Act, there should be a regulation to carry out what was suggested by the Jewish gentleman to whom I have re'ferred namely, a law to prevent landlords raising their  Tent,  so that it should not be necessary for private persons to request them to do what the State should compel. We have passed about 292 laws this year, and surely we could pass another to deal with these exploiters and enemies within the gates? The action of this landlord is not that of an honorable man, but that of a rack-renting brute. I have no hesitation in saying that such exploiters who raise the cost of food and living generally are more despicable than our open enemies, who, at any rate, are man enough to stand in front with a rifle. Tomorrow I will bring the action of this John Anderson under the notice of the State Government in the hope that they will prosecute and punish him for having broken the law. </para>
