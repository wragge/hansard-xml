For some days past the Government has been in close consultation with the heads of churches in an endeavour to find a means which would enable what is desired to be done, and, at the same time, reduce the possibility of added risk to a minimum.

                        <para>- I desire to inform the House, that on Friday afternoon last, I received from the Acting Solicitor-General a letter directing my attention to certain passages in the remarks of honorable members on the 3rd and 4th inst., reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of those dates, as calculated, in the opinion of the Crown Law Officers, to prejudice  His  Majesty's relations with a foreign power. After consultation with the honorable members concerned, I determined to direct the omission from the report of the passages to which my attention had been drawn, since it appeared to me most undesirable that any remarks of the nature indicated - however sincere might be the convictions of- honorable members on the subjects debated - should be published during the progress of the important negotiations now proceeding in Europe. I took this course with some reluctance, and in conscientious exercise of the discretion vested in me by the resolution of the House. </para>

Chair on the day following the sitting, in the course of which the remarks were made. I do not propose, unless in very exceptional circumstances, to direct the omission of any remarks without first consulting the honorable member making them, and it was quite by accident that those I desired to consult were available on Friday afternoon last. </para>

                    <para>Mr.BLAKELEY.- Everything that I said  was  said calmly and coolly, and; so far as I know, was a statement of fact. Knowing the way in which the censorship regulations have been used, I intentionally adopted moderate and temperate language, lest something might occur. The matters with which I dealt were fair subjects for criticism. I question the right of this Parliament to limit a member's power of criticism, and I question, too, its right to give you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the very great powers which you possess. Last, but not least, I question your right to limit the criticism of any member, especially in view of the fact that the necessity for such censorship has now completely disappeared, and also because the criticism in which I indulged was quite in accord with that which is heard in other parts of the world. </para>

For some offence which the soldier committed before he was killed, his widow's allowance was reduced to 2s. per day, and the Department is now withholding the allowance due to his child. Will the Assistant Minister for Defence represent to Cabinet . that in cases in which men paid the supreme penalty these trifling fines - whether for diseases which they are blamed for contracting although they could not help themselves, or for other offences - are waived, and that the punishment should not be visited upon the dead soldiers' widows and children? </para>

                            <para>. - I appreciate the fact that honorable members are anxious to push on with the business on the notice-paper so that they may return to their homes before Christmas; but the action taken by the authorities in this matter is one that I cannot understand, and the reply given on Thursday night to the question raised by my leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> and the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> appeared to me to be quite unsatisfactory. We all recognise that in certain circumstances the placing of individuals in quarantine, and the imposition of restrictions as to who shall visit them, is necessary in the public interest; but it is usual for certain persons to be allowed to enter hospitals or quarantine grounds in order to attend to patients suffering from contagious diseases, provided that proper attention is paid to certain sanitary laws. Clergymen did not hesitate, despite the dangers, to go with our troops to the Front, and, no doubt, they were a source of comfort to many of the wounded and dying to whom they ministered. We can well understand what were the feelings of those who were compulsorily placed in quarantine at North Head, Sydney, when they found that the attendance of a clergyman was denied- them. Attendance upon the sick and the dying is regarded as one of the most sacred duties of the church, and I have been requested by Archbishop Kelly, who is one of my constituents, to impress upon the Government that a serious error was made in refusing admission to a Roman Catholic clergyman to enter the quarantine station at Sydney. Representatives of the churches have always had access to leper settlements, as well as to other places for the treatment of contagious diseases, and while I know the Government have now withdrawn from the stand originally taken up by them in this matter, T wish to urge upon them the importance . of seeing that there is no recurrence of the incident. At a meeting held in St. Mary's Cathedral, and attended by various organizations associated with the Roman Catholic Church, the following resolution was carried: - </para>

                            <para>That this meeting of Catholic societies assembled, under the presidency of the Archbishop of Sydney, most strongly protests against the action of the authorities of the Quarantine Station in refusing admittance to a Catholic priest to attend the sick and dying; and likewise protests against the pretexts used by the officials of " military chaplain " and " personal temperament " to exclude appointee of Archbishop, and appeals to the Prime Minister, in the name of Christianity and humanity, to appoint urgently, a commission of inquiry to report upon the extraordinary attitude of the authorities in this matter. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para>Honorable members generally will subscribe to this resolution. In practically every town and hamlet throughout Australia there has been some form of protest against the original refusal of the authorities to allow a Roman Catholic priest to visit the quarantine station to minister to the sick and the dying. I am glad that the Government have altered their course of action ; but I still think that they must have been rather loose in their arrangements, or were attempting to place in the way more obstacles than were necessary to prevent clergymen and others visiting the sick and dying at the Quarantine Station. It certainly is strange that," while strong action was taken against members of the Church, telegrams from Sydney have told us that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Elkington, Dr. Cumpston,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mitchell</inline> visited the station, and that one of these gentlemen subsequently took up his quarters in an hotel in the city. Of this circumstance the Government must have had some information, because the facts were intimated to the House. However, I feel so strongly in the matter that, at the request of Archbishop Kelly, I deem, it my duty to bring the matter under the notice of honorable members. I do not wish to labour the subject, but as one who has worked in hospitals full of infected patients - at one time in the small-pox hospital, containing about 800 patients, and at another time in the hospital field, with other forms of what people in my particular calling know as " dirt diseases " - my experience has shown that persons may enter such places and keep free of infection if they only take the ordinary proper precautions. Medical men and attendants are not attacked in any great proportion if we keep in view the number of patients they have tq attend, although, of course, there are some who become careless, and render themselves liable to infection. I feel sure that the clergy, if permitted to enter the Quarantine Station, would willingly submit themselves to any necessary discipline, and, in my opinion, the Government have been just a little too hasty in their action. </para>
                        <para>There are, I know, some in the community who would raise the sectarian issue, but I am confident that there are representatives of other churches and religious persuasions who, with those of the Catholic Church, would be quite prepared to enter quarantine and attend to the sick and dying. When the war broke out the clergy of various denominations offered their services, and advanced to most dangerous places on and near the firing line in order to carry out their duties. I feel all the more anxious to bring this matter before the House today because I think that, in the future, no Government will refuse to permit clergymen to enter such places. I am glad the Government have taken the steps that have been intimated to us to-day: and I can only hope that the regulations to be issued will hot be such as to prevent representatives of the churches from ministering to the sick and the dying. </para>

Under the sad .circumstances that prevail in the Quarantine Station, there is always a strong desire for spiritual advisers on the part of those who are ill or passing away; and the question now under discussion has excited considerable attention throughout the Commonwealth. I have an important letter from a public meeting at which a resolution was carried condemnatory of the action .of the Government in not making provision for ministers of religion to enter the Quarantine Station when they were prepared to remain there and take the consequences. Considering that the clergy were prepared to enter into quarantine and take all the responsibility even to the extent of staying there, it is regarded as very hard on the part of the Government to refuse the request. </para>

                        <para>T quite realize that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has to-day considerably modified his attitude, and I give him the credit of being actuated by the best of motives in his desire to stamp out the disease. As I have said, this prohibition affects every section of the community, and various meetings have been held in my district, not confined to one religion, which have condemned the action of the Government. One day last week, on the adjournment of the House, I mentioned the matter, and the Minister gave me a reply, but owing, I believe, to the lateness of the hour, the remarks then made were not given publicity. This is a pity, for, otherwise, the public would have known earlier what are the facts of the situation. On that occasion, the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> supported me'; but, as I say, there was no report of the incident. It appears to me as though the matter has been re-opened to-day by a pre-arranged question from the Government side of the House, although it is a fact that hitherto attention has been called to it only by members on this side. However, the Government have taken a step in the right direction. I cannot understand why any exception was taken at the beginning to the clergy entering the Quarantine Grounds, seeing that they were prepared to remain there. In to-day's press there is a letter from the Reverend L. Rentoul- </para>

The letter I have referred to shows what is in the public mind, namely, that the clergy desire to attend the Quarantine Station, and at the same time to continue to mix with the general community. As a matter of fact, as I stated last week, the clergy have made it very clear that they are prepared to remain in quarantine and take all risks. It was a matter of religion with them. They referred particularly to Nurse Egan, -a woman who has done immense service during the war. She was passing away, and although Archbishop Kelly was in telephone communication with the hospital', it was impossible to gain admission for a priest to administer spiritual consolation. The Archbishop stated that there were plenty of priests who were prepared to remain at the Quarantine Station until all danger . of spreading infection had passed, and he himself volunteered to go there. I should not be prepared to allow any person to come and go among the community at large after being in contact with infectious patients, but permission to do this was not asked for. It might be well if gentlemen in positions such as that  of  the Reverend <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Rentoul</inline> would make themselves acquainted with the facts before writing to the press. Doubtless his intention was to assist the Minister, but actually he did an injustice to him. I am glad that the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> has brought up this matter,, and I am glad, too, that the Minister has given way to some extent. It is to be regretted that, in the first instance, ministers of religion were not permitted to enter the Quarantine Grounds to  give spiritual consolation to patients who were passing away. </para>

                            <para>.- I am glad that the Minister has relaxed the rule in regard to the admission of ministers of religion to the Quarantine Grounds. x Last week when speaking upon the question, after it had been raised by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> I said that quarantine regulations were difficult to interfere with, but that if ministers of religion were prepared to remain in quarantine as long as the authorities considered necessary to prevent the spread of infection, they should be allowed to go there. One of the most famous examples of religious heroism is the case of Father Damien, who ministered to the lepers on the island of Molokai, knowing 'full well that it was only a question of time when he himself must become a victim to the most dreadful disease that afflicts humanity. Even those of us who do not belong to the Roman Catholic faith know how much importance the adherents of that church attach to the ministrations of the priest in the final moments of life, and the Government should be very careful not to give offence to any section of the community in matters affecting religion. </para>

                        <para>I hope that there will be no more deaths in quarantine during the present epidemic. I admire the way in which the Department has prevented the disease from getting into Australia. The doctors knew comparatively nothing about it. They had no previous experience of it, and it was not known whether it could be kept within the limits of the quarantine. Thank goodness, it has been checked. Had there been no quarantine, Australia would have suffered the loss, not of 2,000 or 3,000 citizens, as New Zealand has done, but of front 15,000 to 20.000. </para>

                                <para>- I would not allow any tran who was in contact with a quarantined patient to leave the grounds while there was danger of the infection being spread. There has been, however, misapprehension as to what was desired. Nine out of ten members of the public seem, to think that permission was sought to enter the Quarantine Ground and leave again after the sick had been ministered to. The Reverend <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Rentoul</inline> evidently fell into that error, because in his letter he says that if priests were prepared to stay in the Quarantine Ground until the risk of spreading infection had disappeared, they had the right to be admitted. I am glad that the regulations have been relaxed in this matter, and I hope that, before long, the quarantine will be unnecessary. </para>

I wish that I could congratulate the Government upon the manner in which it has backed down. Other speakers have taken advantage of the 'occasion to point out that it was only from this side of the House that protests were made against the attitude of the Department. ' No doubt, many men on the Ministerial side held strong views on the subject, but their voices were not heard until to-day, when the Minister, knowing that a motion was likely to be moved, put into the mouth of a supporter a question to which he had prepared a carefully worded reply. </para>

                                <para>- It was obvious, from the difficulty that the member experienced in reciting his question, and from the reply of the Minister. The Minister might well have adopted the more generous attitude adopted in another place, where the leader of the party of which I have the honour to be a member .was informed that if he asked a question on the subject, a reply would be forthcoming, and the moving of the adjournment would be unnecessary. However, different Ministers different methods. </para>

                        <para>I cannot allow the occasion to pass without commenting adversely on the conduct of the Government. While Ministers have been reflecting at leisure upon the obvious means of escape from the impasse into which their ill judgment had brought them, we have witnessed the tragedy of a woman dying in quarantine without the ministrations of her church, to which, in a civilized country, and particularly in a free country like this, she was clearly entitled. There is neither precedent nor parallel for the refusal to allow spiritual consolation and support to be given to a person desiring it. It has been suggested in the press that the test of the good faith of the clergy in this matter was their willingness to remain in quarantine after they had been in contact with patients until all risk of the spreading of infection had passed. One might have supposed that a distinguished  cleric like the Rev. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Rentoul</inline> would have kept himself sufficiently well informed to be aware that no minister of religion had asked for permission to enter the Quarantine Ground except on the condition that he would remain there subject to such restrictions as the Government might think fit to impose in the interests of public safety. I appreciate the good feeling and generous expression of the Minister the other day in acknowledging the heroism of those who are prepared to take the risk of coming into contact with sufferers from this dread disease; but I remind him, with great respect, that the patronizing applause of a Minister of the Crown is very poor consolation to a person charged with the serious duties of a minister of religion, who finds himself prevented from giving spiritual relief and comfort to those who have the strongest reasons for asking for it. </para>
                        <para>I hope that the House will be informed whether it is a fact that doctors and nurses have been, and are still, permitted to leave the quarantine area, and to mingle with the general public, staying at places of public resort like hotels. If that has been done, it is - remembering the statement of the Minister that no certain preventive against the disease has been discovered - a scandal of the gravest character. </para>

                        <para>It is no longer necessary to urge reasons for the concession which is now to be given. All I would say, in conclusion, is that, although in this country there have been many bitter political crises, and much bitter political exchange' in this and other legislatures, at no time has any Australian Government, nor, I venture to hope, has any Government in any part of the Empire, hitherto deliberately stood between a penitent and a patient and his spiritual consoler and adviser. The reason is that the people of this country are not prepared to abandon spiritual ideals merely on the ground of expediency or of public or private safety. When the time comes, as it sometimes does, to say whether the right thing should be done, in scorn of consequence, or whether it is to be shirked in craven fear of personal or public danger, this country, I hope, will always be prepared to take its stand for the free exercise of essential conscientious conviction. </para>

                            <para>.- While I yield to no man in my desire to assist the authorities to stamp out a scourge by the use of the strictest means possible, it seems to me that no good purpose was achieved by the action of the quarantine officer in preventing the sister, who had gone into the Quarantine Station to help to suppress the scourge of pneumonic influenza, from, receiving the comfort of a clergyman's ministrations in her dying moments. The Minister has told us that the position will be rectified ; but I think it should be made plain that where clergymen of any denomination are asked to attend the dying in quarantine, no barrier should be put in their way so long as they comply with the regulations that are deemed necessary to safeguard the population generally from the spread, of disease. Nothing more need be said than to stress, in the strongest terms possible, one's regret that, notwithstanding the difficulties facing the quarantine officials in the discharge of their most important duties, no arrangement was made whereby patients in the Quarantine Station could receive the ministrations of clergymen in their dying hours. As the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> has pointed out, this sister expressed a wish to have the services of a priest, and her request was not acceded to. I trust that this will never be permitted to happen again in this fair land of ours. </para>

                            <para>.- I was the first to bring this matter under the notice of the Minister, and I found him very sympathetic. Subsequently I made inquiries from a reverend gentleman as to who could furnish me with information on the matter referred to by the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> and I handed his name to the Minister, but I think the Minister followed the right course in accepting the advice of his medical men. At that time it was not clear that proper provision could be made for clergymen in the Quarantine Ground, owing to the limited accommodation available there. On one occasion I was quarantined at North Head, and while I was there men came into the Quarantine Ground, saw cases, and walked about again. </para>

                        <para>Dr.MALONEY.- On that occasion children left the Quarantine Ground, attended school, and came back again. One lady who had a relative in a high position in Sydney was able to get out of quarantine before any other passengers, probably on the principle that kissing goes by favour. Tradesmen came into the place and went away again, and I ascertained that some of the officials had not been vaccinated for years. I sent some strongly worded telegrams to the then Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor).</inline> Women who were unfortunate enough not to be saloon passengers had to bathe in receptacles 2 ft. 10 in. long, 1 ft. 10 in. wide, and 10 in. deep. The saloon passengers were willing to share their accommodation with the steerage and second-class passengers, but it was not permitted. As showing the ignorance of the man who was supposed to be in the position to supply the Minister with information concerning the matter, I may say that he told the Minister that there were plenty of hot shower-baths for the people whose part I was taking, whereas, as a matter of fact, there was not a single hot shower-bath provided outside those for the saloon passengers. It is a psychological moment for mentioning the matter to which I now wish to draw attention. People who are quarantined are practically imprisoned for the benefit of the rest of the community. If a millionaire is sent into prison, his treatment is identical with that of the pauper who commits a similar crime. Similarly, I maintain that there should be no distinction between saloon and steerage passengers who, although they have com- . mitted no crime, are imprisoned for the benefit of the whole community. </para>
                        <para>I am informed by credible witnesses that certain individuals did go into the Quarantine Ground to examine patients, and came out again. As a medical man, I know that a perfunctory walk through a disinfecting chamber may perhaps destroy germs, 'but it is far safer to treat any person who goes into the Quarantine Ground as a contact, and detain him as such. </para>

The statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reed</inline> in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline> has been severely contradicted by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Lambert,</inline> a passenger on board the <inline font-style="italic">Manuka.</inline> It may have been etiquette on his part not to take charge of the ship, because he was not officially asked to do so by the captain. I understand that he did attend certain patients when he was asked to do so, but  he was not officially asked by the captain to take charge of the ship. I am informed that the bad cases were not isolated at Wellington. The isolation room was very small, and was not restricted to the <inline font-style="italic">Manuka</inline> passengers, as the passengers of the <inline font-style="italic">Monogwai,</inline> whose captain had died, and who were thus impregnated with the germs, were also sent into this room, where they mixed with persons who were presumably healthy. </para>

                                <para>- According to my information the room was very close; patients were spitting all about it; and one of these was a very bad case of tuberculosis. For three days the healthy passengers were subjected to this treatment. They were all mixed up with passengers from the infected ships in the harbor, and none of them was medically examined before they went on board. I am sure that if the Government request the quarantine authorities in Wellington to see that all intending passengers are medically examined, they will do so. My information further states that when <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mitchell</inline> came off to the vessel in Sydney harbor wearing a respirator, he simply casually asked, "How are you?" There was no examination. There was no separating of those who were dangerously ill, although there were thirty on board at the time. No orders or printed instructions were handed to the captain for the passengers to follow. The medical man simply told' the passengers to go ashore lightly clad. The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams),</inline> who was quarantined in Sydney with me, will know that stormy weather occurs there sometimes. We were told to have a bath, and to come ashore with light clothes. Subsequently, we were told that we would not be required to leave the ship that day ; but in the afternoon we were again ordered to have a bath, and go ashore. I said I would not have a bath on board, and change my clothes again. It appears to me that the same idiotic rules are being observed to-day. These people were told to go ashore lightly clad. As a consequence, many of them caught cold owing to the temperature suddenly dropping 22 degrees. It appears that they were for five days without any medical examination, and that there was no separation of the sick from the sound. Another complaint was that on board the vessel there was only one rat-trap. The rats were so numerous that altogether, sixty were caught -by means of this one trap, and seventeen were caught at one time. I am informed that when the vessel was brought to the wharf, no proper arrangements were made to prevent the rats leaving the ship. I do not contend that rats will carry this special disease, but we know that rats and vermin have carried disease from the trench to the ship, and from the ship to the shore. It is only right that we should treat this disease as if it were an infectious and contagious disease capable of being carried by vermin, if not by rats themselves, at any Tate, by fleas on the rats. We know by the discovery made in Sydney during the bubonic plague epidemic that fleas carried the disease to the human being. The information which I have received supports <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reed's</inline> contentions in almost every point, with the exception of that part where he was accused of threatening <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Graham</inline> that he would be sent away. It was well known on board the ship that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Graham</inline> was going. He simply intimated that it might be the result, not that he personally would have him removed. It is only fair to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reed</inline> to make that point clear. </para>

' Bad son though I may he at the present time of the old church in which I was reared, I do say -with full reverence for the faith of my childhood, that the Roman Catholic priests do not stand alone on the pinnacle of glory, but that other ministers of religion have offered their lives in the terrible turmoil and blood of battle, and at the bed of sickness. I do think, however, that the Roman Catholic priest carries his religion to the bedside in a more determined way than perhaps do the ministers of other religions. Of course, now that the Government have made what is, in my opinion, a fair settlement of the question, I have no desire to say anything further, but I am perfectly certain that any minister' of religion who is willing to go into quarantine, and put up with the accommodation, which I know from personal experience is most unfair, ought to be allowed that opportunity. </para>
                        <para>In conclusion, I urge the Minister to impress upon the heads of his Department that the Quarantine Station is not a prison in which persons are confined as punishment for a- crime. The inmates are held in control for the benefit of the whole community, and it is the duty of the Government  to treat them all equally and well. I can_ see no common-sense reason for. building splendid quarters' for the first-class passengers, inferior quarters for the second-class passengers, . and very bad quarters for the steerage passengers. That is. merely a continuance of that vicious principle which makes our transports a curse to the soldiers who are returning from the Front. We have heard honorable members relate cases of men seriously wounded being placed on the third deck, whence they could not have possibly escaped had any disaster befallen the ship. Will any honorable member deny that those who are most severely wounded and physically the weakest should be given the best deck on every transport? As the street of a city is open to every one of its citizens, so should the upper decks of a transport be free to every man who is poor in health. </para>

                                <para>- That may be; but the rule had been laid down and agreed  to  by the various Ministers who have controlled quarantine. The Director of Quarantine is still of opinion, even in face of the very restricted permission which the Government propose, that we should not depart from that rule, and that we are incurring an additional risk in doing, so. But, whilst safeguarding the community as fully as we° possibly can, we are prepared to take the additional risk, rather than wound the  religious susceptibilities  of our people. There is no need for me to follow all the arguments that have been adduced this afternoon; but I do wish to assure honorable members, on the authority of the Director of Quarantine, that* there is no truth in the statement that doctors and nurses are allowed to go into quarantine, come in contact with patients, and then mix with the general community. The Director  informs  me that, of course, the administrative officers', who do not come in contact with the patients, or even with the contacts, visit the quarantine area; but naturally there is a part of that area which is clean. But for that fact, people would never get out of quarantine at all. It is quite competent for 'officers of the Department to visit the clean area and come away; but it is not correct to say that those who do that have been in quarantine. The Government, in dealing with this question, have tried to find a way out of the difficulty in which they found themselves. We have not, as the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> suggested, reversed our decision. Our resolve in the first place was that ministers of religion could not visit patients in the ordinary way, even though they were dying. To have allowed them to do so would have added tremendously to the danger; but when the question arose, the Government, of their own volition, set to work deliberately to endeavour to find a basis of agreement which would concede the minimum required from the church point of view, and yet involve the minimum of risk to the community. It took  us  a few days to arrive at a decision ; but, now that it has been reached, I hope that it will prove workable, and that those ministers who may be called upon for religious service in quarantine will agree to abide by the regulations which have been laid down. I have no reason to believe that they will not do so, and, under those conditions, all that is necessary can be done to meet the religious requirements of our people, and, at the same time, reduce to a minimum the grave risk to the community. .Of course, the Quarantine Department, in the operation, of its duty, is required to do many unpleasant things. It has to place upon the people who come under its control restrictions which they do not like, and which naturally give rise to a great deal of criticism. But I do ask honorable members to believe that, in the face  of  the unprecedented call  which this  epidemic has made upon the Department,  we  are doing all  that is  possible  to mitigate  the severity  of  the conditions under which people  are  quarantined. I  hope, also, that  honorable  members will recognise the  nature  of the great  service  which the  quarantine authorities  will have ren </para>

                    <para>.- The Acting Prime Minister informed the House last week of the measures which he proposes to ask the House to agree to before adjourning about the 19th December. The business of pre-eminent importance is the War Precautions Bill and the Estimates. I have no objection to the House meeting at 11 o'clock in the morning; but as the Acting Prime Minister has given notice of his intention  to  move that standing order 70 be suspended, that will enable new business  to be  taken after 11 p.m. If we are  to  sit here from 11 a.m. until after 11 p.m. day after day,  it will be  impossible for us  to  do justice  to  those who send us here. </para>

                        <para>- The discussion of that measure, particularly by the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> and those sitting on his right, is likely to occupy some time. The Peace Conference is to meet in January, and, according to a press statement, is not likely to conclude before May, so that there is no reason why the Government should not postpone the further consideration of the War Precautions Bill until after the new year, and allow us to proceed at once with the discussion of the Estimates. We have only six or seven sitting days at our disposal before the 19th instant, when it is proposed we shall adjourn for the Christmas holidays, and in that time we cannot hope to give adequate consideration even to the Estimates, let alone other measures with which we are expected to deal. We are told that all the Departments are engaged in war work, and their expenditure is largely inflated. The Estimates, therefore, demand special attention, and we could proceed to deal with them at once if the Government would postpone the further consideration of the War Precautions Bill. In any event, I hope we shall not establish in Australia a precedent for sitting twelve hours a day. The Government propose not only that we shall meet at 11 a.m. each day, but 'that they shall be permitted to bring forward new "business after 11 p.m. If we are to meet at 11 o'clock every morning we should not be expected to -sit much later than 11 p.m. When the guillotine standing order waB passed, we were told that it would do away with the necessity for all-night sittings, and I hope that we are not to be asked now to return to those sittings. There is no reason why we should go the whole round of the clock. . </para>

In that way we have impaired our health, and at the same time have rushed measures through with so little consideration that subsequently they have had to be amended. If the Acting Prime Minister will say that he desires us to deal only with taxation measures and the Estimates before Christmas, I am sure the Opposition will assist him in transacting that business. Surely there is no hurry in regard to the War Precautions Bill. If we are to meet again in February or March next, there will be time enough then to deal with it. I hope the Acting Prime Minister will consider the effect of all-night sittings on the health of honorable members. The honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> is always demanding all-night sittings; but if he wants an opportunity to sit up all night, I recommend that he seek it elsewhere. It takes me three or four days to recover from the effects of an all-night sitting, and the effects upon some of the older members of the House must be still more injurious. </para>

                    <para>.- This affectation of intense industry on the' part of the Government towards the end of the year is, to say the least of it, unbecoming. In any - circumstances, it is objectionable to call the House together in the morning, and to expect it to sit all day and night since honorable members are thus denied an opportunity to discharge their duties to the ' electors who sent them here. The Government should try to learn that they would better con-  serve the interests of the country if they required the House to sit a greater number of days in the year than endeavoured at -the close of the year to crowd into a few hours work that might easily extend over several months. I feel that this Government, without Parliament sitting, and with the War Precautions Act still in existence, are far too great a public danger to be contemplated with a  serene spirit of resignation. The Government, while sitting, have armed themselves, first, with the lethal weapon of the " gag," and with that new invention of Satan which enables them to cut members off from the discussion of public questions of great importance. </para>

                <para>I speak with seriousness, however, as to the possibility of rushing legislation through in the closing days of the year. I shall oppose  this  motion, even to the extent of dividing the House upon it. There is no real hurry. If the Ministry would call upon the House to do its business in the ordinary way, and devote a reasonable number of days to the consideration of public business, there would be no necessity for sitting day and night just before Christmas. This, after all, is only a mere pretence designed to convince the public outside that the Government is energetic and full of industry. A proposal of this kind cannot deceive any one. The general public know that we meet here for only a few days, and that for the greater part of the year the country is governed by regulations. It is most objectionable that either this or any other country should be so governed. These secret processes, which were better known to Russia when she was our fighting Ally, and to Prussia when she was our enemy, are not. forms of procedure suited to this country. We should legislate in open Parliament in the light of day, and not by the objectionable secret processes of regulations. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps so. Our parliamentary institutions, as an honorable member reminds me, are falling into utter contempt in the public mind because of their abuse, and this proposal is apparently a mere piece of make-believe to persuade the people that the grand old British institution of Parliament is still in existence. If the Government would drop the War Precautions Bill - or if they would allow it to stand over until such time as its passing becomes in their view a necessity - there might be some reason in their proposal. The existing War Precautions Act will remain in operation for several months at least, so that there can be no urgency for the passing of the Bill providing for its continuation. The proper time to deal with it would be when the necessity arose - if, unhappily, it should arise - some months hence. I am opposed to this affectation of haste at the last moment, and do not apologize for taking up a little time in voicing my opposition to the motion. I am not impressed with the sincerity of the Government in proposing to compel honorable members to sit here morning, afternoon, and night when they might well give them a little more extended time' to deliberate in the ordinary way and during reasonable hours. </para>

                        <para>- The Government at present have various means at their disposal for gagging measures through; and this motion appears to be another. Matters of the most urgent public importance are being rushed through Parliament without adequate time for their consideration. Notice has been given of a motion that new business may be introduced after 11 o'clock at night, foreshadowing all-night sittings, commencing at 11 o'clock in the morning. Members of the Government and their supporters may keep the House in relays, while the others sleep, whereas a small Opposition is called on to criticise measures of the most urgent consequence over a period of twelve to eighteen hours per sitting. This is an impossible demand from the stand-point of physical endurance, and is tantamount to gagging through important measures without adequate discussion. If the business before the House is urgent there is no reason why there should not be an adjournment over Christmas for a fortnight, at the end of which we could re-assemble and consider matters in the reasonable way in which it is expected the National Parliament shall deal with business of importance. </para>

                        <para>- Not without good reason ; but the absence of one man does not affect the general position. Even when I was absent, in the case of the Electoral Bill, which revolutionizes the conduct of elections in this country, the Government gave so many hours for its consideration, and as it was not possible to proceed in the time allowed beyond some of the earlier clauses, the whole of the remaining clauses were "gagged " without any discussion at all. If there had been additional members in the House, the result would have been the same. </para>

When the Government are asking for additional time, I should be entitled to discuss questions about which there are very interesting rumours, both in the House and in the city; but apparently, under the Standing Orders, I am not allowed to do so. I object to the extra time, because it means a physical strain that will prove beyond our powers of endurance. </para></speech>

I am intensely anxious to get to Western Australia to find out, among other things, what is being done there in regard to repatriation, so as to be able on my return to give some aid in that work. The opposition to this motion is hardly fair to Western Australian members. </para>

                <para>We have a lot of important business, and I, for one, have no intention to aid the Government in applying the closure unless that business is well debated. Amongst the business is the Estimates, and I regret that we have hot been called upon earlier to consider them, for I desire to see them fully discussed. Honorable members opposite ought to afford an opportunity to get as much work done as possible before the end of the. year. I hope that the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Watt),</inline> if we meet at 11 in the mornings, will not also ask us to sit all night, for all-night sittings are very trying to all. Now that we are here, and realize the enormous amount of work before us, I cannot see that any opposition to the motion be genuine. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable- member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> is one of the few members opposite whose appeal would be likely to have any weight with me. He, himself, has always shown a desire to criticise fairly the business brought forward by the Government; but there are other honorable members opposite, who, in this respect, are found wanting, and who shall be nameless. At the same time, I doubt whether the Government are in earnest when it is stated that the extra time is required for doing the business of the country. I see no evidence that the Government are in earnest about doing any business. </para>

                        <para>- I would not. I agree with the argument of the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts),</inline> that the Government have shown no desire to hurry matters, inasmuch as they have not yet dealt with an important statement affecting the honour of Parliament and the Government. If the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> were in earnest, and wished to hurry matters, he would have made that statement earlier to-day. </para>

                        <para>- It is said that the Acting Prime Minister wishes, to hurry matters, because he has delayed dealing with the Navy and Defence Administration Commission for weeks, as he seems to have delayed dealing with everything. On the business-paper there is a number of items which I do not propose to discuss in detail; but there is not a measure in regard to which there is any urgency. Why the War Precautions Bill? The country does not desire it, and it is not urgent. Nor is the Wartime Profits Bill urgent, and it also is not desired by the country. We do not require the Naval Defence Bill, nor the Defence Bill. There is, of course, the Income Tax Bill, and one or two other matters, but mainly the Estimates,, which must be dealt with. I venture to say, however, that the Estimates will not be brought forward in time for proper discussion, and when we can get any information about them. We are asked to meet at 11 o'clock in the mornings; and the honorable member for 'Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> desires to know when we are going into Committee on the Estimates. The Acting Prime Minister will not tell him. </para>

I suppose, however, that he will not bring forward the Estimates until about the 19th of the month, when he will ask us to sit. all night, and honorable members will then be too tired to properly consider them. </para>

The objection always urged against morning sitting is that they prevent Ministers from doing their work, and in war time Ministers are pretty busy. But I would object to meeting at 10 in the morning and continuing to sit all night.

If they are introduced two or three days before Christmas, we shall not have a chance to reduce them, which I hope may be done. Unless reductions are made in our expenditure, the burden of taxation must be increased. I know that the Acting Prime Minister is much harried and overwhelmed with business, but if he will promise that the Estimates shall be introduced on the first sitting day of next week, we shall know where we are. Much of the discussion on the War Precautions Bill and  the War-time Profits Bill might be saved if the Estimates were  dealt with first, because what would .be said on the Estimates would not be repeated when the Bills came before us. I know that members like the honorable member for Maribyrnong, whose home is in Melbourne, object to coming here at 10 in the morning, though others of us travel 1,000 miles a week to attend "to our parliamentary duties, and are physically exhausted in consequence. We have six months' work to do before the 19th December, and must lengthen our sittings either by remaining later or by coming earlier. If members will not come at 10 o'clock, I shall support the proposal to meet at 11 o'clock. </para>

                    <para>. - There are about six meeting days ahead of us, and even were we to extend our sittings much longer than is contemplated, that time might well be devoted to a parliamentary overhaul of the Postal Department alone. Members representing city and country constituencies have piles of postal complaints laid by. There is six months' work to be done before Christmas. I have not risen to reply to the taunt of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman),</inline> but to repeat the request that has been made to the Acting Prime Minister that he may inform us what Bills he actually requires before the session ends.

                        <para>- Last week the honorable member for Maranoa on two occasions asked questions regarding the supply of official' meteorological information to the press, and gave two instances in which he said private advices had anticipated the reports of the Bureau. I have ascertained that on both occasions the Meteorological Bureau had already furnished to the newspapers in detail and in synopsis weather reports of earlier date than the private advices which were published. Departmental reports were furnished to the newspapers on the 27th, 28th, 29th, and 30th November, and on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th September, but were not published. </para>

There are 383 stations there in which rain gauges are kept according to the regulations. The observations in these cases are more accurate than where made on less systematic lines. </para>

                    <para>With reference to the statement of Captain Goff, of Perth, telegraphed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Corboy,</inline> M.P., that having repaid a loan from this Department he was unable to obtain a release, I have inquired into the matter, and find that the difficulty in releasing these securities arose through the fact that the bills of sale had been taken over from the trustees of the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Fund, and were in the name of the Prime Minister. The Crown Ssolicitor had to be consulted in order to ascertain in whom the power to release these securities is now vested. Certain additional particulars were required by the Crown olicitor necessitating further correspondence with the State branch. An opinion was received from the Crown Solicitor on the 7th instant advising that the power to release these securities is now vested in the Minister. A power of attorney from the Minister to the Deputy-Comptroller, Perth, delegating the power to release the securities, is being prepared by the Crown Solicitor, and should be available for despatch by to-morrow. </para>

                            <para>The boring plants used on the first five bores were found to be quite unsuited for any depths over 300 feet, as the strata largely consisted of soft mud under considerable pressure, which filled the holes as fast as they were sunk. The bores, consequently, became choked, and were abandoned. Bore No. 5 was re-drilled in May, 1915. The oil horizon was isolated by cementing, and there was a small production - 100 gallons weekly, diminishing to 8 gallons weekly. The size of the casing was too small for further boring, and it was considered cheaper to bore a fresh hole. The mud pressure was very strong in No. 6, making work slow and costly. The plant in use was unsuitable for deep boring, and, in view of the mud difficulty, work was suspended. No. 7 bore - efforts to get the 4-in. casing deeper than 1,760 feet having ended persistently in failure, the work was stopped. This hole is several hundred feet deeper than the plant was designed to drill. </para>

This covers all outlay of every kind - salaries and wages, purchase of plants, purchase and operations of launch, repairs, insurance, construction of wharf, roads, and all travelling expenses. This last was an unusually heavy item, as men had to be brought from and sent back to the United States. Very substantial expenditure, in the way of leave of absence and medical attention, has been incurred owing to the unhealthy nature of the country. A large portion of this expenditure must be regarded as in the nature of general capital expenditure, and could not fairly be taken into account in estimating the cost at per foot of the bores already sunk. The result will be that the cost will show a gradually diminishing rate per foot. Very substantial reductions in boring costs have already been effected. The cost of boring in bores Nos. 6 and 7 ranges from £2 to £6 per foot. 8. (a) £38,187; (b) £57,963. </para>

                            <para>According to sworn evidence submitted to the Prices Commissioner in Melbourne recently by nine city and suburban grocers selected by the secretary of the Grocers' Association of Australia, the working expenses, including 10 per cent. per annum on proprietors' capital and salaries for proprietors, including overtime, was proved to be 20.9 per cent. of turnover, or, exclusive of interest on capital, 18.19 per cent. The profit allowed to grocers on sugar at present amounts to slightly over 12 per cent., but no authoritative statement can be made as to profits made on this commodity before it was controlled by the Government.

These proposals will involve the Commonwealth in much larger financial participation in the States' schemes, and will prove more advantageous to the States, and to the soldier settlers, than an increase of the amount of the existing advance. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>I was informed yesterday, by a passenger from America, who was quarantined from Sydney recently, that the Quarantine Station there is in a very neglected and dirty condition, and that' when he complained to the medical man in charge he was told that the medical authorities had nothing to do with the cleanliness of the place; that the station was supposed to be cleaned out each time by the ship's crew that had used it. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs knows how prone some persons are to leave places in a dirty condition, and I ask him if he will inquire whether the practice is as stated; and, if so, whether he will alter it, and appoint some, one to keep the station in a thoroughly clean condition for the reception of quarantined persons? 1 am now able to furnish the honorable member with the following information :- - </para>
                    <para>The position is that the cleaning up after occupation by a vessel in quarantine is carried out as a matter of routine by the quarantine staff. The person who interviewed the honorable member for Parkes must have misunderstood whatever statement was made to him. lt is, however, the practice that the steward's department of any vessel in quarantine sees to the wants of the passengers on shore, just as it acts on the vessel itself during the voyage; and, while the passengers are in occupation, .these stewards are expected to keep the passengers' quarters clean in the same way as they have to do while the ship is in motion. It is quite possible that some misunderstanding arose in this way. </para>

                        <para>.- When the War Precautions Act was originally introduced, two particular items emerged during the debate. The first was a protest by honorable members on both sides of the House as to the danger of intrusting the Government with the unlimited powers covered by the measure. The other point was the assurance given by the then Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fisher)</inline> that these powers would be used with discretion, an assurance equally positive and equally as strong as that given by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> last week that they would be exercised with the utmost discretion and reasonableness. The trouble is that the experience we have had during these four years of the administration of the War Precautions Act does not allow us to give much credence to all these protests and assurances. The Act as it now stands with its multitude of regulations is very different from what it was in 1914- 15 - so very different that we cannot draw an analogy between the two. Honorable members on the Ministerial side have twitted us with the fact that this measure was introduced by a Labour Government - the Acting Prime Minister also referred to the fact - but they omit one  vital point, namely, that while the Act was under the administration of a Labour Government there was not a single complaint that the Government had unduly used the powers given to them by it, or were lacking in appreciation of the powers it gave in regard to the conduct of the war. I challenge any honorable member on the Government side to point to one instance in which the powers of the Act were complained about by 'any honorable member' while they were administered, by a Labour Government. It was: not until Mr: Hughes returned from England, in 1916, and discovered that the Labour party was not a machine- to be used by him at his discretion or pleasure, but comprised men of some independence' of thought and independence of action that he found out what -a useful instrument the War Precautions Act was. The trouble in regard to the administration of the Act dates from that time. Prior to that the measure was legitimately used for the purposes for which it was introduced - proper purposes, legitimate purposes, and purposes which we are all now agreed were reasonable in the circumstances of the war; but since August, 1916, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> returned from England, it has been used for political purposes, and, worse still, as a means of exacting private revenge and satisfying personal spite. </para>

                            <para>- The War Precautions Act falls under two rough divisions. The first deals with trade and commerce, matters covering a whole multitude of . commodities and business activities - tol control which about twenty-four boards have been appointed. The second division deals with general aspects . affecting the- public, such as the censorship, internment, and so forth. It seems to me. also that- the - House is peculiarly divided on similar lines. ' Honorable members on the Government side wish to get rid as quickly as possible of the control over trade and commerce, but a number of them are rather anxious to retain the powers that deal with the other items, such as were suggested by the honorable member for New England  (Lt.- Colonel Abbott)  in his speech, matters dealing with disloyalty, internment, censorship, and so on. We; of the Opposition, - on the other hand, are anxious to maintain governmental control over business, but we .desire- to get rid of those extraneous interferences, which, however much they were justified in . war time, will, not- be justified when peace is proclaimed. The real questions -before the House are, '" Shall Government control of' trade and commerce be continued?" and, "Shall Government control over the publications and private affairs of the people be continued?" I am not at all surprised that honorable members on the Government side are anxious to get rid of Government control of trade and commerce. So far as their objection relates to such control being exercised under a War Precautions Act. I entirely agree with them. I do not believe that the trade and commerce of the country in peace time should be controlled under a special power applicable to war time. But I believe in the principle of governmental control, and one of the main difficulties that the Commonwealth Parliament has had to face throughout its career has been the lack of control over trade and commerce. Its limitations in that respect have been accentuated and emphasized during the last four years. When the War Precautions Act was introduced it was not believed that this Parliament had 'any control over those matters. Indeed, the Prime Minister (Mr.' Hughes); admitted that the powers under the War Precautions Act and the Defence Act did not give the Government the necessary control over trade and. commerce. I quote- from 'a- booklet that was issued- in connexion with, the referendum that was to have been taken on' the 11th December, 1915, in regard to the amendment of section 51 of the Constitution, in order to give the Commonwealth Parliament- complete, control of trade and commerce. In. this' booklet, stating the arguments for and against the proposition, the then Liberal Opposition stated their case in a very few words, principally stressing the opinion that the Defence powers of the Commonwealth in war time were so unlimited that there was no possibility of their being found insufficient for the purposes of the war, and that, therefore, there was no need to submit the referendum questions at that time. But the Government, which, so far as the War Precautions Act was concerned, was really <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> took the view that the powers under the Defence Act and the War Precautions Act were not sufficient. On page 11 of the booklet, the Prime Minister said - i </para>

                    </continue><para>We are at war, and the Commonwealth Parliament is charged with the great task of defending the country. To effectively perform its supremely, important functions the Commonwealth must have complete control of all the resources of the country and of every person in it. In order to grapple with the tremendous issues arising out of the war it is essential that the Government charged with the .responsibility should have absolute authority over capital and labour, but the Commonwealth has no control over either. % . . </para><para>Every other Parliament in the Empire has the powers we are asking for. These .Parliaments can protect the interests of the people if ,they choose. They can limit the profits of these unscrupulous persons who are heaping up war fortunes, regulate prices, and deal generally with trusts and monopolies. They can deal with strikes and industrial disputes generally. ,But the Federal Parliament -of Australia,- in the greatest crisis of -the modern world, when the entire fabric of civilization is cracking with the frightful strain, is powerless to deal with capital and labour, powerless to prevent the. exploitation of the people by capital, powerless to maintain industrial peace. </para><para>Later on, :he.said - </para><quote>
                        <para>The power to grapple with these is more urgently needed now than at other times. </para>
                    </quote><para>That was the tenor of the argument throughout ..the book, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> repeated the statement in this House, and privately to his party, that even the War Precautions Act did not grant the 'powers that should have been granted under the Constitution, and that, therefore, the Government proposed to ask the people to invest the Commonwealth with such powers. On two previous occasions the people had refused -to do that, and the reason why the third referendum was not proceeded with was that the Prime Minister reported to his supporters that he had made an arrangement with the Premiers, of New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria, that they should pass through the State Parliaments a uniform measure which would surrender to the Commonwealth Parliament for the period of the war all the powers proposed to be asked for by referendum. He further said that when the Parliaments of New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria had made that concession to the Commonwealth, the other States would come into line, and, therefore, the referendum would be unnecessary. Accepting that assurance, and believing that the course indicated was an easier and more agreeable way out of the difficulty, the party agreed not to proceed with the referendum. </para><interjection>

Finally, we had a suspicion 'that the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> regarding the promises and assurances given by the Premiers of Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria was not based on good foundation, and that there had not been that clear and explicit understanding between the parties that we had been led to believe.

Indeed, if its subsequent misuse had been even imagined when the Act was before Parliament, the measure would never have been agreed to by the Opposition. Honorable members can recollect how leading Liberals, members of long parliamentary experience, protested against even the powers then supposed to be conferred by the War Precautions Act How much more would they have protested, and how much more vigorously would they have opposed the passage of that measure, if they had had even the slightest suspicion that it practically abrogated the Constitution. It did do that, and the Acting Prime Minister, in his speech last week, admitted that we had abrogated our functions as a representative Parliament, and that the desire of honorable members was " to return to regular and constitutional methods of government as soon as possible." </para><para>I may explain to honorable members that 1 spent a good deal of time in preparing my speech on this Bill, because I am certain that a good argument can be advanced against the extension of the War Precautions Act for even one day after the proclamation of peace; but, unfortunately, 1 have developed a sore throat, which will compel me to curtail my remarks, and to confine myself to endeavouring to establish a few main propositions. </para><para>The speech of the Acting Prime Minister last week was obviously directed to the Government Corner party. I appreciate to the full the attitude taken up by those honorable members in opposition to the extension of the War Precautions Act. They know, as the people throughout the country know, what a serious inconvenience that Act has been to the conduct of business. It was originally intended for the purpose of mobilizing the resources of the country, and to be an instrument for so concentrating the available power of the country that all the energies of the people in every department of activity might be directed towards the defence of Australia.- To that principle honorable members on both sides of the House offered no objection. Never once during the war has any protest been made against the legitimate powers of the Government being properly directed to secure that end. But under the interpretation of these powers by the more recent Governments, control of trade and commerce by Governmental Boards and Ministerial interference has been so extended as to accomplish only a series of irritating and annoying irruptions amongst business people, who have been humiliated and irritated, and, in some cases, unreasonably restricted in 'the conduct of their affairs. The Acting Attorney-General, in moving the second reading of the Bill, quoted the opinion of a number of the Boards appointed by the Government to deal with various matters. Naturally, each of these authorities, to whom appeal was made, pointed out the difficulty and danger that would arise if their control were relaxed in the near future. The House would have been much more grateful if the Minister had quoted the opinions of the people whose businesses had been controlled. The honorable gentleman did not give us the opinions expressed by Chambers of Commerce, Chambers of Manufactures, and various other representative institutions  throughout the country, nor did he put before us the views of those whose hours of labour and conditions of employment have been interfered with. </para><interjection>

Those' in charge of them have not been hanging back; they have not been carrying large stocks or laying in big orders, in the belief that the war would continue indefinitely. They knew all along that there must be an end to the war at some time, and they have been laying their plans - whether rightly or wrongly remains to be seen - upon the assumption that, with the proclamation of peace, they would be allowed to adapt themselves at once to the new conditions. What they want above all tilings is to be free from the humiliating and irritating effects of the War Precautions Act and its regulations. </para>

It is positively certain that peace will not be proclaimed for the next two or three months. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has admitted that it is impossible to put a date to that period, but whether the period be long or short, it will be quite sufficient to enable the Government to ..make up their minds as to what business they must continue to control after peace is proclaimed. The Government have been assured repeatedly that we are ready to pass special Bills to give them power to continue their control over such matters. We object, however, to the continuation of an unlimited control over all matters merely because it is necessary to control a few. </para>

That, after all, is only. the beginning of such protests. The business people of this community have not yet realized what the Government proposal means; they are only beginning io waken up to it. Protests are already in circulation from the Labour organizations of the country, including a resolution .of protest from the Transport Workers Federation in Brisbane, which has been forwarded to me. It is only a matter of time when business .people, from, one end of the country to the other, will declare themselves in opposition to the Act. </para>

I take 'that attitude just as strongly as- 1 did in 1911, when the amendments of the Constitution were submitted to the people of Australia.

                            <para>- Of course, that is finished. Every Government since has carried on attempts at price-fixing, and in such a way that, as any one can realize who knows anything at all about' business affairs, it could not be a success, not only because of the methods, but because it was carried on by men who do not believe in it. Honorable members opposite, including the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> who clearly stated that he did not believe in. price-fixing as a principle, are not to be blamed for its failure, and I do not blame them in the least. I believe in the principle; but it can be imagined what a different thing it would be if price-fixing were administered by people who believed in it, and were determined to make it effective, as contrasted with price-fixing carried on by people who- do not believe in it. </para>

                    <para>While I believe in Governmental control over trade and commerce, and in price-fixing, I do not believe that it should be exercised under the powers of a war measure. It is a most lamentable thing that it is necessary in war time to take charge of the commercial affairs of the community in order to protect the public. That is not peculiar to our own country, and it is not characteristic of the British Empire only; it is, unfortunately, to be found in every other country. In war time people carrying on the business of the country take advantage of the direful opportunity to rob their fellows - that is the time for these " patriots " to begin their robbery. It is lamentable, as I say, that at this time in our civilization, the Government of  every country during tha late war has had bo take compulsory charge of trade and commerce in order to protect the people. However great the necessity may be in war time, I believe it is just as great in peace time, but I do not believe that such powers should be exercised under a war measure in peace time. Under our Constitution we have a proper and legitimate way to secure these powers to the Government. Now is the opportunity. There is plenty of time to ask the people of Australia to so amend the Constitution as to give the necessary power to the Government. Honorable members on the Government side have had considerable experience since the last referendum on the constitutional amendments . was taken, and the public of Australia also have had considerable experience. Whatever opposition there was - and it reduced itself to a very small matter - to the Government having the powers asked for in the second referendum in 1913, the public of Australia to-day ave ready to clothe this Parliament with full and complete powers over the trade and commerce of Australia. The State Governments, in my opinion, are inclined to come to an arrangement, and I suggest that constitutional amendment is the only and .proper way in which to give the powers that the Government seek to continue to exercise under the War Precautions Act. If there is time to put through a number of measures which the Government think it necessary to have, in order to continue control in some directions that, according to their ideas, cannot easily be abandoned, there is just as much time to prepare for submission to the people the amendments to the Constitution I have suggested. </para>
                    <para>If the War Precautions Act was not sufficient in 1916, I wonder how it has become all-sufficient now. The Government have found this measure not only useful to enable them to keep control over trade and commerce, but for other things. I have a feeling, and it is very strong, that if it were not that the Government desire to continue their interference with the liberties of the people of Australia, they would not ask for an extension of the War Precautions Act to continue their control over commercial affairs. If it were not for the belief that what the Government wish in this extension of the War Precautions Act is power to use it for political purposes, I would be willing to give them the extension to continue their control over trade and commerce; but I cannot agree to give them control over trade and commerce, carrying with it power to continue their unreasonable, unfair, un-British, irritating, and disgraceful interference with the ordinary liberties of the people of Australia. </para>
                    <para>I listened with amazement to the honorable member for New England (Lt.Colonel Abbott), though probably he is to be excused. I say not one word in regard to his services to the Empire, because we all, particularly those of us who could not go to the war ourselves, have a feeling of respect for those who were able to. go and did go. I have nothing but appreciation for the services of that honorable member to the country; and I may say that from what I have heard from soldiers who served under him, and knew him on the other side, he had an exceptionally good name amongst them. But while absent fighting for Australia he was evidently unaware of what was going on here. When he talked as he did the other night, and told us that we were unreasonable in objecting to ah extension of the War Precautions Act, which gave the Government power to deal with disloyal people and protect the Empire, he altogether overlooked what we have had to pass through, and what those of us who have been in opposition to the Government had to suffer while he was on the other side of the world. Does he  know  that under the powers of this Act, the manifesto which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> issued in connexion with the first conscription referendum was freely circulated amongst the soldiers, but that not  a  word of the views of the Opposition was allowed to reach them? Does he know that even an official cablegram sent by the State Government of Queensland - accepted and paid for - was not allowed to be delivered, and that under the powers of the War Precautions Act the soldiers at the Front were only given one side of the case? Does he  know that amongst the papers circulated amongst the soldiers at the Front was one paid for by the Government, and edited by a man paid by the Government, containing nothing but abuse, misrepresentation, and vile lying as to the attitude of the members of the Labour party? I have one copy of the paper here, <inline font-style="italic">All for Australia,</inline> which was regularly issued to the troops on the other side, and it contains the most scurrilous, unfair, villanous statements about members of the Labour party. </para>

But in connexion with the general election an even more despicable thing took place under the powers of the War Precautions Act. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> took care that his speech at Bendigo was sent in full and circulated amongst the troops, but only cooked extracts from a report of a speech by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> taken from a newspaper, were sent, and the Government had not even the courtesy to submit the matter to that gentleman before sending it. Ordinary decency should have prompted the Government to say, " Well, the honorable gentleman might at least be shown what we are cabling in his name," but nothing like that was done; the War Precautions Act gave them the power, and they used it. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and we know how the honorable member for Ballarat was refused over and over again every opportunity to put our case. Indeed, he was threatened with arrest because he did something on his own initiative in connexion with the matter. Then we must remember that statements' published in the British press were refused publication here, and it is a peculiar thing that the refusal to permit publication applied particularly to the Labour newspapers. In many instances the Government newspapers were allowed to publish extracts from British newspapers and magazines which the Labour newspapers were prohibited from reprinting. There are nearly 200 publications which circulate freely in the Old Country and in the Allied countries which are prohibited in Australia. Labour newspapers have even been refused permission to publish official statements. Is the honorable member for New England (Lt.-Colonel Abbott) aware that under the authority of the War Precautions Act State Government offices have been raided and State Government papers have been seized by the military? Is he aware that under that Act this House was raided, and the property of a private member seized by the military? Does he know that the Trades Hall and the homes of the officials of the Trades Hall were raided by the military, and private papers seized? Is he aware that Australian citizens have been arrested without warrant? He is a lawyer, and I ask him what is his opinion of the action of the Government in arresting citizens of this so-called free country without warrant, in imprisoning them without a charge, and in sentencing them without a trial. In some cases in which a Court has imposed a sentence the persons who have served that sentence are still interned under the War Precautions Act. Is the honorable member aware that men have been arrested and deported from the country, and that their relatives have been refused permission to see them, or to communicate with them, and have no information as to where they have gone? There are to-day in Australia women who do not know where their husbands are, their husbands having been deported, and having been refused permission to correspond with their wives and families. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking of Australian citizen's. Is the honorable member for New England aware that, under the War Precautions Act, citizens of many years standing, against whom there has not been a mark for bad conduct, private or public, have been deprived of the rights of citizenship, and prevented from voting at a general election? Does he know that public meetings have been prohibited, and that when a deputation of women wished to interview the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> in front of this House, they were refused permission to do so, and that next day a regulation was issued under the War Precautions Act making it illegal for any one to hold a meeting near this building ? Yet within a few weeks of the issue of that regulation hundreds of men connected with the meat industry were permitted to hold a meeting on the steps of Parliament House, and within this building, without a word being said against it. According to some of the officials, on that occasion damage was done to the paintings in the Queen'sHall. </para>

Is he aware that under the War Precautions Act the flying of certain flags and the wearing of certain emblems is prohibited, and yet, according to the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> it is. impracticable to frame a regulation under that Act to prevent the use of the Union Jack and Australian flags as trade advertisements? The list of the wrongs that have been done under the War Precautions Act is endless, and when men talk from that side of the House of the need for preventing disloyalty and the flying of the red flag, I ask whether the flying of that flag is an offence comparable with those that have been committed under the War Precautions Act? Freedom and liberty have disappeared from this country under the administration of that Act. </para>

It is because of that argument that I have made my protest against the extension of the War Precautions Act and the War Precautions Regulations. If it is necessary for the Federal Government to hold the powers now exercised under that Act there is a regular and constitutional method of achieving that end, one that is easily applied and one that can be applied immediately. I believe that the Federal Government should have control over trade and commerce, corporations, and industrial matters, but, because I think that there is a much better method of securing the desired end than that which is proposed by the Government, I move - </para>

I recommend the acceptance of my amendment, and I urge the Government during the recess, and before peace is proclaimed, to get the authority of the people of Australia to do those things which they say are necessary; and which can only be done now under the War Precautions Act. It is because of the unreasonable exercise of the provisions of that Act, and because of the use to which it has been put, that I think it much better to follow a constitutional method of governing Australia. If what I suggest is done we shall know where we stand in regard to national matters. </para>

                        <para>. - As a party move the honorable member was justified in the try-on he has attempted so unsuccessfully. The Bill seems to have very few friends. It has certainly very few on the Government side of the House; it has none on the other side of the House, and I do not think there are many very ardent supporters of it even among Ministers . Although the community generally has suffered very heavily during the war, it has submitted with extraordinary fortitude, because it was realized that when the nation was at War, discipline was necessary, and that the people of the Commonwealth should be practically governed by martial law, and more or less despotic rule quite inconsistent with a general and ordered system of government. The Executive has, during the war, practically usurped the functions of Parliament, and this is most undesirable. There are two parties in regard to this measure, on the one hand those who desire the removal of the restrictions on trade and commerce as far as it is possible to do away with them, and, on the other hand, our friends opposite, who desire the immediate repeal of the Act in order that the regulations dealing with law and order, covering such matters as disloyalty, censorship, restriction of public meetings, and so on, may cease to operate. I am one of those who desire that the Act shall be terminated at the earliest possible moment, because of the grave restrictions it has imposed upon the business community. The trading community of Australia have suffered very severely during the war. The honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> has not overstated the serious embarrassments they have suffered by reason of the restrictions placed upon them, but we must bear in mind that serious results would follow in several directions by the immediate cessation of the Act. The commercial and trading community had a right to expect that as soon as peace was declared, which event may not take place for the next five or six months, they would be rid of the exacting and irksome restrictions of the War Precautions regulations from which they have suffered so much, and if they were appealed to to-morrow they would be practically unanimous in asking for the repeal of the Act. Of course I know that there are exceptions. Many wool-growers and some farmers unions are desirous of seeing certain regulations continued, but I carry on business in the heart of Melbourne, and mix daily with members of the business community, and I know that a unanimous demonstration has taken place so far -as representative organizations are concerned, asking for the earliest possible repeal of the Act. In this regard the community of Australia are not singular. There has been throughout the length and breadth of the United Kingdom a universal demand for the repeal of the Defence of the Realm Act. People who have suffered from the restrictions imposed upon them by that Act are clamouring to be released from the embraces of "Dora," as the measure is popularly named, and the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, as well as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law, has strongly declared the Government's determination to repeal the Act as soon as possible. We are entitled to the same consideration in this community. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is putting a difficult question. While it is true, according to the Bread case, that . we practically became a unified Constitution when war was declared, and the Commonwealth Government was able to exercise the powers of a unitary Government, quite irrespective of the State divisions provided for by the Constitution, yet I think the true legal position is this : We have all the plenary powers of defence during the war; but, when the war has ceased, we have, I think, all the powers necessary or incidental to the completion of the work commenced under the defence powers while the war was in operation. In other words, the Commonwealth will have the power to clean up everything incidental to the powers exercised under the War Precautions Act during the course of the war. </para>

                            <para>- The powers df the Commonwealth are specifically laid down in the thirty-nine articles set out in section 51 of the Constitution. All residuary powers go to the States, and are the sovereign rights of the States. The Commonwealth has exercised jurisdiction as a' unitary Government over many matters by reason of the operation of war and its special defence power, but when once that jurisdiction is lost, the Commonwealth will have no statutory authority to deal with them at a subsequent date, except for the power given by the War Precautions Act and for cleaning up the matters therein dealt with. That is one of the difficulties facing the Government. They have to make up their minds as to which powers they desire to continue, and, in regard to any powers they exercise in respect of which jurisdiction is of a joint character as between the Commonwealth and the States, if they have not the power under the War Precautions Act to carry out .certain things, it can only be done by the joint effort of the Commonwealth and the States. That is to say, the States would have to surrender the necessary power before the Commonwealth could deal with it. </para>

                    <para>The Bill in its present form purports to authorize the Government to carry out everything it was previously authorized to do while we are in a state of war. I think the measure in its present plenary form is unfair. I have never concealed my view in regard to the duty of the Government. In dealing with this matter I hold that it was their duty to go through the existing regulations analytically, make up their minds as to what they thought it desirable to retain - for instance, the trading powers, which they regard as desirable to enforce - and then come down to the House and say, " These are the powers we desire to exercise; these are the regulations we desire to retain in force." Honorable members would then know where they stood, mid we would have given the Government authority, as far as we possibly could, to carry out what was necessary in regard to the limited subjects directly submitted to us. I am sorry that the Government have not done that, and are placing members like myself in a very difficult position in regard to the measure now before the House. The Government have seen fit, however, to make a specific declaration, and the statement made by the Acting Prime Minister is practically similar to the assurances given in regard to the Defence of the Realm Act by both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law, in the Imperial Parliament. I listened with interest to what the Acting Prime Minister said, and, although I do not agree with all he said, and, speaking generally, am opposed to this Bill, I cannot ignore the assurances which have been given. The Acting Prime Minister has given his solemn pledge that the War Precautions regulations will not be used for any political purpose. </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister has said a good many things. The Acting Prime Minister told the House that no new policy will be introduced under the Act, except in the event of some unforeseen national emergency; that there will be a gradual and steady removal of the governmental interference with commerce, with the object of reducing conditions to normal at the earliest opportunity. Further than that, he said that he louts forward to the time, as early as possible in the New Year, when legislation will supersede the various regulations that have been made under the War Precautions Act. I am prepared to accept the personal assurance of the Acting Prime Minister; but I realize that grave risks are involved. I do not hesitate to say that the extension of the War Precautions Act should be for three months instead of six months. All sorts of political exigencies may be created; and whilst the Acting Prime Minister no doubt gave his solemn pledge, with the full intention of carrying it out, yet various unforeseen circumstances may arise which will prevent that being done. I would have preferred that this Bill had not been introduced at this stage, because probably a period of six. months will elapse before the War Precautions Act automatically terminates on the proclamation of peace. So far as I am concerned, the Government cannot repeal that Act quickly enough; but I make this stipulation, that if they repeal it, the repeal shall be accompanied by the enactment in legislation of the existing regulations relating to disloyalty. </para>

These bodies are enemies of the Empire, and, during the period of war did all in their power to wreck the Empire. They must be both watched and controlled. </para>

                    <para>Yesterday and to-day it gave <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline> full opportunity to present his views upon the issues involved. After due deliberation, Ministers adopted the conclusion of the Commission that there was no evidence to connect <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline> with the receipt of money in connexion with the acquisition of the Shaw Wireless Works, but decided that the findings of the Commission and the matters disclosed in the report rendered it undesirable that he should remain a member of the Government. The Government have consulted the  chairman  and secretary of the Commission and the law advisers of the Commission as to whether a further investigation of any kind would elicit any additional information relating to this transaction, and in each case the answer was an emphatic negative. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline> has intimated to me that he considers he has been exonerated from wrong-doing, and he does not intend to resign from the Government. With the unanimous approval of Ministers, I am taking without delay the necessary steps to arrange his retirement from the Government. I am in communication with  His Excellency  the Governor-General, and am informing the Prime Minister of the action taken. </para>
                    <para class="block">As to the findings of the Commission with respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long,</inline> Cabinet further determined that eminent counsel be asked to consider and advise whether the evidence taken discloses any fact which would justify or demand action in a Court of law, and further to advise as to the powers, precedents, and procedure of Parliament in cases of this character.

                        <para>. - I desire to say, in the first place, that I had no idea of the results of the deliberations of Cabinet, which have just been read to the House by the Acting Prime Minister. Recently a serious statement was made concerning my honour and integrity. Without any hesitation, I asked the Acting Prime Minister to relieve me of my administrative duties in the Customs Department, pending an inquiry into the allegations. I have carefully read the report of the Commission, and I was present throughout its inquiry, and I declare without hesitation that the summary of the facts given in the Commission's report is not in accordance with the evidence taken. I refer to the portions of the report dealing with my administration of the Navy Department.' I have been absolutely exonerated by the Commission from any wrong-doing or suspicion of corruption. There is no doubt about that. But I have been attacked by the Commission for carrying out the policy of the Government of which I was a member. I have taken it upon myself to not at all times comply with the directions of even a Rear- Admiral. That officer put a minute upon a file in relation to a proposition for taking over a certain industrial concern, to the effect that the operations of industrial enterprises by the Government had not been a success, and he was opposed to the taking over of this concern by the Commonwealth for that reason. I was a member of a Government that was returned by the people only twelve months before upon a policy, one of the principles of which was the nationalization of industries I took it upon myself to refuse to be tied down by the terms of a minute of a member of the Naval Board. I declined, as a member of the Executive, to be controlled by him in that way. I defied him. For doing that I am blamed by this Commission. I am blamed by it because I dared to go outside a minute or a report by a naval officer. </para>

                    <para>I was under cross-examination foi several hours by one of the most eminent lawyers in Australia, and I desire that every honorable member shall carefully read my evidence-in -chief , as well as that given by me under cross-examination. I fearlessly assert that I was not shaken in any way by the cross-examination to which I was subjected with regard to my actions as Minister for the Navy. I fear nobody. The Commission- has pointed to certain little matters in my administrative work, and has magnified them to the greatest possible extent. I want every honorable member to carefully read the whole of the evidence before arriving at any conclusion in regard to myself. </para>
                    <para>T have explained all these matters to the Government. I have been with them for the last two days. They have wanted my resignation; I have refused to hand it to them. I will not give it to them, and I dare them to take my office from me. Even now the Government say they can remove me -from the Department of Trade and Customs and put another Minister in my place. I do not know whether they have power to do that until I have left the office, and I have not yet done so. In the statement just made by the Acting Prime Minister I heard, for the first time, of the action which they propose to take to bring about my retirement. I intend during the next few days, with the permission of the House, to put my case fully before honorable members. I hope that I shall have ample time afforded me to do so. That I think the Government will grant me. At the first opportunity I shall put every aspect of my case before the House, and I feel I can put before honorable members a statement of facts which will secure for me the sympathy of all parties. I fear no one, since I have done no wrong; but at this juncture I shall say no more. </para>

                        <para>. - I am rather surprised that the .honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best),</inline> who was granted . leave to continue his remarks, was not prepared to resume when called upon to do so. In the course of his address he endeavoured in an exceptionally laboured way to explain what would be the legal position if this Bill became law. He took the view that if, after the official declaration of peace, the validity of the War Precautions Act was challenged it was exceedingly probable that the Court would hold that, since the Government had been granted these powers during [the war period, they were entitled to a further extension of the Act to enable them, so to speak, to clean up. I shall not attempt ito controvert tha opinions of a legal member of the House, but in legal circles it is generally considered that if an appeal were made to the High Court at the present time the decision in the Bread case would be reversed. The information I have from an exceptionally good source is that, if this Bill becomes law, its validity will not be upheld on appeal to the High Court. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps so. Afterpeace has been proclaimed, I do not think any legal tribunal is likely to uphold any action taken by the Government under the War Precautions Act. The Parliament of the United Kingdom is in a category different altogether from that of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. The British Parliament is supreme in all matters. Under the Constitution, certain powers have been delegated to us, but there still reside in the States many powers, and, in my humble judgment, a Court of law would decide that any action taken under the War Precautions Act or regulations framed under it, after the proclamation of peace, was unconstitutional. In these circumstances, therefore, it seems to me that we are engaged upon a useless discussion. In any event, we might well allow the consideration of this proposal to stand over until wo resume next year. If that were done a very different Bill might be put. before us. </para>

The honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson),</inline> in an exceptionally good speech this afternoon, urged that if the Government desired wider powers, they should seek them in a constitutional way by asking the people to agree to an amendment of our Constitution. The temper of the people at the present time is such that I believe they would grant to Parliament an enlargement of its powers. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has been able to satisfy his supporters in regard to the wisdom of this proposal. I can only Fay that they are easily satisfied. At the outset there was an uproar in the Ministerial corner, and amongst Ministerial supporters generally. Even on the Ministerial bench there was considerable diversity of opinion as to whether or not an extension of the operation of this very undesirable Act should be sought. The statement made by the Acting Prime Minister was full of what might well be spoken of as fallacies, but it has been accepted by the Ministerial party as showing sufficient reason for an extension of the Act. In his closing remarks the honorable gentleman passed upon the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> strictures such as have not been passed by any member of the Opposition. He said that if this extension of power were granted, then in the event of any member of the Government seeking to avail himself of the Act, or of regulations framed under it, for a political purpose, he would no longer remain a, member of the Ministry. In making that statement he practically admitted that, in the past, the Act had been used for political purposes. I am not going to say that the Acting Prime Minister had any mental reservations in making this pledge, but I would point out. that his view as to what was a political use of the Act, or of regulations under it, might be very different from that of honorable members on this side of the House. We might regard certain actions as having a distinctly political significance, whereas he might hold a contrary opinion. It will be seen, therefore, that it is dangerous to intrust the Ministry with a political sword of this kind. The arguments which the honorable gentleman advanced in support of this Bill could have been used more appropriately in support of an amendment of the Constitution. He spoke of what might happen if the moratorium were lifted. I do not think any honorable member would urge the immediate lifting of the moratorium, but the honorable gentleman said that if it were raised, financial houses would pounce upon those to whom they had made advances, and demand repayment, and that when such persons sought in other quarters the money necessary to enable those repayments to be made, the interest rate would immediately rise. That was a serious accusation to make against the financial institutions of the Commonwealth. The Acting Prime Minister also made a considerable impression upon his supporters when he said that municipalities, under the War Precautions Act, had been allowed to invest municipal funds in war loans, and trustees of friendly societies and others had been granted a like privilege, and that the only protection municipalities enjoy are the provisions and regulations of the Act. I am informed on the best of authority, however, that in Victoria - and I take it the same will obtain in other States - the Local Government Branch of the Public Works Department is engaged in making inquiries with a view to drafting a Bill which will be placed before the State Parliament and passed, to indemnify municipal councils in the event of any action being taken against them for' spending municipal funds illegally The State Governments intend, it appears, to protect what they call their own State instrumentalities, among which are the municipal bodies; and the Bill I have mentioned will doubtless pass before the close of the Victorian State session, which will take place, probably, before we rise for the recess. </para>

                            <para>- As I have said, I presume that the other States will also see that their municipalities are amply protected. This was an argument on which the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> laid exceptional stress.. I do not suppose that there is one honorable member here who would vote for the withdrawal of all the protection of the moratorium, but that protection can be afforded otherwise than by the War Precautions Act. However, it will be seen that municipalities and trustees are pot relying on the War Precautions Act, so that that argument of the Acting Prime Minister falls to the ground. The honorable gentleman made some serious charges, which, if made from this side, would have been described as so much Yarra Bank talk, when he said that if the War Precautions Act were to lapse the financial institutions of the country would take advantage of the necessities of the people and charge abnormal rates of interest. But if .the financial institutions would do this in war time they would do it in peace time, so that there is all the more reason for the proper exercise by this Parliament of powers under the Constitution, which I am sure the people are ready to confer. Another serious charge made by the honorable gentleman was that if the War Precautions Act relating to shipping were lifted the ship-owners would take their vessels to other waters, where they could earn more money, and leave the Australian people absolutely stranded in regard to the carriage of goods from port to port. The honorable gentleman also said that what kept tonnage freights lower in this country was Government control; and again I retort that if it is the honorable gentleman's opinion that the ship-owners take advantage of the public in war time, it is evident that they will also do so in' peace time, so that it is essential we should have the constitutional powers necessary to prevent them fleecing the people. </para>

                    <para>The Acting Prime Minister said, also, that if we were to lift the embargo on the sugar industry, and control were relinquished, prices would immediately leap up. That argument is another confession that constitutional amendment is necessary. The honorable gentleman also referred to wool; and I wish that the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falkiner)</inline> were present, because I think that he must be inclined to very much resent the remarks of the honorable gentleman under this head. The Acting Prime Minister said that without the present powers, the only way to prevent the wool-growers from breaking their agreement with the Imperial authorities would be to prohibit the export of wool. This means, of course, that the wool-growers are likely, in the absence of the War Precautions Act, to break the agreement with the British Government to supply wool for nearly two years, or, at any rate, the wool clip immediately after  the war. If this is true, it is only another reason for an amendment of the Constitution. Another point made bv the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> is that if the control of the War Precautions Act were taken away, we should find that those who had stocks of clothing stuffs, foodstuffs, and all those articles and commodities which make life worth living, would be left with absolute power to make prices as high as they pleased. That is a very specious argument, and I do not know whether it was advanced with a view to allaying suspicion on this side or to lessen criticism; but we are not to be caught with such chaff.- The honorable gentleman also told us that he does not believe in price-fixing and general interference with trade in normal times; but in the few sentences that I have quoted, and they are not torn from their context, he presents sound argument for interference in a constitutional way. </para>
                    <para>The' honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> was perfectly correct when he stated that there is only one relief for the Commonwealth, and that is to obtain the necessary powers by means of constitutional amendment. One cannot discuss on this occasion the benefit of extensive constitutional alterations, or deal with the Unification side of the question; but while I have not much faith in ordinary amendment of the Constitution to give relief, I strongly feel that if all the Constitutions, State and Federal, were thrown into the melting pot, and this Parliament were to emerge with power to act for itself, and to delegate powers to the State authorities, the people of the country would be much benefited. The New Zealand Parliament does not mean to be content with an amendment or extension of their war powers. I admit that the New Zealand Parliament is in a different position from the Commonwealth Parliament, inasmuch as there is not another authority to challenge their right to act. Despite this absolute power, however, the New Zealand Parliament does not intend to rely on their war powers in order to give relief to the people", but are doing what this Parliament ought to be placed in a position to do, namely, passing Acts of Parliament under their Constitution in order that the people may be .protected, not only during war time, or immediately afterwards, but it may be for all time. In the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> this evening there is the following piece of news - &gt; </para>
                    <para>Wellington, Tuesday. </para>
                    <para>Parliament has passed a Bill aimed at the prevention of profiteering. The measure makes it unlawful to sell goods at a price unreasonably high, if the opportunity of obtaining such a price arises out of war conditions. </para>
                    <para>A price is to be deemed unreasonably high if it produces more than a fair and reasonable profit, which is to be based on the profit in August, 1914, with a reasonable addition for freight and charges. </para>
                    <para>They are going back to 'the pre-war period, riot to the exceptionally high prices that have ruled during war time. </para>
                    <para>The hoarding of goods is made unlawful. The maximum penalties are £200 for an individual and £1,000 for a company. </para>
                    <para class="block">They are making some effort to protect themselves against profiteers. Here great cries are raised against Sinn Feiners and Industrial Workers of the World men, but very little is heard from honorable members opposite of the necessity for SUppressing the profiteer - the man who has een filching from the people of this country when they have been in very dire circumstances indeed. If we heard a little more about the profiteer we would be more inclined to place some reliance upon Ministerial promises. Some time ago I publicly stated that two highwaymen had robbed certain Government officials not far from this building, but that the men who were exploiting the widows of our soldiers were far worse than those highway robbers. That is why honorable members upon this side of the chamber are inclined to doubt the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of honorable members opposite. The latter refuse to deal with the arch offenders in our midst. </para>
                    <para>Objection to the extension of the War Precautions Act is not confined to the Labour section of the community. Instead of being called the War Precautions Act it should be designated the Wilful: Persecutions Act, because of the way in which numbers of men have been persecuted under its provisions. No wonder that the Acting Prime Minister is prepared to pledge himself that if any attempt be made by the Government to use the measure for political purposes he will resign. In other words, if the Prime Minister commences any of the tricks in which he has been indulging during war time, the Acting Prime Minister and himself will part company. During the present week I have been informed by men who do not belong to the Labour party that the provisions "of the War Precautions Act and of the regulations framed under it are not only irksome, but damnably oppressive and unjust. Upon the Boards established under that Act there are men who are engaged in the same line of business as others upon whom they -are called to* sit in judgment. Some of the latter have been persecuted under the Act. Quite recently a challenge was issued to one of these Boards to hale certain men before the Court, with a view to proving that they had violated the provisions of the Statute. Why was this done? Because those men desired an opportunity of proving that they were being persecuted. Honorable members opposite who vote for this Bill will be condemned not only by the Labour section of this community but by many other . persons. I know exactly what the latter think, not only of the War Precautions Act itself, but of the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Boards appointed under it. </para>
                    <para>Again, I would point out that in France to-day there are certain goods which are urgently needed by the people there, and for which the need existed not only while the war was in progress,, but before its outbreak. Some of these goods have so deteriorated that they have actually had to 'be burned, and the members of the French Mission recently implored one of these Boards to allow these commodities to be removed in order that use migh't be made of them. </para>
                    <para>We ought to at once suspend the operation of the War Precautions Act, with a view to allowing members of the community to drift back as quickly as possible to normal conditions. In America, prior to sailing for the Peace Conference,  President  Wilson is reported to have said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>As soon as the armistice was signed we took the harness off, and we are allowing business -again to resume its normal conditions. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The people of America will thus have a big start over every other community in the economic fight which has already commenced. But they will have a still bigger advantage over Australia, because under this Bill we are" going to hobble, instead of free, our industries. Australia, which is 12,000 miles from the theatre of war, is going to be the last country to demobilize its fighting forces and to allow its industries to regain normal conditions. It will 'be a crime against the community if we permit the provisions of the War Precautions Act to be used in that way. The honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> has enumerated many of the persecutions that have taken place under that Statute. We desire that such persecutions shall immediately cease. Is not the present the time to allow the community to get back to those conditions binder which business was carried on in pre-war days ? Nobody can urge that the war is not over. Already the embargo upon racing clubs throughout Australia has been lifted. In the matter of horseracing, the people of this country will be restored to normal conditions in the course of a few weeks. The same remark is applicable to boxing contests. The Government is allowing boxing and racing to get back into their normal stride; but the great commercial undertakings and manufactures of the country, which have in the past employed a great deal of labour, and would employ still more if given freedom, are to be kept in shackles. Ministerial supporters may tolerate this, T&gt;ut the people outside will not be so easily satisfied as they have been. Parliament should remove these shackles as soon as possible. Is it right that we should have goods rotting, or so deteriorating as to be unsaleable, and only fit to be burned; goods of a kind that were required by France before the war and during the war, and -are still required by that country? They were, indeed, asked for by the members of the French Mission which has only just left Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- It does not always do to mention names. The facts were given to me by men who are not supporters of the Labour party, but usually vote for Ministerialists. I believe that the real opinion of honorable members opposite is against the continuation of the War Precautions Act. They would be easily satisfied if the explanation given by the Acting Prime Minister satisfied them. That explanation was full of fallacies. I have pointed out that municipalities and trustees will look for protection and indemnification for their actions in connexion with war-loan' investments and the like, not to the War Precautions Act, but to the legislation of the various State Parliaments, because when peace has been signed, and the war is over, the Act will no longer have force. "Were the Acting Prime Minister a State member, he would laugh to scorn statements such as he has made as Treasurer of the Commonwealth. We are wasting time in seeking to prolong the operation of the War Precautions Act. </para>

The continuance of the War Precautions Act on the statute-book will be a disturbing factor, and it may happen that instead of tie community resuming its peaceful avocations, the regulations under the Act will, become so irritating that the people may be driven to some excess. </para>

Why should we not be told directly that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> is about" to leave these shores to represent the Ministry in London in connexion with the demobilization of our Forces ? This may be another instance in which the censorship is being exercised for political purposes. Prosecutions are still continuing in this country. Serious offences in connexion with shipbuilding operations were sun-nosed to have been committed on the Clyde in Scotland, and one man was deported, but he has since been pardoned by the British Government, and allowed to .return to his ordinary avocation, because the war is over, and there is no further need for the war-time restrictions. But in Australia men are still being interned. </para>

In Great Britain, the conduct of the Government, and the carrying on of the war, have been openly discussed on the platform and in the press ; but in Australia the censor has not permitted reference to such matters. These restraints are irksome to -a liberty-loving community, and will bring about more trouble than many persons think.

                            <para>- Yes,  the printing press is still at work. The freedom of the people is being curtailed to a. greater extent every day, although the war is over. I advise honorable members opposite to seriously consider the statement of the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> that if the powers given to the Government under the War Precautions Act are withdrawn, the Shipping Combine, the sugar producers, and other commercial interests will at once take advantage of the necessities of the people and increase the charge for their services or the articles they supply. That, in my opinion, is a very strong argument in favour of an amendment of the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not often find myself in such a quandary as to how I should record a vote as I find myself in dealing with the second reading of this Bill. The War Precautions Act was passed with the full concurrence of this Parliament. The passing of such a measure was most necessary, but there have been many mistakes made in connexion with its administration. Many things have been done under regulations issued under the Act which render some extension of its powers necessary to secure the protection of the public. The present Act continues in operation during the continuance of the present state of war, and no longer. But what does that mean? Is a formal declaration of peace or a special proclamation necessary before the present state of war will have ceased? Before all matters connected with the present state of war are settled, twelve months may lapse, and apparently the Government are asking that the War Precautions Act shall continue in operation for six months after that period. I do not profess to thoroughly understand constitutional questions, but I doubt very much that the High Court would agree to any extension of the operation of the law until all matters pertaining to the declaration of peace are settled, should that take an unduly long time, which is quite likely in view of the present condition of affairs in Germany and Austria. </para>

                            <para>- The Government are asking for an extension of the operation of the Act for six months after the end of the present state of war. I have submitted a proposal to the Attorney-General in connexion with the matter. I desire to move, when we reach the Committee stage, to strike out the words " and for a period of six months thereafter," with a view of substituting the words "until the 30th June, 1919, whichever may be the later date." I should not mind extending the time until the 31st July. That would give the Government seven or eight months in which to come to a determination in regard to any special legislation that might be required to protect those who have operated under the regulations issued under the existing Act. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> and the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> pointed out that it is necessary that the Government should retain some extraordinary powers for a longer period. If the Government would indicate that they are prepared to accept such an amendment as I have suggested, I should resume my seat at once. </para>

                    <para class="block">Bill, trusting, in Committee, to carry such an amendment as I have suggested, unless I have some assurance of Government support for it. If the proclamation of Peace should be delayed until June or July next, and the Act is to continue in operation for six months after that, the period of its operation will be inordinately Jong. Throughout Australia, amongst every section of the community, there is an almost unanimous opinion that we should get rid of the regulations framed under the Act as soon as possible. Some time must elapse, before the operation of the measure ceases, to enable people to prepare for the new conditions that will prevail when the regulations under the Act are no longer in force. Some time for preparation for the new conditions will be necessary in connexion with the moratorium, for instance, the wool trade, and the butter trade. Some special legislation will be necessary, in the circumstances, and I am prepared to give the Government a reasonable time in which to consider what this legislation should be. 1 am not, however, prepared to give them twelve, fifteen, or eighteen months in which to determine upon such legislation. Assuming that the Government do not propose to accept an amendment such as I have suggested, I must point out how essential it is in the interest of the people generally to get rid of the regulations framed under the War Precautions Act as speedily as possible. The Government certainly need to protect certain industries and agreements ; but, as far as I can judge, it is not in the best interests of the community generally for them to have control over matters relating to trade. A great many mistakes have been made. While the Government with good intentions have been anxious to rid the community of certain monopolies, they have only succeeded in creating far greater monopolies. I do not propose tq permit thom to continue injuring trade, and many districts which have suffered as a consequence of the exercise of the powers given by the War Precautions Regulations. We have always been told to look up to the wonderful work done by the Wool Board. We shall always find certain sections of brokers who are quite satisfied with the action of the Government in these matters, because it has brought grist to their mills; but I have not been at all satisfied with the administration of the Wool Board. The price of wool has been good, because the Imperial Government have bought our clips, but the administration has been bad. I object to the endeavour of the Wool Board to destroy communities. At the principal seaport in my constituency there have been appraisements of wool for the last two seasons, but by the dictum of the  chairman  of the Wool Board no further appraisements are to take place there, and the trade of the town will be ruined for the sake of centralization. The dominant feature of the administration of this Board has been its centralizing policy, its endeavour to drag the whole of the trade of Australia into the capital cities. </para>

                            <para>- In Western Australia, a large co-operative association with 5,000 members, nearly all of them sheepbreeders, an organization which was brought into existence by the special pleadings of the Prime "Minister and others, applied for permission to trade in wool, but the monopolists who are controlling the business refused the application. This is, perhaps, a small matter, but there are others of greater importance. From the moment the war started the Government took control to a great extent of metals. I do not propose to say much in regard to the method of dealing with molybdenite, but if the Administration's actions were not due to ignorance they were criminal, because while there was nothing the Imperial Government desired more at the outbreak of war than a supply of that precious metal, there were extraordinary delays in regard to shipping it from Australia, which were, to my mind, due to nothing but culpable ignorance. Then we had the Metal Exchange formed under the auspices of the Government. The peculiar feature of it was that no one could be supplied with information in regard to that Exchange unless it was given confidentially. I had great difficulty in securing a copy of the articles of association, and then I could only get them confidentially. I believe in having a Metal Exchange, but I do not believe in a Government compelling people to trade with an organization without any regulations simply for the purpose of forcing trade into certain directions. The Customs Act gave us all the necessary power in regard to the destination of metals, but no matter where their mines were situated, all metal producers in Australia were compelled to sell their output to the favoured members of the Metal Exchange. Then we had the Treasury regulations dealing with all applications for permission to float companies. It was quite right for the Government to take certain control in this regard, in order to see that money, which was essential for the purposes of government, should not be devoted to improper purposes, or in directions where it would not be of value in adding to the production of Australia ; but the system adopted in the Treasury - it is not so strictly carried out now - was for. a. clerk to deal with any proposition which was to be submitted to the public. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid it was worse than that. Under those regulations a Zinc Producers' Association was formed. It is well that zinc producers, tin producers, or butter producers should have co-operation among themselves; but it is an altogether different matter when the Government lay themselves out specially to force them into co-operative concerns What was done in regard to the zinc industry? I do not know how far it was done in regard to the copper industry, but an attempt was also made recently to do the same thing in connexion with the tin industry On the 20th March, 1916, a conference of zinc producers was .called in the office of the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was away in England, hut <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon</inline> was Acting Attorney-General at the time. The zinc producers were asked to join a Zinc Producers' Association. They found that articles of association had been prepared for them, and that the agreement into which they were expected to enter was prepared for them. Under its terms they were to place the whole of their output in the hands of the proposed association, which would be able to dictate all the contracts  they should have, and the price they were to be paid, not only during the progress of the waT, or for a period of five years, but for a period of fifty years. When the zinc producers objected to joining and pointed out, as the representatives of the Broken Hill Proprietary and Mount. Lyell Company did, that they could not understand how joining the association would affect the interests of the shareholders, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins</inline> said, according to the official reports of the Conference - </para>

                    <para class="block">I pointed out a little while ago that the Government were insisting that any person who desired to float a company must secure the approval of the Government. They were very particular in regard to anything that should appear in any such proposition as that. But these articles of association contain clauses which are not to be found in the articles of association of any other company anywhere in the world, because they actually make provisions which open the way to graft. They give power to the directors to pay gifts or commissions to persons who may not do anything directly or indirectly to the advantage of the association, if, in the opinion of the directors, it is in the interests of the association to grant such gifts or commissions. If I can help it I shall not allow that sort of thing to continue. A Copper Producers Association has been formed; and only the other day we heard a great deal in regard to the tin industry. A gentleman waited on me recently, and gave me the names of two mines in New South Wales which had to be closed down owing to the fact that  they could not dispose of their produce. The name of one was the " Car.pathia." One of the two employed fifty men and the other twenty. There is not the slightest doubt that tin is required all over the world at present. But we have, allowed the whole business to be controlled by one firm, which has been appointed buyer for the Inter-Allied Committee. </para>

Those tin mines have had to be closed down, as this firm refused to purchase. Shares have dropped considerably, and one can understand, not only how great losses or profits may be made in dealing with tin, but how manipulations on the Stock Exchange may occur.

Is the association placed in exactly the same position  as  the copper producers <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I made representations  bo  the Government not long ago regarding a copper mine at Whim Creek, in the north-west of Western Australia. The mining people pointed out how impossible it was, owing to the heavy cost of freight, and to the high smelting charges, to send copper ore to Port Kembla; and they drew attention, further, to the difficulty in making contracts. But the Government insisted that the ore must be sent to the smelters in Australia. The same position will apply to the tin producers, and it is a matter, with the Government,  of  caring little for the producer so long as terms are made with the smelters. The first care of the Government should be to watch the interests of producers in Australia. </para>
                    <para>Dealing with the farmer, or the producer generally, the Government have failed to protect his interests adequately. Therefore, I want to see this Act removed from the statute-book, or its provisions so restricted as may be consistent with the safety of the nation. I quite agree that there must be some little delay. The armistice has come with dramatic suddenness. The war is .virtually, but not yet. over. In all human probability there will be no further fighting between us and our enemies. I wish to give the Government ample time to ascertain what powers are necessary for the protection of those industries which have been affected by the War Precautions regulations, and by the war itself, and then to bring their proposals before Parliament, by which time matters will have returned to normal. Within a few months, the Government should be in a position to introduce Bills which they may deem necessary to carry on. Then Parliament can decide what powers to grant to the Government. </para>
                    <para>According to the Bill under discussion, it is intended that " This Act shall continue in operation during the continuance of the present state of war." What does that really mean ? It is indefinite. There may be a good deal of delay. After that, it is proposed to give the Government six months longer. I hold, however, that that is too long. I would like the Government to indicate whether they will accept an amendment that the Act shall continue until the proclamation of peace, or whether they will consent to fix a date in the Bill. Unless I can secure some information in regard to this matter, it will be my bounden duty to vote against the Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- I pro-' test against the continuance of the Act, because it has been used in the past to affect the liberty of so many persons in the Commonwealth. We have previously had just the same assurances as have now been given that the Act will not be used in that way. Such promises have been  made by different members of the Government, but they have been invariably broken; and the Government are just as likely to break them in the future as they have been in the past. The Act has been used to force an ex-officer of the Army to play the detective on a man who had served under him at the Front for over two years, and to try to put that man in gaol, simply because at the time of the conscription referendum the latter was telling the people the truth about certain matters in connexion with the army.. The officer told me that that was the order he hated most of any he had received. The Government were denying at the - time of the second conscription referendum that a sixth division had been formed, but this man was discharged in the middle of the conscription campaign as a member of the Sixth Division. As a matter of fact, I was discharged from the Sixth Division on 13th December, 1917; I have the Defence Department's discharge as a member of the 70th Battalion, Sixth Division, and at the very time I received it Ministers were denying the existence of a Sixth Division. </para>

                            <para>- No, it was made up of what were called " the fragments from France," namely, the wounded and sick who had recovered. Why do the Government wish to extend the War Precautions Act? We have been told that it is for the purpose of " cleaning up " the various activities of which the Government have assumed control since the war. As far as I am able to judge, they will have, without any extension of the Act, a great many months in which to do the cleaning up before the Act automatically expires. We have been assured that that period will be between twelve and eighteen months, and, therefore, I fail to see why it should be necessary" to extend the duration of the Act beyond that length of time. I am convinced that people of all classes in the community are opposed to an extension of "the Act for a day longer than is necessary. The commercial bodies are opposed to its continuance, and monster demonstrations by the working classes demand its repeal. The Government say that the powers of the War Precautions Act are necessary in order to keep in check the so-called disloyal element in the community. Recently-passed regulations prohibiting the holding of meetings and giving power to prosecute those who attend them seem to corroborate the impression that the prolongation of the Act is desired really for the political purposes for which it has been used in the past. Statements have been made about Bolsheviks and other disloyal elements in the community. Disloyalty depends very much on the point of view from which it is regarded. Whom do the Government regard as disloyalists? Do they refer to men who are disloyal to the Empire or to Australia ? Do they mean people who sit quietly by and force others to remain silent in face of the peaceful invasion of this country by a foreign Power? I regard any person who does that as disloyal to Australia, but the Government permit that to be done, and will not allow us to raise a protest. As a matter of fact, I think the Government's definition of a. disloyalist is any person who is not in agreement with the present system of government. </para>

If one does not believe that the producers of the country should, in addition to supporting themselves, support, a parasitical section of the community, he is, in the view of the Government, disloyal.

                    <para>My strongest objection to the present Act is in connexion with the censorship. The Government have used the censorship in the past for political purposes, and in an instance that came under my own notice it was used for the protection of one particular Minister. The reference to the censorship brings to my mind a publication called <inline font-style="italic">All for Australia,</inline> which was distributed broadcast amongst the soldiers in the. trenches at the time of the second conscription referendum. I often heard the fellows at the Front say that the name of it should have been <inline font-style="italic">All for Hughes,</inline> because that was really its policy. It was practically the only political literature that we were allowed to receive during the conscription campaign. We were not allowed to receive any writings which were in opposition to conscription. The war had to be won, and apparently we soldiers were not winning it, so we could not be permitted to know anything of the negative side of the question. On the front page of the journal was this statement, " To the soldiers : Do not let yourselves be persuaded that this is a conscription vote. It is not." I do not think that statement would mislead any one in this country, although it may have misled some men overseas who had no chance of testing its accuracy. The statement was untrue. The soldiers had no way of finding out what was the issue. They could only form an opinion on the basis of such literature as was supplied, and as the Government only allowed them to read <inline font-style="italic">All for Australia,</inline> naturally they only heard one side of the case. </para>

                            <para>- It was a conscription referendum. Reinforcements for the men at the Front would have been supported by every honorable member of the House, but conscription was very strongly opposed. The Government told a deliberate lie to the men in the trenches when they said that the referendum did not involve conscription. There is perhaps a little excuse tor the use of the censorship to assist a party. After all, human nature comes into play ; we all have our weaknesses, and would be inclined to use any authority we possessed for our own protection. Therefore the use of the censorship for party purposes, can be understood even if it cannot be justified. But I cannot understand it being applied to soldiers who have made the name of " Anzac " glorious, and have brought world-wide fame to Australia. I particularly cannot understand the operation of it against a man like  Colonel Harold  Pope. A few months ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was in Western Australia, and  the Returned Soldiers Association had occasion to send a deputation to him. "The deputation was headed by  Colonel Pope,  a man whose name will endure so long as there lives a member of the 16th Battalion of the 4th Brigade of the First Division; a man whose name is written in letters of blood; upon the minds of the men who followed him; the man who was captured by the Turks, and escaped, a man who always asked his men to follow him- a true leader. On his return to Australia some time ago,  Colonel Pope  offered to raise 500 reinforcements, and I assure the House that he would have raised at least two-thirds of them inside three days from amongst the returned soldiers, so highly did they esteem him. But he was refused permission to do that on the ground that his action would' interfere with the ordinary course of recruiting, and he was so disgusted that he made no effort to get one recruit, but went back to Europe as officer in charge of a transport. On the deputation to the Minister, there were, in addition to  Colonel Pope,  men who had lost limbs, and others who had won decorations which could not be bought by any politicians with all the money in the world - decorations won in the face of death. Those soldiers were so disgusted with the attitude adopted by the Minister that  Colonel Pope,  in furnishing a report, to the Soldiers Executive- said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> order of preference was evidently as follows: - (1) For German subjects resident in Australia; (2) for straight-out slackers; (3) for rejects; (4) for soldiers of very short service; and (5) for men of long service. That report -was passed on to the local press, and naturally if it had been published, it would have done the Minister a considerable amount of harm,' especially in the State he represents. It would have affected very detrimentally his chance of being returned at the next Senate election. So the censorship was brought into play to protect this puny Minister's head from those vile soldiers who had done nothing but go abroad and fight for their country. They had done nothing to win the war; everything had been done by the Minister who, therefore, must be protected by the censorship. For a month the censorship prevented publication of that report and, during that time, two articles were published in the local press at the instance of the State Commandant to defend the Minister, and in them, to use  Colonel Pope's  words, " the soldiers got fits." They were not permitted to reply, but at the end of the month they rebelled, and published in their own official organ two and a half columns without submitting the matter to the censor. Naturally, that officer threatened all sorts of action, but apparently he realized that any harsh measures would only bring down upon his head a load of sorrow. Consequently, no further action was taken. This application of the censorship to an organized body of men who had proved on the battlefields of Gallipoli, France, Palestine, and elsewhere their loyalty to Australia was absolutely unjustifiable. In that instance, the censorship was used for purely political purposes, and we are not justified in supporting a continuance of an Act which permits that sort of thing to be done. </para>

As a matter of fact, his statement about using a machine gun on the people was made in respect of a socialistic picnic gathering of men, women, and children. I claim that any man who makes a statement of that sort is directly inciting people to riot, and I would like to know why the Act is not applied impartially. We have been told that this soldier was prompted and incited to make his statement by a certain mine manager in Broken Hill. Why do not the Commonwealth authorities take action against those people who are endeavouring to stir up strife, and to force one section of the community to try to take the lives of another section ? The Government do not apply the War Precautions Act, or, indeed, any other legislation, in an impartial manner. </para>

                    <para>In conclusion, I am convinced that people of all political shades and creeds are opposed to any extension of the War Precautions Act. It places the whole machinery of government in the hands of Ministers, and abrogates the power of Parliament. This Parliament was elected to pass laws for the government of the people, but, under the War Precautions Act, absolute control is given to the Government, who may deal with the people as they please. However necessary such a power may be in time of war, it cannot be necessary in time of peace. The plea that this Bill is necessary because the </para>
                    <para class="block">Peace terms have not yet been signed is, after all, only a quibble. It is a mere attempt on the part of the Government to evade the issue. It is quite impossible for the enemy to put up a fight against us, since he has handed over to the Allies many of his warships and other means of making war. He has handed over vast portions of territory, and a large section of his transport system; so that, although there may be a little rioting in Germany, the nation as a whole cannot organize against us. We are, therefore, virtually in a state of peace, although the Peace treaty has not yet been signed. In such circumstances, any extension of these powers is unjustifiable. The Government will have ample time before the signing of the Peace agreement to wind up their various controls. If they require power to continue the control of the shipping, or any other industry, they can pass special legislation for that purpose. If it is good to continue the control of these activities now that we have arrived at a state of peace, it should be right to continue it long after the war is forgotten. The Government should draft the Bills necessary to provide for such control instead of allowing lt to fall into the forgotten past after peace has been declared. </para>

                        <para>.- The War Precautions Act was passed as a purely war measure to confer certain powers upon the Executive. Under that Act, various important commercial and industrial activities were built up, and now that the armistice has been signed, and hostilities are over, these require to be reviewed by the Ministry and Parliament. I recognise that the Government need time in which to relinquish their hold upon the industrial departments which they took over during the war period, and, in order that they may set their house in order, and be- able to relinquish or shed many of these activities, a certain fixed time should be allotted to them. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> in his very fine speech on this Bill, stated that, during the war period, the Government had exercised various powers which could not be readily relinquished. That position is sound. Especially so is it sound in regard to the moratorium governing the rate of interest, and the regulations relating to the raising of loans for repatriation purposes, as well as for cleaning up our war expenditure. The credit of depositors in our banking institutions has been used to the extent of £40,000,000 in order that special advances might be made to help our last two war loans; and there are sound reasons why the Government, in the interests of the country, should be granted further time to_ exercise their executive powers ir. this respect. The Acting Prime Minister mentioned that a continuation of these powers was necessary in connexion with certain other activities, and referred, by way of illustration, to the control of the price of sugar. It is difficult to say whether it is necessary to use the powers conferred by the War Precautions Act to govern what is a purely Australian industry, having no export trade. </para>
                    <para>The honorable gentleman also referred to the price-fixing operations carried on by the Government. Their incursions into the realms of price fixing during the war have been in many instances most inopportune. The fixing of the price of meat was an unfortunate step, but I am glad to see that it has been withdrawn. We have also had price fixing in connexion with primary exports, including wheat, butter, and other products, which have been sold here at a rate much below the London parity during the last three or four years. 'These price-fixing regulations should not continue a moment longer than is necessary. </para>
                    <para>The statement made by the Acting Prime Minister, as to the control of shipping, was also sound. He pointed out that, if it were not continued, it would be possible for ships now engaged in the Australian coastal trade to be transferred to other seas where much higher freights could be obtained. In that respect alone the evidence is sufficient to justify a further extension of the operation of the Act. There are many important pools in which the Government are financially interested. In connexion with the Wheat Pool, for instance, there is a bank overdraft of £12,000,000, or £13,000,000, and the next advance will mean a further overdraft of £16,000,000 or £17,000,000. It is most difficult for the Government to at once relinquish control of any pool in which they are financially interested; there are difficulties in the way which it will take some time to overcome. But while the 'Government must control these large pools it should be possible to hand over in large part, to those immediately interested, the management of these activities. We have the statement that the metal contracts which have been entered into cover a period of ten years, and that this will involve the exercise of Government control. Since they have been entered into for a period of ten years it will be necessary for the Government to make some other arrangement in connexion with them to insure their satisfactory issue. The Exchange responsible for the management of this branch of the Government control of industries and production will have to make some definite arrangement with the British Government to carry out the contracts they have entered into over that period. </para>
                    <para>It was disappointing to find the Acting Prime Minister unable to bring forward a schedule of the various activities now under Government control, setting forth that they would be released from that control from time to time as soon as it was possible so to deal with them. The honorable gentleman referred to the press censorship. Even the most charitably-disposed supporters of the Government will, not say that the press censorship has been perfect. It is well known that in many instances there was a departure altogether from war methods. We know that the press censorship has been exercised in order to prevent that searching investigation into the administration of the Government which is necessary in the interests of the people and of good government itself. The press, censorship should be exercised very sparingly indeed now that hostilities have ceased, and it should be quite possible for the </para>
                    <para>Government to indicate the directions in which it is to be exercised in the future. I do not think it advisable at present that the press should have absolute licence to deal with the peace negotiations or the possible terms of peace, because such criticisms might hamper the proceedings of the Peace Conference when it meets. Neither do I think it right that the press should have an absolutely free hand to use arguments that might seriously affect the flotation within the Commonwealth of loans to enable us to carry on the great work of repatriation, to clear up the expenditure on the war, and to' bring our troops back from the Front. Even at this stage I would be quite prepared to give the responsible press of Australia a free hand in dealing with all these questions ; but I would not give it to the irresponsible press, which has taken every opportunity, whenever it was allowed to do so, to use its power and influence against what I consider the effective prosecution of the war during the period of the Commonwealth's greatest emergency. </para>
                    <para>The provision in the Bill as it stands, for an extension of the war precautions powers for a period of six months after the publication of a proclamation by the Governor-General that we are no longer in a state of war, would mean not only that the deliberations of the Peace Conference would have to be absolutely completed, but probably that the whole of the details would have, to be settled before a proper signing of peace could take place. In fact, everything in connexion with the whole of the peace terms would have to be completed before it would be possible for the Governor-General to issue a proclamation that peace had been finally determined. The negotiations that will take place at the Peace table will he on a far more colossal scale than we have any record of in history. Those connected with the Franco-Prussian War lasted from January to May of the same year, or about five months; yet that war did not entail as great a loss of life to the German Army as Australia alone has suffered during the war which ha3 just come to an end. If it took so long on that occasion to settle peace between only two nations, how much longer are the negotiations likely to take in this case, where considerations relating to almost every country in the world will have to be dealt with at the Peace table? They may take seven or eight months, or even longer, and then, if this Bill is passed, the Government will have a. further breathing time of six months. If this House is to have restored to it its right to control the policy -of Governments, it should require the Government now to state a time at which the War Precautions Act shall cease, and if it i3 necessary at the end of that time to continue governmental control over certain trade activities, those activities should be stated, and the House should have an opportunity to review .them. Within six months, which seems a very fair term, it should be possible for the Government to shed the control of many of the trading activities that they now have in hand, and they should then be able to bring down to the House a full schedule showing exactly what controls must be continued, and give the House an opportunity of pronouncing whether the power in each case should continue or cease. </para>
                    <para>This House has, to a large extent, given up its powers and prerogatives during the war. With the exception of its right to review certain questions of policy and finance, it has .rightly given to the Execu.tive of the country, which must be responsible for the proper conduct of the war, practically the whole control of the war destinies of this nation. But the war is no longer in existence. It is true that only the armistice has been signed, but hostilities have ceased, and it is generally believed and accepted in Great Britain that the war is over. The German- Navy is now under the control of the mighty British Navy, and soldiers are being returned in thousands and tens of thousands from- France to resume their ordinary avocations in Great Britain. To all intents and purposes the war is ended, but the negotiations for peace are of transcendent importance, and it is essential that the Government should exercise a certain amount of control, through the medium of the press censorship, during the interregnum between this and the final signing of peace. It is also necessary that the Government should continue to exercise a certain amount of control over those big activities that they undertook, as a matter of necessity, to direct during the period of the . war. But in giving the Government an extended period of power in that direction, the House should not forfeit its right to review the whole question'. By the time the House meets next year, the Government will have had a reasonable opportunity to revise the list of powers, and should inform the House which they feel they can relinquish, and those which, for financial and other reasons, must be continued for a further period. The latter it will be the duty of the Government to ask the House to further consider. </para>

                            <para>- I can quite understand the honorable member's attitude; but I am not prepared on this Bill to vote for anything that will help to bring partial destruction on the Commonwealth, or interfere with the proper negotiations for peace. At the same time I am jealous of the rights and powers and prerogatives of this Parliament. This Parliament should continue to exercise its rights, and that can be effected only by the Government giving the House an opportunity to review the important considerations involved in this measure, in order that the  powers at present exercised by the Government may be gradually relinquished, and that we may return as soon as possible to normal conditions. I hope, therefore, that the Government will accept the suggestion that has already been made, and which I had intended to make myself, that within a reasonable period  -  I believe six months is quite reasonable - this legislation should be brought before the House again, in order that the House may once more review the question of the duration of Governmental control over certain activities and functions which are essential to the continued safety of the industrial and commercial life of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>.- I have listened to two speeches from the Ministerial side of the House to-night, both of which have proved the possession by the members who delivered them of that perfect equipoise in sitting on the rail as to qualify them for the description of accomplished acrobats. Their difficulty, apparently, is to accommodate their views with their votes. Their votes are pledged to the Government, but their views are with honorable members on this side, though we cannot expect, apparently, in matters of principle to get the benefit of their votes. I have listened also to a representative of the Opposition, a young soldier, who has delivered some home truths on the question of the censorship and the treatment, under the War Precautions Act, of soldiers abroad. The speech itself was able and interesting, but it was especially pleasing to hear it delivered in the presence of the Minister for Recruiting <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Orchard),</inline> if that high office still exists, and that high official is still qualified to be known by that title, because when one remembers the War Precautions Regulations which he adopted a little while ago, designed to promote ill-will between returning soldiers and citizens of this country, and when one recalls the illuminating pictorial devices which he caused to be circulated amongst old men and women, returned soldiers, parents and relatives of deceased soldiers, to stimulate their enlistment, one can easily understand that the admirable lesson given by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corboy)</inline> might be of some use to the Minister for Recruiting, still so-called. Even if  I  could, I would not like to be so severe upon the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> in respect of this Bill, as some independent and non-political critics have been. I will not repeat their language of condemnation - unless I may be pardoned for making a passing reference to what was termed his " stilted verbosity " - but I think it is fair to say that if the Bill is necessary, the Minister has quite failed to prove it so ; and the barren speech with which he introduced it has not been rendered the more fertile by the addresses of those who have just supported him from that side of the House. </para>

                    <para>It has been suggested that this Bill, if passed, will be unconstitutional, and it is very curious that the Minister's quotations from a High Court judgment go rather to show that this is so, and that not a single argument was advanced by the Minister in support of the constitutionality of the measure. Under the War Precautions Act, and arising out of the continuance of a state of war, very extensive powers have been conferred upon the Government. How far those powers extend was well illustrated by the Minister's quotations from the Chief Judge of Australia and from learned counsel who addressed the Court in connexion with the cases mentioned by the Minister. They all go to show that the very extraordinary powers enjoyed by the Government under the War Precautions Act arise exclusively out of a condition of war - the pre-eminent demand of national preservation, and the maxim that the safety of the State is' the highest law. The Minister used his quotations as though they supported the constitutionality of his case, and as some warrant, which they are not, for the extension of what I prefer to call this miserable coercive measure. </para>
                    <para>On the 25th April, 1915, when the second. War Precautions Bill was introduced in this House, and standing just about where I am now standing, the then new, modest and timid member for Balaclava, now the bold and confident Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> delivered his first speech upon this subject.

                        <para>The Bill, as has been said by the honorable member preceding me, strikes a blow at many important principles which have been built up as the result of centuries of endeavour, and they are principles of which we all approve. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The Acting Prime Minister, then the plain honorable member for Balaclava, made it perfectly clear that nothing but the very grave crisis which then confronted Parliament and the country could be or would be sufficient excuse for his lending support to that Bill. To-day .the war is over. All are agreed on that. Much discussion must follow; but the fighting is over. The crisis has passed, and, consequently, ' the circumstances which justified the Government " striking a blow " at many or any important principles " which have been built as the result <inline font-style="italic">61</inline> centuries of endeavour " no longer exist. To-day, however, in a time of peace - the crisis happily having passed, and the conditions having been entirely altered - the Acting Prime Minister stands in his place to justify an indefinite continuation of a Bill which " strikes a blow at many important principles which have been built as the result of centuries of endeavour." </para>
                    <para>I have just been reminded that the Acting Prime Minister made another speech on this Bill, when he came to the rescue of his colleague who was in difficulties, and threatened with fire from his own side, or rather from the rear. This colleague was threatened with grave things from certain honorable members, all of whom, we are now happily assured, will vote with him. For some hours, when called to the rescue, the Acting Prime Minister wandered about, obviously cherishing a speech of great importance - wandered about something like the proverbial hen determined to lay an egg but not quite settled as to -where this should take place. Eventually, he delivered the speech. </para>

                    <para>To take only one instance, the Acting Prime Minister told the House that it would be a dreadful thing if the moratorium were to be discontinued, and money, which is at present invested on mortgage at 4 and 5 per cent., were suddenly liable to be called u,p under the attraction of better investment at higher rates of interest, and financial chaos and great hardship were brought upon those persons who had been compelled to borrow money at the lower rates of interest. Any one who is not merely a theorist in these matters knows perfectly well that there never has been a time when there were not hundreds of thousands of pounds invested in real estate and with banks at rates of interest far below the interest obtained on other investments of like character. For instance, when the banks were offering 4J per cent, on fixed deposits, many investors were only too glad to avail themselves of what they conceived "to be the greater certainty and regularity of an investment of this kind, in preference to what they thought were more hazardous investments at 6 and 6£ per cent, in other avenues. It is apparent to me, as having some little experience of business matters of the kind, that the dread of financial panic which the Acting Prime Minister seems to labour under is unfounded. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think it should cease immediately, nor do I think that the heavy machinery of the War Precautions Act is in the slightest degree necessary to its- continuance. I take this opportunity to say that this vast, injurious, iniquitous octopus of the War Precautions Act is not, in my opinion, a necessary adjunct to the reasonable protection of the public in certain well-defined lines and circumstances, upon which legislation may be passed from time to time as need arises, or legislation and regulation may be .retained as wise judgment requires in particular instances. </para>

                    <para>The Acting Prime Minister may be complimented on one phase of his speech. It was an excellent tribute to a policy of State Socialism. He apostrophizes various State activities, which he assures us have been the very buttress of Australia's solvency, as if honorable members on this side had never had a word to say in favour of State effort before. It comes to the honorable gentleman as a new and refreshing discovery that the State can operate, even temporarily, with success in the departments which he mentioned. I am quite prepared to concede with him that State activity may be. very useful and necessary in many departments, but I contend, also, that when power is gathered in the name of Democracy into a single individual, or two or three individuals, acting in secret behind the scenes, there is, inevitably, implanted in the public mind a very deep and dark suspicion of wrongful and corrupt practices. I deliberately say that there is more than a suspicion in the public mind of many improprieties, approaching dangerously close to corruption, in connexion with the various Committees, Boards, and licensed individuals, who in secret are carrying on the government of this country. I will say this f,or the Acting Prime Minister and his speech, that in his debating days, when I first knew him, he would have been entitled, on a division of matter, manner, and method, to have won from any judge a high percentage of marks on both his method and his manner;- the matter was defective only in that it failed to bring up evidence to support his general statements. </para>
                    <para>Having opposed this measure from the beginning, I am naturally very pleased to know that, if not in a position to claim the sympathy and support of all members, I have the sympathy and support of a good many of those who were heartily favorable to its introduction, and, I admit, with more excuse than those who wish to continue it now. My own view is, quite frankly, that there is a difficulty in discontinuing it. It cannot easily be laid aside. As was said, I think by the great Grecian statesman and philosopher Solon of his rival Dionysius, " We might have nipped him in the bud, but now nothing remains but to drag him out ' by the roots.'

                            <para>- It may be mixed, but the honorable member must blame Solon for that, and he has been dead many years. We might have nipped this Act in the bud three years ago, but nothing now remains but to drag it out by the roots. That is a painful method to adopt, but it is sometimes better to bear pain than to allow an evil to continue. The effect of the War Precautions Act upon the people of this country has been one of moral degeneration. It has bred suspicion, and it has tended to corrupt practice. The Act which we are invited to perpetuate contains, amongst other things,- a section which enables civilians to be tried by court martial. The war being over, and the very name of court martial stinking in the nostrils of the public, we are asked to pass a Bill which will perpetuate courts martial, not only in the case of the military, but in the case of civilians. These tribunals are not Courts in the strict sense of the word - they are what the Prime Minister would describe as secret juntas which dispose of men's lives in the same way as would the greatest despot on earth. I am not likely to lend any support to a measure of that kind. </para>

                    <para>A good deal has been said during this debate about the censorship and when the Acting Prime Minister was inviting us to pass this Bill he asked us to accept his assurance that the censorship would not be used for political purposes. I said that I declined to accept any such assurance. I did not mean that I would not accept the word of the Acting Prime Minister because I judged it to be unworthy  of credence. But I refused to accept it because the Acting Prime Minister, in 1918, was merely repeating the pledges which were made by the Prime Minister in 1915, 1916, and 1917, and which were so recklessly broken. Any man who would be so weak as to accept the assurance of the Prime Minister in regard to the effect of an Act of Parliament, in the face of what he has already done, would argue himself a fool rather than a politician. I would not allow my mind to be affected by any protest made by him, no matter how solemnly, or under what circumstances' it was made. I do not think the Acting Prime Minister has ever realized how the censorship has been used by the Government of which he is a member. I have seen the Prime Minister make the most positive pledges that the censorship would no longer be used for political purposes. Subsequently I  have listened to the citation of the way in which it has operated, and the reply of the Prime Minister has been that he could scarcely credit it. "What accounts for this ? The explanation is to be found in the fact that the Censor's staff knew exactly what the Prime Minister wanted. They knew what he had said at the table of this House, but they also knew what he desired. They knew that he would never say, as did King John, that " it was the curse of kings to be attended by slaves who took their humour for a warrant." But the Prime Minister knew that the officers of the" Censor's staff would not give effect to what he had promised, and that they would use the censorship in the way that he desired it to be used. I do not propose to load the official record of our Parliamentary debates with instances of the way in which it has been misused. It has been a notorious instrument of wrong, and its continuance is an argument that one may compromise with his conscience and deal with politics by the instrument alike of falsehood and half truths. I refuse to do that. It is far better that one should suffer and tell the truth than that he should equivocate and temporarily succeed. That is why I will effect no compromise with this instrument of oppression under which our politics have been dragged lower during the last two or three years than they were ever dragged before. </para>
                    <para>Under the . War Precautions Act authority is given to suppress certain classes of literature. It almost beggars belief that an index has been prepared of prohibited publications - an index which includes the publication by the Society of Friends which is known as <inline font-style="italic">Goodwill,</inline> and which from beginning to end preaches pure, simple, non-political Christianity. It . appears on that index because the censorship, as administered during the war, stopped short at Christianity. A. pamphlet relating to the drink traffic has been similarly dealt with. In this connexion I do not go the whole distance with the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson),</inline> much as I admire his singleness of purpose in regard to the crying evil of intemperance. But it would be a scandal for the community to lend itself to the suppression of literature of a character designed to safeguard the morals of the youths, and even of the adults, of this country. Yet it is only too true that we find this pamphlet among others on the index. I often wonder what the Minister now sitting at the table <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> thinks of these compromises with conscience. He, at all events, if he will permit me to say so, has the reputation of being a man associated with church activities. In sincerity, I wonder how he can associate himself with a policy which makes compromises of this kind on vital matters of principle. It is for him to answer. But he rather screens himself in a maze of those generalities which win for him in the press the commendation of having uttered a speech of stilted verbosity. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but in another connexion the red flag denotes, as I think honorable members by this time well know, the principle of international brotherhood. I ventured to interject when a member was addressing the Chair on the question a little earlier, that the red flag was really more than a national emblem, and more than an international emblem. It is really a religious emblem in the sense that it stands for brotherhood the world over, a brotherhood which rises superior to any sectional belief. It typifies the fellowship and good feeling which should bind together the peoples of the world. Correctly understood the red flag, so far as one emblem can be superior to another, must necessarily transcend any other flag that can be flown or displayed by any country in the world. The stupidity and the ill-will of its prohibition must be apparent to those who give the matter even a moment's consideration. </para>

                    <para>I would say, by way of drawing to a close the few observations I wish to record in opposition to the Bill, that the Government will not fail, I hope, to learn the real lesson of this war - the overthrow of military standards of expediency. Interjections have been made about Bolshevism, and the position of Russia. I suggest to the House that if we read the lessons of this war correctly we shall not be too hard upon Bolshevism. The other night we had from the honorable member for New England (Lt.-Colonel Abbott) a wild and rampant oration, in the course of which he condemned me for having asked the question, "What is wrong with Bolshevism?" The question still remains unanswered. When I am told that, during the past few months, murders and atrocities have been committed in the name of Bolshevism, I cannot help reminding honorable members that the few atrocities that have been committed, if any - our information on the subject is scant and unreliable - areas nothing in comparison with the atrocities committed over a long series of years by the late not-lamented military autocracy of Russia, which our soldiers were sent out to support and buttress up in the early part of the war. Happily that autocracy came to a sudden end. That was one of the blessings which we can attribute to this dreadful scourge of war. We have heard a good deal of the Prussian military machine, and it is only natural that I, an anti-militarist, and one who condemns, root and branch, the whole useless, wasteful military business, should cheerfully join with those who condemn it. But there never was a more crushing militarism, a more cruel autocracy than those which we embraced as our Allies in the early part of this war, in the name of Russia. The revolution "came, and this tyranny was overthrown, and after many changes there came what is known as Bolshevism. Immediately the friends of autocracy everywhere set themselves, through their press organs, and by other means, to applaud the old <inline font-style="italic">regime,</inline> and to condemn the Bolshevist doctrines. All I can say is that it will be a long time before the proletariats of Russia will inflict on their country one-tenth of the wrong and cruelty and suffering inflicted by the dynasty and military system which they have overthrown. </para>
                    <para>I opposed this measure in 1914 and in  1915, and in all its phases since. But I confess that when the Bill was introduced originally I did not believe, suspicious as I was of its operation, that the Government who introduced it would so far forget the pledges which they made to the people as to the way in which it would be administered in the years to follow. I believe that the War Precautions Act has been a nuisance to the general public. It has been an incentive and a subsidy to falsehood and chicanery. I believe that the morality of the public has been reduced in their estimation, and in the estimation of disinterested lookers-on, as a result of the operation of the Act. The more quickly the statute-book is disencumbered of its presence the better it will be for this country, and the sooner we shall return to decent legislative methods. Under this Act we cannot have decent legislative methods. We cannot with safety legislate in secrecy. We cannot with safety repose in single individuals extensive powers to be exercised in secret. That has been proved by what has taken place during the time that this Act has been in operation. It was used as an instrument of political oppression. It has been used for persecuting and prosecuting political opponents of the present Government. No doubt it will be so used in the future. At the very moment when I am speaking it is being used as ii means' of political persecution and oppression. Its operation has been extended through secret regulations passed in its name into avenues in which it was never expected that it would be used. It has been used for the prosecution of members of this' House in circumstances in which a prosecution could never decently have taken place. The very fact that most of those prosecutions were abortive is testimony to the method in which this pernicious measure has been employed. </para>
                    <para>For these reasons I propose to vote against the second reading and against all the clauses of the Bill now before the House. I look forward confidently to the time when the War Precautions Act will cease to be an instrument' for the oppression of the people of this country, believing, however, that it will never cease to be used as such an instrument until the persons responsible for ' its enactment to-day .have passed from the opposite side of this Chamber to this side. When that time arrives, I promise a long-suffering people, so far as one individual is able to promise anything, that not only will the War Precautions Act pass away, but one of the first acts of the new Government should be to compensate every individual who has unjustly suffered from its operation. </para>

                    <para>. -  Some time ago, when addressing this House in connexion with the conditions at the shipbuilding yards at Williamstown I made several charges against the management of those yards. Amongst other things, I charged the management with nepotism in the belief that the manager had certain relations employed at the works. I made that charge upon information which I received, and which I deemed at the time to be quite reliable. Since then the Acting Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> has assured me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curchin</inline> informed him that he has no relations whatever working at the Williamstown Yards. </para>
