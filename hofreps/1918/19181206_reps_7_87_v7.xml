                            <para>- It should be hardly necessary for me to say that the statement has not been censored. I presume that the reason why it does not appear in the Melbourne dailies this morning is that it was made at too late an hour - I spoke somewhere about 11.30 p.m. - for the newspapers to report it. By leave of the House, I shall make another statement on the subject. The Government recognise the heroism and devotion of the ministers of religion who desire, at great personal risk, to enter the quarantine area and to remain there in the centre of infection to the very end. It is with the greatest reluctance that in carrying out our duty to the people of the Commonwealth, we find it necessary to prohibit the entrance of all persons, whether ministers of religion or not, to this part of the grounds. The medical authorities who are advising the Government are agreed that no means has yet been discovered for obtaining immunity from the disease which they are combating, inoculation, though to some extent a safeguard, being by no means a preventive. Ministers of religion, if allowed to enter the hospital to attend on the dying, would be with them at the period of their greatest infectiousness, and the probabilities would be largely in favour of them contracting the disease themselves. If we let the ministers of one religion enter the hospital, we should have to let those of all religions to do so, and the effect would be that we should be feeding the disease with new patients, and thus keeping it alive. The whole object of quarantine is to stamp out a disease at the first possible moment. Every day that this disease persists in this country is fraught with menace to the health of our people. In quarantine itself the disease has broken out in the most virulent form, and the danger to the people is so great that the Government does not feel justified in allowing any one to enter the station and thereby keep the disease alive longer than it might otherwise live. If ministers of religion were allowed to enter the hospital, and they became infected, as in all probability they would, we should have to let another lot in, who would probably become infected in their turn, and so the disease would be kept supplied with fresh victims. The Government feels that in the performance of its duties to the living it must, though very reluctantly, refuse permission to ministers of religion to enter the quarantine area. </para>

                    <para>- Yesterday I drew the attention of the Minister for Home and Territories to the deficiency of the official meteorological reports published in the newspapers, and to the fact that the reports were often out of date. He asked me to give a concrete case, and this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> furnishes one. Under the heading "Australian Rain Records" appears the entry "Queensland: none."

                    <para>- This morning I asked for a report on the subject, and I hope to have an official reply later. I understand that the private advices published in the newspapers are often records covering a period of a week, and, consequently, the information they contain is often anticipated by the official reports, which are published daily. I am informed that the private advices are not as reliable as the official reports. </para>

The honorable gentleman's reply appeared to be given rather hastily; and I ask him, now that he has had a night's sleep and there is a possibility of his approaching the matter with a sane mind, whether he will make a statement on the subject for the information of the House and the country? </para>

                            <para>- I read the statement referred to only a minute or two before the honorable member drew attention to it. As I told him last night, I do not approve of the tone adopted by the correspondent, and I said that while the proper avenues for approaching me on public matters were open to the newspapers before publication, I would not take notice of anonymous press reports. Having looked into the matter, I find that, as usual, honorable members opposite must fail in their attempts to disparage me. The decision referred to in the newspaper paragraph was that of the Acting Public Service Commissioner. I have asked that officer for his reasons. Personally, I do not approve of the decision, but I cannot interfere with it. I shall, however, consult with the Commissioner, with a view to arriving at an equitable arrangement; in fact, I am doing so now. </para>

                        <para>- If that question had been asked by one of several other honorable members in the House I could have believed that it sprang from improper motives, hut I know that the honorable member for Hindmarsh has no desire to derogate from the high reputation of the Postmaster-General and merely desires information that will be of service to the public. I am totally ignorant of the cause of the change he has referred to, if change there has been. In the old days, when I was Postmaster-General in the Victorian Parliament for a brief period, everything was branded "P.M.G.," as if I also owned them all. If the monarch's initials were allowed to appear, that was an unusual departure. I shall inquire from the Postmaster-General the reason for the change which the honorable member has indicated. </para>

                            <para>-I do not know that that would be possible in every case. If the House were not in session it would be  obviously impossible to give the information the honorable member desires; if it were in session, it would be possible to do it, but only in the form of a statement. I personally have not the slightest objection to stating at the proper stage of any negotiations all the facts relating to them. The honorable member, having some knowledge of business practice, will know that very often it is not advisable, until agreements are reached, to make preliminary announcement about business affairs. I do not desire to pursue a policy of secrecy towards the House or the public in regard to these important matters. </para>

Some authoritative women believe that a woman married to an alien should be allowed to retain her nationality; others take the opposite view. The matter is under consideration, but I do not think it can possibly be dealt with by legislation during this session. </para>

Much will depend upon the progress made in the preparation of the legislation to which I referred in the statement I made concerning the War Precautions Act, and that, in turn, will be conditioned by the termination of the peace deliberations. The House must adjourn in a spirit of hope for an early settlement at the peace table. The earlier that settlement is reached the earlier Parliament will re-assemble. </para>

                        <para>.- When we adjourned last night, having discussed the position of the Wheat Pool, the Metal Pool, and several other matters in respect of which the Government desired an extension of the War Precautions Act, I was about to deal with the functions of the Wool Board, and to reply to some of the statements made by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt).</inline> The honorable gentleman said that the Government were charged with the responsibility of looking after the whole of the wool clip on behalf of the wool-growers of Australia, and also the buyers, who consist of the British and Allied Governments. The cessation of the operation of the War Precautions Act two months hence would not interfere with the purchase of our wool clip, since the purchase has already been made. If the wool producers are anxious to hand over to the Commonwealth Government, for disposal, the whole of their clip, they can do so without the existence of the Act. Since the clip has been sold, and the greater part of the purchase money already paid, the Government have only to arrange for its shipment, and in this respect the War Precautions Act cannot be of any assistance. It would not add one ounce to the weight of the clip, or a penny to the price paid for it. The </para>

They have been very successful in obtaining the best price ever paid in this country, and have made good fortunes out of the war. If the members have done good work for themselves and for the country, now that the war is at an end, the Act should die and the Board be disbanded. </para>

There has been no curtailment of supplies to newspapers, and there is sufficient paper to enable the printing and other industries to be carried on.

                    <para>In my opinion, if the War Precautions Act were allowed to expire, and we got back to normal conditions, the cost of living would come down. It is this consideration that causes so many thousands of people to object to a continuation of the powers under the Act, for they regard the regulations as the cause of the inflation of prices. I am anxious that people should once more be allowed to carry on their businesses in their own way, and not have interested people regulating the businesses for them. My only desire 'is that the progress of this country, as before the war, shall not be interfered with. There is no doubt that Australia will revive more quickly than, perhaps, any other country from the heavy demands that the-' war has made, for we have enormous resources which ought to be developed on those normal lines that are impossible under the control of about fifty different Boards. </para>
                    <para>I am sorry that the honorable member for New England (Lt.-Colonel Abbott) should have so far forgotten himself as to say the nasty things he did about the red flag. Personally, the Australian "flag is good enough for me; and in my view the colour of any flag does not particularly matter. We may have green, blue, black, or yellow flags, so long as a country has a flag under which people work to make it worth living in. The honorable member, perhaps unintentionally, asserted that the red flag stands for revolution. It does nothing of the kind; the red flag has been adopted by the more humane men in the civilized world today - that is the Socialistic party. It has been adopted by them because the blood of all men is red, and it stand's for brotherhood, not for revolution. In every country in the world we find some of the noblest of characters who believe in the red flag, not, as I say, because it means revolution, but because they look forward to a day when all human slaughter shall cease, and all men shall be brothers. I remind honorable members that the Salvation Army has adopted the " Ifr. <inline font-style="italic">Riley.</inline> red flag ; and surely that cannot be looked upon as a revolutionary army - as a band of what the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archibald)</inline> would call "cutthroats"? These men and women are imbued with the highest and noblest of motives, namely, the uplifting of all who are cast down by drink, debauchery, or poverty; and they go out into the highways and byways with the red flag. If that can be done by the Salvation Army, surely social reformers, who desire a revolution of thought with a view to making the country better for people to live in, should not, because they use the red flag, be stigmatized as " cut-throats," eager for the destruction of the institutions of the country. 'Fancy the Government issuing a regulation to prevent the flying of the red flag ! It is beneath the dignity of any Minister or Government. What does it matter what flag is flown if no one is injured ? </para>

                            <para>- And I am not ashamed of them. This country has been ruled by the War Precautions Act and Boards from almost the inception of the war; and now that the war is over it is the duty of Parliament and the country to return to normal conditions. We desire that the men coming back from the war shall fall into the avenues of labour and take up the industries of the country as if the war had never been; and that cannot be done unless we get rid of the War Precautions Act and pass laws, and administer them in accordance with the will of the people. </para>

                    <para>No one can deny that there has been a severe censorship on the press and public opinion in this country. If there was any need for that censorship it is gone, and therefore I hope that the question of its abolition will not be regarded as a party matter or fought on party lines. We ought to be united in wiping out the War Precautions Act and throwing on the Government the responsibility of legislating in accordance with the public will. If we are incapable of carrying on the affairs of this country and giving effect to the laws we pass, then, of course, we must leave it in the hands of the Executive, but the Parliament, if it realizes its responsibility, must insist that no laws shall now be permitted to operate without its sanction. </para>
                    <para>If we have power to extend the War Precautions Act for any period we choose, we have also the power to legislate, by Bill, in- any manner we choose. As a layman, my own view is that if the War Precautions Act be continued in force after peace is signed, and anybody contests its validity in the High Court, the whole machinery of government will be upset. I believe the Constitution must be altered to give Parliament necessary commercial powers. I hope, in the interests of the country, that all the bitterness engendered during the war will be forgotten, and that we shall return to normal conditions without any class feeling caused by class legislation. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not desire to vote in silence on this Bill. When, after the outbreak of war, the National Executive asked for this further power, and assured Parliament that it was necessary for the safety of the nation, and to enable Australia to effectively do her share in the war, I voted for the measure in the fullest confidence that the power given would be used only when required for war purposes. If the same set of conditions arose to-morrow I should take the same course, for the safety of the country in time of war stands, above personal, social, political, or other considerations. But at the termination of the war, on the signing of the armistice, and with the surrender of the German navy, the withdrawal of the German forces, and the occupation by Allied soldiers of a portion of enemy territory, I was very hopeful that the National Executive, in view of their altered position - and in the light of the fact that they had been wielding a power which no Executive, in my judgment, is entitled to wield except in the hour of danger and crisis - would specify clearly to the House and the .country the power they still required for the effective "grading off," to use the words of the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> of war operations. I was hopeful that the Attorney-General and the law authorities of the Commonwealth would make an exhaustive analysis of all the regulations passed under the Act, and, in asking for an extension of power, definitely rescind all non-essential regulations. This would have been taken as an earnest of a desire on the part of the Executive to shoulder their responsibilities, and relieve not only the political and social, but particularly the trading, commercial, and financial communities from artificial conditions. Recognising the war's great needs we have borne the present restrictions without a murmur. </para>

                            <para>- I was coming to that point. I was hoping that the Government would have named the specific powers it requires for specific purposes. It would not have been much trouble to do it, because the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> in a most clear and able manner specified the particular powers the Government required. I would be willing to give those powers, and even to go still further; I would be prepared to give the Government the power to meet any emergency, which may arise in the future, but which we cannot foresee at the present time. In the meantime, as an earnest of good faith to a nation which has borne this irksome system of government for upwards of four years, the Government could have shed all the irrelevant regulations, many of which have been so irritating to the people, who have borne them solely because of the exigencies of the war. I am certain that the power given by the War Precautions Act will be required in certain directions to protect the country's activities, and as I am prepared to accept the assurance of the Acting Prime Minister that it will only be exercised in the directions he has specified, I shall vote for the Bill.. My attitude throughout the war has been to stand by the Government, whether I sat behind it or not. This war time has not been a time for party criticism or embarrassing Ministers. On the other hand, it has been a time for honorable members to stand by the Government in the colossal task that the entry of such a young country upon such a huge war imposed upon it. </para>

We are now approaching a stage when I consider that Ministers should have made a greater effort to shed some of the irksome and unnecessary War Precautions Regulations. Australia is one of the most liberty-loving countries in the world. The freedom given by our Constitution has been amply demonstrated on the battlefield. The Australian's care-free method of waging war has earned for him a character which stands out by itself. However, the sooner we can get back to responsible government, and to a position in which the Parliament elected by the people can determine upon matters affecting the future welfare of the country, the better it will be for the nation. </para>

                            <para>- I have already explained that there are many directions in which power given by the War Precautions Act is necessary. We must retain the power to deal with matters which cannot ordinarily be legislated upon by the Federal Parliament for lack of  constitutional  authority. No country can have a Constitution adapted to peace times that will meet all the conditions of war times. I do not agree with the reason advanced by the Acting Prime Minister for retaining power to deal with some of the trading operations of the Commonwealth, but I need not go into those matters now.. Those people who are connected with business transactions know that there is a way in which these great financial undertakings should be carried on. In regard to the moratorium seven or eight months hence, when another £50,000,000 of public money will have been raised, and when there will be a greater exhaustion of wealth, the position in regard to the financial commitments of Australia will be very much worse for the individual who has to go out into the cold. I would much rather go out into the cold to-day if I were facing the lifting of the moratorium. However, I do not propose to go into details in regard to that matter or any other matter now. I simply wish ;to place it on record that my reasons for voting for the extension of the War Precautions Act are to give the Government the power it deems necessary, and I wish at the same time to express my disappointment at finding that the Government have not taken advantage of the opportunity to shed every unnecessary regulation. The Acting Prime Minister has specified the powers which he  thinks are necessary : but I would go further, and give additional power to meet conditions arising out of the peace settlement, or circumstances which we cannot foresee at the present time. I would bury the past and give no opportunity to honorable members opposite to go .into the country armed with ammunition of a political nature, when, after all, our chief concern in this matter is the safety of the Realm. </para>

                        <para>. - I protest against the extension of the War Precautions Act because of the despotic power given by it to the Government, and because, from what has happened in the past, it is only reasonable to expect that the Government will exercise that power to the fullest possible extent. I listened most attentively to the speech delivered by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> and to the qualifications he expressed in regard to the regulations issued; and, although I have not the slightest doubt that he will carry out his word to the last letter, I have to point out that he is not the Government, and has not the whole say in regard to matters directly affecting the welfare of this community. On more than one occasion the hand of the Acting Prime Minister and the hand of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> have been forced. If the opportunity presented itself, there are honorable members opposite who would exercise the power given by the War Precautions Act to the fullest possible  extent  on honorable members on this side of the House. For this reason I want to </para>

                    <para class="block">Bee  the War Precautions regulations wiped out of existence as soon as possible. The Act was passed for the purpose of dealing specifically with matters affecting the war. Let me read the words of the Prime Minister at the time the measure passed through this House. He said - </para>
                    <para>As  to the general tone  of  the honorable and learned member's remarks and his depreciation of the spirit of national hatred, I quite agree with Mm that we have no quarrel with the masses of the German nation; but we have a quarrel, and a quarrel to the death, with that intolerable Prussian military autocracy which, by this war and by deliberate preparation ' during the last twenty years, has hoped to dominate the world, and trample under foot liberty and democratic government. In order to meet the  machinations  of this blood and iron policy, the power given in this paragraph is obviously necessary. We are face to face with the most terrible realities. It is for us a struggle of life and death. We must not forget this fact. Sentiment is idle; mere talk will not avail. This Bill is not- intended to harass any law-abiding person in the Commonwealth, naturalized, unnaturalized,  or  native born; but, as I have said, it is a measure which the circumstances have shown to  be  necessary for dealing with the extraordinary conditions arising out of this war. I have at my disposal information which shows that persons regard the form of naturalization as a convenient cloak which they assume in order to operate more successfully against the Commonwealth. We have evidence  of  that fact. In the face of facts like this it is necessary to have powers to deal with naturalized persons in a manner befitting the circumstances. I do not attach much weight to the mere form of naturalization under present circumstances. In the organization to which I belong there are a thousand foreigners - Scandinavians, Germans, Italians, and what not - better men I never hope to. meet. I never ask them whether they are naturalized or unnaturalized.  I  merely ask whether they are unionists. If, however, I found a naturalized German doing anything opposed to the interests of my organization, let alone  my  country, he would get very shaft shrift from me. Naturalization is nothing but a form if the substance does not accompany it - that is, if there is no change in the heart and mind. I ask the honorable and learned member for Batman how long a period of expatriation in Germany would be needed to destroy his love for Australia? If I were in Germany for 100 years, if I could live that long, I should still be British or Australian, and I would not think it wrong to do what I could for Great Britain or Australia. I put a  German  in Australia on exactly the same footing. </para>
                    <para class="block">Those are the reasons given by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> for introducing . the War Precautions Act. He stated distinctly that under no circumstances would he and the. members supporting him interfere with the liberties of the Australian people during the currency of the war.' The measure was introduced as  a  war measure, and therefore, now that the war is over, there should be no further need for it. To my mind, any member of Parliament who votes for the extension of the Act should resign his seat, because, by such a vote, he declares himself incapable qf legislating for the country's welfare. Since the Act was passed, the Commonwealth has been governed by proclamations and regulations, and the Legislature has had practically no voice in the conduct of the administration. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has told us that it is necessary to extend the operation of the Act to enable the Government to continue to deal with price fixing, the regulation of shipping, and the control of various industries. He spoke of the price fixing in regard to meat, wool, and wheat. I ask honorable  members whether the fixing of the price of wheat has been in the best interests of  the primary producer. I am of opinion that it has prejudiced the primary producer. As evidence of that, I mention the fact that less wheat has been sown this year than was sown last year. </para>

                            <para>- The wages that the farmers have had to pay nave not affected their profits. I have no desire to take from the primary producers anything to which they are entitled. I point out that there has been a great difference between the system adopted for paying the wheat-growers and that adopted for paying the wool-growers. The wheat-growers will never forget the control of their industry under the War Precautions Act during the past three years. According to the Acting Prime Minister, if the operation of the Act were not extended, the prices of necessaries might increase by leaps and bounds. He spoke of the prices of boots and of sugar. Never have the people of Australia had to pay more for boots than they are being charged now, and never have the boot manufacturers been making a bigger profit. It is the same with sugar, and with everything that we eat, drink, and wear. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing with times in which the employee was supposed to receive a fair proportion of what he produces. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company has made bigger profits since the inception of the war than it has made during any other similar period of its history. The same thing may be said of the coal industry, and of the iron industry, both of which have been regulated under the War Precautions Act. The iron and steel industry in Australia is on a better footing now than ever before. Take the position of Messrs. Hoskins Limited, for example. No industry in Australia has paid a better dividend than the iron industry is paying. Then consider the cement industry. In pre-war days, cement was sold for something like 60s. per ton, and it is now being sold for between 90s. and 95s. per ton. The labour conditions have not altered, but the processes of manufacture have been modernized. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The members of the Boards have been chosen from the moneyed classes, and those controlling our various industries. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> said that under no circumstances would the Act be used in the future for political purposes, and that the censorship on newspapers would be removed. During the war certain newspapers in this country have been continually harassed and fined for publishing what has been allowed to appear in other newspapers, such as the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Herald.</inline> The newspapers whose views have been opposed to the views of the National Government have been penalized in every way. Yet the Acting Prime Minister wants us to vote for the extension of the operation of the War Precautions Act, so that he may bring them before the Courts, and punish them to any extent. When the Seventh War Loan was being floated advertisements were published in the press asking all and sundry to contribute as speedily as possible towards it; but, although the Government have power to  prevent the newspapers publishing these advertisements from charging exorbitantly for them, it permitted the country to be exploited. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> received 18s. and 25s. per inch, or, in all, £1,708 15s. for its advertisements. </para>

                            <para>- I turn now to the amount received by the great democratic newspapers. <inline font-style="italic">The Worker,</inline> which is recognised as one of the greatest democratic newspapers in the Commonwealth, received 6s. per inch, and a total amount of £7 4s., as compared with the £1,195 received by the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph.</inline> Despite the fact that the large newspapers were charging exorbitant prices for advertising the Seventh War Loan, and were exploiting the people to the fullest extent, the Acting Prime Minister never thought it necessary to exercise the powers conferred upon him by the War Precautions Act to restrain their profiteering. As a result, the advertising of the Seventh War Loan cost the country many thousands of pounds. No honorable member will deny that a ,price of 25s. per inch for advertising the war loan was unwarrantably high. To the best of my belief the Government desire an extension of the powers contained in the War Precautions Act for the sole purpose of dealing with the industrial section of the community. I am not biased, but the utterances of the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archibald)</inline> lead me to believe that those powers will be exercised ,principally against the industrialists.

They know that there is a movement afoot to establish in the Commonwealth one gigantic organization for the purpose of preserving the rights of the workers. Those rights must be and will be preserved in that way, and the statement of the honorable member for Hindmarsh that this is a red flag revolutionary Bolshevik movement is astounding. The honorable member does not know the meaning of revolution or Bolshevism, or what unionism stands for. </para>

                            <para>- These men have paralyzed the industrial movement, and they now desire a continuance of despotic powers conferred by the War Precautions Act. By the aid of these powers the Government have starved the wives and children of many industrialists, and sent men to gaol for committing very trivial offences. They have interned men who have committed no breach of the law - men who were accused of having made disloyal utterances, but never made them. They have interned Irishmen for voicing an opinion which they thought to be right, and who meant no harm. The Government desire to keep those men  under restraint as long as they can. It is for such reasons that they desire to continue their despotism. I hope that now the war is over- </para>

                            <para>- I made my position clear. I said, " I am not suffering from senile decay. But I am not prepared to enlist, and in no circumstances will I ask any other man to do the job I myself am not ready to do." Honorable members opposite knew that they were not fit to enlist, and that they would not have to fight in any circumstances. But they went upon the plat- from and condemned men who would not enlist, and they attempted to force men into active service. I did as much to win the war as did most honorable members on the Government side. I never styled myself a war-winner. Honorable members opposite told audiences that they were win-the-warites, knowing that they themselves were not capable of fighting. The only men who are entitled to take credit for assisting to win the war are those who fought in the trenches. It is not fair to make accusations of disloyalty against a person merely because he has not enlisted. There are circumstances in every man's life which may prevent him from enlisting. Many men who did not offer their services were quite willing to fight if circumstances would have permitted them to do so. </para>

                    </continue><para>I repeat that I believe the Government desire the extension of the War Precautions Act for the purpose of crippling the one big union movement or any other industrial movement which they do not favour. Any bogus union that operates in Australia to-day has the full support and sympathy of honorable members on the Government side. They have tried for the last two years to devise ways and means of dividing the workers and putting one section against another. But the industrialists of Australia now recognise their responsibilities and the hardships they have to suffer, and they have decided to join forces by the formation of one big union for their own preservation and protection. I am in full accord with that movement; I advocated the cause of one big union many years ago. The red-flag revolutionaries spoken of by the honorable member for Hindmarsh do not exist. I do not know that flags stand for much. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- The reason why a number of Australian people do not fly the Australian flag as often as some honorable members would wish is that they have seen too much of that sort of thing. Flag-flying means very little to-day. There are to be found in all parts of Australia to-day people waving the Union Jack who, if appealed to, could not say for what the flag stands. They indulge in flag-flying because others do so. </para>

It is simply an emblem of brotherhood, and is flown by certain people just as many wear on their watch chains the emblem of a friendly society. </para>

                            <para>- To the best of my knowledge the Australian flag has never been hauled down with the object of flying the Ted flag. If in this country there is a certain section who believe in the red flag, then, under our supposedly free and democratic form of government, they should be permitted to fly it. What is more, they will fly it. The time is not far distant when an opportunity will present itself for flying it. AH the War Precautions Regulations in existence will not prevent that being done. Courts of law may say it is illegal to do certain things, but the court of public opinion - which is higher than any Court of law - will not. There is a change about to take place in this country. The people are " fed up " with regulations and proclamations, and they have decided to bring about a change of affairs. When the Government appeal to their masters they will learn exactly what they are face to face with. The electors will place on record their disapproval of the action of this Government in harassing and embarrassing the Australian people since - the inception of the war. </para>

                            <para>- Absolutely nothing. A number of Irishmen were interned merely because they believed, as they were entitled to, in Home Rule for Ireland. There was nothing to show that they had ever made a disloyal statement or had been guilty of a disloyal act. </para>

                            <para>- I have. It was in the same class as the judgment given in the case of the ten or twelve men who, today, are serving sentences of from five years to fifteen years' imprisonment, under the War Precautions Act, for doing  something which they never did. There is evidence clearly proving that the majority of these men are innocent. These are matters in respect of which" the Government will have to answer in the near future. </para>
