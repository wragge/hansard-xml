                    <para>
                        - I should like to refer to a matter, mentioned in the House during the present sitting, regarding the revision of
                        <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                        proofs. I felt it was necessary for me to take some notice of certain observations and criticisms made in this chamber, and therefore I asked the Principal Parliamentary Reporter to &#39;furnish me with a report in such terms as he thought advisable. The report is as follows: -
                    </para>
                </talk.start>
                <quote>
                    <para>In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> inquiry concerning proof revision by honorable members, and with special reference to an alteration made by the Prime Minister, to which exception has been taken, attention is directed to the following extract from the memorandum attached to each set of proofs issued to members: - </para>
                    <para>Honorable members are respectfully requested to note that emendations which alter&#39; the sense of words used in debate or introduce new matter are not admissible. </para>
                    <para>The terms of this memorandum were determined by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> Baker and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Holder in response to a request by me, dictated by a desire to preserve the fidelity of the official report, that honorable members in revising the proofs of their speeches might be restricted to the correction of errors. This suggestion was founded upon much reasonable criticism of the extent to which certain honorable members exercised the privilege of revision, and was also put forward in the discharge of what I conceived to be my duty as the officer responsible to Parliament for the production of the reports. </para>
                    <para>In accordance with instructions I then received, all cases in which doubt has existed as to whether the limits laid down in the memorandum have been exceeded have been referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> for acceptance or rejection of the proposed alteration. In these instances members have sometimes desired to employ verbiage which apparently altered the sense of the words used in debate, and in other cases have sought to introduce new matter. Applying the decision of the Presiding Officers in these instances to the alteration recently made by the Prime Minister, it should certainly be accepted. Al though the alteration unquestionably qualified the phrase originally used, it could not, in my judgment, be regarded as an alteration of sense within the definition of the terms laid down by many Presiding Officers&#39; decisions, nor, according to similar decisions could it be designated new matter. If it be considered that my discretion, in this instance, was wrongly exercised, it would be necessary to in future reject a considerable number of emendations which have hitherto been accepted without question as not infringing the rule. </para>
                    <para>Further experience of the latitude allowed to honorable members in proof revision, however, induces me to again suggest that they should be strictly confined to the correction of errors in the report. The alterations in phraseology made by some honorable members are frequently so extensive as to render it extremely difficult, in the very limited time available for the purpose, to determine whether or not the rule has been infringed. In the interests of the trustworthiness of the reports, &#39; for the purpose of reference, and as embodying an accurate record of debate, I respectfully invite the reconsideration by the Presiding Officers of the existing practice. </para>

                        Harry Friend,
                    </para>
                    <para>Principal Parliamentary Reporter. 25th January, 1918. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>With reference to this report I desire to inform the House that, while honorable members generally exercise the privilege of revision only to the extent of correcting errors, and some members not at all, others do so with a considerable amount of freedom, not only in the direction of amplification and qualification, but also in otherwise altering the phraseology of their speeches. </para>
                <para>Where this has been done within reasonable limits and without altering the sense of their utterances or introducing new matter - although in some cases it has caused inconvenience and delay in checking and re-setting - such emendations have been allowed to pass. </para>
                <para>It not infrequently happens that the effort to crowd a number of subjects and arguments into a time-limited speech, especially when the train of thought is disturbed by interjections or other distracting influences, betrays some honorable members into expressing themselves in terms which, when read in print, are found either to obscure their meaning or to convey an erroneous impression. And I am not prepared to say that in such circumstances honorable members are not entitled to make corrections necessary to convey the meaning they intended when speaking. </para>
                <para>In a publication which circulates so largely among public libraries in various countries, in literary institutes, in universities for the use of students of constitutional history, and in shorthand schools for the purpose of dictation, alterations involving improvement in literary composition, greater elegance of diction, or lucidity of expression should perhaps be encouraged rather than otherwise; but if the general trustworthiness of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is likely, in consequence of emendations, to be seriously affected, its value as a reliable record of our debates will be greatly impaired, and it may be necessary in the future, unless the House otherwise decide, to confine emendations strictly to the correction of obvious errors. </para>

                    <para>It is not considered that it would be to the claimant&#39;s advantage for applications to be hoard as in an open Court. Under the existing system, every assistance and consideration is given to claimants. </para>

                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Instructions have already been issued that, where possible, soldiers&#39; pay books should be checked prior to embarkation. It has been found impossible for this to be completely carried out owing to insufficient notice of embarkation in a great number of cases. Furthermore, thousands of payments are made to Australian soldiers in British and other hospitals, of which advice is not received until after embarkation. Experience shows that many of these payments are not entered in the pay- books. </para>
                    <para>For these reasons it is impossible to pay soldiers in full on discharge without involving the Department in serious overpayments. The balance of active pay as per pay-book is paid to the soldier within two or three days of his return, and 75 per cent, of his deferred pay is paid on discharge. Every effort is being made, both in Australia and abroad, with a view to prompt finalization of soldiers&#39; accounts, and it is anticipated that the balance of deferred pay will shortly be available within a few weeks of discharge. </para>

In the case of the former, there is a considerable quantity still on hand in Victoria and South Australia, which, although forming part of the British Government sale, is subject to contingent charges. In addition to this, there is a considerable quantity of the 1916-17 harvest unsold, consequently the net price realized is not ascertainable. </para>

                    <para>The weight of wheat harvested in recent years is ten times as great as that of the wool clip, hence the wool clip can be shipped much more easily than the harvest. Difficulties of wool storage are comparatively few, but in regard to wheat, they are exceedingly great. Wheat is apt to undergo deterioration, to which wool is not subject. Further, the whole of the 1916-1917 harvest has not yet been sold - over 30 per cent, still remaining unsold. Although an advance of 3s. per bushel, estimated at &#163;15,750,000 (exclusive of expenses) has been arranged by this Government for the 1917-1918 harvest, not one bushel has been sold to the Imperial Government, or any other buyer. </para>

                <para class="block">I desire to say, for the information of honorable members, that the Government intend to direct their immediate and earnest attention to the many great questions that are now demanding to be dealt with, particularly the questions of reinforcements for our troops overseas, repatriation, shipbuilding, and the organization of trade and industry In addition to these, we propose to consider, the whole matter of industrial legislation, and we hope to be able to submit to the House on its reassembling a more or less comprehensive measure dealing with the subject. There are other matters of first importance which the Government will endeavour, as far as lies within our power, to deal with in such a fashion as will be to the advantage of the country. </para>
                <para>As honorable members know, the Government have given a guarantee to the producers of the Commonwealth in regard to the harvests for this and the next season, and, in fulfilment of that guarantee, we are arranging to pay a first instalment of 3s. per bushel on the present harvest. I regret to say that the Wheat Board has been unable to effect the sale of this harvest, and, although we shall spare no effort to satisfactorily dispose of it, I think it only right to say that, as far as one can see, there is no immediate prospect of their being able to do so. However, this will not affect the guarantee, which stands on its own basis, and is independent of any sale. </para>

                <para>One is unable at this stage to. offer any useful observation as to the state of the war. It is in the last degree improbable that that happy conclusion which we all desire will come before the House reassembles. I feel sure I am echoing the sentiment of every honorable member when I say that it will be indeed a happy consummation if by the time we meet again the first real and earnest offer of a peace which will prove acceptable to both sets of belligerents has been made. In the meantime, and failing that, the Government will direct its attention wholeheartedly, and without delay, to the question of securing reinforcements for our forces abroad, &#39;and to that other side, of the same question - the repatriation of our returning soldiers. I hope that in both these matters, as well as in all the other complex and difficult problems which now confront us, we shall have the assistance of all sections of the House. </para>
                <para>The question of finance, upon which, to a certain extent, all other things must rest, is engaging the very earnest attention of the Government. Honorable members have already been told by the Treasurer that it will be necessary to raise in Australia the sum of &#163;40,000,000, and probably a good deal more, before the end of the year. That is a task which confronts us in any ^circumstances, and it is one to which we must seriously address ourselves. The policy we shall adopt, and the means by which we hope to achieve our end, it is not my present purpose to discuss. But the problems of reinforcements, repatriation, the organization of industry, shipbuilding, the disposal of our primary products, and the subject of finance are all great questions, in respect of which the Government is fairly entitled to claim the support of every section of the House. </para>

                    <para>.- The Prime Minister has certainly laid before us a very large programme - a programme commencing with reinforcements and ending with the Government guarantee in respect of the wheat harvest. Hitherto, when the House has adjourned on occasions like the present, no definite date has been fixed for the re-assembling of Parliament. But I understand that on the present occasion there is a more definite date in view-- </para>

                        <para>- I have never understood that. My understanding was that when once Parliament had voted Supply the Government &#34;intended to ask Parliament to go into recess until after Easter. My own opinion is that we are gradually drifting into a bad system in connexion with the granting of Supply. Already, during the current financial year-, we have passed nine months&#39; Supply without a single line of the Budget having been discussed. This afternoon the Prime Minister has foreshadowed a programme -indefinitely larger than the programme that is outlined in most Governor-General&#39;s speeches. I should like to know whether the industrial legislation of which the right honorable gentleman spoke will be more or less comprehensive than is the existing industrial legislation. </para>

                <para>This afternoon we have witnessed the greatest farce that has ever been enacted in this Parliament. At the request of some honorable members upon this side of the chamber, and of others upon the opposite side of it, instead of questions being answered in the ordinary way, the replies were handed to the members who had asked those questions. I admit that the sitting this afternoon is quite an extraordinary one. </para>

Unless every honorable member is &#39;to be handed a full set of the answers to questions, it will he impossible for us to intelligently follow them . Unless that can be done, it will be better to revert to our original procedure, which I prefer to- this method of speeding up.

                        <para>- My recollection may be inaccurate in the matter. I am sorry that we are not likely to meet earlier, though I hope that the Government may be able to call us together sooner than the date spoken of. I realize that the extraordinary circumstances connected&#39; with the formation of this Government make it necessary that Ministers should have some time in which to consider what their  policy is to be, and I take this opportunity to say a few words on the remarkable political situation in which we find ourselves. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>I shall shortly refer to what has been called a pledge, and what the Prime Minister designated as in the nature of a threat, the public declaration of policy contained in the announcement of the Ministry that they could not continue to carry on the government of the country without conscription. I am personally concerned with what has followed, being one of those who backed the Government&#39;s bill absolutely. I stated that I would be bound entirely by the pledge that had been given. </para>
                <para>Three questions will arise in the minds of the public in connexion with the return of Ministers to office. The first of these is, Has any change in the circumstances of the war, or of Australia&#39;s participation in it, occurred which affects the declaration made b$ the Prime Minister in November last? I think that the answer which will occur to every one present is &#34; No.&#34; The Prime Minister today -indicated that there is some possibility of peace negotiations. That is a very cheering thought to us all, and we sincerely hope that peace may soon come; but in the absence of anything definite, the circumstances of the war and of our participation in it are the same now as they were in November, or certainly not any better now than they were then. The second question is, Does&#39; the Government intend to introduce conscription? The answer to that has been practically given by the Prime Minister, who has decided that at the present time it is impracticable - politically, at all events - to introduce conscription by Act of Parliament, and that it would be impracticable to go to the country on the question, even were a dissolution obtained. </para>
                <para class="block">This brings m&#169; to th&#169; third question, which is of vital interest to the Government and the&#39; party that supports it. If circumstances have not altered, and if conscription is not going to be introduced, although in November last it was declared after full consideration to be vital to our participation in the war, the people will naturally wish to know if the Government has any definite or alternative method of obtaining the needed reinforcements. That is the plain issue before us, I do not think that the Government have yet, or had when Ministers re-accepted office, any definite alternative scheme in mind. If it had, that scheme should, have been stated long ago. Therefore, the time that will elapse before w&#169; meet again seems to me to be given the Prime Minister and his colleagues to try to devise an effective substitute for conscription which will procure. 7,000 recruits a month. I do not think it will be possible to get quite so many as that, and I do not know what suggestions have been made, but I say emphatically that a declaration of the kind made by the Prime Minister cannot be lightly put aside. No change of circumstances, no decision of honorable members, can alter a definite engagement of the kind that was given. To my mind, the warrant of Ministers for retaining their seats on the Treasury bench must depend on whether they can between now and the next meeting bring forward some definite and complete scheme which will have a reasonable chance of proving an adequate substitute for conscription. If the Government asks us to indorse the continuation, or any variation, of -that wretched system - wretched in its later development at all events - of hysterical appeals to the sense of shame of persons who&#62; have no sense of shame, which for some months, or for some weeks, before conscription was declared to be vital, had (resulted in the number of recruits dwindling down to a small stream, consisting almost entirely of schoolboys lately arrived at the age of eighteen years, of soldiers who had been patched up and were ready to return to the Front, and of family men who, having managed to settle their affairs, found themselves able to volunteer, as they had all along intended to do- if we enter again on that wretched system, I say now, and I desire to place it on record, that not only shall we fail in our duty to the Empire, but that Ministers will be in a position of having failed to honour the pledge which they gave to the people. Whether they will do that or not remains to be seen. During the conscription <inline font-style="italic">campaign I</inline> was asked on many platforms whether the Government would keep its pledge, and I repeatedly said that it&#39; was unthinkable that an engagement of honour, given under such circumstances, would not be maintained in substance as well as in the letter. The only way in which it can be so maintained is by the Government finding some effective alternative to conscription. The Prime Minister has to-day mentioned a large number of very important matters that will engage the attention of the Government in the immediate future : Repatriation, finance, industrial legislation, and so on. These matters are of extraordinarily great importance, but, overshadowing them all at the present moment is the absolute and paramount necessity of not allowing our divisions at the Front to be depleted and broken up, and our promise to the Empire to fail. Conscription, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, is necessarily put aside for the time being - many honorable members think for all time, though I do not. I have said before that I do not believe that there will be any method whereby we can get anything like the necessary reinforcements unless both parties cordially co-operate &#39; in the attempt to get them, and I had hoped that, before we parted, the Leader of the Opposition would have been in a position to say whether, on this one point of getting recruits, honorable members opposite were willing to co-operate with the Government and the party on this side in any way that might be devised without any breaking of pledges owed by them to their party outside. I cannot get it out of my mind the impression that honorable members opposite are not entirely free in this matter. At any rate, I understand that alliances or coalitions with any other party are not permissible to them. It is not my desire to stir up conflict, rather do I seek to still it, if possible; but, assuming that I have stated the position of honorable members opposite correctly, I would like to know from their leader &#34;whether, despite all that has been said during the heat of the recent debate, it is not still possible to have-some form of co-operation, short of coalition, for i this purpose <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I have already suggested a meeting of all members who are anxious to find a way out. The Government are obliged to go into the question of trying to find recruits, and the only bar to honorable members opposite joining in the same task is, as one gathers from their own expressions, the fact that they cannot co-operate with this Government. It is unfortunate that we have had no statement from the Leader of the Opposition that his party will be ready - within certain limits - to meet our party for the purpose of considering what means may be taken to the end of securing reinforcements, and for the prevention of a humiliating disaster to this country, which seems possible if, through our failure to provide our men with sufficient reinforcements, our divisions have to be broken up. Surely it is not too late for the honorable member to give some indication of co-operation of a limited kind - whatever it may be - in the future, even to the extent of sharing in a National Government. At any rate, for the present, an announcement from the honorable member that his party will share in the task of attempting to arrive at some effective policy of getting recruits will be most acceptable. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to a peculiar position which has arisen in Victoria. I refer to the dispute between the British Medical Association and the friendly societies. It may be said that this is not a matter of Federal importance, but, as friendly societies play a great part in the community, and have been the means of alleviating more suffering than has any other form of organization, it behoves all Governments to see that the good work which they are carrying on is not discontinued. I have no desire to go into the merits or demerits of the case, because I do not wish to prejudice any action that I would like the Federal Government to take. The British Medical Association has made a demand on the friendly societies for payment of 6s. per annum in excess of what has been paid in the past under certain agreements. The friendly societies have agreed to give 50 per cent, of the advance asked, and there the matter rests. The State Government appointed a Judge to consider the matter. </para>

                        <para>- The trouble is that, on the 31st of this month, the whole of the members of friendly societies in Victoria, with the exception of a few whose doctors are not members of the British Medical Association, will be left without medical attendance for themselves and their families. Of the members of the friendly societies in this State, 19,000 have enlisted. These men are practically made free members of the lodges, but their payments to the doctors are still maintained, and their lodge fees are kept up for them. This responsibility has placed a considerable expense on the societies. At the same time, funeral allowance payments have been greater than would otherwise have been the case, and sick payments have also been greater than would have been the case if there had been no war.. I mention these matters in order to show that this is a question of national importance. The Federal Government should have some degree of responsibility, because these societies relieve the Treasury of considerable disbursements which otherwise would have fallen on the Commonwealth finances. </para>

                        <para>- On the 31st instant, I am a trustee of two or three of these societies. In one case there are sixty men at the Front, and many of the men have left dependants here who will be without medical attendance at the end of this month. Seeing that it is a matter of national importance, could not a regulation be framed under the War Precautions (Moratorium) Regulations deferring the resignations of the doctors for another month so that some arrangement may be come to between the two parties ? But for the war having depleted the number of eligible men available, the friendly societies of Victoria would not be in their present position, as they would have been able to secure other doctors to take up their work. Let me say that there was a truce declared between the societies and the doctors until the war was over. I mention that as another justification for action by the Prime Minister, because it goes to show that the difficulty is one which has arisen out of the war. A statement appeared in the press that the legal representative of the British Medical Association, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stanton</inline> Crouch, asserted that there was no truce; but I have seen a letter from this gentleman, dated some time back, charging a certain friendly society with having broken the truce. Such a letter could not have been written if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crouch</inline> had not recognised that there was such a truce as I have referred to. It may seem a somewhat strange request to ask the Prime Minister to compel medical men in Victoria to attend members of friendly societies, and give them professional advice; but I am not asking the right honorable gentleman to say that the doctors should continue to render their services to members of friendly societies for the fees they are getting &#34; now, but &#39; that a definite break between the medical men and the societies should be postponed for another month, to give time for an amicable settlement of the difficulty. The State Government have signally failed to deal with the matter. Perhaps I should not have said that, but there can be no doubt that their efforts in that direction have not been successful. I do not know whether the Prime Minister has been watching the press references to the matter, or has given it, so far, any consideration; but if he will take action to postpone the breach for another month, to give time for a friendly settlement of the difficulty, I can assure him that the whole of the friendly societies of Victoria will be keenly appreciative of h:s services. </para>

I regretted very much, indeed, and I think the bulk of the honorable members of this Parliament, and probably the majority of tha people of Australia, equally regret that Ministers should have given such  a  pledge.
                </para>
                <para>I have been pleased to hear the statement made by the Prime Minister tL t during the recess it is the intention . of the Government to consider questions of prime national importance, and that when Parliament meets again, the Government will be in a position to make a declaration as to their policy. I trust that their policy will include satisfactory proposals for providing reinforcements which will relieve the Administration from the serious criticism directed against it in connexion with the Bendigo pledge. I hope that the policy will have regard, also, for the promise made at Bendigo prior to the last general election, when the National party was returned with such a large majority. Consideration must be given to the relations between  i  capital and labour, and every effort must be made to enable Australia to increase its production if we are to get back to normal conditions after the war without delay. I shall not attempt to discuss details of industrial legislation, but I suggest that representatives of the Labour organizations and of capital in Australia might be brought together to consider how far it is possible, not only to introduce a fair system of piece-work, as has been proposed in connexion with the shipbuilding scheme, but also to secure cooperation between capital and labour in connexion with all primary &#60;&#187;nd secondary production. There is no country in the world in which the conditions are more favorable for the adoption of satisfactory industrial legislation, and the Government led by the Prime Minister will earn the lasting gratitude of the legislators of the world if they are able to bring about industrial harmony in the way I suggest, and so provide for increased production generally, with better conditions for the industrial section of the community. </para>
                <para>I hope that during the recess action will be taken by the Cabinet to relieve the Prime Minister of some of the duties that he is now called upon to carry out, and particularly that some other Minister will be called upon to relieve him of the work connected with the shipbuilding, scheme. </para>
                <para>I am glad that the Prime Minister has referred to the question of primary production, because it is so closely associated with transport. I believe there are good possibilities for the extension of trade in the Far Eastern countries and in the United States. By associating the shipbuilding proposal with the matter of primary production, the transport of our products may be provided for in such a way as to enable us .to finance our obligation in connexion with the war, and to be of great assistance to us when the war is over. </para>
                <para>I trust that when Parliament re-, assembles the Government will come forward with proposals which will justify us in giving them such combined support as will enable Australia to carry out her part in the great war both at home and abroad. Action should be taken to bring about better terms between the present </para>
                <para>Ministry and the Opposition in order that justice may be done in the matter of providing recruits for our Forces, and the stimulation of our industries. I am sorry that Parliament is to be in recess for so long a period. I should have preferred that the important legislation that has been foreshadowed, and some of which has been already delayed too long, should be undertaken immediately. We are informed that we are to go into recess for two months, but I trust that it will be possible for Parliament to meet earlier than is at present anticipated in order to deal with the important legislation indicated by the Prime Minister this afternoon. </para>

                    <para>.- The statement made by the Prime Minister this afternoon was one of the most surprising statements ever made in this House. I wish to refer to it in somewhat the same spirit as that adopted by the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine).</inline> It is impossible that we should fail to realize the extraordinary seriousness of the present position. We must all feel that the position of our own country and of the Empire demands the most serious attention. Whilst the Prime Minister was speaking, I could not help the recollection of a statement he made in Bendigo in April of last year, to the effect that the question of conscription having been decided by the people it would not be resurrected or revived. At that time the Government were consequently faced with the necessity of finding a policy to carry on the war without conscription. Yet at this time of the day, after an interval of nearly ten months, the Prime Minister tells us that the Government are going to consider their policy. It is the most damaging admission of bankruptcy in government that, I think, Australia has ever been faced with. The Government set out to win the war; they announced themselves as being ready to proceed vigorously with measures for winning the war last April. </para>

                        <para>- They have done absolutely nothing to win the war. There is not a single thing to the credit of the Government in connexion with winning the war, but there is much to their discredit, and they have done more to lose the war, so far as Australia is concerned, than any other set of men in the country. </para>

                        <para>- The National party did their best to defeat us. They placed their policy against ours last May, and they won, and, therefore, are entitled to fully and freely carry out their war policy. We put forward our war policy, but the country preferred that of the Nationalparty. From that day to this we have not had the war policy of the Government put before us ; there has been nothing to indicate on what lines they propose to proceed in winning the war. When the policy of the Government is declared will, I suggest, be the time for the Leader of the Opposition to be called on to say whether he is prepared to support it or not. He is not now in a position, and it is unreasonable to. ask him to propound the conditions under which he is prepared to support the Government. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I believe that the honorable member for Flinders is quite right in saying that these hysterical appeals from the recruiting platform are not helpful to recruiting. Only the other day I heard a gentleman in khaki, on the platform at the Town Hall, Melbourne, in the lunch hour, addressing to the (public arguments with which we have become familiar, and calling his auditors cowards, shirkers, and slackers because they did not enlist. I will join any party to stop that kind of thing. Let conscription die and be buried; and I suggest, with diffidence, to the honorable member for Flinders that he should not even suggest that at the back of his mind is an idea that there is yet the possibility of conscription being introduced in Australia. </para>

If the Ministry are prepared to come forward in the House openly with a policy in regard to recruiting, I am certain that we  on  this side  will give it the most sympathetic and favorable consideration. We will not criticise it with any hostile, but rather with a helpful, desire to do the best we can for Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The parties cannot meet until the Government move. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> has said that there are nine members of the Government party favorably disposed, and I was wondering if we could apply the Scriptural reference, and ask, &#34; Where are the nine?&#34; There is only one honorable member opposite who has any concrete proposal. But until a proposal comes from the Government, or from some one with a following behind him amongst honorable members opposite, I do not see that it is worth anything. If the honorable member for Flinders can show that he has a backing on that side we are prepared to listen to him. </para>

                        <para>- I now desire to refer to another matter. To-day I asked some questions in regard to the position occupied by Captain Glossop; and I was informed that he is an officer of the Royal Navy lent to the Australian Navy, that he is not on leave, and that he holds the appointment of Captain-in-Charge of H.M.A. Naval Establishments, Sydney. Captain Glossop is reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 22nd December last as having addressed a meeting at Sydney in the following terms: - </para>

                <para>It is with very mixed feelings that I am taking part in this ceremony. You all know the great referendum has taken place. What can be my feelings on the subject?

                <para>The Government put the proposal before you, and you have turned it down. The feelings of every naval rating and, every military rating are the same. They are ashamed that you have turned it down and have said &#34; No.&#34; </para>

I previously protested against General Birdwood being allowed to interfere, and called his conduct an unpardonable impertinence. </para>

                <para>The position of . Australian civilian prisoners in camps in Germany has for a considerable time been most unsatisfactory. I have brought the matter repeatedly before the Prime Minister with very unsatisfactory results. I was told by the Government to-day that it is proposed to defer any action until the High Commissioner&#39;s letter of 7th December is received. The Australian civilian prisoners in <inline font-style="italic">Germany</inline> found their position so intolerable, and the conditions under which they were placed so unpleasant, that they sent a statement to the High Commissioner pleading for his assistance. They received no reply, but I understand that the Government have been informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> that the Central Prisoners-of-War Committee now desire to place all overseas civilians under the care of their respective Governments. I am informed that the committee mentioned in London have undertaken to look after the welfare and comfort of the civilian Australian and other prisoners in Germany - will honorable members notice the difference between prisoners of war and civilian prisoners? - but ask that &#163;2,500 per year should be allotted to them to cover their necessary expenses. That is where the difficulty seems to have arisen. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> O&#39;Connor, a returned Australian, made the following statement to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 5th November last: - </para>

                    <para>The Australians, he says, should be permitted to have the food which their friends supply, and not be forced to rely entirely on the goods Bent by the Prisoners-of-War Association. The Kew Zealanders, who are supplied through the High Commissioner, are faring much better than the forty-eight Australians. Three out of five prisoners at Ruhleben are barefooted. </para>

                        says that civilians in Germany are without petrol. The civil population have no wool or linen, and women are wearing paper underclothing; but the organization of the army is so wonderful that it will take three&#39; years to knock it out. The Germans hate the very name of Australians and Canadians, who&#39; are regarded as the most doughty fighters in the Allied armies.

Through mutual friends in Holland he has been able to send his son a parcel of food regularly every month.

                    <para>The pledge has been given, and it must be honoured as soon as the result of the voting is finally established. Every member of the Ministry will then fall back into the party which is charged with the direction of the affairs of the country, and is restricted only by the votes of the people against compulsion, and by the pledge which shuts <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> out from leadership. </para>

                <para class="block">On Saturday last and on Tuesday of this week a number of members who were prepared to honour that pledge were charged with having, in common with Germans, an antipathy to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and the Government. Nothing could be further from the truth. A great deal of fuss was made as to an alleged conspiracy that was going on; but the statement made to the press by the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine),</inline> the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Sampson),</inline> the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Leckie),</inline> and myself was an exact and complete recital of the whole facts of the case. It was not until after I had spoken in the House on Friday morning that we thought of doing anything at all in the matter. A consultation took place between us after luncheon. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. When we were sitting in the gardens after lunch on Friday, the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> came along and remarked that he did not wish to intrude. We told him at once that there was nothing secret or private going on, and that if he chose he could remain. He did remain with us, and disagreed with the attitude we had adopted. But he was not in the position that we occupied to participate in the amendment, and we did not ask for his adhesion to our proposal in any shape or form. All that we desired was to do what we had pledged ourselves to do, quite irrespective of who might support us or what the effect might be. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with that point. The very moment the proposed amendment was drafted, I gave the Government Whip an intimation that we intended to move it. Yet, forsooth, the press comes out with the statement that &#34; the plot was discovered.&#34; In the first plaice, there was no plot to discover; the only &#34; discovery &#34; made was the intimation made to the Government Whip by me, one of the supporters of the Government, that we intended to do a certain thing. Not one of the four honorable members concerned had any communication, in any shape or form, with any member of the Opposition. I make that statement in the presence of my three honorable friends, who agreed with me as to the submission of the amendment. </para>

I told him he would find that it was in my handwriting, but I wrote it in full collaboration with the three other members concerned, who, with myself, assumed the responsibility for it. Again, I say that we had no communication about it with any member of the Opposition or any member of our party, save the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman),</inline> who had not spoken in the debate, and who was asked, therefore, if he would submit the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I expressed my view of the Government at the meeting upstairs. I did not hide my light under a bushel. I never &#39;do. It may be only a rush-light, but such as it is it flickers. I said on the floor of this House what I had said of the Government upstairs - that the Government, having given a pledge, should honour it, and should not take their old positions again. </para>

The man who had to pay the cash might regard it as hostility, but, having put his name&#39; to the bill and assumed the obligation, he would naturally be expected to pay. That was our position. </para>

                <para>I want only to say that in the action we took we were not animated by any feeling of hostility to the Government. We believed that the vote on the proposed amendment would probably be determined by the great majority of the House against the view we put, but we did not concern ourselves with that point at all. We would have been perfectly satisfied to clear our positions by submitting the amendment we had prepared. </para>

                    <para>.- It is to be regretted that, since the Government have had a week to consider the discussion which took place in this House as to whether some means could be devised to secure co-operation outside of contentious matters, some further effort has not been made in this direction. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The Prime Minister threw out a casual offer. It had all the appearance of never having been considered, and, since then, it has been covered up with a considerable amount of doubt and suspicion. He said that, if he were in the way of that effective cooperation, so much desired at the present time between members of this Parliament, he would get out. </para>
                <para>As a result of the discussion that took place in this House last week, it is apparent that a majority of honorable members hold the belief that the Government can be better led than by the present Prime Minister. </para>
                <para>Surely Parliament is not so bankrupt of resource as to be unable to arrive at a better understanding. If honorable members had great private interests of their own at stake, they would not merely introduce an important matter such as this, and then dismiss it in a casual way, as has been done by the Government in regard to this suggested co-operation. The mere fact that the proposal has not been followed up consistently shows that there is nothing behind it. The Prime Minister, after making this casual offer in an offhand manner in Parliament, went outside, and did not hear a solitary speech from either side of the House during the whole of the debate. We were told by the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> by way of interjection, that he would read it in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Very well, he has since had an opportunity of having the statements as they appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> dissected. </para>

                        <para>- Coalition is impossible, because the two parties represent fundamentally different principles of political and social economy. Further, could it be supposed for a moment that if any negotiations were possible with the Government, the party on this side of the House would be offered equal representation with the Ministerial party, which has nearly twice its strength? We know perfectly well we would not, and that there would be in Cabinet a majority dominated by members on the other side of the House, with, the result that the Labour party would be burdened with responsibilities for decisions arrived at by a Government in which the majority was against its representatives. This party could not accept a situation of that kind. A coalition is, therefore, impossible both on the grounds of principle and expediency. </para>

                <para>We do not want office unless we can be in a position to carry out our policy. But, whilst we do not want office, we never have, and never will, shirk our responsibilities; and there is no doubt in the world that, had the Governor-General accepted the assurance given him by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> and had we been called upon, we would have met this House as a Ministry, and have placed a war-time policy before the country. It would then have been for this House to reject that policy if it were thought to be unsuitable. This party, also, would have submitted measures, short of any infringement of party principles, which I believe would have secured the co-operation of members on both sides, but, as I said, we did not have that opportunity. </para>

There must, for instance, be a guarantee - </para>

                <para>There has been some talk of cooperation in regard to the voluntary system, but it seems to me that we have reached that stage when there would be a constant suspicion, especially in view of the qualified utterancesof <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, and in the absence of any direct statement from the Government. There is a suspicion that manoeuvring will take place to have another shot at introducing conscription. Until conscription is finally and definitely abandoned, and an assurance of sufficient force given to the public that they can believe it, it seems to me that there cannot be close and active cooperation between the parties. Honorable members know quite well that a large number of industrial organizations have been badly damaged, and some of them smashed altogether, by administrative actions of this Government, which got votes from the soldiers overseas on the pledge that not one stone in the temple of Labour would be disturbed. </para>

The Government have, in a number of cases, destroyed preference to unionists, which the unions had legally won in the Courts. . That is the act of the Government who pledged themselves to the trade Unionists overseas that if they would vote for the Prime Minister and those supporting him not one stone in the temple of Labour would be disturbed.

                <para>The outstanding principles which I enunciated are recognised by a number of honorable members on the Government side. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman),</inline> in a press interview published in Sydney, stated distinctly that it was necessary that conscription for overseas should be definitely abandoned, and that industrial harmony should be restored in the manner I have indicated this afternoon in order to enable that co-operation which is so desirable in dealing with the great problems that confront the country. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> stated this afternoon that from his observations it would have been the easiest thing in the world to have displaced the Government last week. That admission supports the statement that I have made that the majority of members in this House are being led by a Prime Minister, if not by a whole Government, in whom this House has no confidence, but the operation of the party machine on the Ministerial side prevents the voice of the dissentient minority of Nationalists being heard. </para>
                <para>We have read in the press that those honorable members who have gone to the extent of allowing it to be thought for. a moment that there is anything serious in their objections to the manner in which the country is being governed to-day will run the risk of having the party rule run over them, and they must either knuckle down and support the Government or leave the party. </para>

                <para>There is a means by which this country can be led in a way acceptable to Parliament and to the great majority of the people outside, and in a way that would give us better opportunities to co-operate on non-contentious matters than is possible under existing circumstances. Some honorable members on the Government side pledged themselves on the hustings to what are known as elective Ministries. Why not let us have an elective Ministry now? The Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Joseph Cook)</inline> have said that they are prepared to go out of office. Let all the Ministers leave office and let us substitute an elective Ministry chosen by every member of Parliament, but confining the portfolios to members of the National party. We on this side do not seek any office. Let the Government party have all the portfolios, but allow Parliament itself by a majority vote to choose its Ministers. </para>

                        <para>- No. The Assistant Minister is merely endeavouring to sidetrack me. He knows that when a clause in a Bill is under review, it is competent for honorable members to move only amendments which are relevant to it. As there was no clause in the Repatriation Bill dealing with the substance of repatriation we were prevented from moving amendments, because no amendment would have been relevant. </para>

                        <para>- I have pointed out time after time that our Standing Orders are really designed to gag Parliament.

As a matter of fact, the whole parliamentary machine is designed to prevent us transacting the business of the country. </para>

                <para>There are twenty-five notices of motion on the business-paper to-day, many of which have been there for months. Yet Parliament adjourns from time to time without considering them. We have pleaded with the Prime Minister to give us an opportunity to consider these proposals, but all our appeals have fallen upon deaf ears. ^ To-day I again ask the Government, instead of closing Parliament for two months, to afford us an opportunity of discussing proposals of urgent public importance which have emanated from both sides of the House. But nothing is al lowed to come before us, save through the mouthpiece of some half-a-dozen men. </para>
                <para>If it be the desire of honorable members that a Ministry should be formed with which the entire Parliament can co-operate, Parliament should be afforded an opportunity of electing that Government. Honorable members upon both sides of the House would then be able to submit their proposals and to secure their discussion in a non-party atmosphere. The Prime Minister has referred to some of the matters with which the Government propose to deal when the House re-assembles. . He spoke of the organization of industry, and of a scheme of industrial legislation. Are the Government going to use &#39;their majority - a majority gained on a win- the- war policy - for the purpose of reorganizing the industrial legislation of this country, whilst practically excluding from their councils representatives of the industrial sections of Australia? Before this proposed legislation is submitted to Parliament, no industrial representative will see it. When it is presented for our consideration, the rules of Parliament will again be enforced, to support the tyranny of a majority, and to suppress those who really represent the workers. Apparently, the power of the Government is going to be used to overturn the stones in the temple of Labour, which the Government have pledged themselves shall not be done. Representing, as I do, a large industrial&#39; centre, I say that upon those matters which are outside of party controversy, I deplore that there is contention in this country. </para>
                <para>I believe that the questions which are of non-party concern in Australia to-day are greater than those which are of party concern. They include the defence of Australia and recruiting for service overseas. The trouble is that there is in Australia an imperialistic domination which is willing to entirely disregard the future of the country so long as the last man can be dragged out of it for service overseas. Whilst I would do everything possible to assist Great Britain and the Empire to win the war, I hold that any action we can take in that direction must be based upon a consideration of the country&#39;s vital needs. If this Parliament were afforded untrammelled opportunity of considering the problems with which we are confronted, I would join heartily in giving effect to the decision of tie majority. But by denying us a chance to discuss these matters in Parliament, it is impossible to &#34;coerce a minority. If we had an opportunity of considering our position this Parliament would very soon reach an agreement. </para>

                        <para>- I am optimistic. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> may not desire to come to an agreement upon anything. I, however, think better of  him than that. If there are in Parliament members who do not desire to reach an agreement, it will be impossible to do anything; but I believe that on each side there is a majority desirous of co-operating in matters of supreme importance to Australia that are far outside the scope of party. To believe anything else would be to believe that members generally are absolute traitors to the country, and I do not think that of any member. The main obstacle to cooperation upon vital matters is the want of opportunity to reach an agreement, and it seems to me that the Government does not desire that an agreement shall be reached. I am convinced that there is at the disposal of the Government, and of members, means for arriving at an agreement for dealing with matters of vital concern to the people of the country. </para>

                    <para>.- I had not intended to speak, and feel less inclined to do so after the unusually moderate speech of the honorable member for Cook; but as I know something of what transpired last week-end, I think that I am justified in giving my version of the matter introduced by the honorable member for Henty. It was not my intention to speak of it here or now, though I should have spoken of it on another occasion. At about half-past 3 last Friday afternoon - I cannot give the hour exactly - I and other members now in the chamber were sitting in the little room generally known as the quarantine room. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> was one of the party, and the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine)</inline> came in and whispered something to him. Evidently they did not desire that we should hear what was said, as they went out to finish their consultation in the little interviewing room outside. The honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> said that the Whip was informed of what was done. The division was to have been taken at half-past 3, but it was only at 10 past 3, that is, only twenty minutes before the time fixed for the division, that the Whip was informed of what was being done. It is no secret, because the facts have been published in the press, that there were only two dissentients when, at a meeting of the National party, it was moved that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> be leader of the party. Sixty-nine members of this party, out of a possible seventy, were present, you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> not being there. </para>

                        <para>- They had the opportunity to give expression to their dissatisfaction if they desired to -do so. At a subsequent meeting, which was not quite so well attended, though nearly so, the course that the Government should adopt was dealt with, and there were then only nine dissentients. I take no exception to the attitude then assumed by those nine gentlemen. They were justified in voting as they did, and the facts have been published. But. I decline, under any circumstances, or on any occasion, to be identified with trickery such as that of last week; because it was nothing else. For men to descend to such practices as were followed is not fair. What was to&#34; be done should have been done openly and above-board. Why should not the whole of the members of the party have been consulted ? This is supposed to be a united party. There are questions on which we do not all think alike; but we are pledged to stand shoulder to shoulder during the war for the promotion of the interests&#39; of the Empire. It is a singular thing that not a member of the old Hughes party was approached by any one from the dissatisfied coterie. </para>

                        <para>- When the figures are analyzed, support is given to the inference that I have stated. On the division there were 43 &#34; Ayes &#34; and 19 &#34; Noes,&#34; or 62 voting altogether. Four teen added to 19 would have given 33, or more than half of 62; that is, a majority of 4 to oust the Government. If a section of a party is dissatisfied with its leadership, or with the administration of those it is ostensibly supporting, it is perfectly justified in attempting to alter things, but why should it not have been done above board and in an open manner ? That is my complaint. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps the honorable member knows. He may be in the game. If we are to be handed over to the Bolsheviks, let us know. So far as coalition goes, the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> speaking here the other day, declared that a coalition was utterly impossible, not because there was any high principle at stake, or anything of that kind, but because honorable members opposite were not allowed to enter into one. &#34; We are hot allowed to do it &#34; he said - not actually in these words, but in words to that effect - &#34; What would happen if I did ? I would not get the indorsement of the party.&#34; For purely personal and selfish reasons the interests of the Empire and of the country are sunk. That is what the honorable member&#39;s words mean. And the same feeling animates honorable members opposite. They do not participate in a coalition because their principles are against such, an action, nor because they do not believe in what is being done on this side; they refuse to join with us in trying to do something in the Empire&#39;s time of need simply because their own seats are aD stake. When the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts)</inline> was speaking, the honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> interjected, &#34; What do you mean by Australian interests.&#34; What does the honorable member mean? Does he mean that we are to sink the Empire&#39;s interests entirely and have regard only for those of Australia. The honorable member is reported to have said that if Australia was attacked we would have to go behind the Blue Mountains. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that it is true, I merely say that the honorable member, is reported to&#39; have said it. However, that is by the way. On one occasion there was a little arrangement fixed up by a member of this House who is no longer on earth, and few of the Labour party knew anything of it. Yet a paragraph appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> on the following morning, stating that the Labour party had arranged to do so and so, the object being to embarrass the Government. I stood in this, chamber and said that I dissociated myself from it entirely, and would have nothing to do with the intrigues which were making their presence known in this House to the detriment of the honour of the members of Parliament. Upstairs afterwards the gentleman who had arranged the intrigue threatened to punch my head; and had i,t not been for the presence of another man, a better man than he, I would have been given a hiding. I deprecate anything of this sort taking place. If there is any desire to oust the Government, let it be done fairly and in the daylight, so that every one will know what is taking place. </para>

Since the honorable member for Herbert has. ceased to be associated with some of us politically, he is fond of saying that everything done by this party is dominated by outside organizations. We have a platform to which we have pledged ourselves, and we know what we may expect if we violate it. For that reason more reliance can be placed upon our pledges than upon words uttered on the public platform by other parties. The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Leckie),</inline> who disputes my statement, cannot complain, seeing that he suffers from the effect of pledges given by men whom he professes to follow. I know that he is thoroughly dissatisfied with his position. </para>

                        <para>- It did not. One of the main reasons actuating the people of Australia in returning the Labour party with a majority at the elecions held in 1914 was the fact that the party, in matters of defence, both naval and military, did not only talked, but acted. There have been frequent interjecions to-day relating to the attitude of Labour parties in other parts of the world, and particularly to that of the party in Great Britain. The attitude of the Labour party of Great Britain to-day concerning the war and its general conduct is very different from what it was at the commencement of the war. 1 will men-&#39; tion two prominent members of the Labour party in the Old World - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas,</inline> ex-Minister for Munitions in France, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Henderson, an ex-member of the War Cabinet, and a leader of the Labour movement in Great Britain. They are just as earnest as ever in regard to the successful prosecution of the war, yet both of them, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henderson,</inline> are engaged in preparing for the next election. At present <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henderson</inline> is not only leading in the great Labour Conferences in England, but he is seeing to the selection of at least 300 Labour candidates to contest various British constituencies at the elections which he considers are quite likely to take place in May next. No one lean &#39;doubt that there will be a general election in Great Britain before the war ends, and probably at a much more critical period in the history of the war than the present. Elections have taken place in all parts of the British Dominions during the; progress of the war, and in my humble judgment the only way of clearing the atmosphere in Australia today is to permit the constituencies to express their views as to the persons by whom they shall be represented in this Parliament. </para>

                <para>The Prime Minister has this afternoon outlined a programme as extensive as any ever submitted in a Governor-General&#39;s opening speech. Having mentioned a variety of important topics, he said that these were matters of great importance, demanding our immediate attention, and he then proceeded to move the adjournment of the House until the middle of April. We are returned to this Parliament to do the work of the country. We look to the Government to prepare the necessary legislative measures, and yet they are asking now for an adjournment of two months. There might be some justification for the proposed adjournment if it were asked for by an absolutely new Administration. I suppose that in tile records of Parliament the present Ministry will be referred to as a new Government; but we know that it is the same old Government, composed of the same men occupying their old offices, those which they have held for the past eleven months. In spite of this they are pleading for more time for the consideration of the vital measures upon which Australia and our boys at the Front depend so much. </para>
                <para>I repeat that there is one question, and only one, dividing this Parliament and the community at the present time, and that is the question of conscription. The blame for the introduction of that contentious question must rest on the shoulders of the party opposite. If it had not been introduced we would now be in a far better position in regard to the part which Australia is taking in the- war than we are. So much has been said and done since the introduction of that question that it will take the united effort of all the members of this Parliament to compose the feelings of the people outside, and bring them into a mood to take the same active part in the matter of recruiting that they were taking at one time. </para>
                <para>We may differ materially in our political ideas, but every man knows that it is impossible to take a step in advance with any hope of success unless the sympathy and support of the workers of the country have been secured. Take the workers, men and women, out of the community, and the British Empire would crumble up to-morrow. </para>

                <para>I have my own ideas with regard to the prosecution -of the war under the voluntary system, and since the beginning of the Parliament of 1914 I have had ideas with regard to the organization of industry in this country - a matter of the greatest importance which has been absolutely neglected by the present Government. Most of the members of the Ministry in this chamber, and in another place, are Free Traders, and the bulk of their followers are either Free Traders or fiscal atheists. What could be expected in the way of Tariff reform from a mixture of that kind ? It may seem a contradiction of my previous statement, but I say that, in respect of some of our Australian industries, no mere increase of the Tariff would be sufficient to prevent them going out of existence, and the men engaged in them being thrown out of employment, because the competition with which they are confronted is impossible for them to meet. </para>

At present, there is no hope of saving some of our Australian industries by taking any action short of absolute prohibition of goods which we can produce and manufacture here.

                <para>What have the Government done in this matter ? Some time ago the Prime Minister, with a great flourish of trumpets, said, &#34; I have established a Science Bureau.&#34; From that was to be evolved a great revival of the industries of Australia. I want to know, here and now, two years after the establishment of the Bureau of Science, what it has done for the industries of Australia. What are we, as a Parliament, going to do for those industries? If we are prepared to throw men out of employment, and let our soldiers come back to find their fathers out of work, they will say, &#34; This is not how we left the country.&#34; They will want to know what their parliamentary representatives have been doing whilst they were fighting for the country abroad. There is no doubt that the returned men will be very emphatic in asking that question. A good deal of attention has been turned to the settlement of soldiers on the land, but not more than15 per cent, will desire to be provided for in that way; and the question is, What are we going to do with the other 85 per cent. ? </para>

I brought the subject under the notice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> when he was Prime Minister, and also under the notice of the present Prime Minister on more than one occasion since 1914. If the honorable member who interjects cares to turn up the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the 21st October, 1914, he will find that certain suggestions I then made were favorably received by the then Prime Minister, who said he would invite the Premiers of the various States to collaborate with the Commonwealth Government in &#39; some scheme to give Australian industries an impetus so that we might be prepared for the aftermath of the war.

                <para>The Minister for the Navy announced yesterday that the American shipbuilders would turn out the first ship for Australia by March, presumably ready for business, and the question now is - When are we to i have the first ship built in Australia? What is the use of the Prime Minister spending time in endeavouring to make this or that arrangement? Why not start straightway with the building of ships ? We all know that nothing is so much needed by the Empire and her Allies as tonnage, and there ought to be no further delay. Instead of adjourning for two months, we ought to be engaged in passing measures to assist Australian industries, to rescue those which are now practically dying, and to establish new avenues of employment. It is about time that the Government woke up; and I hope, with the honorable member for Flinders and others, that the recess will not be so long as has been indicated, but that we shall be called together at an early date to discuss the measures outlined this afternoon. </para>
                <para>Great and necessary schemes have hitherto been carried on practically under the sole control of the Prime Minister; and, in this connexion, we are entitled to much more information than we have yet received. We have not had a full balance-sheet in regard to the purchase of the fleet of fifteen mercantile ships, so that we are in ignorance as to the relation between their cost and their earnings. In the case of all the Commonwealth factories we have annual financial statements, and similar information ought to be afforded in connexion with shipping, with the sugar industry, the Wheat Pool, and other commercial undertakings in which we are interested. Such information is only our due, seeing how much the Commonwealth is doing in financing the schemes; but members of the Commonwealth Legislature are left in ignorance of what is being done, although, as a matter of fact, we are the first who ought to be informed. It is left to the Auditor-General to find out and tell us of serious leakages here and there; and it is undeniable that the greatest care ought to bo exercised, because, in the future, every penny will count much more seriously than it has in the past. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to make a personal explanation. I regret that tittle-tattle in the House should be made the subject of discussion; but when the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford)</inline> mentioned my name as that of one who had possibly intrigued with somebody on the other side, I gave the suggestion the most emphatic denial. I have since been puzzling my mind as to how any idea of the kind could have originated. The honorable member for Fawkner indicated that he knew something about the matter, and I saw him in regard to it. That honorable member assures me that I walked over the chamber, and, across him, said Something to an honorable member in the Government corner. I had no recollection of any such thing, but something has since come into my mind that may clear the position. The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> was speaking from that corner at the time, and I should like to be allowed to read a few words from his remarks, which may be found on page 3106 of the current <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard.</inline> The honorable member said - </para>

                <para>The one thing that overshadows everything else, to my mind, is the obtaining of reinforcements for the men at the Front. In view of the fact that the greatest bitterness that has ever existed in this country was created by the late referendum, and that there is a personal hostility to an extent that has never previously existed against any Government in Australia against the present occupants of the Ministerial bench, I have been thinking for a considerable time that it would be in the best interests of obtaining reinforcements if another Government occupied the Treasury bench. </para>
                <para>It is of no use to close our eyes to the fact, for it is impossible for any man to go into any portion of Australia and not find that the hostility existing between the Labour organizations and the present occupants of the Treasury bench is so intense that it is having a very serious effect on the obtaining of recruits under the voluntary system. Holding that view, it is my duty - and I take the responsibility, whatever happens - to give expression to it. </para>
                <para class="block">I remember now that, when the honorable member for Franklin sat down, I walked across to him, and, though I do not remember the exact words, said, in effect, that if there were sufficient men on his side of his way of thinking there could be some business done. It may have been that I did mention the number - fourteen; but I gave an emphatic denial to the suggestion made this afternoon, because I had never calculated how the numbers would show on a division, and I could not understand how I could have mentioned that figure. </para>

It does not matter to me one bit what is said on that side of the House on a matter of this kind; but, in justice to honorable members opposite, it is only fair that I should mention this casual remark - so casual that I had forgotten it - so as not to place the honorable member for Franklin in a false position with his party. I should say that I said nothing else to the honorable member for Franklin, outside the House, either before or after he made the speech. The honorable member had made a speech&#39; with which I largely agreed, and I really crossed the House on my way out of the chamber to congratulate him, and did then say something of the kind I have indicated. </para>

I heard the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey),</inline> who was sitting at the table here, when the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> was speaking, shout across the floor &#34; Fourteen will do it,&#34; and the honorable member for Henty answered, &#34;Do you see any green in my eye ? &#34; The interjection of the honorable member &#39; for Bourke was not recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard;</inline> but I heard him shout the statement, playfully, across the floor. If I did say something of the kind, it was quite a casual remark, and had nothing whatever to do with what some honorable members opposite are pleased to call scheming. I said openly in my speech, and say now-, that if there are sufficient members on the other side prepared to support a new National Ministry on that side, I believe it would be in the best interests of this country if the present Prime Minister was retired from office. There is no question of intrigue or underground engineering about that. </para>

                    <para>.- I was exceedingly pleased to hear the explanation of the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts).</inline> Had he made it earlier in the debate, a good deal of bitterness might have been prevented. I was the person over whom the honorable  member for Cook leant on Thursday, when without any qualification whatever he remarked &#34;Fourteen will do it.&#34; That is the remark I heard. I paid no attention to it at the time, as it had no significance for me, and it was not until I heard of the proposed amendment on the following afternoon that what seemed to be a very innocent casual observation the day before began to assume somewhat significant proportions. </para>

                        <para>- I am responsible to the extent that I certainly mentioned it. The first thing I noticed was that on the Thursday, the day on which the re- mark was made, nearly every  speaker  on the Official Labour side pointed out how desirable it was that the present &#39;Government should be ousted from office, and another Government from the Nationalist party substituted. That suggestion came practically from every  speaker  on that side, and on the back of that came this intimation from one of the leading members of the Official Labour party to one of the malcontents on the Nationalist side, &#34; Fourteen will do it,&#34; which implied that fourteen from this side, plus the number on the other side, would just about do the trick. It was after that that the amendment, about which we have heard so much, was proposed, which amendment, had it been put to the House, would probably  have been carried. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member could not gather that from the speeches, because the majority of the speakers on this side signified no such loss of confidence in the Prime Minister. It, therefore, looked very significant to me that a leading member of the Opposition should make such a remark which involved a knowledge on his part of the way in which his party&#39; would act. The vote of his party, acting in conjunction with fourteen on this side, would mean . the defeat of the present Government. I had no idea that this matter would be introduced to-day, but it is as well that it has been, because I am exceedingly pleased to hear from the honorable member for Cook that his remark was a casual one, and that no communication had previously passed between him and any member on this side of the House. </para>

                        <para>- The remark I heard was not of that character. It would not go beyond the one honorable member, I should think, in the immediate vicinity. The honorable member also knew that I was politically unsophisticated, and that he might safely communicate that little confidence in my hearing. </para>

                <para>I am sorry the honorable member for Cook, in frequently making what seem to me to be valuable suggestions, should so often destroy their value by his hesitancies, qualifications, and, at times, exaggerations. The one question on which we are all agreed is the immediate importance of finding sufficient reinforcements for our men at the Front. I do not suppose there would be one dissentient from that proposition on either side. That being so, I agree with the honorable member for Cook that in the future, if the best is to be got out of the voluntary system of re bruit ing, we must as a party recognise that conscription in Australia is dead, and ought to be buried. I adopt that position, and think it is quite futile for the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine),</inline> who seems to be obsessed with the idea of conscription, to drag it in on every occasion. I am sorry that when we have had such&#39; an emphatic pronouncement from the people he should persist in the suggestion that it may yet be necessary to bring the question up again. I should think that after two such pronouncements as we have had from the people on the subject, we ought to be satisfied. In the recent campaign I took up this position: I said, &#34;This question has been discussed from every point of view by the people, and whatever may be the result on the 20th December, I am bound as a true Democrat to accept the decision of the people. I intend to accept it, and if in the future I find any attempt being&#39; made by the Government to bring in conscription by a side wind, it will receive my most uncompromising opposition.&#34; If we are to get the best out of the voluntary system, we must bury Conscription. I have done my utmost on the voluntary platform, and did my utmost on the conscription platform. I recognise that&#39; conscription has been put out of of the way, and that we must go back to the voluntary principle. It was quite impossible at any time to induce the people to accept conscription unless we made a united appeal to them. Had we been unanimous, or anything like it, in the House on the necessity for conscription, I believe we would have carried it, but as matters stand, it is, and has been, and -will be, absolutely impossible. If we are at one as to the necessity of raising recruits, and are thrown back on the voluntary system, then I say, without any qualification, &#34;Let us make common cause.&#34; </para>
                <para>I urge honorable members of the Opposition not to be scared away from the voluntary platforms by the action of the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine)</inline> in again holding up the bogy of conscription or the possibility of it in the future. Let us come together and make common cause. That is tie suggestion I offer. I intend doing, in my constituency, everything I can to renew interest in recruiting from the voluntary point of view. The way to make the most effectual appeal is for honorable members representing both parties in this House to come before the people and to show them, by such an object lesson, that we are at one on this most important matter. </para>
                <para>Let&#39; the Opposition pair with members of the National party, and go out upon a voluntary campaign, saying to the people, &#34; We are at daggers drawn on a large number of questions. We are constantly at one another&#39;s throats in regard to all kinds of matters that we deem important; but here is one about which there is no difference of opinion, about which we are agreed. There is no room for any difference of opinion. That being so, with united voice we make our appeal to the manhood of Australis,&#34; if that be done I believe the result will be all that can be desired. </para>

We who have suffered some of the blame - who have been called pro-Germans in the newspapers of three&#34; or four capitals - are glad to know now that the story of this intrigue was the result of a chance remark made in front of an honorable member who describes himself as &#34;an unsophisticated politician,&#34; and who did not really understand the force of it. We know now that it was a mere chance rumour. </para>

From the very inception of this war I have been doing my utmost to assist recruiting, and in every way to help on the prosecution of the war. It is, therefore, unfair that at a time like this I should have such terms applied to me. I have said in this House, as well as at the party meetings, that I believe a pledge honorably given by the Government ought to be honorably kent. and I fail to understand why I should be called a pro-German or an intriguer for expressing such an opinion.

                        <para>- I care not whether I go out of public life or not because of what I have done in this matter. I repeat that a Government that has given a distinct pledge to the people should keep that pledge, and it will not worry me whether I go out of Parliament or not for giving expression to such a view. If the Minister thinks the people of Indi differ from me in this matter, I am quite prepared to test their feeling. </para>

                <para>We are now to adjourn for a couple of months, and in the interim the Government will have time to decide how they will keep their pledge, or a semblance of the pledge they gave the people. Their pledge that they would not continue to govern if conscription were not agreed to will not be kept by merely drifting along and not actually governing the country. Such a course of action would be one way of appearing to keep the pledge that was given, but it would not be satisfactory to the people or the Parliament. The Government must have a definite policy. </para>
                <para>I am glad that the Prime Minister put in the very forefront of his speech the question of the importance of securing reinforcements. That duty is one of the greatest placed upon this Parliament, yet it has not been taken over by any one Minister. The responsibility for recruiting has been handed over to a gentleman who is not even a member of this Parliament. The Government are placing in the very forefront of their programme the question of reinforcements, yet they have handed over the direction of recruiting to a gentleman who is not responsible to this Parliament, and has not a seat in the Cabinet. We can well imagine a Cabinet meeting to consider this - the greatest of all their duties - and one Minister saying to the other, &#34; How is recruiting get ting on ? &#34; <inline font-style="italic">Not</inline> one Minister would be able to answer the question, however, without ringing up <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackinnon.</inline> I have nothing to say against the Director-General of Recruiting. He has done his work in the most excellent and satisfactory way, and if we were looking for a man to put in the Cabinet to attend to the work of recruiting, he would be one &#39; of the best we could find. The point I wish to make is that since the question of reinforcements is in the forefront of the Government programme, we should have a Minister directly responsible for the work. </para>

                        <para>- At all events, the Government say they regard the obtaining of reinforcements as their first duty, yet they leave to some one outside the Government and the Parliament the work of obtaining reinforcements. I admit that the Government have not stinted the Director-General so far as money required for the work is concerned. But many recommendations that have been made to the Minister for Defence by the Director-General of Recruiting, and much of the advice of the different recruiting committees, have been turned down. The man who is directly responsible for the work of recruiting should have a seat in the Cabinet. He should be able to discuss with Ministers the different systems that be wants to resort to in order to increase the supply of recruits. He would thus have avery much better chance of carrying his schemes to a successful issue. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to make a few observations as&#39; to the suspicion which certain honorable members of this party have been under for some days. My attitude was mentioned by the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> as being in opposition to anything in the nature of an amendment to a motion which I believed to be vital to the Government. The honorable member for Henty, as well as the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine),</inline> the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Leckie),</inline> and the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Sampson),</inline> all knew my views on this particular subject. I was utterly opposed to the suggestion, and I did all I could to discourage it. I told the gentlemen concerned that it was a wrong step to take. There was nothing secret about the proposed action, so far as I was concerned, because it came to me while I was moving about in the garden. At my party meeting, and in this chamber, on Thursday last, I made a statement practically to this effect: My personal views are that had the Government merely resigned and straightway again resumed office, I could not, and would not, have supported them ; but when the Prime Minister resigned unconditionally, and tendered no advice to the Governor-General - who was thus quite unhampered in his choice of a successor, I felt I could trust  His Excellency,  in view of his long and distinguished career in the House of Commons, to take all steps that were possible or necessary to insure a stable Government before again sending for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline></para>

                        <para>- In my opinion, it was quite the constitutional view of the position. That is the attitude I took up on Thursday in this chamber. From that course, I could not be dissuaded, nor, indeed, was any attempt made to dissuade me&#39;. All I want to say now is that I believe that it was wrong on the part of our party managers and Ministers, relying, as they were, upon the loyal support of members of this party in a trying time - and while I do not speak for myself, because it has never been any strain upon me to support my party, I know some honorable members strained their individual positions to stand loyally by the Government - to allow it to be rumoured about, seeming to inspire information for the benefit of the press, that a number of members of this party were associated with the movement. One of our later members, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maxwell,</inline> has limited knowledge of the individual members of this party. It was a mistake, I repeat, to suggest that there were fourteen men in this National party ready to combine and support any movement at the instigation of the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts),</inline> or some disgruntled member - if there be such - on this side, to overthrow the Government. If it were desired to damage the National forces in this community, I could conceive of no more deliberate way of doing it. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Fawkner did not make that suggestion. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. RODGERS.</inline> - I have never known a case in which responsible Ministers, who were relying upon the united support of their party to carry on, allowed any members of their party to remain under this suspicion. Lists were flying round this House ; lists containing the names of thirteen men - men who, I believe, were quite innocent, and had no thought of doing what was suggested.  It is up to the Government and the party managers to take action; and, if they believe any member of this party has been guilty of political corruption, to indict him. </para>

                        <para>- In my judgment, any member who had promised his adhesion to the National Government would be guilty of political corruption if, on a censure motion, he allowed a suspicion to be engendered that he was con- . cerned in a move to overthrow the Government. If there are such, they should be charged. Ministers are charged with certain obligations with respect to this great National party, and the forces we represent outside. It is part of their responsibility to keep this party intact, and by so doing make it possible for the Government to prosecute the war in a manner desired by the people. </para>

                <para>I rose, particularly, to ask the favor-, able consideration by the Minister representing the Minister for Defence of a request on behalf of those racing clubs concerned in a recent Regulation further limiting the number of race meetings per annum. I believe it is necessary that in war time racing should be restricted; but- </para>
                <para class="block">I say, also, that this course of action does not produce the results looked for. It is quite right that a large number of people should not be allowed to spend too much of their <inline font-style="italic">time</inline> during the war in an over-indulgence in racing; but I point out that many country clubs, which have been holding race meetings for forty and -fifty years, are now unable to arrange for the usual meeting because of the Regulation issued recently by the Defence Department. These clubs, moreover, are prepared to devote all the proceeds to patriotic purposes ; and several have done so up to date. Not long ago a conference was held between representatives of the Government and racing authorities, and the result, I understand, has been that seventy-nine race days have been allowed metropolitan clubs, and the balance allotted to country clubs. The object is two-fold - to prevent commercialism in racing, and the too frequent attendance of young men at such gatherings. Both objects are perfectly legitimate, but I point out that the Regulation absolutely cuts out way-back country race meetings which are held only once a year. They have not held these meetings in a spirit of commercialism. They have bred some horses in the district, and the racecourse is their place of meeting. They bring their hampers and fraternize. </para>

                        <para>- No;. they are the ordinary meetings of country clubs. The Government have cut out those fixtures altogether, and have asked the Victoria Racing Club, as one of the bodies governing this sport, to say where the holding of races would be most likely to promote horse-breeding. How do the Government advance war interests by prohibiting these country meetings? Young men do not hang about a district all the year through because of the races. These engagements do no more than provide the amount of pleasure necessary to distract the minds of the average people from the worry of the war. We approached the State Commandant with a request that he should allot us a day for a meeting. His reply was that the number of race meetings had been fixed, and that he could do nothing in the matter. We went before the Victoria Racing Club, and the reply of that body was that it had been consulted only as to what dates would be best for the holding of the prescribed number of meetings. Now we have been told that we may hold our race meetings, but only on an unregistered course. What difference does it make whether the meeting is held on a registered or an unregistered course if it brings the same people together for the sarner, purpose? To begin with, meetings cannot be held on an unregistered course, because every country course is registered; Secondly, every person who participates in racing on an unregistered course, whether as owner, trainer, jockey, or bookmaker, is disqualified from participating in a registered meeting. &#39; Cannot the authorities see that they are merely throwing dust in the eyes of the country people ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not blame Ministers; it is the military authorities who are responsible. I make- an appeal to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence to interest himself in this matter at once. It will be of no use his telling me that he can do nothing. The Government can undo what they have done. They can allot more&#39; days for racing, and, in the interests of decent, clean, country sport, I ask them to review their decision. Many of these clubs have, by means of working bees, made their own race-courses, and the people in the district have bred horses. The holding of country&#39; races &#39; will not interfere with the war, and will give pleasure to people who have far too little opportunity for recreation. What I should like the Government to do is to place a further limitation on the proprietary racecourses. The men who pocket the profits of racing have been allotted more dates than the big clubs, which,&#39; on one day, raised over &#163;20,000 for repatriation. I ask the Minister hot to merely pass this matter on for an official investigation and report, but to act at once, otherwise the whole of the country club fixtures for the year will be wiped out. </para>

                    <para>.- Because of the reports which have been in circulation regarding intrigues against the Government I desire to say a few words in explanation of my position. Owing to somebody having given to the press a report of a meeting of the National party, I have been regarded as one of those who have been trying to cause trouble to Ministers. I knew nothing whatever of the suggested amendment to the no-confidence motion until 3.30 on Friday afternoon last. I condemned the proposal at once, because I took the view that we should adjust . our differences upstairs in the party room and not in this chamber. On the other hand, I was not satisfied in regard to certain things that had happened, and I had made up my mind that I would not vote on the want of confidence motion, I did not vote, but I say candidly that I would have done so if the life of the Government had been in danger. Having regard to the reports which have appeared in the press concerning the war policy of the Labour party, I&#34; could not afford to allow the conduct of the war to be intrusted to honorable members opposite. </para>

                        <para>- I do not. From the many conversations I have had with him, the honorable member knows well how desirous I am of bringing all political parties together for the sake of a more effective effort in regard to recruiting. I indorse the remarks of the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> in that regard. It is our duty to do all we possibly can to stimulate recruiting, and I would sacrifice almost everything to the one great- aim of getting sufficient reinforcements for our men at the Front. I know members on both sides are strongly desirous that we should put our best foot forward in recruiting and all I desire is&#39; that we shall do something to bring parties into co-operation in a vigorous recruiting campaign. </para>

                <para>Parliament is to be adjourned, and the Government have told, us of the matters that are to be considered between now and the date of our re-assembling. So far as the abandonment of conscription is concerned, I make no promise. The honorable member for Fawkner has asked the Government to give a definite promise that the conscription issue will not be revived during the life of this Parliament. But what is to happen if recruiting again fails? I believe that we lost our opportunity through the wretched promise made by the Prime Minister before the last elections that this Parliament would not endeavour to enforce conscription. From the very commencement of the controversy Parliament should have dealt with the matter. I do not believe there is another country in the world, having the same franchise as the Commonwealth that would have polled so creditably as Australia did in the first referendum. &#39; But conscription is an issue which appeals to everything that is selfish and bad in human nature, and should have never been submitted to the people. I ask the Government not to give any promise that conscription will not be proposed in future. What shall we do if again voluntarism proves a failure? </para>

                        <para>- Since the war commenced I have travelled all through Western Australia with Labour men. For the last election 1 signed the nomination of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Buzacott,</inline> although year after year I had fought him on the gold- fields. But I told the people that during the progress of the war all political divisions were ended, although they might be revived after the war had been brought to a successful conclusion. I hope the Government will see if some arrangements cannot be made to bring honorable members opposite into co-operation with members on this side of the House in a joint policy for raising the necessary reinforcements without conscription. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member knows that I was one of the foremost in advocating the formation of a National Government. However, we do not desire to revive those issues now. The position is serious enough for anything. I hope that the Government, during the little breathing time that will be afforded them by the recess which they need badly - because I hold that  we get  too much politics and too little administration - will see whether it is not possible to get both parties in Parliament to work together for the purpose of aiding the voluntary system. On the other hand, I trust that they will not give any pledge again, because, if the voluntary system fails, there must be a further appeal to the people. Should the Ministry give another pledge, I will do my best to aid in burying them as soon as possible. </para>

                    <para>.- I have been requested to bring under  the  notice of the Government a telegram which had been received by the honorable member for South Sydney,  who  is unavoidably absent. It is therein stated that Messrs. Whiddon Brothers have put off forty hands on account of the shortage of wool. The telegram is signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKenzie,</inline> secretary of the textile workers, and I desire to bring it under the notice of the Ministry. </para>
