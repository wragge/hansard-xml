I should be glad, if a favorable opportunity offered, to go to the Territory.

                        <para>- It is not the fault of the Commonwealth administration that the work has been delayed. On every occasion, when a State has asked for the assurance that the money required will be available, that assurance has been given immediately. We are ready to provide money as soon as the States can proceed with the work. Apparently there have been internal and local difficulties. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> has authorized experiments with a view to ascertaining whether a cheaper and more quickly-erected store than a silo would make, a suitable substitute. I shall take an early opportunity to ascertain the results of these experiments. </para>

It is desired that honorable members will cooperate in carrying out the following programme: - On arrival at Federal Parliament House steps 5,000 children will be assembled, who will sing the French National Anthem.

General Pau will introduce the members of the Mission to the Governor-General. The Governor-General will introduce the Acting Prime Minister,  President,  and  Speaker,  and the Leader of the Opposition to General Pau.

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt} a question in relation to the evaporated fruit industry. It seems to be hopeless to expect any shipping to convey evaporated fruits to England at the present time. Those who undertook the evaporating work, in order to get the fruit-growers out of their trouble, incurred rather serious obligations. They have obtained 75 per cent, payment, leaving 25 per cent still due. The evaporated fruit is all stored ready to be shipped away; and I desire to know whether it would be possible for the balance of the amount, or some portion of it, to he granted to the evaporators? Their season will commence very shortly and in order to save the. crop of the second year, it will be necessary for them to continue their obligations, even if they cannot ship to England, in the hope of a. market in the far north of Australia ?</inline></para>

                        <para>We have taken into consideration the representations made in your letter of the 25th September, No. 18/616/21, regarding the reduction of consumption of paper where possible in connexion with parliamentary work.

In fact, very little printing is now ordered by the Committee; practically the only documents printed are those which are printed by order of the Senate or of the House of Representatives, and over which the Printing Committee has no control. </para>

                    <para class="block">In continuance of the efforts of the Presiding Officers to reduce, as far as practicable, the present cost of parliamentary printing, and with special regard for the rapidly increasing cost and shortage of paper, a circular has been addressed, on our behalf, to various recipients of the weekly issues of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> with a view to ascertain whether, in the present circumstances, it is desired by them that the supply should be continued. Up to the present date, nearly 800 recipients have expressed their willingness that it should be discontinued, and the Government Printer has been instructed accordingly. By this means a saving of £500 per annum in the cost of printing alone has already been made, and it is likely that a considerable addition will be made to that amount. A much larger saving has been made by an alteration in the quality of the paper upon which <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is printed, the total amount saved by these two measures of economy being, approximately, £1,500. It will he recognised that this amount represents a considerable saving in the expenditure incidental to one Department of the Parliamentary Service. But, although at the present time, there is urgent and pressing need for economy in expenditure, the need for economy in the use of paper is, for reasons with which honorable members are acquainted, at least equally important, and it is this latter consideration which has largely dictated the measures which the presiding officers have taken in regard to the circulation of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The supply of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> at the instance of honorable members is unaffected by these arrangements, and will be continued as hitherto unless honorable members desire otherwise. The official report of the proceedings of this Parliament is for the purpose, among others, of accurate public information, and is* the only report which reaches the various States of the Commonwealth. It should be mentioned that its gratuitous circulation, unlike that of the State and other Parliaments - which has been largely automatic - is based entirely upon applications, and that there are at the present time almost 1,000 subscribers. </para>
                    <para>With further reference' to the question of economy in printing in connexion Avith the House, about which I made an announcement on the 3rd instant, I desire to state that the practice of the Department has always been to effect whatever savings experience shows to be possible, the result being that very few further savings are now practicable. I may mention, as an instance, that a few months after the Parliament met in 1901, the printing of Bills on vellum for presentation for Royal assent was discontinued, and, by the substitution of paper, a saving of about £100 per annum was effected, and the necessarily heavy charges involved in the extra handling of the type were also saved. In addition, by making of uniform size the pages of type of Bills, Estimates, and Acts, a very considerable saving was made - at first Bills had to be re-set as Acts, and the pages of the Estimates had to be re-made up to a different size - these operations costing 'a large sum of money in the year. The number of copies of papers printed was reduced in 1916 to the lowest possible limit consistent with meeting probable requirements. Only recently a further saving was effected by the discontinuance of members" files of Bills, and by a reduction of the number of bound copies of various volumes supplied to members and <inline font-style="italic">bo the</inline> Departments. </para>
                    <para>Some time ago the question of making a saving in the printing of the notice-paper was considered, and, with the concurrence of honorable members, it is now proposed, so long as Government business has precedence at every sitting, to issue a complete copy of the notice-paper only once in three .weeks, viz., on every third Thursday, that being " Grievance" Day. For other sitting days, only questions, Government business, and new notices of ' motion by private members will be printed in full. Hitherto this change has not been made, mainly on account of the difficulty in regard to anticipating debate, but in order to obviate any possible inconvenience resulting from the proposed arrangement (which it is estimated will result in an annual saving of about £100), honorable members are requested to retain their complete copies for ready reference. </para>
                    <para>Papers laid on the table are frequently set up in type before presentation to the House, and I have, as honorable members of course are aware, no control over the printing of such papers, nor can I intervene when papers are ordered by the House to be printed, except to regulate the number of copies to be printed so as to avoid any waste where possible, or to* exclude expensive printing of plans unless they are absolutely necessary or are specially included in any resolution of the House. </para>
                    <para>With regard to the Public AccountsCommittee, I have received the following reply from the Secretary, with whom I had an interview on the subject: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>In connexion with the printing of evidence for the Committee, alteration was made in the procedure some two years past, viz., that only two, in lieu of three," copies of evidence were printed, the revised copy being deleted. </para>
                        <para>Evidence taken by the Committee is not printed for publication, only such copies being obtained as are necessary for the Committee's, use. </para>
                        <para>Inquiry was also made at the time regarding the typing instead of' the printing of the evidence, and it was ascertained that printing: was the cheaper. </para>

                                <para>- That is a lesson in modesty which historians will doubtless note. One reason for restriction in the use of paper is that of general economy, and the other is to save paper, because of the enormous and increasing difficulty in getting sufficient supplies of all classes of paper for public requirements. </para>

                        <para>- There has been no unnecessary delay in connexion with this project. The report of the Public Works Committee was presented to the House only the week before last, and before the work can be proceeded with, it will be necessary, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act, for the House to, pass a motion stating that, in its  opinon,  it is expedient to proceed with the work. It is intended to give notice of that motion as soon as possible. In the meantime, a little delay is occurring owing to negotiations with the Lithgow municipal council as to the terms on which the council will extend water supply and sewerage services to the area to be built upon, and will undertake the making and maintenance of roads. In order to expedite negotiations, an officer of the Department was sent to Sydney on Wednesday to arrange terms with the council. I assure the honorable member that there will be no unnecessary delay in making a commencement, as the Government are anxious to proceed with the work. </para>

I, however, have some vague and fugitive impressions about the matter after much conversation with the authorities concerned, and I believe that, although the weevil problem is not yet scientifically mastered, a great measure of safety will be assured by the proposal for the storage of wheat in silos. As honorable members know, the Government have been successful in securing the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell</inline> Lefroy, one of the most eminent entomologists in the world, whom we expect to give sustained attention to the problem and to master it, so that there may be no mistake in what the Government are proposing to do. </para>

Some figures in regard to them appear in the Budget-papers, particularly those relating to the Commonwealth steamers, but the whole of the figures are not as recent in their compilation as I would like. My idea has been to enable honorable members, as far as they may desire, or think it proper to do so, to examine how each enterprise is progressing, and ascertain whether it is a losing or a paying concern. I am at present conferring with the Minister for Defence in regard to publishing the balance-sheet of the operations of the Small Arms Factory. It is doubtful whether publication should be given to the number of rifles which is being turned out, and the other defence matters dealt with in that establishment. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member has asked for something which is perfectly legitimate, namely, the inclusion of all proper factors that should appear in a balance-sheet. I was instrumental in finalizing the balance-sheet of the Commonwealth steamers, to which the honorable member has referred, and it included insurance, but not depreciation; because the ships had only operated for eight months before the balance-sheet closed, and as a reasonable set-off against depreciation there was an enormous appreciation in the value of the' ships bought by the Prime Minister. We could easily have, doubled the value of the vessels. </para>

I have  discussed  the whole question with shipping men, with whom the honorable member is acquainted, in order to ascertain how far they feel justified in working down to what may be regarded as a post-war valuation for vessels purchased during the war. They are endeavouring to arrive at such a figure, so that, if there should be any collapse in tonnage values, their . balance-sheets will not need any startling rectification. However, I can assure the honorable member that we are anxious that all factors that should be taken into consideration shall be properly accounted for in the balance-sheets of Government enterprises. </para>

                        <para>- On Wednesday last an aeroplane passed over Melbourne dropping leaflets in connexion with the war loan.- At the time I was in conversation with a returned Anzac, whose practised ear picked up the vibration of the machine some minutes before mine did, but when the aeroplane hove in sight he almost collapsed. It has occurred to me that there are probably many returned soldiers whose nerves may be unstrung in the same way, and that possibly it would be better to stop the flying of these machines for such purposes, or keep them at such a height that they will have no effect upon these men. Will the Acting Prime Minister confer with the Minister for Defence upon this matter? </para>

                        <para>- No one is particularly anxious to further distress men who have been subjected to the horrible effects and shocks of war, but it is perfectly plain that every community will have an increasing number of aeroplanes flying, whether they be carrying mails or passengers. That is a matter for the future to decide. At present the distribution of leaflets by aeroplanes is one of the most helpful forms of advertising the war loan, and at this stage I do not wish to stop them from carrying out this useful task. </para>

                        <para>- In England there is a number of members of the Australian Imperial Force who have been classed by medical Boards as C and 01, that is to say, they are unfit for further active service out of England. They have seen very severe service in France, but they are still retained in England by the military authorities. Is it not possible to have them returned to Australia, where there are thousands of men who, although unfitted to go to France, could be formed into a battalion to go to England and replace these C and CI men, whose relatives would like to see them again? </para>

I do not know how many hundreds or thousands of members of the Australian Imperial Force who are classed as C or 01 men would have to be released if I answered the honorable member's question in the affirmative. There are great difficulties in regard to shipping, and there are many other problems connected with a thing of this magnitude. However, I shall confer with the Minister for Defence and see what is possible in the circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- There are seven bores in Papua, the deepest of 'which is down to a depth of 1,800 feet, and oil has been struck; but the problem is whether it is likely to be obtained in commercial quantities. Out of about 2,000 square miles of territory which have been fairly well tested, the oil-field has been located over an area of about 130 miles long by 10 miles wide. Seepages are marked on the map as being known to exist in various parts. It is now a question of capital. The expedition with which the field can be developed depends upon the amount of money that can be applied. There was delay in connexion with the rotary and percussion machinery, owing to the difficulty of adjusting certain parts, but I think that this has been effectively overcome. An expert has been engaged to go to Papua and superintend the commencement of boring with the rotary and percussion machinery. </para>

In the <inline font-style="italic">Mining Standard</inline> of 29 th August there appeared an article setting forth that a cablegram had been sent from the council of the Mining Association of Western Australia to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, as follows :  - </para>

                        <para>The <inline font-style="italic">Barrier Daily Truth</inline> referred to the effrontery of the gold-mining companies of Western Australia in claiming a bonus Of £1 per ounce because certain of their employees had left the mining industry to fight in Europe. The mining companies did not ask that any additional advantage be given to the men who had left their employ to volunteer for service abroad, but they coolly sought a bonus for themselves. They also claimed this bonus on the ground that the labour now available in the mines of Western Australia was, according to the employers, inefficient and specially expensive. In commenting upon the case made out by the gold mine-owners of Western Australia for this special treatment, the <inline font-style="italic">Barrier Daily Truth,</inline> on 2nd September, wrote - </para>

" Response to the call " is not much of an argument when the serf uses it; of course, the mining "guns" may be more successful. But " get " the impudence of the fashion in which this appeal is framed : Those who did not go to the Front want to be paid compensation upon such of their property as has gone. Never mind the widows and orphans of the " skilled miners." Heed not the dependants of the hopelessly maimed. Pay the compensation to the late proprietors of these chattels. The right of interests vested in the slave must follow him even to the bayonet's point and the cannon's mouth. But the proprietor of the right must not follow the slave there to prove his claim. Nothing like that ! To come from this attempt to make direct profits out of the blood of the servile class shed in the trenches to the diminished value of the men who are available is a descent from "the sublime to the paltry, if we take the value as that paid to the slaves themselves. </para>

                        <para class="block">This action on the part of the authorities supports the argument I advanced when we were dealing with the motion for the censorship of members' speeches.. I pointed out that we had to consider, not so much the words actually employed in the motion as the construction that would be placed upon them by the authorities. In this case, an attack upon the Western Australian gold mine-owners is construed into an attempt to prejudice recruiting. Other Labour newspapers which endeavour to expose similar attempts to exploit the public will be treated in like manner. We are harking back to the condition of affairs that prevailed in England when Britain was at war with France, and when, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> ErskineMay has show, to advocate a change of Government was construed by Judges as sedition. <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> points out, further, that societies of supporters of the Government were at this time formed for the purpose of employing spies and informers to hunt up evidence of supposed " seditious offences," and that " every unguarded word at the club, in the market-place, in the very taverns, was reported to credulous alarmists and noted as irrefutable evidence of alleged disaffection." That is practically the position in Australia at the present time. Labour newspapers dare not criticise the employing class in . Australia lest they be haled before a Court on a charge of publishing statements calculated to prejudice recruiting. We are getting back to the conditions that prevailed in England when Lord Abercromby told a jury that to advocate manhood suffrage was " disaffection," was sedition, and was " unquestionably tantamount to a total subversion of the Constitution." There is very little difference between the condition of affairs prevailing in the Old World in those days and those prevailing in Australia to-day when legitimate criticism of attempts to exploit the patriotism of employees who volunteer for active service is construed as being something detrimental to recruiting. No doubt prosecutions of this kind will be extended. One wonders what kind of country Australia will be in the near future when on the one hand working-class publications are heavily fined for daring to differ from the employing classes in their efforts to exploit the Empire, and when on the other hand we find in the press such statements as the following, which appeared in the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Daily Standard</inline> of 4th October :  - </para>

King Ferdinand then appealed' to the Entente, because he realized that in order to keep his throne and life it was imperative to have a foreign military force in Bulgaria, where revolutionary teachings are already making progress among the extremists. Bolshevism was 'the doctrine of the day at Sofia. The workers and soldiers held meetings, made laws, and demonstrated by the palace, when they frequently alluded to the assassination of the ex-Czar Nicholas. </para>

                <para class="block">The decadent Saxe-Coburg dynasty is to be propped up by the Allied bayonets, and the Bulgarians are to be forced to maintain that dynasty, which a few weeks ago the Allies were fighting, while here in. Australia working-class organizations and newspapers are prosecuted for publishing articles reflecting on the employers of Australia. The Saxe-Coburg dynasty which the Kaiser himself hesitated to assist is being propped up by the Allied bayonets, although the Bulgarians themselves wish to get rid of it; the foreign legions in their midst have been used to prop it up. I saw nothing of this cable message in the Melbourne daily newspapers, although I searched for it. I found it in a country newspaper hidden away amongst other matters, and I also found it in the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Daily Standard.</inline> It might have appeared in some of the newspapers of the other States, but I have not seen it in any Melbourne newspaper.

                <para class="block">Empire would not help that dynasty, the Allies intervened to maintain it. The position there to-day is that King Boris rules instead of King Ferdinand, just as in Greece Constantine, the intriguer leaves the throne, and his son now reigns in his stead. Something similar occurred when Roumania went out of the war, but there the reigning dynasty was maintained by the Central Powers. </para>

                            <para>- I have quoted an extract from the New York <inline font-style="italic">Tribune</inline> of 19th May last, which was reproduced in the Australian <inline font-style="italic">Worker.</inline> Germany, when crushing down the aspirations of the Finnish Bolsheviks, is on the side of humanity and righteousness. The honorable member for Grampians, in supporting a Government that imposes heavy fines on the conductors of newspapers published in the interests of the working class, because they adversely criticised employers who endeavour to reap undue advantages by exploitation of the services of former employees now on the other side, "making the world safe for Democracy," no doubt considers that he is acting in the cause of humanity and righteousness. To-day the press of Australia is engaged in a campaign of vilification of the Bolsheviks and in the suppression of information as to the happenings in Russia at the present time. With a view to giving the public something authentic, I asked the Acting Prime Minister recently whether he could inform me as to what really are the relations at present existing between the British Empire and the Russian people. He replied that he was not at liberty, or in a position, to give the information asked for. Yet the press and public men in this country are constantly vilifying the Russian working-class movement. </para>

                            <para>- It is not a fact, and the honorable member is in no better position than I am to judge of what is taking place in that country. We have been told in the cables published in our daily newspapers that -the Bolshevik Administration has declared war upon the Empire. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has denied the accuracy of that statement. Yet these same newspapers continue day after day to misrepresent the working-class movement in Russia. Nobody here can say what is taking place in that country, or what has occurred there, for the simple reason that the fragmentary information which reaches us necessarily comes from more or less tainted sources. All that we know is that a proletarian Administration is to-day in power in European Russia. We cannot definitely say what that Administration is doing. All that we know is that the Soviets, who occupied the musman region, were recognised by the Allies, and fought side by side with them against the aggression of Germany. We have been told that the Soviets have been overthrown in that. region, and that the Allies overthrew them. Whether that is so or not, no man here can say. In my opinion, the condition of affairs existing throughout the civilized world is nothing more or less than a tremendous tragedy. When we look abroad we find that almost the whole of humanity is locked together in a terrible war. As a result of this awful conflagration the working classes of Bulgaria recently rose in revolution against the Bulgarian Czar, and after vain appeals for assistance had been made to the Austrian Emperor and the German Kaiser, the ruling authorities there decided in favour of peace. Everybody must rejoice that Bulgaria is now out of the war. My only regret is that all the other nations are not out of it. I hope that Turkey and the other belligerents will follow the example set by Bulgaria. </para>

Similarly, the Central Powers were careful not to disturb the ruling dynasty when they successfully over-ran Rumania. In my opinion there is too much consideration exhibited for dynasties and not sufficient consideration for the interests of the people. </para>

Prior to the suspension of the sitting I pointed out that the honorable member is supporting a Government which does not hesitate to impose heavy fines on newspapers if they dare to comment upon the aims of Western Australian mining magnates who desire a  bounty of £1 per ounce upon their gold output, because, forsooth, their former employees have left them to fight for the Empire, and because their present employees are less competent and demand higher wages on account of the increased cost of living. When the Barrier <inline font-style="italic">Daily Truth</inline> commented caustically upon this action on the part of the mine-owners it was fined £50 under the War Precautions Act for having published an article prejudicial to recruiting. </para>

                        <para>. - The speech just delivered by the honorable member for Barrier is a most extraordinary one. In the first place, he assured us that the news from Russia, which is published in our daily newspapers, is utterly unreliable, and he also affirmed that nobody in Australia is in a position to know what is transpiring in Russia to-day, notwithstanding that the leading newspapers of the world have their correspondents there. Yet, the moment he touched upon the Bulgarian situation, the honorable member was, apparently, ready to believe all that is published in the press here in regard to it. If the honorable member's statements are calculated to mislead people outside this House, I am delighted to know that they are not likely to mislead honorable members. The honorable member talks satirically about the freedom of the people here, alleging that they are not permitted to publish their views in the press. Does he not realize that this country is at war, and that, in the absence of a censorship, a person might make a statement on the hustings which might be interpreted to. mean something entirely different from that which he had intended? </para>

                            <para>- In this Chamber, we do not take the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> seriously, because we know him. But people outside do not know him, and consequently it would be dangerous to allow his uncensored statements to be broadcasted. There was a time when we dared not utter words which were likely to offend other nations. But men like the honorable member for Batman have never realized the seriousness of this war. He cares not one iota for Australia. He cares not one iota, as he himself has told  us, for the Empire. </para>

                    <para>Let us analyze the position which obtains in Australia to-day. We are able to go down to the Yarra-bank and say almost anything about the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> We are able to indulge in the strongest language in regard to our public men. Men need not be too careful, either, about telling the truth. I have heard statements made in the Sydney Domain which were absolute lies, and which I could prove to be lies. I heard one man say in the Sydney streets, " If you wish to achieve success for the workers in Australia, destroy that building. Take the nut off the piston-rod of the engine you are working, and knock the end out of the cylinder." I attacked the author of those statements, and spoke for an hour and a half in replying to him. Some of his followers attempted to pull me off the platform, but they did not succeed, and I gained the applause of many of those who had been previously led by this individual, who was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World. We have been told by the press that the Bolsheviks of Russia have declared war against Great Britain. I am not going to say whether the representative of the Bolsheviks in Australia should occupy a seat in this House. But I call attention to this fact in order to demonstrate the amount of freedom that we enjoy. Here  is the accredited representative of the Bolsheviks associated with a great political party in Australia, occupying a seat in this Parliament, notwithstanding that the Bolsheviks have proclaimed that they are at war with the Empire.

                            <para>- The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has taken up a most extraordinary attitude in this Chamber. Last night he made a speech which was unquestionably calculated to mislead people outside. He stated that honorable members upon this side of the chamber were willing to support the Government in doing something which Was unparliamentary, which was subtle, and which was never before attempted here. What is the position? Is it not a fact that when previous Governments have desired to obtain Supply they have submitted a Supply Bill at a time when they knew it could be rushed through this House? There was no greater offender in that connexion than the Treasurer of the Government of which the honorable member for Yarra was a member. I well remember an occasion when word was passed round that the Government must obtain Supply on a particular afternoon. Ministerial supporters were given to understand that they were not to talk, but sit tight, and allow the Supply Bill to be passed, because the Treasurer of the day desired it. But what happened ? One of the members of the Ministerial party, in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carr,</inline> kicked over the traces, and made a speech. The result was that quite a number of honorable members missed their trains that afternoon. </para>

                    <para class="block">That came, not from a member of the Opposition, but from a .supporter of the then Government, sitting on this side of the House. The present Leader of the Opposition was a member of that Government. Yet, last night, because the gallery was full of his constituents, because leading trade unionists were looking on, he uttered a tirade of abuse of those  who  left the Official Labour party when he had not the courage to leave it himself. He made that statement last night to depreciate us and the Government in the eyes of his audience and in the estimation of the people outside. A man clothed with the responsibilities of the leadership of the Opposition should "not try to deceive any body of people. He should simply lay before the House the facts as they are. If he did that, nobody in this House would object to his criticism. He implied that it would not be possible to allow the Works and Buildings Estimates to pass through at the same time as the Supply Bill. On the occasion, in 1916, which I have quoted members gradually left to catch the Inter-State trains, and the "honorable member for Capricornia got his Supply Bill through. Not only that, but in a few minutes, when there were hardly any members present, the Works and Buildings Bill, totalling £662,085, was "passed. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> shows no explanation offered by the then Treasurer of how that money was to be spent. How can these gentlemen who have such short memories expect to gull the public with speeches such as the one we heard last night from the Leader of the Opposition ? Why do not honorable members opposite - men with brains, men with great ability, intellectual men - elect a leader like the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> or the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> ? Those gentlemen would be seized of the gravity of the position they held, and would not think of descending to the tirade of abuse to which the present Leader of the Opposition treated us last night. I regret that the Leader of the Opposition was  not present to hear the remarks I have just made, but now that he has come in, I hope he will endeavour to be fair. I trust he will display that characteristic fairness that we all knew him* to .possess during the whole time we were associated with him. If he rises to the occasion and shows himself to be a man his constituents will respect him. There is no need for him to try to mislead anybody. It is not necessary for him to state that we were thrown out of the Labour party with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> The people know that. It will not do him any good, or advance the interests of this country, nor will it stop any expenditure. I welcome criticism such as we get from the honorable member for Hunter. There is something in it. He builds up all the time! He is constructive, but the Leader of the Opposition pulls down every time. Not a suggestion has come from him for the good of this country since he has occupied his present high and honorable position. I hope the honorable member will be more careful next time, and be more sure of - his facts. </para>
                    <para>I find that returned men injured at the Front come back here, are examined by the doctor, and then given their discharge. Many belong to friendly societies, and, as they have" not quite recovered, go on the lodge funds. That is hitting up the lodges very severely. It is a great" tax on the funds of many of the friendly societies, and I urge the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> to try to do something to prevent it. Let the country pay for these men for a time, instead of throwing them on to the lodges, which have had a hard struggle to remain financially' sound (luring this terrible war. Nobody is more able to go into the question effectively than that honorable gentleman, because he has played an important part in the working of the Australian Natives Association, and, as a prominent member of that body, he must know the great struggle that the friendly societies, particularly the Australian Natives Association, have had to meet their obligations. </para>
                    <para>I do not know the route that  the boats  bringing back the Anzacs are traversing, but a prominent citizen in my constituency writes to ask if one of the vessels could be allowed to make Hobart its first port of call. 1 should like to. see that done, so that the citizens of Tasmania p.ould give these heroes the first welcome back to our country. If the vessels are coming round the Cape, it will be quite easy for them to call at Tasmania first. One thing is certain, that the heroes will be given a right royal welcome. </para>
                    <para>Until recently, a very hearty welcome was given to returning soldiers in my constituency immediately they came back. They went first to the Defence Department, and went through necessary forma there in such quick time that they were, able in a very little while to receive a citizens' welcome in the nearest town hall. For some reason this has been cut out, and, I am informed, returning men have to remain from 9 o'clock to 2 o'clock at the Department before they can get away. By that time they have no desire for a public function. All they want is to meet their own friends who have waited so long to give them a welcome home. I appeal to the Assistant Minister for Defence to see if something cannot be done to restore the old arrangement. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know,' but the line is half finished. A low-level bridge has also been built over the Molonglo River. Some authorities say that it will stand a flood ; others not. As a layman, my opinion, for what it is worth, is that it will go at the very first flood that comes down, because it has been heavily decked to hold it together. I came to the conclusion that the top deck and the beams on the piles are so heavy in proportion to the piling that" the engineer who designed the bridge hoped by bracing the top deck and the girders to hold the bridge together on each side. The bridge is not finished, and is in position to bring about a big washout if the waters come down. </para>

I saw thousands of flourishing trees of various kinds from all parts of the world, and the hills are now becoming quite green. </para>

                            <para>- Many of them are, especially the American red pine, which, I think, will be a valuable asset to Australia in the near future if it will grow under the different climatic conditions. I was delighted to see what was being done, and I hope it will be continued. The importance of this policy was brought home to me when on a visit to the Old World some years ago. I saw there country which once had been fertile land, but which, as the result of the destruction of timber, was then nothing but a barren waste. The area in the Capital Territory has been wire fenced, and as the grass has grown luxuriantly I think there is danger of fire, which would, of course, destroy the timber reserves. I know, of course, that if cattle were grazed on the area they would probably destroy the trees. </para>

                            <para>- I would suggest; to the Minister that something should be done to try and protect the growing trees from the danger of fire, because in that reserve we have a splendid asset, which within twenty years should be returning a profit to the Commonwealth. I should like to see this policy continued. Some of the railways of France are being absolutely maintained as a result of this policy of afforestation applied to land adjacent to the lines. </para>

                    <para>I  hope the Minister will give earnest consideration to the work that is being done in the Capital Territory. As a layman, much of it appears to me to be of  no  value at the present time. Some excavations have been made, and embankments built up, starting anywhere and ending nowhere. In my judgment, if ever the capital is to be built, we should start from within and work outwards, doing only that work which is absolutely necessary to make the area habitable, and not put up embankments here, there, and ' everywhere, and construct imaginary lakes. </para>

Honorable members have all had their minds a little bit drawn away from their parliamentary duties by the excellent reception given this afternoon to the French Mission. It was a most touching and brilliant spectacle, in which,- I am sure, we were all glad to take part. I sincerely hope that the cordial relations that, up to the present time, have existed between Australia and France will become more cordial and permanent. As a. young country we are not able - at least I do not think we are - to throw our ports open as the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce Smith)</inline> would, to all the productions of France. As a Free Trader believing in the absolutely unrestricted freedom of exchange in commodities, he would, I venture to say, break down our Customs barrier; but, though we are not able to do that, we can reciprocate with France in regard to some commodities. There are some people who, no matter how high the Tariff was, short of prohibition, would still buy French goods on account, perhaps, of their excellence and design. </para>

But I made no bitter attack on the Prime Minister. I may have made a strong - perhaps it might be considered a bitter - attack on his policy and his speeches in the Old Country. To-day the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> told us that the Government looked upon the Prime Minister as the mouthpiece of the Ministry on all questions concerning the war. I regret that the Government should take that responsibility, because the Prime Minister's utterances are so inconsistent, contradictory, and abusive, that it is impossible for a Government, members of which have made themselves acquainted with his views, to hold themselves responsible for them. In his reply to a question which I  asked, the Acting  Prime Minister  said - </para>

I want again to say that I made no bitter attack on the Prime Minister. I merely pointed out that the Prime Minister in London was, as an ex-Free Trader, converted to Protection, stigmatizing Free Trade as the sickening folly of doctrinaires, pacifists, and pro-Germans. I complained that those were not utterances that should fall from the lips of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth; and by to-day's mail I received confirmation of the view that his speeches in the Old Country are not doing Australia any good.

                    <para>Are we to wait until the war is over before Parliament deals with the Tariff? The Acting Prime Minister said to-day that this war is Australia's opportunity - meaning that, because the war is on, and there is a lack of shipping, our manufacturers can produce goods, and should extend their industries. I suppose, too, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Watt</inline> assumes that if manufacturers establish those industries in Australia they will go on after the war successfully. I emphasize that, unless we alter our Tariff, those industries, if they become established, will surely collapse. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> manufacturer would take the risk of establishing an industry during the war unless the Government came down with a scientific protectionist Tariff. We have no right to wait until the war is over. The Government have brought forward an Excise Tariff which is almost oppressive ; one which, being upon the distilling of spirits, may not disturb many people, seeing that the general feeling throughout the community is rather against the liquor trade, but it may be an unjust and oppressive Tariff, for all that. I hope to insist, at every opportunity, against any delay in bringing forward a Tariff for the protection of Australia's secondary industries. </para>

But we should set our faces against the sweater, be he British, French, or American.  If  ever the world is to have its " Parliament of Man " there must be some development along those lines. The people must protect the fair employer in their own homeland, and must penalize the sweater as heavily as possible, whether he be at home or in another country. </para>
                    <para>Mr.GLYNN  (Angas - Minister for Home and Territories) [3.42].  -  I desire to utter a few words supplementary to the remarks of the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> with respect to the Federal Territory railway. The vote dealing with that railway was originally an amount of about £25,000; and, when £15,000 had been spent upon construction, the question of the reduction of the Estimates for the Federal Territory came before the House. The only item kept upon the original Works Estimate for 1917-18 was that of £7,500 to complete the railway. The reason was that the completion of the line was looked upon as a preservative work, seeing that four out of the seven miles had been constructed. It was realized that its completion would be incidental to the general development of the Territory ; and, since to leave it as it was would result in no revenue, no traffic, and probable waste, it was  decided, after full discussion in this chamber, to sanction the vote for the completion of the work. </para>

                        <para>- Some doubt was expressed as to that, even by the Government. The matter was fairly put before the House, and it was thought that by extending the bridge across the Molonglo, where work had been begun, it might conduce to added development. It was considered that it might assist settlement in the Territory by bringing the rail terminus nearer to the place of discharge or delivery for the goods of farmers and others. I do not say that it was the wisest step that may have been taken, but that the feeling was that it would be better to complete the work. </para>

                    <para>Under the Works vote, ordinary expenditure was cut down from £166,000 in 1915-16, and £124,000 in 1916-17, to something like £25,000; and this year there has been still further reduction. At the present time there are no works being gone on with in the Federal Territory, except those incidental to development. The honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> fairly put the. position as regards general development. Take afforestation, for instance. I deemed it my duty to secure expert opinion upon such a delicate matter as the planting of various trees for commercial and other purposes. I was advised from one source to put out a certain number of the Californian redwood trees, and, with respect to those, I received advice from two quarters - from one that they should be planted, and from the other that they should not be planted. </para>

I thought it my duty to obtain the best expert advice on the subject, and "the gentleman whom I consulted said, " As you have some 80,000 or- 100,000 of the trees ready for planting, it is a pity not to make an experiment with them." He advised the planting of 60,000. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but the rainfall of the Territory is only 23 inches, whereas that of the real home of this tree is 50 inches, and the slopes of the Pacific on which it grows enjoy perennial moisture. When one has no personal experience, reliance must be placed on experts, and I thought that the best thing I could do was to get full reports from those best capable of giving an opinion. I got a report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Campbell,</inline> a Victorian expert on afforestation and a specialist in city beautification. I thought it wise to get the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson</inline> also. He is another Victorian expert, and I received reports from both gentlemen. These and other recommendations, when compared, left me somewhat puzzled, the conflict of opinions not being confined to Parliament. </para>

From what I have heard of him, I believe him to be a very good man, and before requesting his assistance, I had interviews with other officials of the Victorian Departments. I also got <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Corbin,</inline> who is Professor of Forestry in the Adelaide University, and well acquainted with the forests of the State, to give me advice. He is a specialist on method and development. I laid down some heads of development that I wish to have pursued, and obtained a special report on the subject from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Corbin.</inline> In this way from these experts I think I got the best advice to check the various opinions received, and this justified an expenditure on systematic afforestation this year, £5,000 being voted for the purpose. A commencement has been made, and the other day I had the pleasure of ascending the heights of Stromlo, in company with that great French Commander, General Pau, and showing to him the fine panorama which God has given to us for improvement. About 500 acres are prepared for planting, and the trees - pinus insignis - put in during the last two years are a great success. </para>

                    <para>Let me now put the position of the Northern Territory. At the time of its transfer to the Commonwealth, the obligation actually taken over, including both railways, was £6,029,603, and excluding redemption but including deficiency on the Port Augusta railway, there was a. deficit of £241,792 for the year preceding the transfer. Since then the deficit on ordinary and works expenditure has been gradually decreasing. For the total period since transfer to the 30th June, 1917, it amounted to £1,376,383, irrespective of interest. In 1911-12 the deficit was £75,534; in 1912-13, £177,946; and in 1913-14, £202,461. That year I made retrenchments which reduced the deficit to £132,202, but in 1915-16, when I was not in office, it increased to £148,716; and in 1916-17 was £179,935. The position could be putin a more favorable light, but I do not quite accept some of the official figures bearing <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> it. For illustration, last year the total receipts in respect of the Territory  including Customs and Excise receipts and Post and Telegraph receipts, which are under the administration of other Departments, and in a sense need not be directly considered in relation to the Territory, amounted to £132,535, and the expenditure to £203,340, showing a deficit of £71,805; but that does not include certain revenue received outside the Territory. I have said enough, however, to show that we are not neglecting financial considerations. Not only are we hoping to develop the resources of the Territory, but we are at the same time reducing the annual difference between revenue and works and ordinary expenditure. </para>

Although I protested against the selected site, I had, before the war, almost come to the conclusion that it would be as well if Parliament were removed there as quickly as possible ; but we are now involved in such huge expenditure that it is impossible to proceed with works other than those that may be termed preservative. If it can be shown that the proposed works will be reproductive, I shall be in favour of their being carried out, but, otherwise, they ought to be stopped. It would be just as well for the Government to make inquiries as to whether there is not still dual control of kindred works ; and I hope that more attention will be paid to this in the future than there has been in the past.- </para>

                        <para>In asking a question to-day, I tried to inform the Minister that, in matters of Defence, and particularly matters affecting soldiers and their dependants, we are, according to official statements, up against a dead end. When members receive requests from dependants and prefer them to officers of the Department, we are informed by them that they are systematically and legally turning down cases that ought to be dealt with most liberally. Through these officers, and under Acts or regulations, the Government are permitting the intolerable injustice of imposing a fine on the poor unfortunate wife of a soldier at the Front, simply because for some trivial offence he has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment and had a deduction made from his pay. Wives and children have had to suffer losses amounting in some cases to £50 and over. </para>

                        <para>.- It seems most extraordinary that, after the debate we have had, and the complaints that have been made, we are asked to give the Government Supply to the end of January, and this, apparently, without any protest from honorable members. Are we to allow the Government to carry on until after the end of the year with nothing said in regard to the expenditure of the various Departments or the treatment of our soldiers and their dependants ? </para>

The House should insist on having knowledge of how the money we are voting is to be expended ; we should demand more light on various matters of administration.

                            <para>- Force ; we ought to have had force long ago. The demonstration at Parliament House to-day proves to us that the heart of Australia is all right. Nothing could have been better than the response of our boys to the call of the Old Country, not to speak of the wonderful work of the women in the early stages of the war. Yet we have the disgraceful fact that tens of thousands of fine, strong, stalwart .men are kept in their positions by the Government. There is nothing more discreditable than the answers to questions we receive from Ministers. In answer to one put by me to-day, suggesting that balance-sheets be presented to the House in connexion with the various trading concerns of the Government, more particularly the Small Arms Factory, we had the old special pleading reply that, in the opinion of th«&gt; Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> the information, if supplied, would enable other countries to know what we are doing here. Evidently all these matters have to be kept secret, and yet we know that the administration of the Small Arms Factory is disgraceful. </para>

                            <para>- If they do know, they, apparently, ' are not permitted to make them out. That Factory has been operating for a long time. Admiral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Clarkson was sent to Great Britain and America to obtain an up-to-date plant. On his recommendation the Government obtained from America a Pratt- Whitney plant, which was specially guaranteed. It was established at Lithgow, and as there has been no stint of money in connexion with the working of the Factory, we felt satisfied that, no matter what the rifles turned out might cost, they would be reliable. I- should be wrong if I said that every rifle turned out in the Factory was bad, but I do say that rifles were distributed from the Factory to the troops that were so defective that a man might as well have been sent into the trenches with his hands tied behind his 'back as to have been armed with one of them. I produced in this chamber the official report on 300 rifles which were sent to Western Australia, and of which over 100 were sent back to the armoury because, in some cases, the cartridges would not fit them, others with the rifling defective, and in other cases the fore ends snapped in two. The honorable members for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams),</inline> Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney),</inline> and Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford)</inline> were with me when I brought this matter under the notice of  Colonel Bruche,  and, subsequently, of the Minister for Defence. The result was that an officer was sent to Lithgow. The Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> received an anonymous communication, which he showed to me, and I also received a letter from a man who was in a responsible position in the Factory. The purport of those letters was that when Lieutenant Hart arrived at the Factory, hundreds of rifles, which were ready' to be sent out, were condemned, and the management was trying to save something from the wreck. Since the first four months of the war, we have not sent a rifle out of Australia, and only within the last seven months have we made the Mark VII. rifle, which is the Imperial service pattern. The Lithgow ' Factory has not yet produced a machine gun, and, although £500,000 has been spent in Australia on the manufacture of shells, not one shell has been sent abroad. </para>

                    <para>Now the Government tell us that there must be secrecy in connexion with a proposal to spend millions of pounds on an Arsenal at a site in the wilderness which would be eminently suited for a monastery. God knows what sort of brains was possessed by the man who suggested that Tuggeranong should be the site of an Arsenal. Two years ago the Government Architect said that an expenditure of £1,750,000 would be required to house the employees of the Arsenal. Having regard to the increased price of labour and materials, that sum would be equivalent to over £2,500,000 to-day. The Government ask us to pass further credits for a work of that sort, without the matter being discussed by Parliament. </para>

                            <para>-The Public Works Committee has nothing to do with the establishment of the Arsenal. The construction of a railway to the Arsenal site has been referred to the Committee; but we have no right to express any opinion as to whether the site is suitable or unsuitable. As  chairman  of the Committee, I have not allowed one question to be put to witnesses regarding the suitability or otherwise of the site. That is a matter for Parliament to determine. I feel satisfied that the Committee will unanimously recommend that the railway should be constructed to the Arsenal site, because  it would be useless to have an Arsenal there without railway communication. But the Government should appoint a committee of three sound, practical men, with a gentleman like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> at its head, and allow them a free hand. They should not be tied as was the previous Arsenal Committee, which was given certain instructions, and could only report upon the relative merits of certain sites. Admiral Clarkson has pointed out - and his view has been indorsed by every person who has had the opportunity of visiting Lithgow - that the majority of the machines employed in the Factory are automatic. In the Old Country and America, boys are employed to work them, and in Germany and Belgium, girls. This officer, who had been sent to England' and America for the purpose of inquiring into this project, urged that a factory of this kind should be established near a large centre of population, where it could draw upon a constant supply of that intelligent boy labour which is so essential for the economic carrying on of its operations. </para>

                    <para>The Government desire to get Supply this afternoon. I am quite prepared to let them have one month's Supply, but not a vote which will make them independent of Parliament for the next four months. This House should insist upon a more complete control of the expenditure of public funds than we have had in the past. It is not fair to this Parliament that money should be frittered away and wasted, and that the Administration should be so callous to the claims of those who have already made great sacrifices, and indifferent to every principle of morality. Report after report has been made showing extravagance in different Departments, and I wish to know who is responsible for it. If I refer particularly to the Navy Department, I hope the Acting Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> will not think that I am querulous in regard to his administration. These abuses have been occurring for months and years. I and other honorable members on this side have drawn attention to the scandalous things that have occurred in the past. </para>
                    <para class="block">There was, for example, the work being " carried on at the Flinders and Henderson Naval Bases. The Naval Board has had to take the responsibility of all the gross extravagance connected with it; but the work was started without the approval of the Board. The former Public Works Committee visited Flinders Base, and saw evidence of most astonishing incapacity in connexion with the construction of a wharf. Instead of the engineer driving the piles in the sea as is usually done, he first excavated the site, made a huge wall with the spoil, for the purpose of preventing the sea coming in on the work, and then drove the piles on the land side of the wall. I suppose that Westernport contains one of the finest harbors in Australia, and 1 have no desire to dwell at the present moment upon the method which was adopted there of having to dredge for 3 . miles up a river in order to get a decent landing place. I wish to confine my remarks to the wharf. When the Public Works Committee visited the Naval Base they saw an enormous excavation 600 feet long, 50 feet wide, and 20 feet deep, in which piles for the wharf were being driven. When I queried the method which had been adopted the engineer in charge told me that he could not drive the piles through the sand. Any one who visits the Naval Base to-day will see the completed wharf, half having been built in this huge excavation, and half without the removal of any dirt. They had to put a reinforced concrete facing to the edge of the excavated ground. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot give the actual cost of removing the dirt, but for work which should have cost about1s. 3d. or1s. 6d. per cubic yard the Department have admitted a cost of 9s. 41/2d. per cubic yard. Nothing more disgraceful has occurred in Australia in the shape of throwing public money away. The Department actually had a pump installed for the purpose of getting rid of the seepage from the excavation. It was no concern of the Public Works Committee,but when I attacked the engineer over the matter further work on the excavation was suspended, and the balance of the wharf was built without the removal of any more earth. I believe that my action was the means of saving at least £10,000. For over three years work' had been in progress at Cockburn Sound, before any plans had been approved. On top of all this, we have other works piled up all from the same source, and all due to the administration of one man; and yet the Government are quite prepared, as we ascertained to-day from an answer given by the Acting Prime Minister, to adopt the same old system of secrecy. "We are to be given no information about the building of the Arsenal, no matter what it is to cost, £2,000,000 or £4,000,000, because possibly the Germans may get to know what we are doing. We have not sent a rifle out of the country since four months after the outbreak of the war; we have not manufactured a single machine gun, nor sent away a single shell. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it does; but if we are to spend this money, is it not wise to have a proper investigation into the matter before anything is done? If experts will say that it is quite right to build an Arsenal at Canberra so that the operations may be carried out in secret, well and good; but let those experts have a free hand in coming to their decision, and do not let them set to work upon a commission from the Minister for Defence, practically tying their hands as to the nature of the report they must submit. We should certainly have an Arsenal in Australia, and though I do not believe in Socialism, I think that it should be controlled by the Government. In the manufacture of guns and other warlike material it is our duty to see that the machinery employed is the very best obtainable. At the same time, we should see to it that operations are carried on without waste, particularly at a time when we are called upon to do so much to assist in the production of wealth in this country. I am certain that if the Arsenal is established in the Federal Capital Territory money will be frittered away. Every article that will be required - all supplies, coal, iron, steel, and every requirement for the manufacture of explosives - will have to be conveyed long distances to the spot. Labour will have to be taken there from distant localities, and we shall create a second Broken Hill right at the doorsteps of the Federal Parliament House, a proposition quite remote from the idea that prevailed when we set about the building of the Capital. </para>

                    <para class="block">The proposal to build an Arsenal there is altogether wrong, and before more money is spent on it the light of day should be thrown upon it. </para>
                    <para>The demonstration in front of this building to-day has shown us that the heart of the people is all right. Yet it seems to me that there is something wrong somewhere. I have received letter after letter from men who went away in the early days of the war. One letter I received was from a man who was No. 3 among the West Australian recruits. He left his farm in charge of a mate, went to Gallipoli, was wounded there, was sent back to Egypt, deserted from the hospital, got on a ship, and returned to Gallipoli, was again wounded several times, went to France, was gassed there, and was sent back to Australia on furlough. When he returned he found that his mate had left the farm after the expenditure of six years of labour and £2,000 of capital upon it, and sold everything. Thinking that he would have a chance of recovering something from it he asked for his discharge, but he could not obtain release. He has to go back to the Front again. Another case is that of a married man with two children, whose two brothers have also enlisted. He left his farm in the care of a neighbour on. the share-farming system, spent four years at the Front, came back on furlough, and found that his farm had been neglected, that the fences were falling down, that his horses were running wild, and that the undergrowth was springing up again. He also asked for his discharge, but was informed, as the Minister has replied in every case, that, although the Minister regretted it, it was absolutely impossible to give relief because he was wanted at the Front. At the same time, in every Department are to be found great big strapping fellows who are kept in employment by the Government. It is absolutely disgraceful. It is not fair to these men who have done so much for us at the Front, and it should . not be tolerated by Parliament. Supply ought to be refused until the Ministers tell us that they will deal fairly with those members of our Forces who went away in the early stages of the war. A little while ago a young fellow came back wounded, and was given a job as a recruiting agent, but as there was very little recruiting being done he was retired. At the same time he was told that there would be a possibility of  securing a job at the Base Hospital. He got word that there was a job available there, and he dared to put on his uniform and go to the Defence Department. The officer whom he wished to see was not there, and as he was returning to the train about noon - it was on a Saturday - a military policeman got hold of him, put him in gaol, and left him there until midday on Monday. </para>

He entered the Department on the recommendation of the Clerks Union, and I 'am informed had no, previous experience. Before joining the Department, he was employed in a shop. He was placed on duty in the Base Records Office, however, and is to be seen walking about the streets of Melbourne in uniform. So far, no returned officer has been considered fit to take his place. While I was in Perth, I learned more in a month as to the wretched manner in which the Department are treating returned soldiers than I should have learned here in two or three years. I was brought into actual touch with men who have been at the Front, who had made their sacrifices, and had come back thinking that a grateful country would do something for them. They had, however, been disappointed. </para>

Had the Government desired it, I would have helped to apply the closure to the debate on the censorship motion, in order that we might have more time to deal with the important questions awaiting our attention. I desire that the debate on the Budget may be at once resumed, so that we may lose no time in urging the Government to take certain action which I think would be to the best interests of the country. What opportunities shall we have to bring these matters before them if we grant them to-night the Supply for which they ask? This method of procedure is unfair to the Parliament, to the country, and to those who have made their sacrifices for us. If there is one thing more than another that fills me with absolute dismay, it is the thought that, at a time like this, and having regard to the enormous sacrifices that the Old ' Country is making - having regard to the thousands of millions of pounds she is spending in her efforts to destroy the terrible German menace - Australia, with all its wealth, should be going to her for financial assistance. She has assisted all our Allies, lending money here, there, and everywhere. She has bought our produce. There  are to-day 2,000,000 tons of wheat lying here for which the Old Country has already paid. If she ever gets it, Heaven only knows in what condition it will be! She has paid tens of millions of pounds for our wool and other produce, and yet not only are we unable to pay for the upkeep of our soldiers at the Front - we owe the Imperial Government at the present time £39,000,000 in that respect - but we are borrowing money from her. We are borrowing for ourselves, and also for the' States, in order that they may continue their wretched policy of extravagance. - <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline> - But for the kindliness and thoughtfulness of the Old Country - a kindliness and thoughtfulness paid for by the blood of our men at the Front - where should we be today? How glorious has been the response of the manhood of Australia to the call of Empire. How glorious have been their actions on the battle-field, and it is because of them that the Old Country has stood by us as she has done. It is  a standing disgrace that either the Commonwealth or any State Government should be allowed to go to the Old Country to borrow money, except it be for loan conversion purposes. Having regard to our enormous wealth, does it not seem scandalous that we should be going to the Old Country for money? The position is very much that of a rich old gentleman with a profligate son, whose property in various countries has been injured or destroyed by storm and revolution. Despite these adversities, the old man has helped friends in different countries in financial difficulties, and his profligate son comes to him week after week for more money to devote to riot and extravagance. Our position is very much that of the profligate son. Surely, in' a time of stress like the present, we ought to be able, and should be compelled, to finance ourselves. </para>
                    <para>My desire is to prevent the passing of Supply to-night. I take this stand because I object to many of the actions of the Government. I desire to see many changes in the method of handling a number of our industries. In the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of last Saturday, there appeared a report of a speech made in the Old Country by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> in which he stated what he desired to do here in reference to the organization of our industries. I have not the report at hand, but his speech, if I remember rightly, was such as to lead the people of Great Britain to believe that the people of Australia themselves determined the method of organization that should be adopted in relation to all our industries. That is quite incorrect. In every instance that has come under my notice, the Prime Minister has endeavoured to bludgeon people and huge organizations into the acceptance of the economic methods proposed by him. In this connexion, I would point out what he did in connexion with the zinc industry. A resident of Sydney, named Scott, who owns a zinc mine some 200 miles from the city, and has spent about £10,000 upon it, desired permission to sell his ore to the Japanese Government. He applied to the Commonwealth Government for permission to do so, and was referred to the  chairman  of the Zinc Producers Association. He wrote to the  chairman,  who told him that it would cost him £500 to join the Association, that they would charge him 1 per cent, for dealing with his ore, and would claim the right to make all contracts for him for a period of fifty years. </para>

This man was also told by the  chairman  of the Association that if he did not think his mine big enough to justify his joining the Association they would see what they could do for him. The man wrote at once to the Department to say that he had not £500 to spare, and that if ho had he would prefer to put it into his mine rather than to pay for the privilege of joining the Association. He said, further, that, as a British subject, he demanded the right to control his own property. If the Government had any objection to selling the ore to Japan, there, so far as he was concerned, was an end to the matter; but if they had not he did not intend to permit any organization to control the output of his property for one year, let alone for fifty years. He received in reply an absolute refusal. The honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming),</inline> who represented the district, had enlisted, and he asked me to take up the matter. </para>

                    <para>I took the matter up and asked that certain papers connected with it should be laid on the table. From these papers I was able to find out how this Zinc Producers Association was formed. It was formed on the suggestion of a <inline font-weight="bold">.Mr. Higgins,</inline> who has been very prominent in connexion with many of the regulations affecting the formation of organizations. He was responsible for the blunder that occurred in connexion with the export of molybdenite in the early stages of the war. He is now  chairman  of the Wool Board, and has been very prominent in connexion with all these matters. A circular was sent out to the big producing companies to attend a conference at the Attorney-General's" office. When the representatives of the Broken Hill Proprietary and the Mount Lyell Proprietary, the two biggest metal organizations in Australia, said that they desired more time to consider how the proposal would affect .the interests of their shareholders, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins</inline> told them that he would urge the Attorney-General to use the strongest powers, he possessed rather than that the scheme for the formation of the Association should fail. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon</inline> was then acting as Attorney-General, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was a't the time in England. He informed the representatives of the producing companies that they must accept the proposal in the letter and in the spirit in which it was proposed, and they were given forty-eight hours within which to consent. That is how the Zinc Producers Association was formed. In the Association all the big companies have one representative, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins</inline> is the representative of the Government on the directorate. </para>

                        has been instrumental in having Treasury regulations prepared affecting the formation of companies. This is a time at which it is fitting and proper, that the Treasurer should control the registration of companies to see that the investment of money is not ill-directed. If I were Treasurer of the Commonwealth I Would not for a moment permit the investment of capital, for instance, in picture shows or racecourses, or in any business that would not assist the production of the wealth of the country. But the Government have gone quite beyond that, and have made all sorts of ridiculous inquiries. I can give honorable members an instance or two. A man wrote to me from Sydney to say that he had bought a New Zealand patent of very great value, and the price for the option was £2,000 and a share interest on the formation of a company.  His  application to the Treasurer to be allowed to form a company was refused on the grounds that they would not permit £2,000 cash to be paid. He wrote to ask me whether I could help him in any way. I wrote a warm letter to the Department, telling them that, in view of what was being done here, Tammany would blush if they knew the opportunities that they had missed. Later on this man got his permit. Another application came from persons interested in the Light of Asia Mine in Western Australia, but nearly three months elapsed before the application was granted. The Department required to know the nationality of the vendors, and why they wanted any cash. This application was made in connexion with an option in the case of a mine from which gold to the value of £100,000 had been taken, and
                        <inline font-style="italic">on</inline>
                        which there was &gt;a milling plant and a winding plant. The permit was withheld for nearly three months, and in the interval the men who were giving the option won £6,000 of gold out of the property, and so reduced the value of the option.
                    </para>
                    <para>I ask honorable members to consider what is likely to be the natural outcome of this kind of treatment of persons who wish to get companies started. The honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> will know the many difficulties that were placed in the way of the starting of companies while he was in charg&amp; of the Treasury, because of the conditions, insisted upon by the Prime Minister (MrHughes) - not by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> . whom I absolve in every way in connexion with this matter.  </para>

Seventy of the shares were to be for the public at £30 per share, and thirty shares for the vendors. They asked no cash, and every penny they received was to be placed to the credit of the company to be expended upon development alone. The honorable member for Grey, as Treasurer, approved of this proposal, subject to a condition that the thirty shares should be placed in reserve until six months after the war. Any one with any knowledge of mining knows that these shares might have a value in six or twelve months and none at the end of the war.

Before saying that they shall not send their ore out of Australia, it is incumbent upon themselves to insure that the producers shall get decent treatment here. This particular company spent about £80,000 in the erection of a plant, which it was anticipated would successfully treat the carboniferous ore - the oxides. That plant was a failure. It is costing these people 30 per cent, more to- get their ore .treated at Port Kembla than it would cost them to get it smelted  in  England. If they could send it to </para>
                    <para class="block">Japan, they believe that the profits would enable them to erect a plant of the character that is required to economically treat it. If that could be done between 700 and 800 white workmen would be profitably employed there. That is what we want. If we intend to hold this country, we must settle a white population in the northern portion of it. If. we do that, we shall be conferring the greatest possible benefit upon Australia. </para>
                    <para>At the present time we have a little coterie in Melbourne comprising the zinc producers, the copper producers, and the tin producers, and they are getting absolute control of bur production. God, knows why the Government want to acquire an iron mine. I have been through the papers dealing with the option which they have secured over the  By the  River deposit, in Tasmania, because I desired to learn what amount of  insolubles  was contained in the ore. But I was unable to get any information save that the Government have already paid £3,000 for the option, and may have to pay an additional £97,000 for the purchase of the mine. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins</inline> is to get £10,000, which he is distributing for the good of the people- </para>

                            <para>- We have not been told that. Instead, we have the vague statement that it is " in the interests of the nation." If the Commonwealth Government desire to own an iron mine, the Western Australian Government will give them for nothing a far richer and better one than that at Blythe River. I refer to a deposit near Derby, in Western Australia. I will undertake to say that that mine will give far better assay values than will the Blythe River deposit in Tasmania. </para>

I endeavoured to ascertain what expert examination has been made of the Blythe River mine, what are the assay values of its ore, and whether it was right for the Government to purchase an option over something of which I am sure this House will never approve. </para>

It is true that we are giving them liberal treatment in the way of sustenance allowance, but we most certainly ought not to pauperize them. Single eligibles in the various Departments should be displaced with a view to providing employment for returned soldiers who have done their duty to this country, who are possessed of a decent education, and who are able to efficiently perform the work that is required of them. </para>

                        <para>.  - I desire to address myself to the question of payment to the dependants of men at the Front who are absent without leave. I know that according to military law these men have been found guilty of an offence. But even if they were criminals, surely their wives and dependants cannot be held responsible? We have been told that it is not the duty of the Defence Department to continue to pay sustenance money to the dependants of men who have been guilty of so-called desertion. But it is the duty of this country to look after the dependants of every soldier who has gone to the Front, no matter what he has done, because but for the war his dependants would never have been in the position in which they find themselves to-day. There can be no excuse for the Government withholding sustenance money from the women and children in our midst whose husbands and fathers have gone to the Front, and are to-day absent without leave. If those men had continued in their civil avocations, their dependants could have sued them for maintenance. As they are on the other side of the world they cannot be proceeded against under the law. After hearing the honorable  member  for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> and the honorable member for New England (Lt.-Col. Abbott), I am willing to believe that many men who have not suffered in the fighting are absent without leave, being really wasters. I quite believe that the men at the Front will insist on their being punished, but the Government are punishing, not them only, but their dependants in Australia. But I have also heard of dozens of oases of men who have been in the trenches for over twelve months and are not responsible for being absent without leave. I have heard of eases of men who looked as if they were deserting to the enemy, but who were not, because they had not only wandered away, but had wandered back again, under the effect of the stress of war on their brain and nerves. Surely it is a crime to punish men like that, and a much greater crime to punish their families? Any- Government that punishes the dependants of either class is not carrying out its real duty to those left behind. I blame, not the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> but the Ministry. No one Minister should have the power  to decide that the dependants of any soldier shall be allowed to starve. . The Minister for Defence is endeavouring to throw the onus on the State Governments, but why should they shoulder it? Their avenues of taxation are now restricted owing to war conditions, and it is not right to throw on them the cost of keeping the dependants of men absent without leave at the Front. I am surprised at the Ministry defending such a proposal. Not one member of this Ministry can say individually, with justice, that dependants should be punished for what the breadwinner has done at the Front. I know of quite twenty heartrending cases. </para>

                    <para>Charitable associations have not the money nowadays to give the relief needed, because the calls in other directions on  the charitable public have deprived them of much of the funds they used to handle. Even the churches have felt the pinch severely, and the revenue of sporting clubs has, in most cases, dwindled to nothing. Friendly societies are in the same position -as the churches, and the Government know that neither the State Governments, benevolent institutions, churches, or friendly societies can support these people. The last we heard was that the Government had offered to pay half if the State Governments would find the other half. Some of the State Governments have rightly refused on the ground that the onus should be on the Federal Government of paying for anything that is the outcome of the war. Votes for public works have been restricted, and in practically every State but Queensland the money voted for charity and education has been reduced. Seeing that it is the same people that find the money, it is not statesman-like to argue over the question whether the State or Federal authorities shall pay.' It is agreed that the people of Australia should pay, and, as the Commonwealth has the largest area of taxation and the easiest methods of collecting revenue, it should discharge the obligation of providing for the wives and families of these men, not a mere pittance, but enough to place them in the same position as they were in before their breadwinners went away. The Commonwealth can deal with each man concerned on the merits of his own case, but it should not deal with any dependants on the merits of "the case of their breadwinner. I know nearly a. dozen cases where the men before they went away were sturdy workers, good husbands and fathers, and kept their families properly. When they left, the purchasing power of their money was considerably greater than it is to-day. Now, through conditions of war, for which they are not responsible, their dependants are in want. </para>
                    <para>We might as well blame a lunatic for being a lunatic as blame a great many of these men for being absent without leave. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know if that is so, but I know one man who had been in the trenches for fifteen months.  His  company went over the top one day. Some of his comrades met him as he was coming back. Instead of staying in the lines afterwards, he wandered 18 or 20 miles off to a French village, and was there for five days. When found, he did not know much about anything. Those put in charge of him could see that he was, temporarily, almost witless, and were not very careful of him, with the result that he got away again. The man in charge of the guard was reduced for letting him go. It was seven weeks before they got him again, and during that time he had been with the French people. He has been given three years for being absent without leave and for breaking guard. He has a wife and three children. Before he went to the war he was most attentive to his family, a hard worker, and an able tradesman.  His  wife and family to-day are living at the mercy of charity. There are thousands of such cases, and, as evidence that the present Ministry recognise that the people of Australia are responsible, they have suggested that the States ought to pay for them. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member knows what I mean. I say that any demand that the islands shall become Australian dependencies will embarrass peace negotiations more than anything that Industrial Workers of the World advocates could do. The efforts of the Dominions in connexion with this war have been fully advertised, and, naturally, some respect will be paid to their wishes. We had the pleasure to-day of welcoming members of the French Mission, whose visit to this country is evidence of the fact that our Ally, France, fully appreciates what Australia has done, and, of course, will give some consideration to Australian views upon this great question of the Pacific islands, which some people are demanding shall become a dependency of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- That, at all events, was not one of the conditions leading to the war in 1914. We understand now that Asia Minor is to be cut up, and certain territorial re-arrangements are to be made in Italy, France, and other countries. I say that these secret treaties must embarrass those who have to consider the terms of peace, and if we, in Australia, demand that the islands shall be retained, we will further interfere with the negotiations; but I shall avail myself of every opportunity to say that ' we have no right to exhibit greed for territory, or false pride of what we may have done. </para>

                            <para>- Well, the honorable member can look at it that way if he likes. If a peace could be secured which would insure that there would he no more standing armies, except those necessary for policing purposes to subdue so-called dynamitards and their ilk, there would be no need to (demand that Germany should not receive her islands back.  President  Wilson's conditions of peace laid down emphatically that Germany should have no right to construct naval bases in the islands of the Pacific. If peace were based upon  President  Wilson's conditions, there would be no need to worry whether Germany might ever construct ' naval bases in the islands, and there would be no necessity to demand that Germany should not get her islands back. </para>

                    <para>In arriving at a basis of peace, also, it should be laid down that no private capital be invested in the manufacture of munitions of war. What did Germany do with respect to. constructing naval bases during the period in which she held control of those islands? If, after having paid her war indemnities, and having observed all the other peace requirements, Germany said, "We want our islands back to provide us with necessary raw material," we would have no right to embarrass those around the peace table by saying, " We demand that Germany shall not have her islands back, but that we shall have them." If President Wilson's conditions of peace cannot be secured, it will mean that Germany will not have been vanquished, in which case we would not get those islands. Our own Naval Bases may be useful in the future for mercantile purposes; but if President Wilson's conditions are to be observed, our present Naval Bases will henceforth be of no use to us <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> such. </para>
                    <para>With respect to repatriation, I know the difficulties which the Minister administering the Department has to face. The gentleman who occupies that office is generally inclined to do well, and I do not know of any other gentleman on his side of politics who would do better in the same office. The difficulties are great. There are several points of administration with which I disagree. For example, it is not fair to spend up to nearly £4,000 in the case of one returned man who is suited to go on the land, if, at the same time the Department is not prepared to expend as much, if necessary, in placing another returned soldier in a position to earn his living as a carpenter. Quite possibly, the man upon whom £3,000 is to be spent to give him a start on the land has fought no better than, if as well as, another returned man upon whom nothing like the same amount is proposed to be expended. </para>
                    <para>There is another consideration, that, by placing returned men on the land and spending large sums of money in establishing them, the cost of land throughout Australia is increased; but the value is not enhanced. It is not fair to spend £3,000 in insuring one man's well-being unless the Department is prepared to disburse as much in giving other men a start in different avenues of employment. </para>

                    <para>That the amount set down in the Schedule for the Postmaster-General's Department - £1,275,570- be reduced by £1. </para>
                    <para class="block">I take this action because of the acute dissatisfaction, both within and without this chamber, with the administration of postal matters. Ever since I have been a member of this Parliament, and probably long before I entered it, country representatives have been expressing disapproval of the curtailment of postal facilities, and have been complaining that, instead of helping country residents, the Postal Department has put obstacles in their way. I am continually receiving communications from all sections living in my constituency, containing complaints about the action of the Department in asking for personal contributions to supplement departmental expenditure, in order that postal facilities, such as they are, may be continued. Only yesterday, I received a letter from the council of the municipality of Wilcannia, asking me to present to the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Webster)</inline> a petition against the discontinuance of the Wilcannia-Ivanhoe mail service. I was informed that the petition was being largely signed by the residents along the mail route, and by the citizens of Wilcannia. The council thanks me for past favours, and entreats my efforts once again on their behalf. Ever since I entered Parliament, I have been continually writing to, or interviewing, the Postmaster-General regarding grievances suffered by my constituents. Their complaints come, not from the men working in the Broken Hill mines, but from station-holders and station-workers, and small men on the land throughout my electorate. The petition which I have presented to the Postmaster-General shows that last year the Department called upon residents along the line to contribute £26 towards the mail service, and they are told that this year they must find £56. They ask, very pertinently, what, at this rate of increase, will they be called upon to pay in 1919. Services have been curtailed throughout the country under the plea of economy being necessary. At this period, postal facilities are more than ever necessary and desirable, because so many are anxious to hear of their relatives at the Front. Yet this is the time that the Postmaster-General chooses for the curtailment of services, telling country people plainly and bluntly that if they will not put their hands into their pockets, and consent to be specially taxed, they will not be permitted to enjoy the usual conveniences of civilization. No Government claiming to have the interests of the people in the back country at heart would act in this way, penalizing those who have separated themselves from the city, with its enjoyments, comforts, and conveniences, to live in and develop the interior. I know what country conditions are, because I have lived in the country and driven a five-furrow plough. In the back-country districts one is absolutely  nut  off from civilization, and it is only fair that there should be a regular and proper supply of newspapers and letters  to  keep  the  people in touch with  the  world. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lamond),</inline> the last time I mentioned the subject, assured me that I would have two-thirds of  The  members with me. I do nob claim any monopoly in making these complaints, but I do say that we treat the Postmaster-General with too much consideration; people outside are not given half the consideration that this House gives to the Postmaster-General in his vagaries with the Department. The honorable gentleman talks about economizing, and yet he publishes a pamphlet in face of the paper shortage. </para>

Personally, I think the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams)</inline> suffers a great disadvantage in being politically connected with the Postmaster-General. No other body claiming to be a representative assembly of the people would tolerate such a travesty as the Postmaster-General's attempt to administer his Department. </para>

The complaints which have been made over and over again by honorable members prove that there is grave dissatisfaction with the postal administration. Before the House adjourned in June last honorable members on the Government side attacked the Postmaster-General's administration, and the Acting Prime Minister agreed to confer with the Minister as to the possibility of finding some remedy for the complaints. I have waited in vain the outcome of the conference. The only way of testing the feeling of the Committee with regard to what I consider the maladministration of the Postal Department as it affects country residents is by moving to reduce by ?1 the amount provided in this Bill for title Department. </para></speech>

                        <para>. - With much of. what the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> has said I agree. My remarks will not apply to the present Postmaster-General any more than to his predecessors. It is the principle, or lack of principle, of which I have complained every time the Postal Department has been under consideration in this House. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">The honorable member for Barrier was on the right track when he said that the balance-sheet of the Postal Department should not be taken into consideration when we are dealing with the postal, telegraphic, and telephonic service of the back-blocks. Of course, those services do not pay. Does any one expect that they should? Does any one believe that the people who go into the backblocks should not have fair telegraphic and telephonic conveniences? For a long time I have been in communication with the Department in regard to one portion of my electorate, where the postal service is worse than it was fifty years ago, when there was not a railway service in the State of Tasmania. I hold that the present system of blackmailing local residents when they ask for services is rotten in principle. We are always urging the people to leave the cities and go into the country. Does any one suggest that, the people in the cities should pay portion of the cost of the two or three mail deliveries which they enjoy daily? At a saw-mill in the back-blocks, miles away from the nearest nurse or medical man, the telephone is an absolute necessity in the interests of humanity. Unfortunately, serious accidents happen in the milling districts, but if by means of a telephone the people can communicate with a medical man, and be told what to do until medical aid arrives, many valuable lives can be saved. Has any one the right to say to those people : " Before you can have telephone communication you must put your hands in your pockets, and out of your poverty make good any amount by which the earnings fail to meet the interest on the cost of construction?" The principle is altogether wrong, and I am certain that the Postmaster-General knows it to be so. What is beating him, as it has beaten every one of his predecessors, is a system by which the bookkeeping account regulates the postal services in country districts. It is time that system was discontinued, but I do not see that any good can result from pressing, in such a small Committee, the amendment which the honorable member for Barrier suggested. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it is not. The time is particularly opportune for the honorable member to bring for ward this matter, because tenders are now being accepted for a three years' service all over Australia. I ask the Postmaster-General to tell us now that the postal services in the back-blocks will not ' be reduced, and that the people will not be asked to make up any loss of revenue. I was one of the half-dozen members who opposed the introduction of penny postage. I do not object to penny postage, but I hold the opinion that the postage rates should not be reduced until the backblocks have proper means of postal communication. </para>

                            <para>- The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Webster)</inline> is thoroughly justified in asking for an increase in the. postal rates, but that increase should be accompanied by the display of a little generosity towards the people in the back-blocks. It is true that some only get a letter occasionally, but to them the daily papers are a source of intense anxiety. They may have boys at the Front. They want to see the news of the outside world, with which they have little means of communication. They have few of the benefits that the congestion of civilization offers in the big centres. For fifteen years I have been waiting to see in office a Postmaster-General in thorough sympathy with those who are living out in the back-blocks. The best man we have ever had in the position was the first Postmaster-General with whom I was brought into contact. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sydney</inline> Smith. He did more for the country residents of Australia by giving them postal facilities than has been done by any of his successors. I have every sympathy with the speech delivered by the honorable member for Barrier. There is scarcely a sentiment which he has expressed to which I have not given utterance here for many years past, but I ask him not to press for a division. I urge him and others who feel as I do to wait until the Estimates are discussed, when we shall have the opportunity for a full-dress debate, and can urge upon the Postmaster-General those principles for which he and I stand this evening, I hope, with such effect, that there will be an end to the blackmailing efforts displayed towards country people, by telling them that they must put their hands in their pockets before they can get postal services. </para>

                        <para>. - As a rule I do not reply to general complaints by honorable members concerning individual cases that may be interesting them at the moment. The honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> has brought forward two cases. It was only yesterday that he submitted two petitions to me dealing with those cases. If that is his idea of giving a Minister the opportunity to investigate matters which he claims should receive attention, if that .is his way of treating those who are responsible for the administration of the Department, and if it is his method of letting the country know how he thinks the Department should be administered, all I can- say is that it does not savour of British fair play. I represent a large country constituency, which is probably more settled than most country electorates of the same size. When I came into this Chamber there was no postal concession for country districts. If the service, mail or telephone, did not pay, the Government made no concession in regard to it for years after Federation was established. With other country members, I urged successive Ministers to act more liberally to the man in the back-blocks. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it was. In those days there was no country telephone service, and there were no balance-sheets. No one knew what was being spent. Post-offices were being built by political influence, and in some cases did not return in revenue one-fifth of the interest on the cost of construction. Since then, the Federal Government have undertaken to liquidate 25 per cent, of 'the estimated loss on both telephone and mail services. Two or three years afterwards, when the finances were flourishing, honorable members compelled them to give still further consideration, and the percentage allowance was increased to 50 per cent.- Since the war began, and since I have had the honour of administering the Postal Department, I have on my own initiative extended that allowance by 10 per cent, in each case, in order to give country people fl fairer opportunity of getting those services which I know are essential to settlement. There are services that should not be granted under any consideration, services which would cost hundreds of pounds and yet return practically shillings in revenue. These services cannot be granted because, if it was the policy of the Department to establish them at great cost, it would have less money to devote to the establishment of services which were more warranted, and would injure people who are better entitled to consideration. The whole problem is one of finance. Mail services are costing 100 per cent, more, and in some cases 300 per cent, more, than in pre-war days, and this extra cost has to be made up by the Department out of the rates that were in existence prior to the war. Telephone material has increased in cost. Wire which was £12 per ton is now £82 per ton. The cost of poles, crossarms, and everything else, has gone up, even by 80 per cent. Labour costs practically 25 per cent. more. Yet honorable members ask me to endeavour to give facilities equal to those which were given when the pre-war rates existed. I ask them, as reasonable men, to remember that there are war conditions here which have to be met. I have my responsibility, the Treasurer has his, and he controls the purse. Rightly or wrongly, he says to me, " The finances are stressed. You must do with, so much." It is not a question of whether it will injure this or that. I have taken the trouble to compile a history of the whole of the main operations of the Postal Department for the past three years. </para>

                            <para>- I compiled it for the information of honorable members. I did it in order to save the time of the House, and if possible to allay complaints from different honorable members by letting them know our difficulties and the direction in which economies have been effected. I tried to show them that I was endeavouring on the one hand to give the best services I could, and even more services, and on the other hand to practise economy in -directions where waste had been discovered. Our expenses are going up year by year. Each time mail tenders are called for, they -are higher. Those which are coming in to-day are higher. Of course, this House is supreme, and if it decides that people should have  country services, willy-nilly, whether they give any return or not, or whether they give a small return, with a big loss, then in these days of great expenditures money will have to be found by way of subsidy to provide for these services. I have heard the honorable member  for  Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams)</inline> again and again in this House deliver the same kind of speech that he has made this afternoon. He makes them no matter who holds office asPostmaster-General. I think I may reasonably appeal to honorable members to recollect the conditions under which we are labouring, and to have regard to the fact that each year of war adds to the disabilities and anxieties of the Department. I ask them to, at least, give me that consideration, and not to expect what they might have done in pre-war days. I cannot to-day give new telephone extensions or extend telephone lines, not only because I have not the money at my disposal, but because there is no material. It is a question, not of whether I would provide these services, but of where I could get the material to supply them. As to the question of mail services, equitable consideration must be given to the whole of the country mail contracts and the whole of the people to be served. I must strive to do with the money at my disposal the greatest good for the greatest number. No honorable member can say that he has ever failed to receive at my hands, not only an acknowledgment of a letter of complaint, but a thorough investigation of his claim. Where a proposed work! cannot be carried out, I invariably give the reasons against it. In many cases I have been able to carry out works that have been urged by honorable members, and even the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> admitsthat recently, despite the difficulties confronting us, we found a way of giving relief to a certain district in his constituency. </para>

                            <para>- On one floor a few that were built before I took action have been pulled down so as to provide for modern conditions. As to the institute to which the honorable member refers, I would point out that it is designed to give us better-qualified officers and a higher standard of service. We could not make a better investment. The institute is to be opened on Tuesday next at noon, and I invite honorable members to be present and to see what has been done. But for the action I took, the floor now devoted to the institute would have been occupied by men who are now accommodated on other floors. </para>

Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been saved by economies in large centres of population, and in this way I have been enabled to maintain country services which otherwise would have been abolished. If the amendment is to be regarded as a reward for my effort to do my duty honestly in times of trial, then I shall take it for what it is worth. I shall continue to do as I have done - I shall go on doing what I believe to be right, caring nothing for the critics who desire merely to serve their own political ends. </para>
