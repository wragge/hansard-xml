It seems a dastardly thing that some journalist should have inserted in the press a statement of that character. One can only describe him as a &#34; muckworm,&#34; or something of that description. I have telegraphed to the editor of the paper denying the allegation, - and demanding an apology, for I claim to have as much loyalty and devotion to the British flag as any other honorable member of this House. </para>

J. Hassall, complaining that he and two daughters were ejected from the Paramount Theatre by the manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hassall&#39;s</inline> only offence being that, when the National Anthem was being played, he removed the hat from the head of a man who refused to rise or uncover his head? Can any steps be taken against this manager in the direction of cancelling the licence of the theatre whose manager ejects loyal citizens whose only offence is that they strongly object to the open display of disloyalty on the part of others? </para>

                        <para>-- During the last eight or nine days the Government have been endeavouring to provide, in conjunction with the States of New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria, for the cutting in hay of a reasonable amount of grain that might otherwise become wheat. I have had considerable difficulty in getting the States into line. They are not quite into line yet. For instance, South Australia is prepared to accept a lot of work in connexion with the scheme, but is not prepared to accept any financial responsibility. The guaranteed responsibility in connexion with the Wheat Pool was shared between the Commonwealth and the States, and we were anxious to have an arrangement on a &#34;similar basis in regard to fodder supplies. I am still hopeful that it will be complete before the season is too far advanced, so that in the bulk of the hay belt we may be able to save a good deal of the crop for fodderpurposes. </para>

The policy of the Department is to at all times give preference to returned soldiers, as is shown by the fact that of the existing male staff 97 per cent. are returned soldiers. This high percentage of men, the majority of whom were previously untrained in official work, has increased the difficulty in organizing the Department. Where, in the interests of efficiency, it has been necessary to utilize the services of other than returned soldiers, this course has been taken.

I am now able to state that this matter will receive full consideration in connexion with the question of demobilization when the time arrives for action in that regard. It is one of the important factors, but by no means the only one, to be considered in this connexion. Full weight will, however, be given by the Government to the length and conditions of service in arriving at a decision. </para>

I beg to inform him that this was considered by the Government, but it was decided not to do as suggested. It has not been the policy of the Department to make approvals of this nature retrospective, <inline font-style="italic">e.g.,</inline> increases in the payment of separation allowance were recently approved to date from 5th April, 1918. A great deal of work would be involved in investigating past cases, if the approval were made retrospective, and it is doubtful whether adjustment could be made in respect of casualties which occurred during the earlier period of the war. No information is available which would enable the amount of expenditure which would be incurred in back-dating the approval to be calculated, but it is estimated that between &#163;60,000 and &#163;80,000 would be involved. Approximately 40,000 cases will require to he investigated, and it is estimated that payments will require to be made in about 10,000 cases. </para>

                        <para>- On the 6th November the honorable member for Newcastle asked a question as to the military arrest of an Italian, who had not had an opportunity of adjusting his private affairs. If the Italian referred to is Tamborini, this man is not now confined. He was granted leave by the Italian Vice-Consul to arrange his private affairs, and did not embark with his compatriots. </para>

I desire to inform the honorable member that the Minister for Defence does not consider the time has arrived to review this matter from the military side, but when it does he is confident that we shall have available Australian officers who, as a result of the experience gained in this war, will be quite competent to advise the Government on this matter. </para>

Instructions were issued by the Commandant, 3rd Military District, that the men were to carry twenty-four hours&#39; rations with them as a precautionary measure. This order was apparently misunderstood by the officers commanding concerned, and the usual arrangements for the feeding of the men were not made, but an adequate supply of bread, jam, and tea was provided, portion of which was not consumed. Instructions have been issued to the Commandant that will prevent a recurrence of the matters complained of. </para>

I am now able to state that if the honorable member&#39;s statement refers to yarn supplied by the Government Woollen Mills to the Repatriation Department for hand-loom weaving, and to knitting wool supplied to the Red Cross for socks, he is evidently under a misapprehension. In the first place, no shoddy yarn has been supplied by the Government Woollen Mills, and secondly the yarn for making cloth and yarn for knitting wool are very dissimilar. If the yarn supplied for hand-loom weaving has been used for knitting socks, nothing but unsatisfactory results can be expected. </para>

                        <para>That the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia declares that it is essential to the future safety and welfare of Australia that the captured German possessions in the Pacific, which are now occupied by the Australian and New Zealand troops, should not, in any circumstances, be restored to Germany; and that in the consideration and determination of proposals affecting the destination of these islands Australia should be consulted. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Those who apprehend the gravity of this motion will observe that it is appropriately divided into two parts. The first part, which is in the negative form, declares for the non-restoration of these captured German islands in the Pacific, and the second, which is in the positive form, declares for a consultation with the Imperial authorities before those interests are determined. It is thus made plain that Australia is not asking for. itself any additional territory. These captured islands are supposed to be rich, and to have a future of great potentiality. But we did not enter the war for plunder, and it is not because of any such desire that we are seeking a clear and definite line of action with regard to them. It is true that when we found the cost of the war piling up upon our people we expected an indemnity for loss incurred by this country, and, possibly, in respect of the war expenditure that fell upon us. It is equally true, &#39;if one looks carefully at the proposals for peace which are to guide so largely the deliberations of the statesmen around the Peace table - I refer to the fourteen points which emanated from the  President  of the United States of America - that in none of them is there mention of an indemnity, but merely a reference to reparation for certain classes of losses inflicted upon the injured nations. There are other losses, however, which every nation, and we amongst them, have had to face. </para>
                    <para>It may be said that if Germany is dismembered - that if the great Confederation, in addition to shedding its kings, also sheds the ties that bind together its scattered parts, so that the German Empire is divided into a congeries of isolated, and, possibly, rival independent Republics - it will not be possible for us to secure from it an indemnity or to obtain even the reparation for which President Wilson&#39;s Note provides. If that be so, it may be necessary for Australia to take the view, apart from others that I am about to enunciate, that we or some cue should hold these captured German Possessions in fief and in trust for the payment of some of the losses to which Australia has had to submit in consequence of the war. I make that statement in distinct recognition of the fact that in certain quarters it has become fashionable to speak of &#34;no annexations &#34; as being a humanitarian doctrine. In regard to some of the territories that are in issue in this  struggle  it is possibly a wise and beneficent doctrine, but it is not so with regard to territories that have been recently acquired; that have been money-making propositions for the Germans ever since they secured them; and over the backs of the aboriginal populations of which the whip of Germany has been extended ever since she has possessed them. Notwithstanding the statement, fashionable in some quarters, that there should  be  no annexations, we, as trustees of the future, ought to see if it is not possible to obtain a true indemnity or proper reparation, that we do hold in pawn some territory that will help to relieve the debt of the people of this country in future years. </para>
                    <para>We submit this motion, however, on higher grounds. We submit it because we seek to insure the safety of the lives of future generations in Australia. This is no new, no party, conception of the position. It does not evolve from this or from any particular Government, but has been the doctrine of the most educated type of Australian sentiment for over thirty years. I. have not had time, in the rushing life of to-day, to thoroughly scan the history of the genesis of this policy in Australia, but I can go back to the year 1883, and give one typical illustration of how statesmen had deliberated upon this question long before this Parliament was called into existence, and had established with regard to it a public view and conscience. In December, 1883, there was an Intercolonial Conference, at which the following resolution was passed: - </para>
                    <para>That &#39; the further acquisition of dominion in the Pacific south of the Equator by any foreign power would be highly detrimental to the safety and well-being of the British possessions in Australasia, and injurious to the interests of the Empire. </para>
                    <para class="block">It was in August of the following year that - notwithstanding that the Australian communities, through the lips of their rulers, spoke emphatically regarding this matter in this and many other ways - Germany was permitted to make the annexations now known as German New Guinea,  Wilhelmshaven,  and other islands of the Archipelago. The naval opinion on this question - and we as laymen must seek advice as to what is the naval conception of our responsibilities and dangers - tends only in the one direction. It is in the direction that, from a naval defence point of view, Australia has an outlying frontier, and that a- large part of that frontier is made up of Papua, the Bismarck Archipelago, the Solomon Islands, the Fiji group and their channels, and neighbouring waters. Beyond that frontier there are look-out posts which it is important that Australia should understand, and, if possible, govern. The late German possessions in German New Guinea, chiefly the Bismarck Archipelago and the island of Bougainville, in the Solomons, form,- perhaps, the most important part of that frontier. The naval advisers of the Government go further, and say that, from a strictly naval point&#39; of view, the Bismarck Archipelago and the surrounding possessions, which we now hold under military occupation, constitute the main strategic point, of the whole of the Pacific. They advise the Government that to obtain the same degree of defence as the possession of these islands would mean - if we possibly could obtain them - would cost Australia an additional expenditure of several million pounds per annum. If these possessions, or others like them, were allowed to remain in the hands of an enemy, or even a potential enemy, that would be the position. </para>
                    <para>It is, I think, within the knowledge of honorable members, although not within the knowledge of the country generally, that in one of these possessions there is perhaps one of the finest outlines for a naval base in the southern hemisphere. We are advised that there are there several first-rate harbors within reasonable distance of one another, and of ready access : that there is one magnificent river, navigable for some 300 or 400* miles from its mouth; that it has no bar at its entrance, being of estuary formation, and that it affords shelter and all the means of sustenance and equipment such as probably no harbor in Australia could supply. We are advised, further, that in this group there are all the indications of oil supplies, which would form an invaluable auxiliary asset; and that it is beyond the hurricane belt which, from the naval point of view, apart altogether from the other geographical features to which &#91; have alluded, makes it immensely important. It is said by the advisers of the Government&#39; that if we were to allow these possessions to gravitate or drift back to even a crippled enemy such as Germany might be after this war, they would still form a menace so imminent that, within the limits of one day, an attack could be made by aeroplane upon the coast of Australia, and, within the limits of two or three days, by ordinary naval craft. If honorable members care to study the map they will see that from one point in German New Guinea, by a direct accessible line, the distance to Townsville is only 1,050 miles. I have here a map which I shall be glad to show honorable members if they desire to see it. </para>
                    <para>These are broadly, and in very rugged sketch, the plain, frank opinions of the naval authorities of Australia in advising the Government of the danger from the naval point of view of allowing these territories to revert to enemy control. I ask honorable members, in deliberating upon them, merely to think, as laymen are entitled to do, on the lessons of this war. An attack such as would be possible from striking points of this kind could be made, not only on our ports, but on our territories bordering thereon, as well as upon all our trading and shipping routes. If in the future, there is to be warfare - and there is probably no man daring enough to predict that war may not recur, despite the smashing and humiliating defeat of Germany, at this stage, from a military point of view - and if submarine warfare is to be the feature of the future, such a danger spot might practically cut off Australia from the rest of the world as far as shipping and cable communication are concerned. Thus, instead of that great immunity that we have enjoyed during these four years, thanks to the fact that the British Navy did sweep the seas of German craft, Australia might have no possibility of exchanging her products or her men. Her oversea trade, upon which her very life blood depends, would vanish, and instead of prosperity and immunity, we should have an awful isolation, such as a distant community of this kind dare not think of with equanimity. </para>

                    <para>It is suggested by interjection, and also by utterances in British communities, that there has come &#34;to Germany a great change of heart because she has driven the Hohenzollerns into captivity. If Germany really means business, she will demonstrate the fact to the Allied nations by delivering over to the great Allied Council the men responsible for the war. When she has done this, and she could do it if she liked, then doubtless the civilized world will regard it as an act of honest and sincere reform, and not a piece of pious humbug. But I do not believe that men can change suddenly. It is true that there have been some great conversions - St. Paul, of Tarsus, got his on the road to Damascus - but, generally, I am not a believer in such sudden changes; and certainly not in the case of a people with the psychology of the Prussians, whose roots of brutality and ferocity are laid too deep, more particularly when one sees, as one might have expected to see, that, although this Republic has arisen, Hindenburg still offers to head the army of the Republic. There is no change of voice or heart visible so far as we can see in the present attitude of Germany. </para>
                    <para>I am not speculating whether this group of German Republics - the fragments of a broken Confederation - can run a great Navy, or whether they can establish a colonial policy; only the future can teach us that. In the meantime it is better to be sure than sorry. </para>

I am not now pred i cat ing as to the final destination of the islands, but as a word of warning I say that international control of any kind in isolated or insular possessions has never been a success. I am quite prepared to leave the matter to the statesmen at the Peace table, so long as they know exactly the Australian view, so that whatever happens these islands shall in no case be handed back to Germany. </para>

                    <para>So much for the negative aspect of the motion. Now for the positive. We are asking that we shall be consulted in the consideration and determination of the proposals affecting the destination of these islands. This, I think, we have a perfect right to ask as a British people. We are not putting it in the form of a demand, though perhaps we might be justified in going that far. This matter touches us so nearly, and will so influence for weal or woe the life and work of this continent for many generations, that we, as trustees, would be recreant if we did not definitely say what our views are. </para>
                    <para>Australia has always led in the study of the problems of the South and West Pacific. There is a world of literature and history surrounding this question,, and it is not a bright or cheering history for Britishers to read. It is a history of lethargy and neglect for which the Colonial Office was chiefly responsible - not the British people, and not the British Government as a Government, but the bureaucracy which resided at the Colonial Office. This Department has always been hours behind the clock in regard to all the great events in the Southern Hemisphere, and we do not wish that to occur in the present crisis. When the acquisition of Fiji was established by Britain in 1870, it was at the earnest appeal and solicitation of Australia; otherwise Britain, even then, would not have acted. We know the history of Papua, how daring statesmen in the north had practically to hoist the flag themselves. British statesmen who. had never visited these southern waters, and knew very little of the possibilities of this country, or of the tributary archipelagoes, secured only a portion of Papua, when the British flag might equitably, properly, and successfully have flown over both sections. As to the New Hebrides, I remember, in this connexion, the ex-Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Alfred Deakin), and how, in 1887, when a delegate for Victoria at the first great jubilee of Queen Victoria, he warned British statesmen and .the public what complications to the Empire those Possessions might involve. And I remember his phrase that rang throughout Great Britain for the first time, that &#34; The Australians are a pacific people, so pacific that they want the southern Pacific.&#34; We do not want quite that much, but we do want that safety which springs from proper precautionary acquisitions in that ocean. In view of our history, of our danger, and our interests, we have a perfect right to say to the Mother Country that we desire to be consulted.  But for the fact that A.ustralia has an educated conscience and opinion on this subject, there would not be any British opinion in regard to the Pacific, even in the centre of the Empire. This war has brought Australia into the blood stream of the world, and we can never got out of it again so long as nations are nations. That brings to us great opportunities, of course, but also it brings boundless responsibilities, and amongst many others will arise the question of determining what our foreign policy, to speak in popular parlance, will be with regard to those waters and those islands. We must be a vigilant people, and an educated people as to what this responsibility means, and encourage public thought upon these questions, in addition to those domestic problems that hitherto have received almost exclusive attention from the people in times of political crisis. We must be courageous, and speak out our minds. There is a right and a wrong way of doing that. This, I think, is the right time to speak, and this motion is the right method, because this Parliament is the best qualified medium <inline font-style="italic">to.</inline> voice Australian public opinion, and to watch with jealous care Australia&#39;s interests. I think the motion is all that is necessary at the present time. I dwell with emphasis on that point. Such a proposition could be framed in more minatory terms, and have a wider scope, but I think the phraseology is proper,&#39; and covers sufficient ground for the present occasion. It will strengthen the head of the Government, who, in Britain, is s&#93;&#62;eaking his mind in regard to this and other matters. It will help and fortify those who may sit as the guardians&#39; of British interests at the Peace table, and my impression is that when this question is to be determined, the future destination of these countries must be placed in the Peace bond. The matter must not be left in doubt. It is not fair to the unborn generations of this country, or to the 5,000,000 people who have built up this island continent, and safeguarded so large a seaboard, that any &#34;uncertainty should surround this matter. If the matter is left in doubt, in addition to the heavy load of indebtedness incurred in this war, there will be thrust upon us great expenditure for naval protection which, without this menace, would not fall upon us. Australia must be a great country for the white people of the world, and we appeal to the statesmen of the Mother Country to see that we get a chance of working out our own destiny without fear and trembling, by placing the future destiny of the Pacific Islands in the Peace bond. I recommend the &#39;-motion to the House in the hope that it will secure unanimous acceptance. </para>

It is not right for even the majority in the House to prevent the discussion of matters which can be dealt with only on grievance day.

                        <para>The motion before the House carries my mind back a few years to the time when you, sir, on many occasions raised the question of the future of the New Hebrides and the other islands in the Pacific, and urged the necessity for the  Australian Parliament expressing its mind on the subject. The Acting Prime Minister has stated that he was able to obtain support for the motion from the resolutions of the Inter-State Labour Conference recently held in Perth. With one portion of his remarks I am in hearty agreement, namely, that if persons or nations in any place adjacent to Australia ill-treat the native population, we have a right to protest. I am not unmindful of the fact that Professor Andrews recently made representations to the Government and to others concerning the treatment of Indian natives in Fiji by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. If it is right for us to say that the Germans have acted criminally in ill-treating the natives in German New Guinea, the Marshall Islands, the Caroline Islands, and the Bismarck Archipelago, it is equally our right to forbid&#39; the Colonial Sugar Refining Company ill-treating citizens of India who are working in Fiji. The reference of the Acting Prime Minister to the ill-treatment of the natives was only an appeal to the sentiment of the people, with the idea that he would thereby assist the passage of the motion. I hope we shall extend our protest and say that, not only do we object to the ill-treatment of natives in the German possessions, but that we forbid the almost inhuman treatment of natives of India by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in Fiji. </para>

If the honorable member means that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, being an Australian corporation, should be expected to act better than the German settlers in the neighbouring islands, I certainly agree with him. That company should treat its employees properly whether they are in the islands of the Pacific or elsewhere. I have no desire to say that Australian companies generally treat their employees as Professor Andrews said the Colonial Sugar Refining Company treats the Indians in Fiji. </para>

No matter what the press would say, I would vote against the motion if the Acting Prime Minister had stated that its object is to grab territory for Australia, but he has made it perfectly clear that there are two sides to the motion - a negative side, which says that in no circumstances do we desire the islands to be restored to Germany, and a positive side, in which we declare that in the consideration of the proposals affecting the determination of these islands Australia should he consulted. I am not in favour of land-grabbing. In the words of  President  &#34;Wilson, we do not want to make anything out of the war. </para>

We are told to-day that it is not a new Germany we have to deal with, but that it is the old Germany, and that, because von Hindenburg is in a position to do certain things we must discredit everything that has happened during the past few days. Let me quote the words of the Prime Minister as recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the 23rd February, 1917, page 10632. It was the day prior to the Ready incident, when the Prime Minister telegraphed to the Premier of Tasmania. When he was moving for the extension of the life of the last Parliament he said - </para>

                            <para>As to peace, and the terms upon which the Empire should make it, let me state my own view. I have been unsparing in my denunciation of the military power of Germany, but I shall never stand quiet under the criticism of being thought desirous to humiliate and crush a giant nation. I am not in favour of humiliating Germany as such, hut I am in favour of destroying the military power of Germany, and to that end I will bend every ounce of energy I possess. But, so far as the German people are concerned, when they have exorcised themselves of the monster that now has them in its foul grip, when the evil has been burnt out of them by fire, and they have been purged of this disease that corrupts their body, they shall stand again in the councils of the nations. I shall do nothing to place them outside the pale. I will be no party in any respect to a ruthless policy towards Germany as a nation, but to that military despotism that now directs and possesses it, that menaces civilization and threatens the welfare of this continent, I am opposed, and will do all that in me lies to utterly destroy. </para>

With what authority will they meet us, and with what assurance that their authority will abide and sustain securely the international arrangements into which we are about to enter?

                                <para>- The representation of Australia at the Peace Conference will probably be one-sided. It will be the representation of the party whose proposals the Australian people have twice rejected. The Acting Prime Minister yesterday gave me a copy of the motion, but there is no good reason for hurrying through its discussion. If it is the desire of the Government and of the Ministerial party merely to grab territory, I am opposed to the motion. I am opposed to the grabbing of territory merely to appease an earth hunger. Our experience of the responsibilities of administering territories has not been a happy one. Article after article has appeared in the newspapers, and particularly in the columns of the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> drawing attention to the cost of this administration. Honorable members need not think that I am seeking compliments from the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> I have always fought and beaten both that journal and the other metropolitan daily. I have been elected to this Parliament in spite of them both. We have poured out much money upon the administration of our territories. No doubt, it may be urged that much of our expenditure, such as that on the Northern Territory, should rightly be debited, not to development, but to defence. </para>

                        <para>Regarding the German colonies, I have repeatedly declared that they are held at the disposal of the Peace Conference, the decision of which must have primary regard to the wishes and interests of the native inhabitants. One of the main purposes of that control will be to prevent the exploitation of the natives for the benefit of European capitalists or Governments. The natives live in their various tribal organizations under chiefs and councils,  who are competent to consult and speak for their tribes and members, and thus to represent their wishes and interests regarding their disposal. </para>
                        <para>President Wilson has this among his fourteen points - </para>
                        <para>A free, open-minded and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict observance of the principle that, in determining all such questions of sovereignty, the interests of the population concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims of the Government whos: title has to be determined. </para>
                        <para class="block">The first consideration must be that of the interests of the native populations. It may be said that, in many cases, the natives are not competent to decide whether they should be under their former masters or employers, or under a new set of masters or employers. There was an excellent article in to-day&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Ar/e</inline> on the subject, followed by an excellent letter, in which it was pointed out that probably for the first time in the history of the world, we now have open diplomacy, the public discussion of what should be done with the various countries, whose fate is - at stake, instead of matters being fixed up privately by delegates sitting round a table. The representatives of the various peoples are expressing their opinions. At a meeting at which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George gave, utterance to the statement I have just &#34;read, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Henderson, who had recently left- the British War  Cabinet, said - </para>
                        <para>We will take no territory out of the war. Where populations desire to be freed from their present Governments, but are not strong enough to stand alone, we are under a moral obligation &#39;to secure to them international protection.  We  do not desire to assume this task alone, unless explicitly requested to do so by the Peace Conference, or a similar International authority. </para>
                        <para class="block">Whether we agree to the motion unanimously, or with some dissentient voices, it should be made perfectly clear that this Parliament is not out to grab land ; that we are not considering the interests of capitalists, who wish to use native populations for the development of copra, oil, or other tropical resources.  We should make it plain that our primary object is the defence of Australia, and that we are determined that the natives of the territories in question shall get an absolutely fair deal. Mistakes have been made in the past which this Parliament was created too late to remedy. I hope, too, that it will be made perfectly clear by the Government that the motion refers only to the territory occupied at the present time by the Australian and New Zealand Forces. </para>

                                <para>- Then we are concerned with the Bismarck Archipelago, German New Guinea, and Samoa, the last-named place being occupied at the present time, I understand, by New Zealanders. It would have been better had the Government communicated with the Government of New Zealand so that the Commonwealth and the Dominion could have taken action simultaneously, and spoken with a united voice. If the motion, as an expression of the opinion of the&#39; Australian people, will be effective, surely an expression of the opinion of the people of Australia and New Zealand would have been more effective. </para>

T. Ozanne.&#34; </para>
                        <para class="block">I had a notice on the business-paper asking for the appointment of a Royal Commission, but the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> intimated to me that, while the war was on, it was impossible to recall Lieutenant-General Monash, and that therefore the Cabinet could not recommend the appointment of a Royal Commission. Now circumstances have altered, and the war is over, or practically so, that difficulty will not present itself. If my request be granted, as I trust it will be, by the Government, some little time will necessarily elapse before the Commission is able to meet, and the chances are that General Monash will then be available to appear before the Commission should his evidence be required. </para>
                        <para>I submit this motion with considerable feeling. I was associated with exQuartermasterSergeant Ozanne overseas. I went away with him, was with him in camp, and also spent some time with him in London. I am familiar with all the circumstances of his case, and am genuinely sorry for him. In response to the call of Empire he enlisted, leaving his place in Parliament to go practically as a private to the Front. He took the risk of submarines, and did his duty to his country until his health failed him. With a full knowledge of the facts of his case, I say that he did not desert for one second from the Australian Imperial Force. Every honorable member will feel sorry, not only for ex-Quartermaster - Sergeant Ozanne, but for his wife and children. Wherever the children go they are told that their father was a deserter. The man himself cannot enter upon any occupation. Ever since his return to Australia he has been unable to enter into any business because there still remains against him the charge that, while on active service, he deserted from the Australian Imperial Force. I am satisfied that if this Commission is appointed, I shall be able to convince honorable members in ten minutes that Ozanne was not guilty of the charge. </para>
                        <para>While in camp at Larkhill, Salisbury Plains, he was selected by General Monash, of the 3rd Division, to enter an Officers&#39; Training School at Tidworth. Although forty years of age, he set to work at that school, and notwithstanding that he had to compete with temporary officers and with men much younger than himself, he secured 83 per cent, of the possible marks, and out of a hundred or more competitors only about twenty were ahead of ham. Having passed the necessary examination, he was entitled to a commission, and he proceeded to London on four days&#39; leave. While there he took ill. The charge made against Ozanne is that he took ill, and did not report in the regular manner. The military authorities on the other side, however, know very little about the matter. I see on the file a letter from General Birdwood, in which he states that Ozanne did not. report sick in a proper manner. There are also on the file a number of papers by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> dealing with this aspect of the case. They all go to show, to my mind, that the authorities were not; aware of the procedure followed by soldiers who took ill in London. I have had considerable experience of the practice followed in such cases, and venture to say that I saved the lives of at least a hundred Australian boys by inducing them to do exactly what Ozanne did when he took ill in London, I do not blame any one in Australia for what happened to Ozanne out here. A lot of people ar.e of the opinion that it was due to political party motives. I do not- think it was. Brigadier-General McC- Anderson, who was in London, caused all the trouble. In view of the cable message sent to the Department here stating that a charge of desertion was laid against Ozanne, I do not blame <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and others  for believing that the message was correct. </para>
                        <para>If a soldier takes ill while on leave, he has to report - and these instructions appear on his card - to the nearest hospital, or to the nearest military doctor. Ozanne went to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Shaw,-</inline> who was stationed at Horseferry-road, and reported, just as thousands of other soldiers have done, that he was ill. The doctor ordered him to Southall,  where we have an auxiliary hospital, and he was detained there for two or three weeks. He had leave, I think, until 18th November. On the night upon which that leave expired he returned to his unit, and reported to the orderly, as well as to Captain  Dewson  and Lieutenant Simmons, that he had been ordered to return next .day to the Southall hospital. He went to that hospital, where he was operated upon for nasal trouble. Meantime his unit had proceeded to France. He had no chance of going with it, and when he left the hospital he went up to London and reported to Brigadier-General McC. Anderson, who said to him, &#34;You are qualified for a commission, but there is no commission in the  Army  Service Corps that I can give you.&#34; Men of  Ozanne&#39;s  age are much better qualified for the Army Service Corps than are younger men.  Ozanne&#39;s  age was such as to make him unfit to go into the trenches, but Brigadier-General Anderson said to him, &#34;I can only give you a position in the infantry.&#34; Ozanne said he would accept such a position, and would go wherever he was sent. Brigadier-General Anderson then said he would give him a pass to remain in London for a few weeks, and that as soon as word was received from France he would be able . to join his unit there. I was in London when the order reached Ozanne to report to Brigadier-General Anderson. He reported, and returning to me an hour later, said that he had a commission in the 24th Battalion, and that on the following day he was to go before a Medical Board of three doctors. When a commission is granted in such circumstances, as distinguished from promotion on the field, it is necessary for the recipient of that commission to prove that he is medically fit. Ozanne went before the three doctors. The  chairman,  of the Board was, I think, Surgeon-General Howse, who reported that he was medically unfit, not only for the trenches, but for any service whatever. No one heard the word desertion spoken of in connexion with Ozanne in the Old Country, and it came as a shock to me to read in the Australian papers that such a charge had been -made against him. Here is a letter from the official file, which is unsigned, but evidently came from General Griffiths or Brigadier-General McC. Anderson. It was apparently written in reply to a communication from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce:</inline> - </para>

                        <para>A7599, Your WY615. Our records show Ozanne leave granted from Larkhill Camp from 10th November to 18th November, and this was subsequently extended by telegram, and that on 20th November he was admitted to Southall Hospital owing to old injury causing deflected septum. Admission to hospital was reported to Ozanne&#39;s commanding officer by this office, memo. 29965, on same date. Ozanne was detained as an in-patient until 24th November, and on discharge medical officer reported, in writing, he would require to keep him under observation for two weeks, for which purpose he was to visit Southall. You will, therefore, see that some mistake has been made in statement that he was absent without leave on embarkation of unit, 22nd November :. . . . </para>
                        <para class="block">It will probably be remembered that General Monash, in a cablegram sent by Brigadier-General Anderson to Australia, is alleged to have said that had he known where Ozanne was when his unit embarked, he would have had him arrested and tried as a deserter. Here, however, is a letter, evidently from the Commanding Officer at Head-quarters, London, saying that Ozanne had been sent to Southall Hospital for treatment. </para>

                        <para>There is only one man to blame for what has taken place in regard to exQuartermasterSergeant Ozanne. I have here a copy of a long cablegram as to Ozanne having been absent without leave. which is supposed to have been signed by General Monash. But I have seen, and can produce, a letter sent by General Monash to a relative, in which he declares that he never sent any cablegram to Australia in regard to Ozanne. The honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> has also seen that letter. I believe that what happened was that General Monash reported to Brigadier-General McC. Anderson, who thought this was an opportunity to show his gratitude to some one for the position to which he had been appointed by fabricating something, and that he sent out the cablegram which ruined Ozanne. </para>

                                <para>- I have made the same statement outside. I have remained very quiet, but now that the war is over, 1 feel free to bring this matter forward. I have had my own troubles, and could, if I wished, make it very unpleasant for some people. Every member of the Australian ImperialForce who was a sergeant, and happened also to be a member of Parliament, did not enjoy too good a time in the Army. I have not uttered a word of complaint, although I could have said that I was kept hanging about the front line in the neighbourhood of Ypres for about three months, and could not get anything to do. I could have told that story with considerable effect against the recruiting movement had I desired to do so, but I remained quiet. It is almost inconceivable that such a cable message as that to which I have referred could have been sent from Head-quarters, London, to the Department here, in view of the following letter that Brigadier-  General Anderson gave to the alleged deserter prior to his leaving London: - </para>

                        <para class="block">I do not think that any man could have better testimony as to character than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> has in this letter written two days before he left London for Australia. On his arrival at Fremantle there came a message that he was liable to be arrested as a deserter; and that was circulated throughout Corio and Australia generally. How would any honorable member feel if he were placed in such a position as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> then found himself <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> I might here mention that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> was not the only man to get a passage on a Peninsular and Oriental boat. I know a clergyman, who, accompanied by his son, went from Australia to England on a Peninsular and Oriental boat. That son had been taken out of the Army to be batman to his father, and the two had nice tours in England, Scotland, and France, just where there were no shells falling. A major thought that this clergyman&#39;s services were required in Australia, and he and his son were sent back on a Peninsular and Oriental boat at the expense of the country. It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne&#39;s</inline> passage was paid, but that was because there was no other way for him to return. I may say that  Colonel Griffiths,  about that time, came into the room of which I was in charge, and, informing me that there had been a dissolution of the Commonwealth Parliament, said that I ought to be in Australia looking after my seat, and suggested that I should sign a form&#39; which would enable me to leave London in a few days. However, I had - always made up my mind that, having joined the Army, I would not leave it until I could do my bit in France, so I declined the offer .with thanks. Fortunately, through the kind offices of  Colonel, now  Brigadier-General, Griffiths, one of the finest men the Australian Army possesses, I did get to France : but, doubtless, I should have been exposed to the same sort of attacks as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> had I come back on a Peninsular and Oriental boat. A charge is made that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> presented an hotel bill for <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> 2s. 3d. incurred at Weymouth. As a matter of fact, it was his duty to go to that place. He was ordered to Australia, but he wanted very much to go to France to see how the boys were treated, and he did go to France, but at his own expense to the .extent of &#163;60. At this time he . was supposed to be a deserter, but he was being received at head-quarters by General Birdwood, and also one of the French generals, who took him along the firing line. He made an exact report of what he observed on his visit, and he did not  say  he was in the firing line as a fighter. When he came back to London, and went to Weymouth, he was driven  there in a motor car by General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Newton</inline> Moore - a man who knew nothing about the military when the war broke out, when he was given the rank of general. </para>

The hotel hill of &#163;5 2s. 3d. represented four or five days&#39; stay, at a tariff rate of 17s- 6d. per day, and I think I am right in saying that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> had one drink and a cigar after each meal. That is not very extravagant, and I remind honorable members that there are no cigars to be had at five for a1s. in England, and not much of a cigar can be purchased for 2s. 3d. </para>

I appeal to the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> to for a moment put himself in the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne.</inline> I am not in the habit of making extravagant or foolish statements, but I speak from a long association with this man. I was associated with him from the day he left Australia, and I was at Charing Cross to wish him <inline font-style="italic">ion voyage</inline> when he left on his return trip. I can give the Government my word that he did not desert for one second, as the records clearly and conclusively prove. There is no necessity to have General Monash here for an inquiry, because he had practically nothing to do with the affair. We have all the documents to prove that every time he was away from Camp, Ozanne had a pass; indeed, we have most of the passes, together with the medical certificates and the letter from General Anderson. There was never a charge of desertion made against him in London, and Ozanne knew nothing of it until he arrived at Fremantle. </para>

                                <para>- I said that I can produce a letter written by General Monash to a relative, in which he states that he never signed any cable to be sent to Australia concerning the Ozanne case; and that letter I can produce. The honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> brought a friend of General Monash to me the other night, and I saw the letter referred to. I do not say that this cablegram was created or forged in Australia, but I believe it was sent from London. I know some of the strong influences which were at work there at the time. There were certain men, of whom the Government are not aware, who made strong efforts to induce <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> to take the conscription side. He was bitterly opposed to conscription and despite the influences brought to bear, said, &#34;During my country&#39;s troubles I have not been a traitor, and neither will I be a traitor to my party.&#34; He stuck solidly to his party, and his attitude caused some bitter feeling in certain directions in London. He was sent back here as medically unfit, and with no word about desertion; and from the day of his arrival he has never received justice at the hands of the Government or the military of Australia. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to accede to the request for a Royal Commission. For all I care, the Commission may be composed entirely of members from behind the Government, for I am confident that with the documents and evidence available they will acquit <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> of any charge of desertion. </para>

                            <para>. - I have listened very intently to the remarks of the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath).</inline> I know that during recent months, since his return, he has shown very keen interest in this matter, and, naturally so. for two reasons. The honorable member was intimately acquainted  in earlier politics before the war with the ex-member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ozanne),</inline> and, further, he met him when at Home, and had knowledge of many events connected with his visit to the Old Country. I was pleased to notice the moderate and temperate terms of expression the honorable member employed. In earlier days, when this case was before us, there was a good deal of party recrimination associated with it. I was not familiar with the circumstances, but I hardly thought it possible that politicians could enter into a matter of this kind with any degree of propriety. I am glad to hear from the honorable member, not an admission, but a proclamation, that he does not blame anybody in Australia except, as he qualified his statement, exBrigadierGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Anderson, and him not in any political connexion. Some little time ago, the ex-member for Corio, ex-Quartermaster-Sergeant Ozanne, wrote to the Government and asked that his case should be inquired into by a Royal Commission, and I told him that his request would be considered by the Government. At the same time the honorable member for Ballarat lodged his notice of motion, which was subsequently discharged from the notice-paper, to be replaced by this amendment on the Supply motion. I wrote to the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> informing him that a Royal Commission was asked for, and suggesting that he should inform me as to the views of the Department. I think it advisable to read the honorable gentleman&#39;s reply : - </para>

He was not present with his Unit when the Unit embarked, and he was reported &#34; absent without leave &#34; ; and expressed the hope that the authorities in London, who are responsible, will take the necessary action to vindicate discipline by sending this noncommissioned officer over to France under escort, to be dealt with in the ordinary way. </para>

                                <para>- I deeply regret to say that there are in Australia many men who feel that they have not been properly treated. I know one man particularly, who fou&#171;rht for three years, from the early occupation of Gallipoli onwards, and who from the ranks won his commission, but who feels that he was made a scapegoat. He still declares that he did not get a fair deal on the other side of the world, and cannot get it in Australia. I have spoken with him. He sees the Minister&#39;s difficulty, and he is content to wait till the end of the war, when he will expect the matter to be cleared up. He does not ask for the appointment of a Royal Commission. I shall expect the Government or Department concerned to appoint for him, in common with other soldiers who feel that they have the right to make the same demand, a cleaning-up day and place. I do not wish to promise to Ozanne a Royal Commission, because such a promise ought to apply equally to every man who enlisted from the street and not from this House, and who feels that he has been unjustly treated. I do  not think the time has arrived when an inquiry of any kind would be complete. If we were to promise such an inquiry now, and try to start the machinery, we should probably find that General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Monash, of whom every man who knew him before he left Australia is pardonably proud - </para>

We cannot try that case in the absence of General Monash.  His  career as a citizen soldier has been so unparalleled that no man would suggest that an inquiry reflecting on his honour and probity should be undertaken in his absence. I do not claim that officers should be given different treatment from that accorded to men in the ranks, but I do say that a man who is General Officer Commanding the Australian Forces, and who, if he had had the chance, would have ranked with many of the great Generals in the war. should not have his honour attacked without having full opportunity of defending himself. </para>

                                <para>- It is involved incidentally. I have talked with Ozanne. I know that he is smarting under an accusation of desertion. He told me how it affected his means of getting a livelihood and his prospects in private and public life. I wish to give him a chance at the proper time and in the proper way of clearing himself if he can. But I do not wish to have my hand forced because I know- him, and because he was a member of this House, to make concessions to him that cannot be given to every soldier who is similarly circumstanced. </para>

                                <para>- That may be. But General Monash was, at that time, Commander of the Division to which Ozanne was attached. He has since risen to be  Commander-in-Chief  of the Australian Army in the field, but as a Divisional Commander he ordered Ozanne to be sent to Head-Quarters for punishment as a defaulting non-commissioned officer. For that reason General Monash comes right into the picture. I assure the honorable  member  for Ballarat that I wish to see Ozanne get a fair deal, and at the right time and in the right way I shall assist him to get it. I think he has made good his case for such an inquiry, and, of course, when it is held the case will necessarily stand on its merits. If the honorable member is satisfied with .that assurance, I shall take counsel with the Minister for Defence as to the best way and the best time for this inquiry to be held. </para>

                            <para>. - The honorable member for Ballarat, in stating this case, did not make it a political matter. Unfortunately there are two phases of the question. First of all there is the family feeling in connexion with it, and secondly there are the disabilities under which Ozanne has suffered. The mother of exQuartermasterSergeant Ozanne had one son killed at the Front. She was proud that he had done his duty to the country.  Her  other son also went to the war, and returned in sheer disgrace. I differ from the honorable member for Ballarat, for I say that the charge against Ozanne was deliberately made in order to defeat him at the election for Corio, and it had that effect. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know, but I do say that the Minister for Defence is culpable to a great degree. I had the pleasure of addressing sixteen or seventeen meetings in the Corio electorate at the time of the last general election, and I have participated in two other election campaigns in the constituency. Therefore, I know the district well. At every meeting I received a good hearing, and had no trouble with my audience, but at the conclusion of my remarks I was overwhelmed with questions as to why Ozanne had deserted. It was impossible to escape from that charge; it was published in the newspapers, and they could not be induced to print even a statement as to the possibility of doubt in regard to the charge, let alone a direct contradiction of it. The accusation wa3 used by the newspapers and the National party for political purposes during that fight. Only a man who has been in the Army knows what a charge of desertion means. A soldier could commit no greater crime than to be absent without leave from his unit when it embarked for the Front. Ozanne had to fight the election with that charge hanging over him, and his wife and family were subjected to the taunts of the political crowd, who used the accusation to injure their opponent&#39;s candidature. It may be said that all is fair in love and war, and that a political party is justified in resorting to such tactics. I would do much for my party, but I would not commit perjury for it; yet perjury was committed in the Ozanne case. I say nothing against the honorable member who defeated <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne.</inline> He <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister),</inline> in common with all honorable members, is charged with many things. I have been charged with having committed crimes it was impossible for me to commit, but in this chamber I have been in a position to refute them. During the course of his campaign, the present member for Corio was attacked, but he was able to refute the charges levelled against him. There have been plenty of opportunities since May, 1917, for the Defence Department to communicate with General Monash, and to get evidence to prove or disprove the charge that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> had deserted. If a man gets leave from his unit at Salisbury Plain, goes to London, and takes ill there, he reports to the nearest military depot, and if he can make good his case that it was -not his fault that he did not get back to his camp before his period of leave expired, the camp authorities deal with his case accordingly. It may have been remissness on his part that caused him to miss the train, but whatever .the circumstances are they are taken into consideration. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> reported to the nearest military depot in London, it would be strong evidence that he was not willingly absent without leave. The hospital records should show that on the day his unit was due to leave Salisbury Plain for the Front he was on the books of the institution, and therefore he was not absent without leave. An army doctor&#39;s certificate is paramount over every charge. The hospital record could have been supplied long before this. It must have come to hand. Then why should this charge be allowed to hang over <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ozanne&#39;s</inline> head all this time? Non-commissioned officers and privates have come to me and shown their discharges. They have pointed out how impossible it is to secure employment with the discharges worded as they are, and they have been anxious to get them altered. How much more necessary is it to have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne&#39;s</inline> case inquired into in view of the circumstances in which he enlisted? To the disgrace of those who have uttered the words, I have heard it said that those members of Parliament who have enlisted have done so for certain purposes. Charges are levelled against returned soldiers who stand as candidates for Parliament. It is said that they use the fact that they have been to the Front as a means of getting into Parliament. &#39; These are only some of the cruel .charges that are preferred against public man. I am quite willing to believe that not one honorable member opposite would willingly injure any man in the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> has &#34;been hurt, but political use has been made of the charge that was levelled against him. Some people believe that they are justified in using any methods by which an opponent may be defeated, but I can assure honorable members that the charge against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> was used during the whole of the election campaign in order to secure his defeat. The moment one came down to question time in the Corio campaign there were dozens of questions,- particularly from among the women. One could hear woman after woman say, &#34; My brother is there -fighting; Ozanne deserted; how can you expect us to put him into Parliament?&#34; The effect on the Corio election can readily be understood. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> still remains under the ban, notwithstanding the fact that there have been plenty of opportunities for the Minister for Defence to clear up the matter. There is already enough evidence on the file to disprove the charge of desertion. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> had been a deserter at any portion of the time he was away, he would not have been given the discharge he carries. However, that is not sufficient proof for the public. Further evidence is needed to convince the public of the falsity of the charge. There were many peculiar circumstances attaching to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne&#39;s</inline> case. He arrived in Western Australia in plenty of time to reach Victoria before polling day, but there always seemed to be a set of circumstances preventing him from getting here in time. I do not know how they came about, but the Labour party are quite satisfied that what was done was done deliberately. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> reported to the hospital before his leave was up, and had it extended, and if afterwards he exceeded the time the doctor allowed, it can be shown by the documents. There should be no trouble in clearing the matter up. One does not like to speak of such matters, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne&#39;s</inline> brother has been killed at the Front, . and the feelings of the mother when her other son has to bear the charge -of having deserted can be readily understood. I am willing to admit that the Acting Prune Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> is quite ready to do all he can towards clearing up this matter, but there is no need to wait for the return of General Monash. Ali we ask is for a letter from the Defence Department giving the facts of this man&#39;s case, stating his record, and showing whether he had the acquiescence of his commanding officer in what he did,- or whether another officer placed him under requisition on such and such a date. The whole case could be followed up in this way. The Acting Prime Minister has said that he cannot treat <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> differently from other men by granting a Royal Commission ; but there is a difference between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne&#39;s</inline> case and that of any other member of the Australian Imperial Force. The whole tiling should have been cleared up long ago. These matters should not be left to the final decision of the military authorities. </para>

                                <para>- When everything is settled down the evidence will be back here. The honorable member knows the difficulty of getting some of these documents. Two men waited .on me to-day. One was discharged eight months ago; the &#39; other was discharged eleven months ago; yet neither man can get his deferred pay. In another case, which is fourteen months old, documents cannot be secured from the Old Country. However, although the charge that lies over <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne&#39;s</inline> head is a horrible one, he is willing to face it, and he should be given the opportunity of doing so. He has certainly not been treated fairly. I hope that in his case, as well as in that of others, the military authorities will not be allowed to work their own sweet will in any investigation which may be made. It is said of the Military and Naval Departments that an officer is never -wrong, and that a non-commissioned officer is seldom wrong, but that a private is always wrong.  Even in civilian life, it is difficult enough to prove a man&#39;s innocence; but in the Army or the Navy, once a man has been adjudged guilty, superhuman efforts are required to prove his innocence. Something should be done in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne&#39;3</inline> case. I hope that the Acting Prime Minister will not allow the matter to be passed over, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> will have the opportunity of clearing his name, and that those who have been guilty of laying charges against him unfairly will be punished. </para>

                                <para>- Yes ; he should he compensated. If he can prove his innocence there will he no question that he will receive compensation. On the other hand, if the charges against him are substantiated, he should take his gruelling. I believe that he is prepared for any inquiry based upon those grounds. Now, concerning my connexion with_this matter : As most honorable members know, it had been arranged that I should tour Victoria, in the interests of recruiting, to deliver a series of lectures illustrated with pictures. I was to visit each electorate in turn, staying for a fortnight. Corio was the first electorate that I entered. -I went there some seven weeks or so before the election. When I had been in Geelong for about five days, I was asked if 1 would nominate -for the Corio seat. I told those who approached me that I did not aspire to parliamentary honours; that I knew a little of the politics of Queensland, but had only a <inline font-style="italic">very</inline> limited knowledge of Federal politics, and that I thought that, as a Queenslander, I had no chance of securing the indorsement of the party. However, upon being pressed to allow myself to be nominated, I did so, although I looked upon the nomination form as merely waste paper. I then went into the Ballarat electorate, and there I was asked to oppose <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath.</inline> I declined to do that, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath</inline> wa3 overseas serving his country, and I had allowed myself to be nominated for Corio. I was not particularly anxious to secure the party indorsement, and no one was more surprised than 1 was when I was chosen to contest the seat. At my first election meeting 1 made it clear that it was not my intention to discuss <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> or the merits of his case, and I thereafter left both severely alone. Although, like the honorable  member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews),</inline> I was inundated with questions about the case, I resolutely refused to discuss it by replying either to question or interjection regarding it. On the Thursday before polling day, when I was addressing a midday meeting in the market square at Gee long, I was questioned on. the subject by a staunch supporter of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne,</inline> and. 1 replied thai I was not opposing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> personally, but was standing in the interests of the Nationalist party, because the attitude of that party towards the war was in accord with my own. I said, too - I think the statement is on record in the files of the local press - that I thought people would be wise to reserve judgment concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> until he bad returned to Australia to answer the charges levelled against him. I have no feeling in this matter. I hope&#39; that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> will be given an opportunity to clear himself, if he can, of the charges. But I wish to remove the impression which seems to be firmly embedded in the minds of some honorable members, that hi3 defeat at the election was due to these charges. I do not think that it was. Party feeling was particularly strong at the election, but if you compare the record of the voting at Corio for Senate candidates with that of the voting for the House of Representatives candidates you will see that, on party lines, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> came out much better than the Labour Senate candidates. That is attributed by some of my supporters to the fact that on the evening of the day before the election a telegram came from Fremantle to the supporters of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> in Geelong, of which I cannot from memory give the exact words, but its effect was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> was in a position to clear himself of the charges made against him. This was read at the final rally in the Mechanics Institute, and at an overflow meeting in the hall next door. My supporters told me that that telegram &#39;had a decided influence on the- polling. I know that in moving round the booths of the division I met many persons, including women, who said that they would vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> because he was under a cloud, and there was doubt as to his guilt, but that they would vote for the Nationalist Senate candidates. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne&#39;s</inline> defeat can be attributed to anything beyond the strength of the Nationalist party in the Corio division, it is attributable to the circulation throughout the electorate of Corio of certain letters sent from France by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> to political friends and foes. In these letters he represented himself as having been in the firing line, although, according to the dates with which they were headed, it was impossible for him to have been there. Personally, I hold that neither the charges against him, nor the circulation of these letters, influenced the electors to a great extent. But if there was such influence, the blame must attach to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> for having misled people as he did. I have nothing to say against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> personally. Whether my political career be long or short, I hope that throughout it I shall treat every one fairly and squarely. I should not have referred to this matter today had it not been for some remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> a few weeks ago. I hope that before the next election the Government will hold an inquiry which will give <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> the opportunity to exonerate himself if he can do so. </para>

                            <para>.- I have listened with a good deal of pleasure to the remarks of the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister).</inline> I am glad that he approves of the amendment, though it is only what I would have expected of him. I was a little hurt at his mention of certain letters. There was no need for that. If the matter has any relevance, it can be left over for the inquiry. I have, perhaps, the longest political experience of any honorable member, and I know that a more terrible charge cannot be made against a man than to accuse him of being a traitor and a deserter. I was at the declaration of the Corio poll, where the bitterness of certain women was extreme. For the first time in twenty-eight years I then said something to a woman which might be regarded as rude. I have always tried to treat all women who cross my path as I would wish my mother, my wife, and my daughter to be treated, but I was stung by the bitterness of one woman into uttering what might have been considered a rude remark, and afterwards members of the League to which she belonged personally thanked me for having been one of the few persons who could silence her tongue. I was present at a large meeting in the Corio division, and I say that if ever a man was crucified unjustly that man was Ozanne. </para>

It is to be remembered that he was called upon when he returned to Australia to fight for his political life. Only seven or eight members of Parliament have volunteered for active service, and they alone could provide cases similar to that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne.</inline> 1 wonder that the Acting Prime Minister did not see that. The ship in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> returned to Australia was delayed. I have that from passengers who were travelling by it. I cannot prove that it was delayed designedly, but why was it delayed ? It was not allowed to pass a certain point, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> could not leave it until it reached Adelaide. A wireless telegram was sent saying that he was a deserter. Why, if he was a deserter was he not shot? Why, if he was a deserter, should he not be branded for all time, and prevented from holding any office in the Commonwealth, State,or municipality? I have not time for a traitor or for a deserter. But this man&#39;s brother died at the Front, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> himself, although over forty years of age, succeeded in getting 83 per cent. of the marks obtainable at an examination for which he sat. He was prevented from going to the Front by a physical defect which, if the doctors had been shrewd enough, might have been discovered in Australia. I can speak with personal knowledge of the delay which took place in granting Ozanne his discharge, and I accuse the </para>
                        <para>Department of the responsibility for it. The accusation made against exQuartermasterSergeant Ozanne no doubt affected the voting for members of our party who stood for election to the Senate. I have blamed General Monash, possibly wrongly, for what occurred. I could not believe the. cablegram reported to have come from him in regard to Ozanne&#39;s desertion. My conscience told me it was wrong, and possibly I spoke harshly of General Monash. If his name was forged to the cable message, then the person responsible for that forgery - even if it were Brigadier-General Anderson - should be punished. The only gunpowder Brigadier-General Anderson has ever smelt was probably that used in a cracker. </para>

                                <para>- Why did he on his return from Egypt to Australia state, in order to gain a little kudos for himself, that General Murray had told him that he woiild rather lose a division of other troops than a brigade of Australians? An infantry brigade consists of 124 officers and 4,055 of other ranks, not including those detailed at base, whereas a division comprises 585 officers and 17,488 men. If General Murray did declare that he would sooner lose 18,000 British Tommies than 5,000 Australians, he should be sent out of the Army. I asked some time ago that, in justice to General Murray, a cablegram should be despatched to him asking whether the statement attributed to him by Brigadier-General Anderson was correct. My request was not agreed to. In any event, Brigadier-General Anderson is in a cleft stick, since, if General Murray did make the statement to him, it was a breach of confidence for him to publish it. </para>

                                <para>- Why has Brigadier-General Anderson not been man enough to come out and tell us all about the matter? If he forged General Mon ash&#39;s name to a cablegram he should be punished. I do not suggest that he did; but the person responsible for the forgery, no matter who he is, should he punished. The cablegram was merely sent to &#34; crucify &#34; this man Ozanne, whose brother had died at the Front, and who himself had offered to fight. Did any one ever hear of Brigadier-General Anderson offering to fight except to fight for a good billet? </para>

                            <para>.- As I understand it, the question now under consideration is whether a Royal Commission should be constituted to inquire into the case of a quartermaster-sergeant who has been returned from the Front under a very considerable cloud as to what his actions were on the other side. No doubt every honorable member has within his knowledge the case of either a private soldier, a non-commissioned officer, or an officer at present in Australia, who firmly believes that he has been very unjustly treated, and that his case is entitled to a special inquiry. Some of us, no doubt, have tried to have these cases re-opened in Australia, but, in each instance have received from the Defence authorities the reply that it is impossible for them to vary the decision that has been arrived at overseas. That being so, it appears to me that we have no right to consider in any way what were the political circumstances of the person involved in this case. The fact that he has been a member of this House is one to which we should not give even a moment&#39;s consideration. I was rather startled when the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> said that he was not quite clear as to whether a member of Parliament, on becoming a soldier, was entitled to any privilege to which any other  soldier  was not entitled. In my view - and it is the view held by every one who has been a soldier - the moment a member of Parliament joins the Forces, his smaller position as a politician becomes merged in the higher one of a soldier, and he becomes at once amenable to the laws to which every other soldier is amenable. It is not at all fair that a distinction should be made in favour of a man who was a member of Parliament before he went on service. </para>

                        <para>It has been stated during this debate that the person concerned has more at stake than is usually the case, since his political life - those were the words actually used - was involved. I would suggest that something rather more important than political life is at stake in connexion with many of the cases that come  before us. There are, primarily, the cases in which the honour of every one of those concerned is involved in what they regard as their unjust treatment, and then there are the cases which mean the physical life of those concerned, because they are practically faced with starvation. I do not think that the political life of a man influences a case very much. In my view, we certainly ought not to grant exceptional treatment to any individual on a point like that. I would certainly do everything I could to support an inquiry into this case, as into every other case where apparent injustice has been done.- but at the proper time when full evidence is available. </para>

                    <para>.- One point not dealt with by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> is that we have to consider, not only the retention of the islands, but also the position of the persons who now own and control these islands. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.B.</inline> Piddington, in a very excellent contribution to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> to-day, points out that there is no international law that can deprive these owners of their rights in the lands. Germans still control the islands, and will control them no matter what resolution we may pass, unless it is decided at the Peace table that in return for a sum of money the islands be handed over to those who desire to have them. The three Powers that I should like to see in control in the Pacific are the United States of America, New Zealand, and Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that, under international law. the war will leave them in exactly the same position as before. The letter of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington,</inline> I think, puts the position very accurately, and, therefore, I regard the motion before us as so much camouflage - as so much pretence and playing to the gallery. While we have nominal control, the Germans will have real control of the islands and of the disposal of their products. We did not enter this war with any idea of gratifying greed, and my belief is that out of the conflict will arise a League of Nations, with the object and hope of abolishing war, and with it naval bases that might be a menace to Australia. I do not think there is any necessity for the motion, but, as I have stated, I shall not vote against it unless it is specifically set forth that we are out for land-grabbing. It is not my opinion that we, or any on the Allied side, entered this war with the object of acquiring territory. </para>

                    <para>. -  I listened with interest to the addresses delivered on this motion, and it was amusing to hear the Leader of the Opposition expressing the views of the old Tory leaders in Britain years ago. The argument that these possessions, should they come under the control of Australia, would be too expensive, reminds one of the famous saying that the &#34;colonies were millstones around the neck of Great Britain. That &#34; the time is not opportune &#34; has been the plea of every Conservative in this and other countries since political institutions began. The Leader of the Opposition resumed his seat without informing us whether he favours or rejects the motion,  but  with a mere statement that he  does  not propose to vote against it unless somebody rises on this side and says so and so. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry that honorable members have such extended rights to insult others. I wish to bring the debate back to the only point in it, namely, that unless we secure the vantage points near to our continent from the control, not only of Germany, but of any other Power that may in the future become offensive to this  Commonwealth,  we shall have given of our best  blood  in this war for nothing. I take it that my position in this matter is on all fours with that of many other honorable members of the House. In order that I might take a certain stand in connexion with the war, I had to sever my political relations with men with whom I have been associated for very many years. I took that step because I thought they were asking the Australian Democracy to pursue a policy which was inimical to the interests of the continent as a home of the white people, and I think that our efforts in this war will have failed  if at the end of them we are still to have near to our shores nations that may become hostile and attack Australia from the bases &#39;which Germany owned before the war. Because I feel that the taking of those islands from the control of other nations is necessary for the future peace of this continent, I am wholly in accord with the motion. I would have been glad had it been framed in more definite and emphatic terms, because to us the matter involved is one of life and death. It is a question of whether we are to reap the fruits of the sacrifices our people have made, or whether when the war ends, we are still to live in terror that some day in the lives of our children or our children&#39;s children, Australia will again have to go through the horror of the last four years, but nearer home. My view of this matter has not changed since the day when the Queensland Government performed the patriotic act of taking possession of New Guinea. I believed then that the attitude of the Colonial Office was inimical to the interests of Australia, and no one who has studied the question since can deny that that is so. &#34;We have been in danger for many years past of having that portion of New Guinea controlled by Germany used as a base of operations against Australia, and we have failed to learn the lesson of this war if we do not recognise that it is unsafe to  give possession of points of advantage near to us to any other nation. The lesson taught by the war is that the friends of last century are the enemies of to-day; that every nation has to make an effort to be self-contained, and, as far as possible, keep from near its borders any other nation that is likely to challenge it3 supremacy at any future time. </para>

                <para>The effort that is being made now to obtain some security for the future peace of the world must concern itself with the future of the Pacific Islands. The question of Australia&#39;s security in the &#34;future is one of vital importance to us; but it must not be forgotten that at the Peace Conference which will consider this question, if it were only a matter of Australia&#39;s interests, we should have, at the most, one voice against all the other voices around the table. It will be only because the attention of the world has been directed to the preservation of peace in future that this question will claim that consideration which it ought to have in the final adjustment of the terms of peace. </para>
                <para>We must remember that Australia has not only to look for benefits from the war, but that she has to accept the responsibilities which her geographical position imposes upon her. She has to do her part in securing the future of the world for Democracy, and it may he that the deliberations of the Peace Conference will place upon her shoulders the responsibility of supervising the good government of the islands adjacent to this continent until, in the ordinary course of political development, they are able to set up independent governmental institutions of their own. If we are called upon to undertake the government of portions of New Guinea other than that controlled already by Australia, we should accept that responsibility, because it is necessary that good government should exist there, and, because of the position of the islands, that responsibility comes more naturally to us than to nations at the other side of the world. Personally, I hope that, whatever decision is arrived at by the peace delegates, we shall not have joint control of any of the Pacific Islands. International control of the islands has been a failure in every instance in which it has been tried, and it is far better to place the sole responsibility on one nation than to divide it among two or three, for that naturally leads to friction and bad government. </para>
                <para>I appreciate to the fullest degree the effort which the Prime Minister is making in England at the present time to get a hearing for the Australian view in this matter. I think that many people are beginning to realize the truth of what we said at the time, that when the Opposition in this Parliament prevented the Prime Minister from attending that most important meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet, they did an irreparable injury to the Australian cause. If, as a result of that action, the terms of the armistice are so interpreted as to prevent Australia  securing a fair deal at the Peace table, that responsibility must rest upon the party led by the honorable member forYarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> and cannot be placed upon any other shoulders. Australia should have had a potent voice in the deliberations of the Imperial War Cabinet before the Imperial delegates went to Versailles to settle the armistice terms. </para>

                        <para>- That is true. The principle of a White Australia and other things for which we have fought in Australia for the last quarter of a century are involved, and when the Prime Minister was prevented, for merely party political purposes, from attending those Imperial councils, a serious, and perhaps irrevocable, wrong was done to the Democracy of this country by its professed champions. We are now in the position that Australia has to make a very clear declaration of her wishes in that regard in order that they may have that attention in the Imperial councils that they must have before we can hope that they will be considered at all by the Peace Conference. Because I believe this motion will result in the Imperial Government giving consideration to the claim of Australia to equitable treatment in this matter, and will acquaint the authorities overseas with the importance to the future of this continent of the elimination of Germany from the Pacific, I support the motion. </para>

                <para>In regard to the motion, the question is whether we want more land. Speaking as an Australian and a lover of my country, I would say that at present we want no more land, because all that the Anglo-Saxon-Celtic race has done so far as Australia is concerned is to embroider its borders with splendid cities. The large interior, which could be cultivated by the conservation of water and by the boring of wells, in a sense has not yet been touched. We therefore do not want any further land at present, but speaking for the future and with a vista of a glorious Australia, one of the great homes of the white race, helping to keep up the civilization which the western nations have so far brought to such a high pitch, I would say, &#34; Yes, let us take all that we can.&#34; Against that idea we have the splendid precept laid down by President Wilson that there shall be no aggrandization of territory, followed by the declaration of the United Kingdom that Great Britain wants no territorial increase. Surely with the wide spaces we have in Australia we should follow those splendid examples, and say that we already have enough land of our own. I am contend to leave the matter to the decision of the  nations which will dominate the Peace table. If Australia is not represented as I could wish it to be, we must lay the blame upon the electors, but whoever is there, if he carries out any plan or fight for the benefit and welfare of Australia, will certainly earn my thanks and my regard.

At present, the Germans in the Caroline Islands collect labour in vessels which fly the British flag, and they have made that flag such a terror to the natives that whenever a boat flying the British colours approaches an island,, the native population rushes off into the forests and hills. The Germans are purposely making our flag an object of terror to these natives, so that if ever their voices are taken upon the matter of the future ownership of the islands,, they will vote for the other nation, and not for the country whose flag they have learned to fear. All this has happened since the war.

                <para>I recall a statement made in August, 1914, by the Consul in Melbourne for the last of the Allies to join us - the little Republic of Nicaragua, on the Isthmus of Panama. He told me then that we should not win even if we had 100 men for every one that Germany put into the field, and that not until we had ten large pieces of ordnance for every one possessed by Germany would we be able to blast our way through to Berlin. He said he had seen four revolutions and four different Presidents in his own country, and that while representing that country at Berlin he had enjoyed the secret information given to representatives of foreign Powers. Amongst other statements  made by  him was one to the effect that he had been through a new building in Germany four stories up and four stories down, which was stocked with munitions only to be used when Germany was invaded, and that this building had a floor space of 2 miles square. How great, then, was the achievement of our. &#34;contemptible little Army,&#34; ill-equipped as it was, m stemming back the onrush of the best equipped Army in the world ; but  to Prance must special credit be given for the stand that it has made. </para>
                <para>It is absolutely necessary to pass a motion of this kind. As my leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has said, there may be no immediate hurry, and the passing of it may not have much influence with the Peace Conference, but it will tend, at all events, to show that Australia is quick to express through its National Parliament the opinion it holds with respect to this great question. I could have wished that the question of an indemnity being paid by Germany had been introduced into this motion. What I suggest is not a penal indemnity, but one by way of justice. I perfer  to see Germany called upon to pay such an indemnity rather than that the workers of Australia should have to bear an interest burden of from &#163;15,000,000 to &#163;20,000,000 a year. Why should such a load be handed down to our children and our children&#39;s children <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> Innocent as we are of this war, the&#34; children as yet unborn will be even more innocent of it, and it would be an infamy to burden them for all times with the cross of interest payments. I hope we shall never agree to&#39; anything of the kind. It has been estimated that the coal resources of Germany alone, at a valuation of 5s. per tori, are worth &#163;240,000,000,000. If that be correct, then they are, in themselves, sufficient to provide, in time, for the payment of such an indemnity as might be demanded of Germany. I do not ask that the enemy should be called upon to pay down at once, as the unfortunate Japanese nation was once asked to do, the indemnity demanded of her. I should not mind if the payment were extended over 100 years; but I certainly think that an indemnity should be paid. The German race would not be crucified by having to comply with such a demand. Having put an end to the autocratic forms of government which disgraced their earlier history, the workers of the German Empire will have the right to leave their country, and seek a living elsewhere, if, as a result of the war, they find that local taxation is too heavy for them. I am not afraid of my fellow-Australian citizens of German parentage. In the very first days of the war the Melbourne Turn Verein offered its splendid club-rooms for use as a hospital for our soldiers. Some thirty of its members volunteered, and we know that over 100,000 American citizens of German parentage have marched to the Front under the flag of the United States of America. I could have wished that Roosevelt, rather than Wilson, had been  President  of the great Republic of the United States of America. As it is, I believe that Roosevelt stimulated the  President,  and led him to take action such as he might have hesitated to take had he been left to his own more philosophic moods. No one will say that if Roosevelt had been in the presidential chair the torpedoeing of the <inline font-style="italic">Lusitania</inline> would have occurred. The United States of America long before that outrage took place would have been in the war if Roosevelt had had his way. </para>
                <para>I look to the future with joy, since I believe that this will be the last great war in the World&#39;s history. At one time I had a fear of the East and the West coming into conflict, but I no longer entertain it. I know what noble work has been done by the stronger of our eastern. Allies; its fleet has protected our coastal towns and has prevented them from being utterly destroyed. No one will say that the splendid <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> was able to guarantee the safety of our coastal towns, stretching, as they do, from Brisbane round to Perth. Vessels of the Japanese fleet have been protecting our shores, and it was due to the generosity and splendid spirit of chivalry displayed by the Japanese that our own cruiser, the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney,</inline> was allowed to go out to meet and destroy the <inline font-style="italic">Emden.</inline></para>
                <para>I loathe war, and wonder sometimes why the Almighty permits it. To me the fact that 12,000,000 men have been killed, or have died as the result of wounds or sickness, in this war is appalling. It&#39; is equally appalling to learn that some 30,000,000 men have been wounded in a hundred different ways. I join most heartily in praise to the Creator that at last the war is over. Providence must view with feelings of sorrow the efforts to destroy each other which are made by those whom He has endowed with brain power above that of all other forms of life. Why should a brute like the Kaiser have been allowed to plunge the world into war? Men who share my views can join with me in showing respect to our own King, since his is a limited monarchy. Our King may not make war without the consent of his people. If he were an autocrat, then I should wish him to disappear just as the monarchs of the German Kingdoms have been swept away. King Edward, when Prince of Wales, was once discussing with a friend the question of whether England would ever become a Republic. He said that while he might come to the throne, he thought that England would one day become a Republic. If it did, he declared the best way out of the difficulty would be for the people to make him their first  President,  and then give him an opportunity to disappear into private life. It is a tribute to the spirit of the British that, although the people of Great Britain have one of the least up-to-date franchises, they have yet more liberty than have the people of other nations with a wider franchise. The franchise of Great Britain is undoubtedly ridiculous; it is certainly absurd that a woman under thirty should not be allowed to record hervote. </para>
                <para>I have only to say, in conclusion, that I should like this motion to be amended in the way I have suggested. We should do nothing that is likely to create in the minds of an Ally a feeling of distrust, and it seems to me that there could he placed upon this motion a construction altogether foreign to the wishes and desires of honorable members. If we left the disposal of these island colonies to the Conference which is to settle the peace terms, it would remove what I may term the&#39; personal note when we speak of Australia and New Zealand. If I cannot get my ideas accepted, I shall vote for the motion, such as it is. </para>

                    <para>.- The motion having been introduced, set in terms which every member of the House can cordially indorse, I feel it is my duty to interpose on a proposal which one might prefer to see passed without comment or question, my own views as to the possibility of justice requiring something further for Australia than what is actually implied in its terms. Instead of being a humble member of the House, had I the responsibility attaching to the Government, I should have hesitated to introduce this motion, and for two reasons. In the first place, I realize that we are speaking as a section of the Empire upon a subject on which we have every right to be heard; but we are not speaking to persons without sympathy for us, or who have no difficulties in the management of the peace conditions. Realizing that we are speaking to our own kith and kin overseas - realizing that we are speaking to a Government that appreciates most highly the inspiring example set for the whole Empire and the world by the early action of Australia, and that also appreciates in the highest degree the way our volunteers have played their part on the battlefields of Europe - I feel we can trust the Government responsible for the affairs of the Empire to act with an earnest desire to meet the necessities of the Australian people wherever they can be met. The other ground on which I should have hesitated to introduce the motion is that any person reading it without also reading the very able and eloquent speech with which it was introduced, might feel that this was all that Australia required as recompense for her tremendous sacrifices. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>We cannot regard the possession of these islands as an economic compensation for Australia. As the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has pointed out, the proposal is entirely in the interests of prudence, and. has little, if anything, to dc with economic recompense. </para>
                <para>I may be permitted to make a passing reference to what has made these islands of recent years so profitable, so . important, and of such promise to Germany. Honorable members may know that, before the war, the price of  copra,  the stable product of the 3?.lands, rose and kept on rising. The reason was that new &#39;markets had been found for the materials into which copra could be manufactured. Up to quite recently, it has been impossible to profitably use copra in the production of food. Not so long ago, however, a German chemist discovered a way of making from  copra  an excellent palatable oil for cooking, which was used by the whole Jewish  people  of Central Europe; and a great British industry in the supply of olive oil to that part of the &#34;world disappeared with the discovery. In the same way large markets are every day being found for imitation butters and margarine that have been manufactured from copra. It is only if we continue to maintain these markets - and it is difficult to know if we can maintain the previous markets for the product in Western Russia and Eastern Germany - and develop them that the islands can be made of economic advantage to Australia. However, the motion is set in terms of prudence; and on that ground, I think that every member of the House might well support it. </para>
                <para>It seems to me that persons who assume there are to be no indemnities are rather overestimating the case. They are carrying in their minds those debatable points put forward by  President  Wilson many months ago at the time when Germany was talking colossal indemnities, and refusing to consider even a drawn war; but those points have been vitally modified by the armistice conditions recently published. No doubt honorable members were as alarmed as I was when I read in the press that all the Versailles Conference had succeeded in doing was to get the phrase &#34; no indemnities &#34; altered into the phrase &#34; civilian reparation.&#34; I realized that the ordinary meaning of &#34; civilian reparation &#34; meant no return to Australia for her heavy outlay in treasure and the sacrifice in the war of some of our best producers. I was correspondingly delighted when I . afterwards read in the armistice conditions, section 19, the words, &#34; With the reservation that any future claims and demands of the Allies and the United States of America remain unaffected, the following financial conditions are required: - Reparation for damage done&#34; - and so forth. The very .armistice conditions presuppose a position arising under which indemnities, against the ordinary costs of war, so far as they can be met, may be claimed. </para>
                <para>May I now say one word on this subject as it seems to me to affect Australia ? Unless these indemnities are forthcoming to Australia, or unless there be a spreading throughout the Empire of that &#34; civilian reparation &#34; which individual sections of the Empire are to get, Australia will be unjustly treated. We may say that if a man&#39;s house has been bombed, or a man&#39;s ship has been lost, that house and ship shall be made good. But if Australia has lost no house or has lost no ship, Australia has jio claim for such damages. Now, in the case of a house, or of a ship, the damage has already been made good, so far as the individual owner is concerned.  His  house has in &#34;all human likelihood been insured, as the ship undoubtedly was, so that civilian reparation means reparation to the Government for damage done to its civilians. What is the difference between the damage done to the civilians of this country by the taxation levied here, and the damage done to the civilians of the Mother Country? The latter has been met by the various insurance schemes specially&#39; formulated to meet such contingencies; and the very insurance companies could not have reparation made to them, because they have put up their premiums in order to be able to meet the claims made. </para>
                <para>I shall take honorable members one . stage further; and this is, perhaps, the most interesting phase to my mind. The Empire makes war as a whole, with all its energies and heart, for a common purpose. But in the terms of peace, under &#169;ur loose Constitution, one section of the Empire - one Government, fortunately, composed of the very best of persons with the deepest sympathy for us and our aspirations - makes the peace. Again, the one section that makes the peace gets, on behalf of the Empire - for it is the trustee for the Empire - anything which  comes  out of the melting pot, amongst which may be some of the potentially richest provinces in the world. Take one simple illustration. Let us assume that the Peace Conference decides that Mesopotamia, which at one time was the granary of the then civilized world, is not to revert to that tyrannical and wasteful rule that turned it from a granary to a desert, but that the Empire is to &#39; receive it. If that happens, not the&#39; Empire, but the United Kingdom, which is the trustee for the Empire, gets territory worth thousands of millions sterling, while Australia gets another competitor in -grain in the markets of the Mother Country. </para>

                        <para>- I am only saying these things now because I think that the shortest, way to success is to be perfectly frank and free. As one of the keenest Imperialists in this Chamber, through all the years I have sat here, I say that it is of vital importance to the solidarity of our race in the future that the Dominions of the Empire shall be generously and considerately treated in connexion with the peace proposals. I do not for a moment say, as some people loosely say in the street, that this .country should have all its war expenditure met. There is one part of our war expenditure that this country would be too proud to have met by others; I refer to the extra money we are only too happy to have paid to our soldiers, an expenditure we prefer to bear as a. tribute to the men who have kept us where we are. But there are some phases of our expenditure which should be met, in justice to the country, first on the ground that the phrase &#39; &#39; .civilian reparation &#34; does not meet our needs; secondly, that any territorial aggrandisement the Empire gets is at the expense, so to speak, of Australia in providing another competitor; and thirdly, because I trust that this Empire of ours in the future will every day grow closer together, with the people in greater sympathy and harmony, and .that we should look back&#34; upon a common gain without any bitterness at the suffering that has gone. </para>

                <para>I do hope that we shall get one compensation at the Peace Conference that has been referred to to-day, but which I believe is none the less real. The greatest military Powers in the world have been disarmed, and that, in my humble judgment, means that many swords may be turned into many plough-shares, and many energies that have been devoted to preparations for war may well, be diverted to the development of the resources of mankind. I hope and believe that that is one of the results we shall get out of this war. But we would be mad to assume that this is the  last war, and that war is always a clashing of right against wrong. Some of the greatest crimes of this kind in history have been due to the clashing of right against right. I need not refer to the direction in which such things may possibly occur again, but let us hope that so long as we live we shall not have a repetition of what we have passed through during the last few years. I have urged my views in connexion with this motion  in  no sense because I fear the justice we shall receive at the hands of the Mother Country, but solely that those who may work sympathetically for us in connexion with the peace proposals may realize that the terms of this motion are not all that justice requires for the Australian Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. -  Many times during this discussion we on this side of the chamber have been taunted with the question, &#34; Will you vote for the motion ? &#34; I say emphatically that I shall not vote for the motion as it is worded, and I take the risk of all the threats that may be made as to what will happen to me on account of that attitude. The wording of the motion is somewhat peculiar, especially as we are dealing with the islands in the Pacific. It says that in ho circumstances shall the captured German Possessions in the Pacific, which are now occupied by Australian and New Zealand troops, be restored to Germany. There is no reference  whatever to the islands captured by Japan. I know it is a very nasty statement to make, but I must accept the responsibility for saying that I would as soon have the Germans holding the islands in the Pacific as I would have the Japanese. </para>

I think it would be very ill advised on the part of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports to pursue the subject which he has introduced. He has referred to one of our Allies in terms which may cause serious offence. I am sure he will recognise the unwisdom of further references of the kind, and that the general sense of the House is certainly opposed to such references. </para>

                        <para>- My remarks are not intended to be offensive. I speak solely from the industrial and racial standpoints. It does seem somewhat peculiar that members on the Government side should be able to give expression to their feelings without restraint, and that the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kelly)</inline> should be able to make a remark which, if voiced by me, would have been considered disloyal. Throughout the war I have refrained from alluding to one of our Allies, but the motion says that in no circumstances must Germany, whether reformed or. otherwise, re-occupy the Pacific islands, because to do so would be to create a menace to Australia. When I endeavour to point to another menace I am immediately called to order. I quite understand the delicacy of the situation, and I would be the last person to introduce any discussion that would be likely to bring about international difficulties ; but I am of opinion that nothing I may say will create any difficulty between Great Britain and Japan. Today the Caroline and Marshall Islands are controlled by Japan. </para>

                        <para>- My memory reverts to the time when the name of Russia was anathema to every Britisher. We remember well the great Russian scare of not many years ago. We were told that Russia was menacing India, and endeavouring to obtain political influence in Afghanistan. British politicians&#34; and the press discussed that matter very freely, and the feeling towards Russia was one of real hatred, because the Russians desired, just as the Germans have done, to secure the trade of India. They were said to be sapping the commercial interests of Britishers in that country. There is no need for me to recite the diplomatic arrangements that were made to avert the threatened trouble, because honorable members are familiar with the facts. At the time of the Fashoda incident the French and the British peoples were, at variance; feeling ran high, there was talk of war. Nobody ever dreamed that Britain would ever be at war with Turkey, because Turkey always looked upon Great Britain as one of her protectors; yet for the last four years we have been waging war against the Turkish Empire. </para>

                        <para>- I am. I cannot understand any people feeling hatred towards another people who, by no stretch of imagination, can be blamed, as a people, for what has taken place during the last few years. I have no feeling against the unfortunate German worker in regard to this war, and if the Allies, as peoples, do not wish to be placed in the same category with the Germans, of whose &#34; kultur &#34; we have spoken so sarcastically, they will not deal with the German people, as some persons desire that they shall be dealt with. Have honorable members read the speech of  President  Wilson published in yesterday&#39;s press, in which he spoke of his feelings towards the German people? The Prime Minister of Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has expressed himself similarly, and so has <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> the former Leader of the Labour Party. I know, of course, that he was brought to book for his remarks. I say, again, that we have no right to blame the German people for the war. As a matter of fact, the war was purely a Prussian design. Have honorable members studied the history of Germany and learnt how the different States were forced into the German Federation? </para>

                        <para>- The Germans deny the charges that have been made against them, and they should be proved or disproved in a neutral Court. I am not one of those who would hand over the proof or otherwise to a court consisting of Prussian junkers; but I do know that if a British army captured a town in any foreign country, and if, after the enemy had been thrust out of that town, civilians dared to fire upon British troops, they would be met with reprisals; and, according to the extent of the injury done to the troops, so would be meted out the reprisals to civilians. It is an acknowledged principle in all warfare that civilians must not attack soldiers. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite willing to believe that outside of such reprisals as I have indicated much was done by the German army; but I insist that much of what was actually done would have been done also by the- soldiers of any other nation. In all the hatred which is being heaped upon the German people to-day, it should not be forgotten that the same, degree of hatred has been felt by the British towards other countries which are now our Allies. This is the first occasion in recent history when Germany and Britain have not been friends. </para>

                <para>We are told that the Allies will not enter upon even the consideration of peace unless they are to deal with a reformed Germany. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> stated to-day that even with Germany on her knees, as she now is, General Hindenburg remains as one of the leading factors at the seat or the &#39;German Government. I do not believe it. I do not believe that the Socialists and the Soviets would tolerate Hindenburg for ten minutes. I believe that, wherever he now is, he is pretty close to the Kaiser. The fact is that in the latter course of this war, . Hindenburg has been endeavouring to supplant the Kaiser; that is if we are to believe the cables. No reformed Germany under a socialistic <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> would tolerate a Hindenburg in its midst. If the people of Germany show that they will have no more of  Kaiserism,  and will become,, as we ourselves would like to be, although we- are not,- a civilized nation, will honorable members still say that in no circumstances shall Ger.many nave the opportunity of regaining her overseas dominions ? The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kelly)</inline> gave the whole show away when he referred to the present value of copra. I am&#39; informed that the Oil and butter extracted from copra will supplant almost every other product of that character. We say that we shall not deal commercially with the Germans; that we shall not accept their cure for cancer, or for bald heads; that we shall not listen to their music ; that we  shall not encourage through commerce any of their great discoveries, such as making cocoanut oil palatable. The Germans, in their organized thoroughness, have discovered how to make that cocoanut oil palatable, wherefore it has now become a matter of commercial concern throughout the world. There are teeming millions of Jews in Europe who are fond of fried edibles, and to whom the fat of the pig is abhorrent. To them there is considerable significance in the fact that copra has been found to provide a substitute for a great many fats and oils. The extracts from copra are now being used to a vastly greater extent than ever before. The product of copra in future will be in greater demand than ever. Therefore, when the honorable member for Wentworth alluded to the fact that copra will be largely produced in those islands, we were able Jio see that, after all, commercialism is mixed up in the matter of who shall get those Possessions. </para>
                <para>Perhaps the time will come when Britain would just as soon have Germany close to the shores of her Dominions as certain other nations which are to-day her Allies. Just as the feeling of hatred now is against Germany, so may hatred on the part of Britons return with regard to certain other nations which to-day are our Allies. There is not an honorable member opposite, who is conversant with the history of Britain&#39;s troubles, and of her desire for dominance and commercial expansion, but who must be aware that those islands of the Pacific may create further international turmoil. Yet we are told that this was not a war to acquire more territory. </para>

                        <para>- My opinion is that it would be better to have Germans there than certain other people.This is only another evidence of grab, added to the secret treaties of the Allied nations during 1916. Honorable members are aware - although the public outside may not be - that certain secret treaties gave to Great Britain the greater portion of Asia Minor, the whole of Mesopotamia, the suzerainty of Persia, with a clear line right into India. Secret treaties gave to Italy vast European territories which Italy could not claim as ever having been Italian. Secret treaties gave to Italy and to France, in Asia Minor, huge areas which they are to colonize. Yet we are told that it is only the German who was after territorial aggrandisement in the war. </para>

                <para> I am one of those who desire to be proud of our country; but can &#39;we be proud of any country that will say to the people of another country, &#34; Down you go to hell, so far as we are concerned &#34; ? Honorable members talk about indemnities to be enforced upon the people of Germany. If the Allies &#34; collar &#34; the Kaiser and all the rest of his royal and military gangs, I shall only say, Good luck to the Allies. But if the Allies force upon Germany a huge burden, added to that awful load which the people are already carrying as the result of the war, then I can only describe such conduct as absolute vindictiveness towards the unfortunate workers of Germany. What is the value of the mark to-day? When our enormous indemnity has been piled upon the present indebtedness of Germany, what will be the value of the mark then? If it is taking the German all his time to  cope with his debt to-day, what will happen to him when he is crushed beneath the added load of indemnity? We say, rightly, that every brick torn from every building in the territories occupied by the German army, that every tree hewn down and blown down, and that every ton of coal and iron taken from the mines of France and Belgium shall be paid for by Germany. It is quite right that Germany should repay and make reparation for all such tilings as that.; for I know that if we had lost the war there would have been added to our burden of war indebtedness by the Prussian military caste ah indemnity which would have rendered us abject slaves for generations and centuries to come. But that is what we are trying to do with Germany now. I have no concern for the wealthy and military classes of Germany, but if we are going to thrust the unfortunate German worker under, I, for one, shall protest. </para>

                <para>We talk about the feeling of one nation to another. It is quite within the bounds of possibility that New Zealand may declare war against Australia over these islands in the Pacific. The honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> may laugh, but the desire of the people of New Zealand is to secure control of some of the islands. They claim Samoa, and when it comes to a question of partitioning we may find Governments which are Looking for benefits out of the war attacking one another if they think that benefits are being secured by others which are not accruing to themselves. If I am any judge, ill-feeling will be created between Australia and New Zealand. We have our Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> in Great Britain urging the claims of Australia. On the other hand, we have the Ward-Massey combination urging the interests of New Zealand. I bet the four of them are not like lambs lying down in the fold. Each is trying to get special benefits for his own country, not for the people, but for the commercialism of his own country. At a football match I have seen as much feeling and hatred displayed by the opposing teams and their supporters as could be displayed by people of hostile countries towards one another. At times feelings of hatred find expression in this chamber, but I must say that they are not so strenuously expressed as they are outside among the supporters of the parties here. During an election or a conscription referendum campaign in Australia greater hatred has been displayed than has ever been felt by the people of France and Germany towards one another. No stronger hand and no greater exercise of the mailed fist or the Kaiser spirit could have been exercised by the ex-Emperor of Germany than was exercised by the present Prime Minister during his last two fights against the Labour party. He utilized all the money that he had under his control, the whole of the press, and the whole of the laws of the country in order to prevent us putting our views before the people. </para>

                        <para>- I have been very patient with honorable members. I have called the House to order frequently, and interjections have immediately followed. This cannot be permitted to continue . and it is necessary that some action should be taken when the House gets out of control in that way to enforce the directions of the Chair. I expect Ministers and the Leader of the Opposition to support me in my efforts to preserve decorum in debate. Otherwise the orderly proceedings of the House will be impossible. I ask the honorable member for Batman to apologize to the House for his interjections, and to do so, not in a spirit of levity, but in a spirit of seriousness. </para>

It is a disorderly practice which cannot be permitted, and I hope that he will not offend again. For the time being, I ask the House to allow the incident to close, but I trust that it will not be repeated. I hope that honorable members will see the necessity of obeying the direction of the Chair when the House is called to order. </para>

                <para class="block">In the face of these emphatic utterances, we can have- the utmost faith in the statesmen who will settle the future of these islands; but, at the same time, the motion submitted by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> is exceedingly opportune, because this . Parliament is a body which ought to &#39;be able to speak with authority upon the future control of the islands of the Pacific. We have had an experience of those Possessions which no other part of the British Empire has had. Out geographical and local knowledge, and our trading and other relations lead us to know not only their resources, but also how favorably situated some of them are for the establishment- of naval bases and coaling stations. We know, as no other people know, how vital they are to the safety of the Commonwealth, and what a menace they would be to us if they were allowed to continue under foreign ownership. There is a fair amount of trade between the islands and Australia, but it is not very profitable. From an economic stand-point, they would not be very valuable Possessions for Australia to hold; but under divided or under foreign control we realize they will always be a menace to our future safety. </para>
                <para>The Pacific is different from any other ocean, .since it is dotted with islands which might easily  be occupied by a foreign Power, who would thus be able to cut off the whole of Australia&#39;s trade. In no other ocean is there such a menace to the future of this continent. We know what the policy of peaceful penetration did for the German people. By such means they increased their influence and their territories in the Pacific in a way that if allowed to continue would very soon make them the dominant power in that part of the world. The Inter-State Commission, in a voluminous report recently issued, set out the trade relations of the territories of the Pacific with the rest of the world. The figures published in that report gave the population and the total trade of these islands, and showed in a striking manner the way in which Germany had increased its influence in the Pacific. The war party within Germany, before the outbreak of war, was deploring the fact that so many German citizens were becoming absorbed by other nations and losing their nationality. &#34; They arrived at the determination that if Germany desired to expand and become a world Power, she could do so only by increasing her oversea colonial Possessions. The total imports and exports of the various islands of the Pacific, including Papua, are of the value of &#163;8,000,000 per annum. Of that total the British proportion is about &#163;4,000,000 per annum, while the German proportion . before the war amounted to something like &#163;1,550,000. Great Britain, if we include New Guinea, holds 111,530 square miles of territory in the Pacific, with a population of 600,000, while the Germans before the war held something like 80,000 square miles, of territory, with a population of 800,000. Although the territory held by Germany is only two-thirds of that held by Great Britain, its population is 200,000 more. Largely by means of its missionary efforts Great Britain- was responsible in the early days for securing to these islands in the Pacific whatever civilization they now possess and the trade arising from it. But the German nation, in accordance with its&#39; policy of peaceful penetration to secure territorial expansion overseas, and so to extend its power and influence, had come in and had obtained two-thirds of the total territory controlled by Great Britain, with a population one-fourth greater. The population of the whole of these islands, which is something like 1,400,000, is calling out for some form of unified control. We have had some experience of divided control within the Pacific, and more particularly in connexion with the New Hebrides. We hold those territories conjointly with our Allies the French; but we now find it difficult to have a unified control over territories in the Pacific, and at the same time a proper scheme of development and a system of laws that will conduce to the growing up of an industrious and peaceful people. </para>
                <para>If we, as a Commonwealth, claim that Great Britain shall control these territories of the Pacific, and give to the Commonwealth some kind of suzerainty over them we shall be acting in the best interests of the people of the islands as well as in the interests of Australia and the whole Empire. The retention of our control over these islands is absolutely essential to our safety and integrity. It is clearly pointed out in the report of the Inter- State Commission that there is only one means by which the people of these territories can be raised to anything like a reasonable standard of civilization, and that js by providing for the natives a system of education, including the teaching of a uniform language, so that they may be trained to habits of industry. On the occasion of a recent visit to Japan I had an opportunity to call at the Philippines. There I saw the Filipinos being trained under a system of State education. English is being taught as a compulsory subject in all the State schools, and the natives are being trained to take charge of their own affairs. They occupy all the seats in both Houses of Parliament, and fill important positions in the various schools. They carry out for themselves most of the administrative work of the country. This is an illustration of the fact that with a proper system of Government control providing for the education of the natives and the compulsory teaching of a uniform language, it is possible to raise the people of these  islands to something like a reasonable standard of civilization. </para>

During the Spanish control of the Philippines, which extended oyer something like 400 years, the Filipinos had opportunities to become acquainted with forms of civilization as established in Spanish communities, and we have yet to learn that the Papuans, the Samoans, and other island races are not capable of rising to the same standards. </para>

                <para>The terms of this motion are such as should meet with the unanimous approbation of this Parliament. I should have liked it to go further, and to state that Australia believes it to be in the interests of the Empire as well as essential for the safety of the Commonwealth that the future control of these islands of the Pacific should be vested in the British Empire. Britain has the most right to them, and -is in the best position to govern them. When we recognise the part that the Pacific must play in the world&#39;s destiny, and how essential it is that Australia should continue a part of the British Empire, we shall realize at once that we should cultivate a closer re. lationsbip with the great Republic of the United States of America. I can see no possibility of this continent being retained a part of the British Empire to be peopled by the British, unless the control of the islands that lie in the Pacific be divided between Great Britain and the United States. I can see no possibility of our remaining part of the British Empire with reasonable safety, except by means of a greater flow of capital from the United States and Great Britain, followed by a large inflow of the enterprising people of those two great countries. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems to me that, at this period in the world&#39;s history, when the international working classes are rejoicing to the music of falling thrones, this is a rather puerile proposition to place before a Parliament that claims to represent &#34;one of the most advanced Democracies in the world. We are told in the terms- of this motion that it is essential for the future safety and welfare of Australia that the captured German Possessions in the Pacific, which are now occupied by Australian and New Zealand troops, should not, in any circumstances, be restored to Germany. I am one of those who believe that the German working classes do not want the return of the colonies. I do not believe that any intelligent working class community, or section of humanity to-day, concerns itself with the question of colonial Possessions. A far greater question interests the, people of the world today. It is not alone in the belligerent countries where thrones have toppled over, and where others are shaking, that this attitude is to be found. The peoples of the  world are undergoing a mental revolution. The great catastrophe that overwhelmed Europe has left no part of the world untouched. The working classes of all countries have been affected by this great catastrophe, which has quickened their minds, widened their vision, and shown to them that there are other considerations more important than that of who shall own certain islands in the Pacific or elsewhere. To-day, the working classes of the world are not concerning themselves with these, to my mind, comparatively trivial affairs. They do not _ concern themselves with the question of who shall control the Pacific and the islands therein, but who, or which class, shall own the world and make impossible a repetition of the tragedy that has just closed; and I trust that we have intelligence enough in the world to prevent such a repetition. I am sure that not one of us desires to see war ; and if we could formulate some scheme to abolish it we would do so. It is claimed that under no circumstances shall the Pacific islands, now occupied by Australian and New Zealand troops, be returned to Germany. The German Empire has gone for ever, though the German people remain. We do not know how they will reestablish themselves, whether as a number of independent Republics or a federation of free peoples. </para>

                <para>This is only a surface motion, a move to take advantage of the patriotic and latent national spirit in the people of Australia for political purposes. That this is the real reason for the motion is supported by the contention of the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lamond),</inline> that no nation but the Commonwealth of Australia should have control of these islands. The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kelly)</inline> told us that he is an out-and-out Imperialist. I believe that that is true, and that honorable gentlemen opposite, conscientiously for the most part, hold the opinion that in Imperialism lies the safety of the Commonwealth and the continuance of the Empire. My own opinion is that Imperialism is not a good doctrine, because it means the crushing out of liberty. The Commonwealth, if it desires to pursue a national policy, would be far better-served by one such as that adopted by the United States of America prior to the American-Spanish war - a policy of minding its own affairs on the continent without regard to outlying Possessions contiguous thereto. </para>
                <para>We are told that it is not for economic gain that Australia desires these Possessions in the Pacific, but only with the idea of safeguarding the Commonwealth. The object, it is said, is to take hostages for the future, because, if these islands got into the possession of some foreign power, it would be necessary to largely increase our naval and military expenditure. Yet, during the course of the war, we were told that it would result in a League of Nations, the grand outcome of which would be the rendering of war impossible, with the supremacy of the Allies on sea and land. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether it is. If any lesson is taught by history it is that conquest by force, and the imposition of the harshest terms possible, only leave a legacy of hate; and we have a striking instance in the policy &#39;of revenge that ruled France from 1870. However, that is outside the scope of the motion. The only attempted justification for the motion has been that put forward by those who term themselves Imperialists, and believe in Imperial expansion. The oration of the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kelly)</inline> &#62;was a lesson to all economic students, as showing why the islands in the Pacific should be acquired by Australia. The reason given is that these islands are rich in copra, and, as the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(&#34;Mr. Watt)</inline> told us, there are good* indications of oil. The&#39; honorable member for Wentworth pointed to Mesopotamia as the granary of the world, and he waxed sadly eloquent as he contemplated the future competition of that country, under British control, with Australia in- the production of foodstuffs. </para>

                <para>Although it has been stated that Australia, the Empire, and our Allies entered the war without any thought of acquiring an inch of territory, it is_ remarkable that similar protestations should have been made by similar statesmen at the time of the Boer war in 1899. On the latter occasion the object was stated to be merely that of. obtaining the franchise for the  Uitlanders,  but at the conclusion of hostilities the two Republics were incorporated in the British Empire. Of course, that was only  a happy coincidence; and so with Mesopotamia, the Pacific Islands, and so forth. I recognise that the expression of opinion by those of us whose views are not in harmony with the ideas of the supporters of this motion will not produce any great tangible result. We are asked to be silent at this stage in -the history of Australia, because, the people today are naturally in an excited state over the victory of the Allies; and it is thought that we might be afraid to run counter to the popular trend. . It- may be that popular .opinion in Australia will indorse this motion, but I am satisfied that the working men and women in the country, when the war fever has died down and ordinary work-a-day existence is resumed, will not care who is in possession of the Pacific Islands. </para>

                        <para>- There never was a proposal of the kind in regard to which that same old argument was not used. Honorable members opposite have told us that our Allies of 100 years ago are our enemies to-day - that the enemies of yesterday are the friends of to-morrow; and it may be that history will repeat itself. We on this side may not say a word about our friends of to-day, though honorable members opposite may tell us about the friends of yesterday being our enemies of to-day. The people Of Australia, the Empire, and the world will be asked to train children, to build up armaments, in order to safeguard Australia, not this time in Europe, but much nearer home. We shall be told, as in the past, that the greatest security for peace is to prepare for war. This war, which was to end war, is, apparently, to result in making preparations against some at least of our quondam friends, because if the victorious Allies of to-day are supreme on land and sea, war, if it comes, must be amongst themselves. What is there inherent in the system that rnakes war in the future, not only possible, but probable? It is the same thing that is behind this motion - the conflict for markets, and the necessity for reaching  out  for fresh lands. As Professor Atkinson pointed out last night in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,&#39;</inline> the League of Nations, which is to- redeem humanity, is but the political framework of another trust - it is the&#39; oil trusts, steel trusts, and others which have broken the confines of any one nation, and are reaching out for international control. These are the financial interests which control war and peace, and which have their head-quarters in Wall-street. </para>

We are told that the German people are responsible for the crimes of their taskmasters - the people who were kept down by the bayonets and rifles of the German autocracy, and who had the choice of being shot in front by the Allies or being stabbed in the back by the bayonets of their own soldiers. And the Australian workers would have been in just the same position if honorable members opposite had had their way, and conscription had been adopted. The German people have had to carry the military legions of the Kaiser; but the Russian revolutionaries sent 10,000 emissaries into Germany and used the ambassador&#39;s presence in Berlin for the purpose of disseminating Bolshevik literature throughout Germany, with the result that today the German autocracy is broken down. </para>

Indemnities and annexations are for honorable members opposite to settle; they do not interest the working class in this or any other country. They in every country have to work to pay the indemnities, which the capitalists will collect and enforce so long as they have the power behind them.

                <para>Mr.CONSIDINE. - I have no wish to frighten anybody; but as the honorable member is unusually silent, my remarks must have had some effect upon him. I have a recollection of having read in one of the world&#39;s good books that certain rich men were told that the only way for them to reach salvation was to get rid of their possessions, and they went away sorrowful, because they had much. </para>
                <para>The matters with which I have been dealing demand serious attention, and can not be dismissed by a casual laugh. They reach down into fundamentals. The whole structure of capitalistic society rests upon economic conditions, and all that that means; and we cannot leave economic conditions in this country unchanged while the world is rocking and seething with revolution. If we are to avoid the catastrophies that are occurring in other countries, we must devote our brains and energies to an alteration of the economic conditions in Australia, to giving the workers industrial as well as political Democracy.

It may be  that  some time must elapse before reason is allowed to re-assert itself  in  these matters. The advent of  that  time will not be accelerated  if  some of the gentlemen connected  with  the  press  have their way. The honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nicholls)</inline> this afternoon quoted an instance of their methods. I have no apologies to offer to the press or anybody else for any attitude I adopt in this House.For any attitude of mine, any expressions of mine, or for any sentiments to which I give utterance or refrain from giving utterance, I am responsible to the people who sent me here; and if my views and actions do not suit them, I have no wish to he here. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> has explained that he has no apologies to offer to any one.. I apologize to him for my silence, which was mainly due to my desire to conform to the rules  of  the House, but was attributable also to an intense wish to understand what the honorable member meant to convey. I intend to vote for the motion, but I have two regrets in respect to it. One is, that a motion asking that the former German colonies should in no circumstances be restored to Germany was not carried unanimously months ago; and my second regret is with regard to the wording of the present motion itself. For months there has been an order of the day upon our notice-paper. I have one in my hand at present, dated 12th April, containing the wording of a motion similar to that which was carried unanimously in the Senate, but as to which this  House  has apparently been too busy to be permitted even to give it consideration. I considerably prefer the wording of the resolution of the Senate to that of the motion which we are now dealing with. If I am in order, I will give honorable members the exact words. </para>

A motion on the business-paper for a subsequent date does not prevent the Government from dealing with the same question in the form of another motion, or of one which may relate to the same matter on an earlier date. In any case, the two matters are not identical. </para>

If those words of limitation were inserted accidentally, or without full recognition of their significance, I can only express regret that they should not have been deleted. If they were inserted deliberately, I would prefer personally to dissociate myself  from the limitation. In the present circumstances, however,- it is infinitely important that a resolution, should go forth from this Parliament drawing the attention of the Imperial Government and of the Allies to this most important aspect of the future of the whole of the German colonies, so far as Australian sentiment is concerned.

                        <para>- That interjection reminds me of another aspect of the debate. It has been inferred by speakers opposite, as a slur upon those honorable members supporting the&#39; motion on this side, that in some way our demand that the former German colonies should&#39; not be restored to Germany is due to the fact that some people in Australia hope to obtain commercial advantage, or that they desire some further acquisition of territory. I believe that I speak for all honorable members on this side when I say that there is no such thought in the minds of honorable members. &#34;Upon a celebrated occasion in the House of Commons during the Napoleonic Wars, one of England&#39;s greatest patriots and statesmen - the  prototype,  I am inclined to say. of . Lloyd George - </para>

The object of this motion can be put into one word, that is safety - safety for Australia, for the British Empire, for civilization against the greatest danger that has ever menaced mankind. As I have listened to the words&#39; which have flown with such facility from honorable members opposite, I cannot help asking now if they have - ever given consideration to the future of our children and of our children&#39;s children ? If honorable members opposite will try to free their minds of prejudice and bias, and will visualise the future, will they still say that it would be safer for Australia that there should be German- colonies in the Pacific rather than that the Germans should be absolutely out of those islands? </para>

I wish, first, to record the motion, because it is a momentous one - being the first important declaration on the part of this House since the termination of this colossal tragedy of war. It is becoming that the motion, as moved by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr: Watt) should be debated seriously and efficiently rather than that it should be disposed of, as was desired by honorable members on the Ministerial side, in a demonstration of hysteria. The motion reads - </para>

Is it the mind which the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> interpreted to the country on the same occasion ? Or is it the more moderate expression of opinion which seems to be involved in the motion as it is now phrased ? When the Acting Prime Minister was speaking this afternoon, I ventured to interject, for at that time interjecting was not so dangerous as it has become in the more volcanic atmosphere that has been created as the night has gone on - that it is not long since the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> declared that we should hold on to these islands to the last gasp. That was the spirit, if not the wording, of the motion moved by another honorable gentleman in another place. The motion before us to-day is in a milder form, and for a special reason. When the Minister for the Navy took his departure from Victoria, and was pausing for a moment in New South Wales to bid the farewell in the congenial atmosphere of the Millions Club, on the 25 th April last he is reported as having said - and, as be has been reported so frequently as having said it, and has failed to deny it, we may take it that he was correctly reported - </para>

                        <para>- I am doing what the honorable member dares not do - I am giving my opinion. It wag not long before the scene was changed and the tone of honorable members opposite was changed. As soon as these distinguished tourists left Australia to go abroad at this country&#39;s expense in order to misrepresent the Commonwealth in another part of the world, our policy in&#39; regard to the South Pacific Islands was not that we should cling to them to the last gasp, but, according to the words of the Acting Prime Minister, that they must remain under our control, or under that of some other friendly Power. There was a very decided modification in the tone of these fire-eating politicians of ours as soon as our representatives had come within the influence of Downingstreet, where they received, as we know perfectly well, a polite intimation that they must sing a softer tune in regard to their Imperialistic ambitions. From that day they have sung a softer tune, and the gentler notes of that tune are reported in the words contained in the motion before the House to-day. The Acting Prime Minister says, &#34; We do not want territory.&#34; If greed of territory, if the vain and foolish and costly ambition of Imperialism is not involved in this motion, how else is it proposed to use the islands to which it refers? I will concede that there is no other Power which has a greater or better right to occupy the islands of the South Pacific than we have; there is no other Power that is likely to occupy them, unless it be that from which they have been taken. Therefore, it follows that the only middle course is for them to pass under some kind of international control. </para>

                        <para>- I do not pause to advocate it or repudiate it. I am simply saying that if the Government declare that. these islands shall not revert to Germany they must mean that they shall either he retained under our control or pass to the control of a friendly Power, or else be placed under some international control. I have already said that no other Power has a better claim to them than we have. As to international control, will the Government assert that any scheme of international control or occupation of the Pacific Islands would be satisfying? It would not be satisfying to them. Therefore, this motion can have no other meaning, although they dare not say it in so many words, than that their policy, not at the end of the war, hut at a time when the end of the war seems imminent, is to declare for Imperial territorial gain. </para>

                <para>What is our position in regard to these islands and the Allies? Have Ministers forgotten that the Allies have made a very deliberate declaration in regard to colonial claims. If so, I think they have been sufficiently reminded during this debate that such is the case, for clause 5 of the memorable epoch-making fourteen points drawn up by the illustrious  President  of the great Republic lays it down in the following terms :  - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>A free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict observance of the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty, the interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims of the Government whose title is to be determined. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Are Ministers not aware that No. 5 of these fourteen points, as laid down by  President  Wilson, has been accepted by the Allies and adopted as the very basis and foundation upon which this peace rests - an absolutely open-minded impartial adjustment of all colonial claims &#34; ? How, then, do they, in this outpost of the Empire, propose to make a declaration which, if it has any influence at all, may clearly embarrass the Imperial Government, and which is, in fact, out of harmony and inconsistent with this declaration which has been accepted by the Allies ? Clause 5 of the fourteen points cannot be read with this motion. We cannot read into the mind of  President  Wilson when he penned these clauses, or into the minds of the Allied Governments when they adopted them, the declaration that the colonial Possessions of Germany should not be returned to her after the war. </para>

                        <para>- There is a second part to the motion. We are asked to affirm that &#34; in the consideration and determination of proposals affecting the destination of these islands Australia should be consulted.&#34; It is something new for these gentlemen on the Ministerial bench to contend that Australia should be consulted about things Australian. The argument with which we have been made familiar during the past few months, particularly in connexion with the conscription campaign, is that Australia should be consulted about nothing, and should be subservient to Britain. </para>

                        <para>- It is said that these islands are so nearly contiguous to Australia that their occupation - not by an enemy, because nobody supposes there will be any change in their occupation during a time of war, but by a Power with which at some time or other we may have been at war - would be a danger to the Commonwealth. The logical extension of that argument is that, wherever we possess territory we should obtain possession of adjacent or nearly contiguous territory, in order to protect it, and that thus we should run up our flag&#39; on the various small islands of the Pacific, declaring our right from propinquity to all, even those remotely associated with us geographically, until we have extended round the universe a chain of&#187; power curiously like that described by the not lamented Kaiser as World Power. </para>

                <para>One wonders what will he the danger to Australia arising from&#39; the possession by the German people of islands in the Pacific, if the objects for which this war has been waged are achieved. One of those objects was to make the world safe For Democracy. Now if the world is to be made safe for Democracy, it certainly follows that we must give effect-to another of  President  Wilson&#39;s fourteen points - the one relating to the reduction of armaments. Good headway has been made in this direction in the case of the Germanic Power. But before that result- .can be achieved, we had to accept the declaration, not only that there would be a reduction of armaments on the part of Germany, but that there would be a reduction of armaments on the part of all civilized Powers involved in this war. That is one of the provisions of the fourteen points laid down by  President  Wilson. Thus, although we of the Labour movement, and the Internationalist movement, view with intense pleasure the overthrow of German militarism, we recognise that the work which our soldiers have accomplished in that regard will -be largely unfruitful if it be .confined to one country, and does not apply to all the belligerent nations. If, therefore, full effect is to be. given to the points affirmed by  President  Wilson, it necessarily follows that not only will Germany be rendered harmless as a military Power, but that all the nations affected by the peace terms which are shortly to be adopted, will also be rendered incapable of inflicting misery on the world in the way that militarism has done in the past. </para>
                <para>If, then, the world is made safe for Democracy, what matters this resolution, which is based, as the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> would have us believe, on .considerations of safety. Suppose - and I do not advocate &#34; it - that these Pacific islands were to revert to Germany. Is it not perfectly clear that if effect be given to the peace terms, they cannot be used for any aggressive purpose? Words were recently used by a gentleman in Sydney, which deem to me to illuminate some of -the observations made by the honorable member for Grampians and others this evening. A little while ago the retention of what were called the &#34; Hun &#34; colonies was discussed by the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> Teece submitted a motion in that connexion, which was unanimously agreed to. That resolution reads -  </para>

                <para>It is perfectly evident that this resolution, so far as it can have any effect, will, if adopted, operate as an embarrassment to the British Government. It puts in respectful terms what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teece</inline> expressed in terms lacking respect. It affirms that the British Government have exhibited supineness in this matter. Does it not occur to honorable members opposite that  it is rather a paltry thing for us, before the war has. closed, and with the whole of the intricate questions of colonial adjustment about to be considered by the responsible authorities, to put forward our claim for territorial rights in connexion with islands which are contiguous to Australia? I say, further - and this is where the Government exhibit a lack of loyalty - that I am in complete accord with the resolution adopted by the Allies in connexion with colonial adjustments. If any honorable member opposite can describe my statement as a declaration of disloyalty, and can find fault with what President Wilson has said, and the Allies have adopted, it is quite open for him to do so. </para>

                        <para>- The Allies have adopted those fourteen points, as the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams)</inline> knows perfectly well, if he has followed the history of these important negotiations. As those points involve an impartial adjustment of all colonial claims. I am absolutely content to accept them, remembering, as I do, that  President  Wilson himself declared, at least once, that he believed in doing justice, not only to those to whom we wished to do justice, but also to those to whom we did not wish to do justice. I am willing to adopt a settlement of this colonial question on that basis, but I am not content here and now at a time when peace is being restored to the world to enter upon any kind of boycott that is to continue indefinitely, and to continue even when those who are now our enemies have ceased to be our enemies. That may be five years, ten years, or twenty years hence, but this Government implies that never at any time, although the war is over, and although they do not know what the terms of peace will be, is our attitude to alter. Although the Imperial Government and the Imperial Prime Minister himself has laid down the policy that there must be no such thing as mere useless punitive reprisals, although the Imperial Government is opposed to any of the absurd economic boycotts which were accepted at the Paris Conference largely through the folly of our Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> - although all these things have come to pass - we are pledging ourselves by this resolution at no time to vary our attitude in regard to colonial claims. We are not to be influenced by the fact of what kind of German Government we shall then be dealing with. </para>

                        <para>- Some of the honorable member&#39;s party on the Ministerial bench - the Minister for Recruiting <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Orchard),</inline> the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> the Minister in Charge&#39; of PriceFixing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> and the rest of the eligibles who tried to coerce and for some time succeeded in coercing men into taking a part in the war. I am sure that nobody is in a hurry to settle this momentous question ; but, at the same time, although I propose to have a good deal to say in regard to the adjustment of territorial claims and Imperial questions as they will arise after the war, I think I have sufficiently indicated my view of this motion. I was challenged by the acting Prime Minister to vote against the motion, and I was threatened that if I did so I would be represented outside this Parliament as being a spokesman for Germany and a supporter of German interests. Honorable members opposite have worked that gag for four and a half years. In the early stages of the war they sought, by a policy of publicity in the press and elsewhere, to browbeat the men who differed from them. Later, they found that the censorship was a more useful weapon than publicity, and they employed it. That, however,I hope, will soon be lifted, and, with it, the whole of the War Precautions Regulations and kindred measures. </para>

                <para>I leave the matter at this stage. I have shown why I propose to vote against the motion, why I think it will be a useless embarrassment to the British Government, and entirely out of harmony with the declaration of the  President  of the United States, &#34;whose armies were, as we know, a deciding factor, together with the internationalist movement in the Central Powers - coupled, of course, with the conspicuous valour of our own soldiers - in bringing the war to an end. The motion should not have been moved. It was moved only as part of the hysteria which Conservative Governments are wont to display on occasions such as the present. It would have been much better if we had trusted the Imperial Government, the  President  of the United States, and the better sense of those who are responsible in this matter, because it is one outside the Commonwealth of Australia. I hope that any matter that is distinctly Australian will in future be determined by the votes of the Australian Parliament, and will not be left to the decision of any outside Power, however friendly, even though it be the centre of the Empire itself. </para>

                    <para>. - I regard this motion as one of the most important ever brought forward in the history of this Parliament. I confess that I am not altogether in love with the second portion of it. In order to strengthen the hands of those who are working for us in the Old Country, it would be far better for us to say straight out that, in our opinion, New Guinea, at least, should remain portion of Australia&#39;s dominions. It was my privilege to hear some important discussions on the Pacific Islands question by Sir Samuel Griffith, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McGregor at the Federal Convention, and I believe that the most dangerous thing that could happen to Australia would be to have joint control of German New Guinea. Joint control was instituted in Samoa, with the result that Germany and Britain were on the verge of war on two separate occasions. With America and Germany invariably pulling together, Great Britain withdrew from the island in disgust, and allowed them to do as they chose. God forbid that we should have in New Guinea a repetition of what happened under joint control in Samoa. In regard to all these matters that affect the best interests of Australia, it is far better for us to say what we think. What are the nations which would be entitled to joint control in the Pacific, including New Guinea? The only nations that have direct commercial interests in the Pacific are Great Britain, the United States, and Japan. </para>

                        <para>- I am not frightened by that. bogy. If the acquisition of territory will assist to prevent Australia being involved in future turmoil, and threats of war,&#39; I am quite prepared to accept it. I do not believe that it would be to the commercial advantage of Australia to take possession of New Guinea. The Lord knows that we have made a big enough bungle with the territories we already control. Bearing in mind our experience with the Northern Territory and Papua, for any one to say that the acquisition of a big slice of New Guinea would be an instance of territorial greed, and a desire to make some profit out of the war, is to ignore our own history.I appreciate very much the difficulties which beset the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> in his desire that the Imperial Government should not &#39;be embarrassed by this discussion; but I think that the hands of the Imperial Government would be strengthened if we passed a resolution to the effect that it was in the best interests of Australia that that portion of New Guinea captured from the enemy should be held under the British flag. What is meant by the intimation that Australia should be consulted? It is just one of those indefinite ideas which must always fail. Just imagine what would be the position if, when the Conference sat down to discuss this important matter, some one suddenly reminded the Conference that they had to consult Australia on this subject. Whom should they consult? It is true that we have in England the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who, I believe, is doing his best in the interests of Australia, and that we have also the High Commissioner to represent our interests there ; but neither of them is nearly so well able to sound the national feelings of Australia in connexion with this matter as the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I can quite understand that some honorable members should object to majority rule when they are not in the majority; but some one must voice Australian opinion, and what body can so well do this as the National Parliament? I am certain, at all events, that this Parliament has a much greater authority to do this than the Perth Labour Conference. . The members of this Parliament must be regarded as the custodians of the National interests of Australia; and I repeat that, instead of passing a dilettante motion, which expresses the opinion that Australia should be consulted, it would be much better to say straight out just what we mean. If a majority in this Parliament consider it is in the best interests of Australia that the British flag should fly over German New Guinea, let us say so straight out. If an amendment had been moved to this effect I certainly should have supported it, but I do not think we would now succeed in carrying it. I believe that Australia could deal with this problem of German New Guinea much more efficiently than is possible under a joint control as the Prime Minister has suggested. There has been no joint control, in the history of the world, which has been successful or for the benefit of the country concerned. Joint control has always been a source of difficulty and danger, as in the case of Samoa, which, on two separate occasions, brought two of the greatest nations in the world to the verge of war. I think it is  my solemn duty to utter a warning that this House would be making a great mistake if it passed any motion which might be construed by the Conference as an expression that we favour a joint control of German New Guinea. </para>

                        <para>.- I am  reluctant to occupy the time of the House on the motion for adjournment, but, as I rarely do so unless the matter is urgent, I claim the forbearance of honorable members. On Thursday last, I had occasion to ask the following questions of the Attorney-General: -  1.Is it a fact that a member of the Commonwealth Police Force by the name of Wilson has been sent to Bourke to collect information against W. Anderson, an organizer of the Australian Workers Union? </para>

                    <para class="block">Recently a member of the Commonwealth Police Force was sent to the district of Bourke, and also to Multagoona, to interview <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baird,</inline> the manager or owner of that station. Certain information was collected, and I have no doubt a report was furnished to the Attorney-General or the Crown Solicitor. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson,</inline> the organizer referred to, is to stand his trial in Sydney on the 14th of this month, and, as a matter of fact, he was tried in a like case in Sydney. It appears that a number of men are not members of the union, and that the organizer took certain steps which are provided for in the constitution of the Australian Workers Union, which is registered under the Arbitration and Conciliation laws of this country. A strike or dislocation of the industry occurred, but it did not last long. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> was prosecuted and found not guilty. Further steps have been taken by the pastoralists to, if possible, impose a penalty or imprisonment upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson,</inline> whose case was to be tried by a jury in Bourke on the 14th instant. The reason I bring the matter up is that hostilities having ceased there is no longer any need for the operation of War Precautions Regulation 213, which was passed last year, dealing with the stoppage of work in wool sheds and such like matters, under which the proposed action is to be taken. I say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> has already had a sufficient trial, and is standing another trial to-day. The Government can, in the circumstances, very well exercise leniency, and I appeal to the Attorney-General, and ask him whether it is not possible for the Government to cancel whatever orders have been given in this matter. If they persist in going on with the prosecution of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson,</inline> it will amount to a persecution. The evidence which has been collected by the special constable has, I  believe, been transmitted, and orders have been given for the prosecution, but the Attorney-General can at this late stage exercise leniency a d mercy. I appeal to him to cause an inquiry to be made into the matter. I am sure that he will find that the facts of the case are not such that any further prosecution of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> is necessary. The need for such a. prosecution no longer exists since hostilities have ceased. It will be merciful, and I believe it will be wise - and I do not use the phrase in any threatening sense, because I recognise the many things with which the Government have to deal at the present time - if the Attorney-General will decide not to take any further steps in this matter. </para>

                        <para>.- On the 6th of this month I asked a number of questions with reference to the greater use of tonnage on the Australian coast. I asked whether the Controller of Shipping some time ago referred to the u n suitableness of the steam-ship <inline font-style="italic">Merimbida</inline> for the Interstate trade, on the ground of her bunker space being insufficient. The Controller said that he had made a statement that the <inline font-style="italic">Merimbula</inline> had very small bunker accommodation and a large consumption of coal considering her size, the effect being that if sufficient coal were taken to last a reasonably short Inter-State voyage it would encroach upon her lifting power to such an extent that she would be able to carry only a small quantity of cargo and hardly sufficient to warrant her being employed Inter-State.

                    <para class="block">I have since received a letter telling and that this statement is utterly misleading, and that, asa matter of fact, the charterer did not return the ship to her owners, but that she was commandeered by the Controller of Shipping. If that statement be correct, some explanation of the matter is due to the House by the Controller of Shipping. This House cannot main tain any control of the Public Service if officers of the Service are to mislead it. I am sure that the very straightforward Minister in charge of this Department will be one of the first to admit that public officers should give only accurate information in reply to questions asked in this House. I believe the information supplied to me is correct, because i t is supported by what I was told by another honorable member, who is in receipt of the same information from an entirely different quarter. I should like the Minister to make a determined effort to put a stop to this sort of thing. . </para>
                    <para>Mr.POYNTON (Grey- Assistant Minister for the Navy) &#91;11.17&#93;. - I cannot accept the concluding remarks of the honorable member. From his statement &#34;that I should make a determined effort to put an end to this sort of thing, one would think that the kind of thing of which he complains is continually happening. I have told the honorable member already that I have received a letter similar to that which he has himself received. </para>

                            <para>- I had taken steps to investigate this matter long before the honorable member mentioned i&#163; to me. If he had come to rae in the first place, I would have told him what I did subsequently tell him. I strongly resent this practice of springing matters upon the House instead of going to the Minister interested, and giving him a chance to find out whether there is any foundation for the complaint made. I told the honorable member before he spoke to-night what I had done. I think that should have been sufficient for him, if I am the straightforward Minister he  speaks  of. But yet the honorable member springs the matter upon me in this way. What I am doing is not being done because of what the honorable member has said here, as I had already instituted an inquiry. As soon as I know the result, I will comply with the request of the man who wrote to me, and if the statement made is incorrect I will mention lt on the floor of the House. </para>

I want to put it on record that I had submitted a question to you, sir, on this very matter earlier this evening before T saw the Minister. I told the Minister that I had submitted the . question, and that I intended to refer to it upon the adjournment. And I received no objection on the part of the Minister then. But, apparently thinking that I was cut out from the opportunity &#34;to reply, the Minister. </para>
