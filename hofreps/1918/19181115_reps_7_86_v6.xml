                            <para>- A week or two ago the Minister for Repatriation, in a letter to the Commission, drew attention to the fact that soldiers would shortly be returning, and asked that steps might be taken to secure their employment on any works in connexion with the Murray waters scheme. The agreement provides that construction work shall be carried out by the States concerned, who are referred to as the &#34; constructing authorities.&#34; Immediately upon receipt of this letter I communicated with each of the three States involved, bringing under their notice the request of the Minister for Repatriation that soldiers should be considered in connexion with any of the construction schemes contemplated. The Commission has already on two occasions, brought before the constructing authorities. the desirableness of pushing on all works. Under the agreement the State authorities have to submit plans, specifications, details, and estimates to the Commission for consideration, and the Commission &#34; having approved of them the works are then carried out by the State constructing authorities. We are asking the constructing authorities to expedite the submission of the contemplated schemes. South Australia has already almost completed the submission of the big scheme known as the Lake Victoria storage. The Governments of Victoria and New South Wales have had their surveyors at work inspecting various sites, and I understand that they are now determining the site for a storage on the Tipper Murray. I am also informed that they have under consideration the question of the construction of some weirs. I shall draw the attention of the constructing authorities to the honorable member&#39;s request, with a view to all expedition being shown in the construction of the works mentioned in the agreement. </para>

                                <para>- There are various brands of Democrats. I do not pretend that the members of the Government come within the honorable member&#39;s category. God forbid that we should. As to the meaning of &#34;Social Democracy,&#34; the interpretations of that much-abused phrase are legion. In one sense we are Social Democrats,sincewe hope to hold out, as we have been doing, to human nature nearest the ground a chance to rise. We hope to ameliorate the conditions of mankind, although not in the same way as the honorable member who has interjected. Tha honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> may rest assured that the democratic policy of the Government will be prosecuted as vigorously in the future as it has been in the past. </para>

                        <para>I have the honour to acknowledge your cordial message delivered by the head of the French Mission, General Pau. Australia feels proud to receive the congratulations of your brave and noble nation. The admiration and gratitude which you are generous enough to express to Australia for the valour of her troops now fighting in the cause of liberty and justice on French soil will find pleasurable acceptance by all classes of the community. Our returning soldiers are full of praise of the French people for their great sacrifices, and of admiration of their French comrades- in-arms for their heroic deeds and steadfast courage. Australians feel that centuries cannot repay the debt the world owes patient, undaunted France. We read with peculiar pleasure your assurance that the- peoples of France and Australia are animated by the same ideals and aspirations and the same fraternal sympathy. May I be permitted to express the hope that this sentiment will develop into an indissoluble bond, of free nations, tending to the maintenance of peace and civilization? </para>

                            <para>- I was not aware until the honorable gentleman drew my attention to the fact that an extension of the arrangement which has existed for some time is being proposed by the Queensland authorities. I assume that the honorable member is taking steps to test the accuracy of the statement. Recently it came to the notice of the Government that the authorities in New Zealand were endeavouring to secure an extension of the meat contract with Britain for that Dominion. I at once cabled to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and told him that similar steps should be .taken for Australia for two reasons: First, in order that the outlet for Australian meat might not be prejudiced by any pre-contracts made with another Dominion; and second, because, if there were an extension of the contract with New Zealand and not with Australia, a vast amount of tonnage which we needed for other purposes would be diverted from Australia to New Zealand. I asked the Prime Minister to make due representations with a view to ascertaining that, in future, any contracts made are through the Commonwealth Government, and not through a State Government. </para>

I have already informed that honorable member that all steps are being taken to secure the desired end, first by fixing the price of all new bran bags arriving in Australia ; and, secondly, by licensing dealers in second-hand bags. If a second-hand dealer indulges in the practice that has obtained in the past in regard to the handling of second-hand bags, and refuses to do the fair thing by carrying out the instructions of the Government in regard to price, his licence w;ll be immediately cancelled. If it is necessary the Government will take possession of the bags and distribute them on hiss behalf. </para>

As the honorable member knows, strong pressure was brought to bear on the Government not to engage unnecessarily in public works, and on, those representations the Government have acted. At the same time, all requests that have been made are being expedited. </para>

It may be necessary for them to fulfil their present duties; but the Board of Trade has recently &#39;been considering at length some of the questions to which the honorable member refers, including the influence of the stoppage of the war on new and existing industries. In a short time the Government hope to be able to give an assurance to the House as to the policy which will be followed. </para>

The Acting Prime Minister will see that it is clearly designed, both in its illustrations and letterpress, to create feeling on the part of returning soldiers against men in this country who have not enlisted. Now that an armistice has been arranged, I ask whether this action on the part of the Recruiting Department has the approval of the Cabinet as a whole, and whether they propose to persist in the distribution of this publication. </para>

In1917-18 camps of training for 8 days only were ordered. &#34; In 1918-19, all units are required to serve in camp for 24 days. This makes a total of 32 days in the two years. In the case of Artillery and Engineer units and Army Service Corps units allotted to those arms, the training is 18 days short of the requirements for two years. Under the circumstances, and in view of the backward condition of training, it is considered inadvisable to reduce the training this year. </para>

                <para class="block">As honorable members will see, this is a request to them to extend the days of sitting by one day per week until the session closes, shorty before Christmas. The Government can give no indication at present as to whether it will be possible for us then to prorogue or not. Should disorder continue in Germany, and the assembling of the Peace Conference be delayed, in all probability it may be necessary&#34; for us merely to rise for the Christmas vacation, and remain summonable in accordance with the practice which has obtained during the progress of the war. On- that point none of us can do more than express conjectures at this stage. But if Parliament is asked to assemble after Christmas to deal with problems arising out of the peace settlement, it will be a most cheerful assembling, aud I am sure honorable members will most willingly attend. In the. meantime, in order that we may dispose of a number of matters already on the notice paper, which are essential for the proper legislative- government of Australia, as well as one or two other matters it will- be - necessary for the Government to introduce, honorable members are asked to give this&#176; extra day of service. I am not in a position to indicate very definitely what those other matters may be, but it is becoming increasingly plain from the situation arising out of the recent judgments of the Arbitration Court that at least some action will be necessary on our part if we desire to safeguard the arbitration system and awards already in existence. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but whether it will be structural or vital I am not able to say at present. A Bill dealing with the matter will, in all probability, be recommended by the Acting Attorney-General. In addition, a problem which the Minister for Repatriation has been developing foi some considerable time in relation to the building of houses on liberal terms for returned soldiers who are married, or who, after return, will marry, will be brought before the House. These matters, together with the business already on the notice-paper, should take up all the time we can devote to them if honorable members are to get away in sufficient time to enable them to reach their homes in the more remote States before Christmas. I hope that this motion will be agreed to without discussion and unanimously, as an indication to the country that we are prepared to do our job as well as the circumstances of the present time demand that we should. </para>

                    <para>. - I have . no objection to the House meeting on four days a week, but I claim that it will be absolutely impossible to deal with all the matters that are down on the notice-paper for our consideration in the four weeks available to us if honorable members are to leave in time to reach their homes before Christmas. <inline font-style="italic">Not</inline> one speech, except the Treasurer&#39;s, has been delivered on the Budget, one of the mo3t important matters that can be dealt with by this House, and there has been no discussion on the departmental Estimates. These are two matters to each of which a week could very well be devoted. Then there are three financial proposals on the notice paper, two of them being interwoven with the Budget, the Land Tax Bill, and the Income Tax Bill. These must be got out of the way. The War Loan Subscriptions Bill may not be a controversial measure, but the proposed amendment to the Repatriation Act will be a mo3t important measure. The honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> asked a question this morning about the placing of repatriation on a more business-like basis.

                        <para>- That is very likely, but we have said it in one or two places with effect. The Repatriation Bill which is to be introduced in another place must be dealt with. Then there are. two Bills dealing with industrial matters. The Assistant Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> has given notice of one which will deal with shipbuilding, and go to the very foundation of our industrial conditions. Of course, we do not know the contents of the measure, but from various speeches which have been delivered we have gathered that the Government intend to contract themselves out of the Arbitration Act. It seems as if the Government intend to say to private employers, &#34;You must obey the Arbitration Act, but the Government intend to contract themselves out of it.&#34; There is to be also an amendment of the Arbitration Act, arid we were told in the Ministerial statement that the Government propose to introduce a Bill to put price fixing upon a more permanent basis. The eight or nine Bills I have mentioned, together with the Estimates, will more than keep Parliament occupied if they are to have fair discussion. I offer no objection to Parliament sitting on an extra day each week, but if we do that I think that we should adjourn before 11 or 11.30 at night. Working for such long hours is too strenuous for honorable members, and particularly for Ministers, as they, no doubt, will discover. </para>

                    <para>.&#39;- I offer no objection to the motion, but I think that the Acting Prime Minister might have given honorable members a little more notice of it. Many of us will return to other States tonight, and we have made business appointments for Tuesday. To be told to-day, for the first time, that the House is to meet on. Tuesday is altogether too brief a notice. I realize that there is a lot of work to be done, and I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether this motion is a prelude to giving private members an opportunity of dealing with some of the motions which they have placed upon the notice-paper. I have on the business paper a notice of motion dealing with the Constitution, and the Acting Prime Minister, during my absence, promised the honorable member for Illawarra that he would consider the &#39;desirability of setting aside one day for its discussion. </para>

                        <para>- Consideration is the policy of the Government. I say quite candidly that the Government seem to do very little else but consider things. &#39;If an honorable member asks a question he is told that some Board has been applied to, that the Board  ha3  reported to somebody else, and that the matter is receiving consideration. I am tired of so much consideration, and the only thing that has prevented me from saying so more frankly is the knowledge of the great responsibilities carried on the shoulders of Ministers. </para>

The honorable gentleman is now free of the awful burden he has been carrying, and carrying very well, during the time he has been in office, and now that the war is practically ended, a change must come over the spirit of the dream. We must have legislation by Parliament instead of by means of the War Precautions Act, and honorable members must be made responsible instead of power being given to irresponsible Boards.

                        <para>- The Acting Prime Minister has said that the Government have sought the advice of a lot of business men. We hope that more time will be given to honorable members, so that we may show that the Government were rather dilatory in calling in that assistance, and that, in consequence, some awful messes have been made. I shall not vote against the motion, because I think that we ought to stay here and do our work. But men living in Melbourne ought to give some consideration to honorable members who reside 500 miles away. We ought to meet earlier on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, in order to cope with the work. I am prepared to sit even on Mondays, because it is desirable that we should have more opportunity for bringing about necessary changes in the administration.  I am opposed to government being carried on for one day longer under the War Precautions Act, because the legislation and work of the country should be done by the men who are responsible to the people. </para>

                            <para>. - This motion is of tremendous import to the future of Australia, and I am unable to understand the suggestion of some honorable members that it ought to have been put and carried without debate. I am doubtful whether the time is opportune for such a motion to be submitted. At this period of national excitement and intoxication, we have not the point of view sufficiently clear to enable us to approach these matters with the calm and cold reasoning they deserve, and I am somewhat in doubt as to the reason why the Government have introduced this very important proposal at this juncture. The proposal is one that demands most serious consideration, because it is committing Australia to a policy and an attitude which will mean very much to the economic and political future of the Commonwealth. As far as I could understand from the able speech delivered by the Acting Prime Minister, to which I listened with considerable pleasure, there are only two reasons actuating him in submitting the proposal. He said much about the evils of Germany, its bad conduct and unreliability, all of which seemed to be beside the question, because those things are incontrovertible. Honorable members are in no doubt as to Germany&#39;s misconduct, cruelty, and barbarism, but those things do not constitute a sufficient reason for the introduction of such a motion at this time. Therefore, I was forced to the conclusion that the Government had one of two objects in mind, and I think the first I shall mention is the more reasonable and particular, namely, that the Government think it necessary that the Prime Minister should be fortified in the attitude he is adopting at the present time in Great Britain by a resolution of Parliament bearing on this matter. There was another suggestion in the Acting Prime Minister&#39;s speech, which I regretted to hear, and on reading it in print this morning it seemed even worse than it sounded yesterday. </para>

                    <para class="block">It was quite gratuitous and unworthy for the Acting Prime Minister to associate in such a direct fashion opposition to German rule, cruelty, and ill-treatment of the native populations with the attitude of the Opposition towards this motion. Honorable members will recollect that I interjected at the time that the motion was a loaded gun aimed at the Opposition in order to try to place us in difficulties. Unfortunately, we have had too much reason to suspect motions such as this when submitted by the Government. Occasionally, at any rate, the Government seem anxious to put us in a wrong light with the public. </para>

                            <para>- If this is the psychological time, there was no need for the Prime Minister to make such a reflection upon members of the Opposition, whose attitude would be discovered in good time. The suggestion that we might not vote for the motion, and by voting against it might appear to support the ill treatment of native populations by the Germans, was an unworthy and gratuitous insult to us. I am tired of answering reproaches and questions about my loyalty, and I do not bother about the loyalty or disloyalty of my honorable friends opposite. The Government may rest assured that whatever their virtues may be,&#39;they do not advertise them by proclaiming our vices. If their claim to loyalty depends on their  exposure of what they call our disloyalty, they are not on very sound ground. 1 regret that the Acting Prime Minister saw fit to make the reference to which I have taken exception. The acceptance by Australia of additional territory, and the responsibility of controlling native populations, is a matter of so much importance that we should approach its consideration without party feeling. I think that every honorable member, without exception, is actuated by the sincere idea to do the best possible for this country. Whatever may be our personal predilections for other countries, we are all sound Australians, and the future of the Commonwealth is our most intimate and serious concern. </para>

                    <para>If the motion is designed to support the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> in the attitude which he is taking in Great Britain, it is understandable. Whether we should agree with that attitude or not is another matter. In May last, when passing through America, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> mads a stirring speech, to which I called attention here on the 11th June. That speech has now come to be known as the &#34; Hands Off the Pacific &#34; speech. I do not so much object to the policy therein expressed regarding foreign interference in the Pacific, as to the attitude assumed by the Prime Minister in stating it. I do not object to the doctrine itself, but I object to a member of this Government adopting an attitude obviously embarrassing to the Imperial Government, and I said so in June last. I am so conscious of the tremendous burden of responsibility that the Imperial Government have been carrying during the war, that I think we should give it all the help we can to enable it to bring the struggle to a successful end. Anything that would embarrass or hinder negotiations with our Allies, or retard a successful conclusion of the war, is to be deprecated. Judging by the statements of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, of the Prime Ministers of our Allies, and of the  President  of the United States, the future control of the Pacific, and the disposal of the captured German Possessions in various parts of the world, is to be considered when the terms of peace come up for discussion. But our Prime Minister, before he could enter the inner Imperial Council to which he was invited, took upon himself to state on behalf of Australia, a definite policy, and adopted an uncompromising attitude in regard to the questions that he was invited to discuss. I submit, as I did in June last, that that &#39;attitude was not a fair one for him to take in regard to the Imperial Government, or in regard to the Prime Minister&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">confreres</inline> in the Imperial Conference. </para>
                    <para>I have two reasons for supporting the motion, which seem to me all-sufficient. The first is that it should induce the Imperial Government to join with us in repairing the huge and grievous blunder made in 1883, when the Colonial Office refused to ratify the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Mcllwraith, then Premier of Queensland, in annexing Papua. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Mcllwraith had information which led him to believe that Germany had designs on that territory, and he determined to forestall a German annexation. But his wise and statesmanlike foresight was not acceptable to the Foreign Office. </para>

                            <para>- I am convinced that the Imperial Government is even better seized of its seriousness than we are, because it takes much wider views concerning not only the future of Australia, but also the future of the chain of communications between the various British Possessions encircling the globe. If, by passing the motion, we assure the Imperial Government that we wish to be intimately associated with them in repairing the blunder that was made some years ago, I am thoroughly in favour of it. Germany will not be a welcome neighbour in any part of the world for many years to come ; she will certainly not be a welcome neighbour in any of the islands near Australia. She has, no doubt, by expelling the Hohenzollern .dynasty, gone a long way towards rehabilitating herself in the good opinion of the nations of the world, but it will take many long years before the German people can convince the other peoples of the world that there is in them a change of heart and policy, as well as a change in the form of government. We shall require practical and incontrovertible evidence of their change of heart. But the change of government that has occurred is the best guarantee for the regeneration of Germany, and we may sincerely hope that she will eventually rehabilitate herself in the esteem of the nations. </para>

                            <para>- No. I regret the means, but I am entirely in sympathy with the end. I think that Germany has now started along the road to a position where she may associate with the free, liberty-loving nations of the world. While the Hohenzollerns were in power she had no hope of occupying that position. I wonder whether we shall be ready to receive the evidence of her change of mind when the German people are ready to exhibit it - the evidence of a genuine love of liberty and of a desire to live in economic industrial and political association with the nations of the world? </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but it took time for our nation to reach the point that it has reached, and we have not yet worked out our full salvation. For that reason we should give sympathetic consideration to those who are on their way towards the position we have attained. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> this morning prayed for the forgiveness of our sins as we forgive others, I could not help thinking that if we are to be forgiven only as we are prepared to forgive Germany, the forgiveness that we shall receive will not be of much account. I declare myself ready, so soon as Germany gives evidence of a change of heart, to concede her whatever consideration may be possible equally with other nations,butuntil we have that evidence she must understand clearly and distinctly that her company is not seriously wanted. </para>

                            <para>- I think so; but they are not the sentiments of the British Government. I indulge the fervent hope that the people of the United Kingdom may have a &#34; say &#34; in these matters before long. Perhaps the general election which is foreshadowed may bring about such a change in the attitude of the Government that Great Britain will become much more nearly a Democracy than she has been hitherto. </para>

                    <para>Another reason why I support the motion is that it declares that in the consideration and determination of proposals affecting the destination of these islands Australia should be consulted. I hold that Australia should be consulted in every matter in which its interests are so directly concerned as they are in the determination and final disposal of the Pacific Possessions lately held by Germany, and now under the control of Australian, New Zealand, and Allied Forces. We have made great progress of recent years in this direction. At one time the wishes and desires of Australia were not thought worthy of consideration, but since 1907 various Imperial Conferences have brought us much nearer to a close and intimate partnership with the rest of the Empire in regard to matters of mutual concern and interest. We are now practically taken into the consultations of the </para>
                    <para class="block">Imperial Government in all these matters of general concern. When our representatives returned from the last Imperial Conference, we had given to us the statement that the British Government had been absolutely frank and open in discussing with them matters of Imperial concern. That is of great importance to us, since, if Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the other Dominions are expected to stand in with the Imperial authorities, in war and peace, it must be recognised that responsibilities must include privileges. &#34;If we are to have burdens imposed upon us because of the Empire&#39;s responsibilities, then it follows - and it is well that this has been recognised - that we should be taken into consultation in the determination of how those burdens may be best arranged and borne. </para>

I support it, and I hope that it is something more than the doctrine of self-preservation. I hope that we are in the British Empire, and willing to accept our responsibilities as a part of that Empire from a much higher motive than the desire&#34; to save our own skins and to secure an advantage to ourselves.

                    <para class="block">Empire&#39;s concerns are our concerns; that an injury to one is an injury to all, then the perfectly logical and reasonable concomitant is that the Imperial Government should take the Dominions into their innermost consultations and considerations. Obviously, these things can be done only when we have the fullest confidence in each other, and are prepared to associate to the fullest extent. I do not think we have anything to complain of now in regard to the Imperial authorities taking Australia into consultation. The Imperial Government, of recent years particularly, have evinced a desire to give full consideration to the point of view of the Dominions. This shows that we are approaching, in a far more real fashion than ever before, the absolute unity of the British Empire. If we can establish such a unity of ideas and association of interests in the British Empire, we may be able some day to extend it, and to make the League of Nations now suggested a real, practical, satisfactory entity. The Imperial Government today stand in a different relationship towards the Dominions than ever they did before. I am so anxious to preserve that good feeling which has been engendered, and has drawn us so closely together during this war, that I regret that there should be anything said, either on behalf, or apparently on behalf, of Australia to cause any danger of disruption. The two reasons I have suggested - that this will give us an opportunity to repair the blunder of 3883, and that it means that Australia only expresses the wish that she shall be consulted in regard to all these matters - will induce me to vote for this motion in the most whole-hearted manner. I wish to point out, however, how these matters develop our association. The Imperial attitude in regard to this war has been one that from the very beginning I have most heartily approved. I expressed myself at the beginning of the war as being in entire accord with the attitude adopted by the British Government, and- 1 believe in that attitude today as strongly as I did then. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Grey stated the British reasons for entering the war in terms that could not but commend them to every right-thinking member of the community. The Imperial attitude throughout has left little ground for equivocation, unless it be in respect of a few unfortunate instances. The one thing that has been stated clearly from the beginning to the end is that, whatever our war aims were, territorial acquisition was not one of them ; that we were not in this war to secure territory, or for anything that we could get out of it. It has been also stated, with equal emphasis, that we were not in the war because of any hatred or opposition to the German people. I have here one or two extracts from statements on the subject made by leading British statesmen - by such men as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Grey, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith,</inline> and Lord Bryce. Each and all of them have said that our reasons for entering the war did not include any specific objections or opposition to the people of Germany. Our objections were only to the system that the Germans, unfortunately for themselves, supported. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> said - </para>

                            <para>- I am aware of that, but let us be fair. We know how absolutely essential it is, and must be, to  every big nation to have oversea colonies. In the case of Germany it was absolutely necessary to her economic development not only that she might secure supplies of raw materials necessary for her industries, but that she might find new markets for her manufactures. We are therefore faced with the proposition that at the Peace table the question of the future of the captured German Possessions must come up for consideration. Are we to approach the Peace table with demands or are we prepared to consider the future of our own nation only to &#39;the absolute exclusion of the interests of other people? I do not know that we can cavil because it is probable that no direct Australian representative may be at the Peace table. I have the fullest confidence that the Imperial authorities are so desirous of meeting the wishes of the Dominions, and so anxious to show their appreciation of our services during the war, that our interests will be sufficiently well protected by them. I cannot conceive why the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes should be complaining, as he is doing, that he was not consulted in regard to the armistice, and that he may not be consulted in regard to the peace terms. The Imperial Government War Cabinet has held a number of sittings at which he and the representatives of the other Dominions have been present. The Imperial authorities are quite cognisant of our wishes in regard to quite a number of matters, so far as Germany and other enemy Powers are concerned, and there is ho doubt as to our wishes in regard to the German Possessions in the Pacific. Therefore, I think that, if we, by this motion, were to convey the impression that we insisted on a certain thing, either by direct representatives at the Peace table, or by indirect instructions, so far as we might be able to give them, at an Imperial Conference, we would only court trouble, and delay negotiations in a way that might perhaps result in an unsatisfactory settlement. If Australia claims direct representation at the Peace table - or if it had claimed direct representation in regard to the armistice, in regard to which the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes)</inline> complains - we must admit that all the other Dominions, not only of the British Empire, but of all the Allied Powers, have an equal right. </para>

                            <para>- No;  but if the honorable member had heard the whole of my argument, which I am trying to put in sequence, he would have heard me urge that the reason for the introduction of this motion, particularly at this juncture, can only be because the Government think it necessary to fortify the Prime Minister in England by an expression of opinion from this House. I do not think that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is really representing the attitude of Australia in his statements at the present time. Why, he is &#39;even threatening the Imperial Government, in telling them that they will have to use force against Australia if they wish to adopt certain proposals. </para>

                            <para>- But the danger is that there are not only the German Possessions in the Pacific, but also Possessions in other parts of the world that are of immense importance to the future safety and security of the British Empire. And it is not only the British Empire we have to consider; we have to think of French interests - of the security and safety of the French nation in the future. We have to think of all those nations who stood by us so splendidly, and with whom we have been in such close association during the last four years. All those interests have to be considered, and the discussion approached from no preconceived rigid point of- view, but with an open mind and a desire to achieve a satisfactory and mutually helpful result. But if we support the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> in his demand, and in his emphatic attitude, it will not help the British representatives or the representatives of other nations to approach the problem from the point of view that I think is necessary. </para>

                    <para>Our interests in the Pacific are bound to increase as the years go by. It is essential, and certainly most useful in our interests, that we should have direct association with those other nations that have equally important interests in the Pacific. For instance, I think that New Zealand is even more closely associated with us than hitherto in Pacific matters. New Zealand was invited to join with us in an Australasian, rather than an Australian, naval policy, but at that time she was not prepared to sacrifice what she regarded as her individual interests, and merge them in the interests of Australia. It i3 to be hoped that New Zealand has had a vision of what the future may mean, not to us and to themselves alone, but to them and us in association with other parts of the Empire, and also with the United States, with whom I hope we all desire to perpetuate the most kindly and fraternal relations. If this war has brought British peoples together - has brought the English-speaking peoples together - it may prove a very useful and satisfactory event. </para>
                    <para>When we think of the interests that New Zealand has in the Pacific - the rights that have to be protected and the work of development that has to be undertaken and of our own and American interests there, is it not clear that negotiations either direct, or through the Imperial authorities, ought to be opened with a view to a combination, not only for defence, but for developmental purposes ? </para>
                    <para>But there is another nation interested in the Pacific. The captured German Possessions north of the Equator are at present held by an Allied power, but only temporarily. The ultimate destination of these Possessions has also to be determined at the Peace Conference; and we have to consider how our associations with New  Zealand, the United States, Japan, and to a certain extent also with Prance, are to be so arranged that the future will hold for all of us that security and safety which we are told forms the reason for the submission of the motion. The safety and security of the Commonwealth is the primary consideration of every honorable member, and we desire to develop this country on the best and highest lines. If we insure this, not by ourselves alone, but in association with other equally interested nations, we shall secure freedom from war and international trouble for the southern seas. </para>

There are some places in the Pacific that are liable to cause trouble. It is time Fiji was taken under the control of either Australia or New Zealand The condition of affairs there is a scandal to the British Government, and if we are not very careful it may at any time bring about trouble between Australia and India. Honorable members are to some extent well aware of what is happening in Fiji. </para>

We ought to assure the Mother Country that we would endeavour to do our duty in these places in accordance with the highest ideals of British justice and liberty. That is how I would approach the matter. Australia already has more land than we know what to do with, and if we appear anxious to grab these Pacific possessions from the territory point of view, seeing that with our population of 5,000,000 people, we already hold a continent, we may lay ourselves open to objections from other countries. </para>

For these reasons, if the Imperial Government .at the Peace table should determine to ask Australia to take control of New Guinea or any other part of the Pacific, we should give the proposal our most sympathetic consideration with a view to taking our share of the burden of Empire - the white man&#39;s burden of looking after the natives of these islands, so that they may be used to their own advantage and not to our regret. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is quite wrong. My complaint about Fiji is that there has been no shouldering of the burden. I am urging that some one should accept the burden and control Fiji in order to get rid of the troubles that unfortunately exist there at the present time, due to the fact that Fiji is a Crown Colony, and is not under the direct administration of people who are intimately associated with it, such as are the people of Australia and New Zealand.. If Australia or New Zealand had- control of Fiji the scandals that have occurred there would not continue. It is because I am anxious that all these outposts of the Empire should be under the direct administration of the people who are most intimately concerned in them that I am prepared to say that if the Peace Conference should ask Australia to take charge of New Guinea, Fiji, or any other place in association with the United States of America, Canada, or- New Zealand, in order to guarantee the safety and security of the Pacific, I would be prepared to accept the trust imposed upon us. </para>

                            <para>.- The honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> has given us a speech which is at once moderate, practical, and instructive, and I am glad to be able to congratulate him on the fact that he has also been able to put such an immense distance between himself and some honorable members upon his side of the House, who appear to be desirous of achieving the distinction of being friends of every country but their own. The honorable member has been quite orthodox in his attitude towards Germany, and in only one small respect can any objection be taken to the position he has assumed in that regard. He has quoted to us - probably his national training led him in that direction - the very highest Authority we have in regard to forgiveness of those who trespass against us. I remind the honorable member that the same Authority has indicated very plainly that He cannot forgive unless forgiveness is first asked. When the German people show signs of regret for the course they have taken, when they give us an indication of their desire to make amends as far as practicable, and when they ask for forgiveness, I feel sure the British nation as a whole will not withstand such an appeal. </para>

When he tells us that we may take the Germans straightway to our bosoms he is &#39; evincing a generosity for which he surely does not wish us to give him credit. If I understand his attitude aright in regard to some other peoples of the world, it is one of absolute unforgiveness under any conditions. He has shown that to be his attitude ever since he has entered the House. The .honorable member may be reminded of a saying of a man whom, I feel sure, he holds in very high regard.

It is one which can be accurately diagnosed and traced. It is the result of browsing on the poisonous products of . certain addle-pated theorists, mostly of German origin, who, when war was declared, took the earliest opportunity of showing that they themselves disbelieved in their own theories. There is only one remedy that I can suggest for the honorable member, but it is too drastic to be applied to any one. Australia and the honorable member&#39;s kith and kin have been saved its infliction by that very Imperialism, with its policy of conscription, which the honorable member has denounced. The remedy is a taste of the German fiendishness that has been perpetrated on other countries by that very German working class which, in German uniforms, has devastated Belgium. </para>

                                <para>- I was about to remark that there were in other Parliaments when the war broke out, especially in that of Belgium, many members holding ideas quite similar to those expressed by the honorable member for Barrier - men who. had been fed for many years on a diet of German internationalism and class war until they were unable to see the ordinary affairs of life other than in relation to those two doctrines. For some years before the war those members of the Belgian Parliament had had dinned into their ears by military authorities and others the imminent danger to Belgium from Germany. They had been told of the steps Germany was taking to desolate their country with overwhelming armies. Their attention was directed to elaborate and extensive railway systems, with equipment for the transport of large bodies of troops to the Belgian frontier at places where there, was no justification other than a military one for such works. They were reminded of the necessity for keeping their armies and their defences in the highest state of efficiency, but, obsessed with ideas imbibed from German sources, they believed that the .proletariat of Germany, their &#34;comrades&#34; of the working, class in that country, would prevent any such dangers coming upon their nation. The result was that when Germany precipitated her armies on Belgium the country was quite unprepared to resist. The soldiers were few in number, poorly armed, and the fortifications were defective. Did the German working-class soldiers show any compunction about invading that defenceless and innocent country; did they refuse to wear .the garlands of flowers thrown on them as they left Berlin on their way to Belgium; did they refrain from singing <inline font-style="italic">&#34;. Deutschland fiber alles &#34; ;</inline> or did they make any attempt to be loyal to their own economic and political doctrines? </para>

Moreover, I am quite sure that if the war had ended in their favour, we should have heard nothing whatever from the German working classes, or any other section of the German people, of regret for the course they had taken. I have read of only one solitary instance of a German soldier showing any unwillingness to carry out some of the duties that were performed by that army in Belgium, and, singularly enough, he was a Prussian officer, who, rather than execute some innocent Belgian citizens, shot himself. </para>

                        <para>Consider now the position of those Belgian Internationalists, betrayed by their own comrades in Germany, who gave them no hint of the danger that so imminently threatened their country. When the horrors of war desolated Belgium, when innocent civilians were being murdered &#39; wholesale, and other abominable and unnameable horrors were being perpetrated, to their everlasting credit the Internationalist- Socialists of Belgium took the only honorable course that was open to them. Those of them who were able to bear arms seized rifles, and &#39; in the thick of the fight, many of them paid the supreme penalty for the mistake they made in trusting the German working classes, and unwittingly playing into the hands of their treacherous enemies. </para>
                        <para>I am very pleased to support this motion for many reasons. I believe. that it is a timely and necessary one. But I am not influenced by .one of the reasons which was mentioned by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> namely, that it will strengthen the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in London. It appears to me much more necessary to close his mouth, if we can manage to do that for any length of time. When the honorable gentleman went away, I was very apprehensive as to the course he would pursue, and I think every honorable member who has watched his doings 9ince he left these shores will realize that he has done a vast amount of harm to the interests of Australia.  His  first exploit was to address a meeting in the United States, at which, as the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> indicated, he talked very loudly about a &#34; Monroe doctrine for the Pacific.&#34; He did not explain what he meant by that doctrine, and nobody who understands what the Monroe doctrine is has the slightest idea yet what the honorable gentleman meant. In America the Monroe doctrine is practically an intimation that America will-not tolerate any country whatever, other than those in possession, attempting to acquire a single rood of soil in North or South America. It means practically &#34;hands off&#34; to all the .nations of the world as regards the acquisition of American territory. But the doctrine is totally inapplicable to the Pacific. In or bordering on the Pacific are not only British interests, but French, American, Dutch, Russian, Japanese, and Chinese. Therefore, to talk about a Monroe doctrine for the Pacific is absolute nonsense. But it sounded imposing, and as the honorable gentleman is more concerned with sound than with common sense, he let the statement go for what it was worth, assuming, probably, that it would attract some attention in America. Then, after he arrived in Britain, he plunged into the internal politics of that country, and he has created a considerable amount of resentment oh that account. I know it is said that the resentment is only felt and expressed in Free Trade quarters, but that is not so. I have in my possession a letter from a gentleman prominent in England in matters of Tariff reform, and he expresses regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has made such an untimely fuss about these matters, and indicates his opinion that our Prime Minister has, by his interference, done that cause more harm than good. According to the press, the Prime Minister has insinuated that &#34; the White Australia &#34; is in danger, a totally unjustifiable suggestion, so far- as I am able to see; and in the later cables we are given to understand that he has practically accused the Prime Minister of Great Britain of lying. Then we find him demanding, in the most hysterical fashion, that an economic war should be waged against Germany. Yet this is the same gentleman who declared a few months ago in this chamber that he would be no party to a ruthless policy towards Germany as a nation. I regret very much that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has not shown more discretion in regard to this and other matters, and 1 would very much have preferred that the affairs of Australia, at the present time, should have been in the&#39; hands of a gentleman of. moderation and urbanity, like the present High Commissioner. </para>
                        <para>I support this motion for one- reason, amongst others, and that is a very strong one.. It is the absolute necessity at the present juncture, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> clamouring for admission to the conferences of the Allies, and in the face of his other unwise actions, for this Parliament, as representative of the people of Australia, to indicate to the Imperial authorities and to the leaders of the Allies, our opinion- and conviction concerning these matters independently of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> I am afraid that those who come into contact with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> abroad are being forced to the conclusion that he cannot be taken very &#34;seriously, regarding the politics of the Empire. The matters dealt with in this motion are of very great moment to Australia. I am glad to know that this Parliament will carry the motion practically unanimously, and thereby give a clear indication to the Allies and the Empire of the wishes of the people of Australia, an indication that, I believe, will carry the greatest possible weight. </para>
                        <para>I was sorry to hear during the debate certain observations about the criminal folly of the Imperial authorities in the past in connexion with these islands. I do not defend the Colonial Office or those of our . Imperial statesmen who have shown regrettable lack of knowledge and of courage in dealing with the larger matters pertaining to the Empire, for which we have suffered in many ways, and particularly during the present war; but I remind honorable members that while we may feel that the Imperial authorities ought years ago to have shown more foresight by acquiring possession and control of many of the islands of the Pacific, we fail to realize that the Imperial Government was then staggering under a heavy burden of responsibility which Australia, refused to help to carry. The whole blame for what  happened cannot be put on the Old Country. Had Australia in &#39; those times offered to bear its. share of responsibility, the position might have been  different. As a loyal son of the Empire, it is gratifying to me to know that Australia is at last in many (regards making an attempt to live up to her responsibilities, as indeed this motion indicates. Its discussion, however, has brought out certain suggestions which I strongly deprecate. There has been talk of obtaining an indemnity for this country. We have a tendency, like chanticleer, to fly to the highest point of the landscape, flap our wings, and proclaim our sublime satisfaction with ourselves. There is danger in our present elevated state of mind, that we may crow a little louder than is prudent. Remembering that- neither martyred Servia nor Belgium has yet made a specific claim for an indemnity, it is ridiculous for Australia, which has * suffered less financial loss than perhaps any other country connected with the war, to clamour for one at this time.

The return mail brought, not the expected advice of shipment, but the curt intimation that the order could not be filled, because the manufacturer with whom the Australian merchant had dealt for years, declined to continue to do business with a country which had turned down conscription. </para>

When we read a proposal in the daily press that Australia should send a testimonial to Marshal Foch, or, in other words, that we should pat him on the back and say, &#34;Here, old man, is a tip for your services,&#34; it is time to make an earnest protest against suggestions that make us ridiculous in the eyes of the world. There is plenty of good, solid work for us to do. Our soldiers have achieved a record of which we have every reason to be proud. We owe it to them and to the country that we shall approach our responsibilities soberly and earnestly. I trust that the motion will be carried, and I shall have much pleasure in supporting it. </para>

                            <para>. -  I am glad that the Government has taken a different course in regard to the motion from that first suggested, when, by interjection, I said that it looked like a trap. </para>

                        <para class="block">Had the Standing &#39; Orders been strictly enforced, only the leaders on each side would have had an opportunity to express their views. Now that honorable members generally have the opportunity to speak, I wish to state my reasons for the vote that I shall give. .1 heartily support the motion, and I shall show to my friends inside and outside the House who do not agree with me why I take this attitude. I have studied the position of the Pacific Islands for a longer time than most honorable members, and have always believed that Australia and Great Britain should assert the &#34; Hands off the Pacific&#34; doctrine. It is the duty of this Parliament to look beneath the surface of things, and to make provision for the protection of the future generations which will occupy this soil. If Germany gets back her Pacific Island Possessions, she may, twenty-five or fifty years hence, again make them a menace to the commerce of the Pacific and to Australia. The advance of science, and the improvement of mechanical appliances have made ocean distances of small moment. Transit between land and land is quickly effected by steamer, and we may before long have air and submarine services as well. Therefore, we should not let slip the opportunity to get absolute control of the islands of the Pacific. I remember when Heligoland was handed over to Germany by Great Britain. Many Radicals and Radical journals of that day - some members of my own family were among them - strongly opposed the giving of that island to Germany, but the influence of Queen Victoria and of Germany was too strong for them. To appease the British public, it was stated that Heligoland was being gradually washed&#39; away by the treacherous North Sea, and that the island would eventually disappear under the waves. But. the German people brought their scientific knowledge to bear, and by the use of mechanical appliances, constructed breakwaters which have preserved the island from destruction. They have there &#39;to-day one of the finest harbors in the North &#34;Sea for a fleet. I have referred to this matter only to show how unwise it is not to retain even a small possession that might ultimately prove of value to the nation. Had British guns  alone been mounted on Heligoland, it is quite possible that the war would have terminated sooner than it did. </para>
                        <para>Some of my friends outside may think that since I intend to vote for this motion I am becoming an Imperialist. I would point out, however, that this does not touch the question of Imperialism. Imperialism has to do with government, and some of the most pronounced Imperialists would take from Australia some -of its most cherished rights of self-government. This island question has nothing to do with the principle of self-government. In this instance we are merely expressing the view that we should be allowed to retain our hold upon these islands, and thus prevent them from becoming enemy storehouses of destruction. I would rather that they should be white elephants in our hands than storehouses of destruction in the hands of an enemy. I am giving expression to my views on this question to-day, because I recognise that if we do retain possession of these islands, they are not likely to become self-supporting for some time, and that in all probability claims in respect of them will be made  upon our revenue. There is a possibility of our having increased demands made upon us in connexion with the government of Papua, and I want to place on record the fact&#39; that in passing this resolution we did not lose sight of economic questions affecting these islands. </para>
                        <para>This is by no means a new question. I remember attending with the honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spence)</inline> a Trade Union Congress held in Melbourne in 1885, one of the questions before which was the desirableness of urging the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria to send an ambassador to France with the object of inducing the French Government to hand over New Caledonia to the eastern States. At that time New Caledonia was- a possible menace to Australia, since the French Government, with the aid of a firm of Scottish bankers, wa9 sending there recidivists, a class, of criminals who were likely to prove most objectionable settlers among a free people. Had we secured possession of New Caledonia at that time, we should have done much better with its mineral deposits than France has done. I am proud of what the British have done as colonists. The British are undoubtedly the best colonizing people in the world. Britain&#39;s success in colonizing has been largely due to the care which she exercises in preventing any cruelty to the natives, and in securing the observance of humanitarian considerations. With the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson),</inline> 1 visited Papua some time ago, and what we saw there convinced us&#34; that there was nothing to be ashamed of in our management of the Territory. Those who take charge of these captured German Possessions, if we are permitted to retain and hold them, will be guided by the&#39; same ideals of civilization that have influenced those charged with the administration of Papua. </para>
                        <para>It is not set out in this motion that, in the opinion of this House, there should be no joint control -of these islands. I think, however, that such an expression of opinion should appear in it. Some time ago I set out on a visit to the New Hebrides, but I had only reached Norfolk Island when the war broke out, and I could go no further. I was endeavouring to fulfil a promise to several Sydney friends interested in the New Hebrides that I would visit those islands to see for myself whether the joint control of them had failed, as they declared it had. I was assured by them that the New Hebrides would have been much better managed had they been under the sole control of the British. I sincerely hope that the idea of a joint control of these islands will not be entertained at the Peace Conference. The carrying out of this&#39; resolution will be beneficial, to the natives of the islands involved, and I believe that if they were consulted, they would desire to have the control of the islands vested in the Commonwealth. </para>
                        <para>Having regard to clause 5 of  President  Wilson&#39;s peace proposals, I am convinced that he had availed himself of an opportunity to examine the principles of the Australian Labour party before he drew up that statement. I know that the programme and various manifestoes of the Labour party have reached him. I have brothers and sisters in the United States of America, and at their request since my return to this Parliament I have sent them much literature and information concerning the Labour movement in Australia. It is evident that  President  Wilson., when he drew up his fourteen articles, was familiar with the great principles laid down by the Australian Labour party in the peace proposals of the New South Wales Labour Conference. In any event, it is evident that great minds think alike. I feel it is the duty of honorable members, and &#34;more particularly of the Opposition, to voice their views on this question, and so to satisfy those whom they represent of the wisdom of their reasons for supporting this motion. Ministerial supporters have not that freedom that we enjoy. We are free to discuss a subject of this kind at length, but they no doubt are being held back. I have only touched the fringe of this question, but time will not permit of my going into it in detail. There are many other good reasons why we should- retain these islands. It must be apparent to all who have taken any interest in the subject that, in this Greater Britain of the southern seas, there is going to be a large population. At present we are, as it were, only a few birds of passage; but the advertisement which the war has given this country will attract millions from both Europe and America. In. this regard, I have information more than is to be gathered from the newspapers. All my friendships in England were not broken when I came to Australia. My family was a large one, and many of us - who were discontented with conditions in the Old Country - have made homes in other parts of the world; and, from relatives and friends, I gather that there is for Australia a future that very few are able to realize. Of course, by then I shall be under the cold sod, and I do not know whether there will be anybody left to plant a daisy over me; after all, whether or not one is a public man, we pass away like flies, and are forgotten. However, there will be the records of Parliament to show that at least some members were satisfied as to the grave importance of the step we are taking to-day. The responsibility for that step we are willing to shoulder, because we believe that we are acting in the best interests of those who will come after us. I am glad, too, that there has been no attempt on the part of the Government to restrict debate, for any infringement of the rights and privileges of the people will call forth protests from me so long as I have any vigour of body and mind left. The motion has been, debated in a manner worthy of the traditions of the Australian Parliament; and however disagreeable it may be to some honorable members to be detained here this afternoon, they , will find that the time is not ill-spent, even though the  speaker  may be the humble member for East Sydney. The British race, with all its faults, is the race to undertake the development of such possessions; and it is not so much the flag as the sentiment that underlies it that counts. I believe that the opinions I have expressed are those of the people I represent, and that the history we are making now will be read with deep interest and satisfaction by future generations. It pleases some people to attempt to cast ridicule on <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but I feel convinced that those who come after us will read the pages of that publication and approve of the sentiments therein expressed in favour of this motion. I trust that our action to-day will result in preventing any race but the British from having control of the islands in the Pacific. </para>

                            <para>. - I regret that this motion, couched in terms so obviously in the interests of Australia, should have been the subject of any debate. I should have been glad, indeed, to refrain from speaking had other honorable members been of the same mind, because the speech made by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> covered the whole position. It is reasonable that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> should also have spoken,&#39; and this would have been sufficient to give complete expression of the opinion of this Chamber. There is no question that should have been more of a non-party character and accepted as such; and the introduction of such expressions as we have heard from some honorable- members opposite is the cause of much regret and disappointment to many. If the motion had been accepted in a proper spirit as indicating the will of Australia, we should not have had such criticism and suggestions as that it is launched inopportunely and as a trap - we should not have had honorable members opposite complaining that it is proposed with the object of placing them in a difficulty. Why it should place honorable members opposite in a difficulty I am at a loss. to understand. Although it is acknowledged that the friendly control of the Pacific Islands is vital to Australia, honorable members opposite were responsible for preventing Australian delegates being present at the first Imperial Conference, where this very question was discussed. That in itself should have been a reason for my honorable friends opposite giving  whole-hearted support to the motion. </para>

                                <para>- The speech of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> was a distinct disappointment to me and many others. The honorable gentleman had some difficulty in making up his .mind, or rather in telling the House, the exact attitude  he intended taking - whether or not he intended to vote for the motion. He ultimately did tell us, but was careful to explain that if the motion had contained certain other terms &#39;he would have voted against it. At several points he sought to read into the motion a meaning which it certainly does not contain, and he would have done justice to his well-recognised. loyalist feelings if he had boldly and vigorously supported it. </para>

It is unthinkable that the British Government are going to sacrifice the interests of this country, either in regard to our powers of self-government, or as to our fiscal or economic powers.

Everything that the Prime Minister has sought to do by way of public denunciation he could have done more effectively by private representations to the British Government. I am in full sympathy with his objective, namely, the conservation of the interests of Australia so far as these islands are concerned, but I, for one, protest against his method of reaching that objective. </para>

                                    George has to some extent reproached Australia, and particularly this Parliament, by saying that Australia had the fullest opportunity to make her representations at the first Imperial Conference, at which, however, our delegates were not present. Therefore, it cannot be said against the British Government that we had not the fullest opportunity to make known our wishes.

When the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> makes use of the expression &#34; Hands off the Pacific!&#34; I, like many of my friends, am at a loss to know exactly what he means. If he means that German hands must be kept off the Pacific, I am in accord with the view. I hope that hi3 labours in this connexion will be carried out more discreetly, and that only when the interests of Australia are really being neglected will he publicly , complain. There is no evidence of such neglect as yet to hand. </para>

                                <para>- I am aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George has said that this was the subject of consultation by the War Cabinet when our Prime Minister was present. Under these circumstances it is well that there should be a distinct expression of opinion from the Australian Parliament itself in order that the British Government may realize that in our opinion the future welfare of Australia is wrapped up in these islands. Of course we have had no time to debate this matter fully. My object in rising, also, is to repudiate some of the mawkish sentiments we have heard expressed in regard to no indemnities and no annexations. A policy of no annexations and no indemnities would be a very excellent principle to apply, provided it had been honorably adopted by both sides. I think it was in 1917 that the Reichstag passed a motion in that particular direction, but shortly afterwards, when by reason of the deadly penetration of German propaganda in Russia, that country was laid prostrate, that resolution was cast aside, and Germany, in pursuance of her doctrine of might, stepped in and annexed Russian provinces, dictated her own terms at Brest Litovsk, and made the unfortunate Russians the victims of her strength and. power. The Russians were put practically in the position of vassals to Germany. Such was the German application of the policy of no indemnities and no annexations. In fact, they extracted from Russia an indemnity of something like &#163;300,000,000. What she did in regard to Russia she ruthlessly repeated in regard to Roumania. </para>

                        <para>It is a pretence to say that Germany has put forward a policy of no annexations and no indemnities. Why, then, are we not justified in deliberately advocating the annexation of these islands in the Pacific? Germany was deliberately out for conquest, and never really concealed her intentions; and Australia itself was one of the prizes she coveted and designed to capture. I would be pleased to see the Pacific Islands brought under British rule, for we have our responsibilities in that regard, and are bound to accept them. But we do not wish to embarrass the British Government unnecessarily at this stage, hence the temperate wording of the motion which has been submitted to the House. Nevertheless, I trust that we are rigid in the attitude that in no circumstances shall these islands be returned to Germany,, even if they cannot be brought under the immediate control of Great Britain. The experience of the past has not been satisfactory in regard to international control, but some such system will need to be established if the islands are not to pass under British rule. In any case, kept from Germany they must be as part and parcel of the policy that Germany must be put in such a position that a repetition of the horrors of. the past four and a half years will not be possible. It is vital to Australia&#39;s welfare that Germany shall have no say in them. Their occupation by Germany has at all times been a menace to us, and guided by the  experience of the past we must accept the motion as submitted by the Government. I trust that no word of discord in the consideration of the motion will mar the best interests of Australia. </para>

                            <para>.- In July last Germany issued her terms of peace in the form of what were called the Twelve Commandments. They were most drastic. They insisted that Great Britain &#34;should surrender her fleet, all her coaling stations, Cyprus, and Gibraltar, and should be stripped of any territory which might prove suitable to Germany&#39;s interests. Yet, honorable members opposite put forward the claim that she has not advocated a policy of indemnities and annexations. We have heard a good deal about the terms of peace set out by  President  Wilson. Let  President  Wilson speak for the United States of America. We speak for ourselves. However, in order to show what consistency there is in the arguments put forward by honorable members opposite, let us look at the attitude of America towards defeated Spain. How many of her possessions were left to Spain ? America stripped her of the whole of them, even those islands which were not contiguous to the shores of the United States. If it was right for America to do this, surely it is right for us to deprive a defeated enemy of lands which are contiguous to our shores, and not removed from them by the thousands of miles which separate the Philippine Islands from the American shores.

It is said that we should not take possession of these islands because we have bungled in our administration of the Northern Territory. There is no comparison between the two places. The NorthernTerritory cannot be called particularly fertile. It is certainly fairly good grazing country. It . is a huge empty State occupied by about a thousand people. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. If these Pacific Possessions are fertile and productive lands, that is all the more reason why we should hold them. Some time ago, when the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> was speaking in &#34;this chamber, the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> interjected, &#34; They are a lot of mud islands.&#34; If they are a lot of mud islands, why did the honorable member occupy hours yesterday in urging the House to be just to Germany? If they are of no value, how can Germany be hurt by our taking possession of them ? In any case, we are entitled to control them for our own protection. Aerodromes could be established 1,000 miles from our shores, only one day&#39;s flying, and two-and-a-half days&#39; steaming from Sydney; from those bases an enemy could bomb or shell our cities. The distance from Sydney to Great Britain, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Panama Canal, is 600 miles shorter than it is <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Suez Canal, and as the former route runs right through these islands, if we could establish defended posts about it our commerce would be very much more protected. In any case, we ought to look after the interests of future generations of Australia, and set up those outer defences in order to defend Australia&#39;s oversea trade against any possible attack by enemies. More particularly should we guard against the establishment of enemy submarine bases among the islands. The whole world has been horrified at the dastardly deeds done by German submarines. We do not want a repetition of these things in the Pacific. People who have broken treaties, and adopted such despicable methods of warfare as we have experienced during the last four and a half years, should not be given the opportunity of re-imposing these horrors on future generations. </para>

I have a budget of their grievances with me now, and the only means I have of preventing a recurrence of them is the ventilation of them in this Chamber. </para>

I mentioned to a mutual friend that I had this complaint, and he came to the House, and promised that he would make inquiries. Later, Lieutenant-Colonel McInerney told me over the telephone why he had made this charge to the widow of a soldier, but I am far from satisfied with his explanation. </para>

This widow knew nothing about the filling in of pension claims. That is a work &#39;which the Pensions Department ought to undertake free of cost. She went to Lieutenant Colonel McInerney for advice, and for filling in a pension form, and practically nothing else, he charged her &#163;5 15s. He said that he did other work. I understand that he was Provost-Marshal in Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>- I have heard that from others. The case has been brought before me by the secretary of the Returned Soldiers&#39; Association, after he had made inquiries, but not satisfied with that I wrote to the widow, and have received two letters from her. She informed me that she visited Lieutenant-Colonel McInerney, who filled in the pension papers. She told him that she had a policy on the life of her husband for &#163;80, the surrender value of which was &#163;10 15s. He wrote&#39; a letter in lead pencil, and told her to copy it out, and send it to a firm of solicitors. He also wrote a letter to the Pensions Office, and filled in her claim. He asked to be allowed to see the insurance policy, and then said he would collect the amount, which she herself could have done; in any case, the money would have been paid automatically three months after the death of her husband. Lieutenant-Colonel Mclnerney deducted &#163;5 15s. from the total amount of &#163;10 15s. </para>

                        <para>- The widow informs me that the work I have mentioned was all he did. When, however, she made a complaint, he handed back &#163;111s., leaving the amount actually received by him &#163;4 4s. It is the duty of this Parliament to see that every facility is given to widows and others to fill in pension claims without their being obliged to go near a solicitor. No publicity is too great for the action of a man, especially a lieutenant-colonel in the Army, who would charge a soldier&#39;s widow &#163;5 15s. for filling in a pension application. I have not made this statement without making investigation, and I hope that the Acting Minister for Defence will make it known publicly that the officers at the Pensions Branch will fill in the claims of soldiers&#39; dependants. </para>

These men were told that their positions would be guaranteed when they enlisted. They went away on active service, and it is scarcely fair that when they return, they should be . reduced in rank, and offered salaries &#163;24 less than they receved&#39; before they left Australia.

                        <para>.- Some time ago I asked the Minister for Defence, or whoever was. responsible in the matter, to try to secure some of the Arab horse blood that might be possible of acquirement through the operations of Australian soldiers in the Orient. According to the reply I received, the experts whom the Department consulted did not think that any advantage would accrue to horses of the military type by the introduction of Arab blood. I was thinking, not so much of horses of military type, as of general utility horses. The ablest experts in Australia agree that the Arab horses make the staunchest and best horses . that can be got for general purposes, and they will endure more in Australia than any other horse. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt if we could trace back its pedigree, the Australian horse was reared from Arab blood. I am not expressing only my own-opinion ; I am speaking from the experience of men who know something about the matter, even in regard to horses of the military type. I believe that good artillery horses could be bred if the right mares were selected. With one portion of the Minister&#39;s answer I agree, namely, the danger of introducing disease from the Orient. Glanders is a dangerous disease, and is very prevalent in the East, but that difficulty is not insurmountable. An opportunity is now presented if the Government will only seize it, to get fresh blood, and, , if it is let slip, our horse breeding industry will suffer. A gentleman who has bought a lot of horses in Western Australia for this Government is a thorough believer in the right type of Arab. Those who say that the Arab is not suitable for stud purposes have in mind the Arab that has come to this country of late years, which is not an Arab in the true sense, &#39;but a very poor sort of horse, quite different from the Arab known throughout India. Many of the staunchest and best horses we possess have a lineage traceable to. Arab sires introduced many years ago. The Turks and other possessors of good Arabs are not easily induced to part with their best horses.;butthere is a chance now to get some of these horses, and, in the interests of our breeders, the Defence Department should try to securethem. </para>

                            <para>- I think . that something might well !be done through General Ryrie. He might be asked to secure Arabs of a type suitable for Australia. He would know the  sort  of horse required, because he has had experience with horses. A better man could not. be suggested for the task, and I hope that the Defence Department will communicate with him on the subject.I do not agree with the opinion that the Arab is not suitable for &#39;breeding horses for military work. With a proper selection of mares, he is suitable, and other types can also be bred from him. Australia should not lose this opportunity of gaining an advantage by securing horses which, under other circumstances, could not be obtained. </para>

                        <para>. - I rise to complain about the possibility that we may not &#39;have an opportunity to deal with the Estimates before the end of the present calendar year. A reply given by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> to the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> and the appearance of the business-paper make it plain&#39; that it is intended that we shall close our business without dealing with &#39; the most important questions of finance and expenditure. Honorable members, as well as Ministers, have a responsibility in this matter, and we should insist on discussing at least the proposals for public expenditure for the current year. I sympathize with the Acting Prime Minister because of the tremendous amount of work that falls on his shoulders.I appreciate the difficulties of his position, and admire the way in which he has . discharged his duties. But I do not admit that there is any reason for postponing the discussion of the finances of the country, ot, at least, the discussion of its . expenditure. Hostilities have ceased, and peace is only a matter of time. That is an additional reason why we should apply ourselves to securing economy in administration, especially at a time when taxation is being increased to the extent of millions of pounds. I hope that the Ministry will reconsider the matter, and that an early announcement will be made to the effect that we shall have a reasonable opportunity before the end of the year to deal, if not with all the Budget proposals, at least with the proposals for expenditure during the present year. If we allow this discussion to go over until next year, a great deal of the money will have been spent, and we shall not be able to discharge  out  duties effectively.We are pledged to reduce expenditure, and I hope that an opportunity will be given for a calm and comprehensive review of the financial proposals of the Government before the present series of sittings closes. </para>

                    <para>I rose to draw the attention of the Postmaster-General to the dissatisfaction of postal employees in New South Wales&#39; with the treatment that he metes out to them. My attention was drawn to the matter before I left Sydney, and I had intended to speak upon it earlier.

                <para>I am sorry that the Postmaster-General is not in his place to answer for himself. It is a pity that, instead of writing poems and drinking hot water,  he  cannot attend to the duties of his office, and do what he ought to do for his staff. I believe that there is not that good feeling towards him on the part of his staff that has existed under previous Ministers. It is a serious thing for a staff to have differences with its Ministerial head, and the present state of affairs should be brought to an end. If the Minister will not alter his ways, he should go out of office. I could speak very strongly on this subject; but I hope that what I have said will be sufficient, to prevent him in the future from treating New South Wales officials differently from officials in other parts of the Commonwealth. </para>

That piece of advice would keep many women out of the hands . of the money-lender.I wish to have one man&#39;s name registered in the mind of the AssistantMinister . for Defence. &#34; Paddy &#34; Hill is, I believe, a money lender, who was imprisoned for conspiracy in the Ronald case, and caused all the other witnesses in that case, except two, to serve time. He interferes between the dependants of soldiers, and has the audacity to go to the Defence Department. &#39;I speak now in accordance with a suggestion received from an officer of that Department, where they are trying to block these men from coming, and should receive assistance in doing so. .
