                    <para>- Some time ago a very serious cyclone visited the Mackay district. The (people there suffered severely in consequence of it, and the Government promptly and generously came to their assistance. A more disastrous cyclone has since visited the Cairns district, destroying a great deal of property, and some lives. I interviewed the Prime Minister with regard to the matter, and asked him to consider the advisability of treating the people further north in the same manner as those in the Mackay district were treated. I also wrote to the Treasurer on the subject. I now ask the honorable gentleman if consideration has been given to my representations, and, if so, what decision has been come to by the Government. </para>

                            <para>Information in the possession of the Government is to the effect that, when the vessel was first reported missing, Burns, Philp, and Company dispensed a considerable sum as temporary assistance to urgent cases of distress amongst the dependants, after which further assistance was given by the Shipwreck Belief Society and other unions. Wages due to the crew, until 6th August, 1917 - the day after the vessel was last heard of - were handed to the Government Shipping Master, in Sydney, for disbursement to the next-of-kin. The claims for compensation having lapsed when, in February, 1918, the <inline font-style="italic">Matunga's</inline> fate was definitely known, Burns, Philp, and Company at once took up the question of assistance for the families of the crew. A meeting was arranged, at which the Commonwealth Government and the principal seafaring unions were represented. It was then decided that the Commonwealth Government should ascertain the procedure followed by the Imperial Government in analogous cases, for guidance in dealing with the <inline font-style="italic">Matunga.</inline> In the meantime it was arranged that Burns, Philp, and Company should make, on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, weekly payments, based on the scale of allowances to relatives of deceased soldiers ( Imperial War Pensions) to the dependants; and it is on this basis that weekly payments have since been made. </para>

                    <para>Is it a fact that the labourers who went to England as war workers were guaranteed a minimum wage of £2 0s. 6d. a week, and that since their arrival in the Old Country, they have been compelled to insure against accident, although that gives them no more than was. guaranteed to them before they left. Under the circumstances, ought not the Government to pay their insurance premiums? </para>

                        <para>Australian war workers are subject to the same conditions of employment, and to the provisions and benefits of the National Insurance Scheme, similarly as are British workmen with the exception that Australians are guaranteed minimum weekly wages). <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton's</inline> statement to the effect that Australian workmen were guaranteed against accident in Great Britain is not correct; the Commonwealth's liability in this respect applies to the sea voyage only. Australian war workers are guaranteed minimum wages of £20s. 6d. per week, and are getting that amount, and in many eases considerably more. Their earnings are considered to be quite sufficient to permit of their paying the small premiums under the NationalInsurancc Scheme, and there appears to me to be no just reason for asking the Government to relieve the men of such payments. </para>

                        <para>. - I am thoroughly in accord with the amendment that the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy do not represent the undivided opinion of the people of Australia. During the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the Government, the honorable member for Bendigo has not done anything in his capacity as Prime Minister that would tend to bring about that harmony which he so much desires, or make him and the Minister for the Navy truly representative of Australian opinion. Although we do not know at this juncture what problems are to be dealt with at the Imperial Conference, we do know that should any matters be brought forward affecting the ultimate destiny of Australia, neither the Prime Minister, as he is at present, nor the Minister for the Navy will be justified in subscribing to anything that would inveigle the people of Australia into any binding agreement with the Imperial authorities. The section of the community which the Prime Minister has turned against himself, through his actions during the last two years, deeply resent, in their turn, the fact that he and the honorable member for Parramatta are leaving this country to represent them. The trip of those two gentlemen should have been postponed, or, at . least, the people should have been consulted as to (who their representatives should be at a conference for that purpose before those representatives left these shores. We have only to refer to the Prime Minister's public utterances to find that he condemns certain sections of the community simply because they choose to disagree with his method of conducting the war. That method was submitted to the people on two occasions, and the people immediately turned it down; but he should not brand the sections of the community opposed to him as disloyalists and pro-Germans, or as having absolutely no interest in Australian affairs, for that reason only. Furthermore, he condemns us because we are not in thorough accord with his reason for continuing to prosecute the war. We assume that the war is a righteous one, and for that reason we are pledged to support it loyally. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Times Trade Supplement,</inline> the Prime Minister made the following statement in April, 1916 - and this is only one of many - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">A commercial war must be waged. The organization of Empire trade is one of the vital duties before us. It is a necessity in the defence and security of the race. The hour has come, and we look for actions. </para>
                    <para class="block">In utterances of that description, the Prime Minister plainly declaims to the world that this is a commercial war. We in Australia say that we do not recognise it as such. We are prepared to prosecute the war so long as it remains within its original ambit, that is, the breaking down of German militarism; but once it departs from that we say we want none of it. That is Australian opinion. Whether it is the Prime Minister's opinion, or the opinion of others, I cannot say, but once the war becomes a commercial or trade war, I am finished with it. Yesterday the Prime Minister, before he left the House, wished to know what had come over the spirit of Labour. He asked what had crushed its virile spirit. He and other honorable members know very well what has come over the spirit of Labour. Labour entered into this war in the same spirit and with the same determination as any other section of the community. When the Government Went to the polls, the Labour portion of the community were quite prepared to support a Government that was out to win the war. Led away by that spirit of self-sacrifice, they voted for men who they knew were naturally diametrically opposed to their interests. They did this for the one reason, that they believed those men would assist to bring the' war to a successful consummation, and at the same time look after the interests of the workers. After the Government was elected, the first action of the Win-the-war party was to do everything it possibly could to crush the spirit of the workers. That is what has come over the workers to-day. They are suffering from a sense of oppression and injustice. They recognise that they embarked on a certain course which was opposed to the beliefs held by the particular Governments then in power in Australia. They were defeated in that course by methods which did not reflect very much credit on those Governments. One would naturally have thought that the Governments, having defeated the. trade unionists, would stop at that point, but they did not do so. They continued to wage economic war on the workers, and they have been doing it ever since. The workers feel that the Governments have been putting the knife into them. They suffer under a sense of injustice. They are sullen and intolerant ; they will not listen to anything that the Governments suggest in the direction of giving them justice; they do not trust them ; they look upon them with suspicion, and until that suspicion is removed it is useless to look to the workers for any co-operation in the matter of winning the war: Until the workers' grievances are removed, they will look upon all overtures made by the Governments with the utmost suspicion, and they will continue sullenly indifferent to any suggestions that come from Ministers. That is the spirit that has come over Labour. </para>
                    <para>The Prime Minister says, " Go to your unions ; tell them the truth, and urge them to action." But what is the use of our going to our unions? We have already told them what their plain duty is, and they know it already. There are unions in New South Wales whose members have abstained from work for seven months, and who are prepared to starve rather than go back on the principles and ethics that are ingrained in them through their association with trade unionism. These men are heroes. They are of the material of which heroes are made. They are just as good fighters as are any men in France to-day. They are the class of men to whom we should look to save the country from that oppression of which honorable members say they are very much afraid, although they do not appear to be. These men have sons and relatives at the Front. The spirit which they have exhibited is one that should not be crushed. Bather it is one that should be built up in this country. If we are to be a virile, independent people, we should cultivate that spirit among the workers rather than attempt to press it out of them, and make them servile beings. Restore these men to the plane which they should occupy, and there will be no need for any one to tell them their duty. They know it. But when they find that those rights for which they have fought are being assailed, it is useless for any one to go to them to ask them to co-operate. That is my reply to the Prime Minister when he asks us to go to our unions and urge them to action. There is no need to urge them to action. The proper course is for the Government to carry out what the Prime Minister has said he is prepared to do. He has said, "I am prepared to bring things back to where they were." If the Government are prepared to do that, there will be no necessity for any honorable member to put up a case to the workers. They will put up their own case. </para>
                    <para>I had an interview with the Assistant Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> this morning in regard to certain concessions which he granted in what appeared to me to be the right spirit. If that spirit is observed in any dealings or negotiations with the trade unions in the future, even if things do not resume their normal 3tate, there will, at any rate, be very much better relations between all parties. The Prime Minister has said that there would be some difficulty in dealing with certain employers, over whom the Government had no control at present. Surely, if the Government have complete control over the employees, they have the same control over employers. If they can issue War Precautions Regulations to deal with workers who refuse to abide by certain conditions which are intolerable to them, surely it is simply a matter of starting the sausage machine, and rolling out a few more regulations for the purpose of dealing with any employers who refuse to accede to the Government's wishes. Lord </para>
                    <para class="block">Forrest has said that the War Precautions Act was brought in to deal with the " other fellow." Honorable members opposite have been dealing pretty thoroughly with the other fellow for the last eighteen months. I hope that a broadside of regulations will be .brought to bear on the employers. If it is done, there will be a little more harmony in the community. </para>
                    <para>We are told that in the face of the common danger, it is not too much to hope that the people in all parts -of the Empire, including the Commonwealth, will present a unified and unwavering front, but -the Government are not attempting to -bring about this state of affairs, because there seems to be a decided set against people of Irish nationality living :in the Commonwealth. Where there is a desire to obtain harmony, the Government should . do nothing to disturb the 'existing state  of  affairs, yet a new regulation has just been issued, designedly for the purpose of dealing  with  persons who may belong to the Sinn Fein organization, Abut really embracing every person who happens -to be Irish -ot of Irish descent. For some years I have 'been connected- with a certain  club  in "Victoria, anil I have spent many enjoyable evenings there; 'but when I went down the other night I was told (hat the military authorities had raided the premises, taken the secretary's books, and all his belongings, and closed the place for practically a week. "It is -not -a Sinn Fein organization; it is simply a club got up for the purpose of bringing people together in social evenings. It is altogether exceeding the spirit of the regulation if, because a man is a Hibernian, or belongs to an Irish guild or lodge, or some other thing termed Irish, his house is to .be raided. It appears to me that a set has been made .against one section of the community. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> .there are 139,000 people in Australia who were horn in Ireland.  Out of a total population of nearly .5,000,000, there are 139,00.0 who are supposed to be a menace to the peace of the Empire. There are .many Irish who  have sons and relatives at the Front. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> am of Irish extraction, and. I have  four  relatives in the .firing line. There are dozens of people with whom I am acquainted, who are Irish or <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> Irish extraction, who have sons, brothers, and fathers in .the firing line. There are Irish-'born people, too, fighting at the Front; and, I say, therefore, that the whole action -of the Government is utterly wrong. If it is 'the intention to deal with ..associations, or any set of persons  who  are guilty of anything contrary to law., let those associations and persons be dealt with individually; do .not let .us pick out any section of the community .and declare their association to be unlawful simply because they are of a particular nationality. </para>

An Irishman, if lie refuses to .be a conscriptionist, does not, we know, refuse to fight, while others I have mentioned will neither fight nor be' conscripted. If it is disloyal to "be an anti conscriptionist, why not imprison all who are opposed to conscription ? If the pre* sent state of things is permitted to continue, we shall have more out-laws than there are people within 'the pale of the law ; the whole 'country will become an unlawful association, and will, I suppose, issue war regulations (against those who are now within  the  Segal pale. If it is unlawful to belong to  the  Sinn Fein, ;a social democratic club, or other progressive association,  then  I suppose that the Peace Society -would also, , be considered unlawful. In fact, as I say, we shall soon have half .of 'the community .declared an unlawful .association ; and the man who stops in the street 'to :speak to a friend may ,be arrested for associating with some proscribed person. </para>

                    <para>It is up to the Government to take some action, now that the stormy petrel' has left us. There is no doubt that the Prime Minister is the cause of all the trouble. He is decidedly anti-Irish, and anti-Catholic, as is proved by the regulations to which he has been a party. There is the case in point regarding which I asked a question to-day. In Sydney there is a Catholic ecclesiastic who has a following, not only of Irish, but of the whole of those composing his congregation; and I suppose there must be some 30,000 or 40.,000 Catholics within his influence drawn from all parts of the world. That man. has been interned; and while it. may be all right to intern an ordinary individual, of. whom. no. one. has much knowledge, it is clear that it does not tend to create a better feeling in the community when a man is taken out of public life and interned without just trial. If this man is disloyal', and can be proved so, there is no one in the community who would say a word' against the action of the Government in interning him; but he ought to have a fair trial. Meetings of protest have been held all over Australia regarding this case; and I should like to see the Minister for Recruiting <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Orchard)</inline> go to Newtown, Enmore, or Marrickville when one of these meetings is in progress. Only last week I was at a meeting attended by over 8,000 people, in protest against the internment of this ecclesiastic; and if the Government desire to make any progress with recruiting they ought to refrain from such actions as have raised all this feeling. I have made inquiries, and, so far as I can gather, this man has neither done or said anything disloyal. All he said from <inline font-weight="bold">Ms pulpit,</inline> some time ago, was that he desired the congregation to pray for the souls of all those who had fallen in battle, and he did not discriminate between nationality or creed. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the position. If this man has been guilty of disloyalty, or of anything that tends to show that he is a pro-German - that his sympathies are with any other country that that in which he lives - let him, of course, be interned. But there should be inquiry into the case. Why should the Minister for Defence be both judge and jury in a matter of this kind ? This priest holds a position in public life equally as important as that of the Minister for Defence. If the Minister were arrested and interned, he would demand an inquiry into the allegations against him, and the people of Australia would be prepared to see that the inquiry was made. We ask for the same treatment in regard to this ecclesiastic. If, as a result of an inquiry, it is found that he is disloyal, the Government may then say to the Roman Catholic community, " This man was disloyal, and a menace to the Empire, and he has been only justly dealt with." How can one go amongst the Catholic community and ask for recruits when there are injustices such as this, and the anti-Sinn Fein regulation and the petition which was presented yesterday? The whole tendency seems to be to persecute the Irish and the Roman Catholics. </para>

                            <para>- Labour in Australia co-operated with the Government in the early stages of the war. But the Win-the-war Government have not desired the co-operation of the workers. They thought they were strong enough to flog the workers into subjection, and they found that by the flogging operation they destroyed the best recruiting asset they had. The Labour Government which was in power in the early stages of the war did co-operate with the workers, and the workers reciprocated. When the Government determined to take over and operate the interned German ships, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> attended at the rooms of the union with which I was connected before I entered Parliament, and asked if we were prepared to man those ships for trading overseas, and asked us what were our terms. He arrived at an amicable understanding with us. We manned the ships at the wages ruling on the Australian coast, and although the wages out of Great Britain are £5 per month higher than those for men out of Australia, our members are adhering to the agreement made with the Minister, and are working in the danger zone for lower wages than the British seamen are receiving. Similar arrangements were made with other unions. The Government approached the coal lumpers' organization, and by arrangement a battalion was formed to carry out certain work. Agreements were made with the wharf labourers and the leather workers. Whenever the Government desired to insure the supply of clothing, or any other article required for the war, they approached the union and arranged for the co-operation of the workers. Preference to unionists was given to the men, and as a result harmony prevailed during the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the Labour Government. It was only when the National party took office, and attempted to abrogate preference to unionists and to flagellate the workers, that discord was created. Honorable members know that during the first two years of the -war there was no discord between the Government and the unions. It was not that the workers were getting higher -wages from the Labour Government than they are receiving from the Liberal Government, but they gave their assistance in return for the confidence of the Minister. Whenever the Minister approached the unions and said he was prepared to negotiate with the men, the union officials indicated their readiness to take a share of the responsibility. If the present Government think that the Australian workers can be driven like a flock of sheep, they are making a mistake. The honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lamond)</inline> knows that as well as I do. He was schooled in the Labour movement; but either he has forgotten what he was taught, or he is pretending a lamentable ignorance in order that his present associates may think he is a pure merino. Honorable members are frequently speaking in praise of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Samuel</inline> Gompers, the  President  of the American Federation of Labour, and I propose to read to the House a passage printed in the journal published by that organization. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gompers</inline> is a conscriptionist, and consequently must be infallible.

Obviously, we are not prepared, as you are not prepared, at the request of a dozen or more employers, to throw aside all those safeguards that cost you, and those that have preceded you, not only many anxious hours, but many large sums of money to secure. We are not prepared to forego those rights at the mere request of employers. Therefore, we have safeguarded the position of the men, and we have attached considerable import to setting up of local committees, because those men know the local conditions, and they have their national organization to refer to if necessary. We feel that the interests of our workmen are thereby safeguarded, and I think the employers should have the same feeling that their interests ore also safeguarded by that kind of machinery. </para>

                            <para>- I shall come to that later. If a Wool Board is established there should be on it a representative of the shearers, as well as of the pastoralists. If that were done all details connected with the working of the industry would have consideration, and friction would be removed. All that the pastoralist knows of the industry is how to collect dividends and inflate the price of wool. If any of them are taken into the Arbitration Court and confronted with a man like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grayndler,</inline> when they are brought to the consideration of the details of the industry from which their profits are obtained, they are made to look like bally fools. </para>

The idea is to establish Boards that are to control the various industries. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that I should be a member of one of these Boards. What I do say is that the' workers should have direct representation thereon. With me the interests of the country come first. The Government propose the organization of industry, and I am strictly in earnest when I say that if they want harmony in an industry I have suggested the only way in which they can secure it. Some time ago, in connexion with the coal-mining industry, the Government appointed a Coal Board, which, as constituted, was an absolute farce. All these Boards, as at present constituted, are absolute farces. On the Coal Board there was, first of all, a representative of the Colliery Owners Federation, then a representative of the ship-owners, and a third representative, an admiral or something, that took part in the war. The least said about that gentleman the better for all concerned. Apart from Captain Glossop, the other two members of the Board had been running the industry from the start. I fail to see how the public can expect to gain any advantage by trade organization if the various industries are to be handed over to Boards composed of those who have always controlled them. In its turn, the Coal Board was controlled by the Shipping Board; but the Shipping Board was not composed of hard-working seamen, but of representatives of the shipping interests. Admiral Clarkson, C.M.G., is the  chairman  of the Shipping Board, and let me say that a naval man knows as much about the running of the mercantile marine as a pig does about an aeroplane. However, simply because he was an admiral of the Royal Navy, this gentleman was appointed controller of the mercantile marine. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, he is a C.M.G. "In the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed man is king," and it pays sometimes, when you have an object in view, to put a duffer into the position of chairman, and let him take the  blame for any trouble that may arise. That applies as far as the Shipping Board is concerned. The <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> includes Edward Owen Cox, managing director of Birt and Company, Limited,  chairman  of the Overseas Committee and  chairman  of the Overseas Shipping Representatives' Association. I do not think there is any more capable man, so far as shipping interests are concerned. He has more qualifications than Admiral Clarkson for the job; but put him on board a man-of-war and he would be as much astray there as Admiral Clarkson would be on a merchantman. There is also  Colonel Oldershaw,  of the Prime Minister's Department. I do not know much about that gentleman. Then there is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gordon</inline> Wesche, a partner in the firm of McDonald, Hamilton and Company, agents for the Peninsular and Oriental line, and formerly superintendent in Australia for that line of steamers. He is another man possessing vast experience, and knowing shipping from A to Z. Also there are <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> M.

I have nothing to say against the business capabilities of the gentlemen, or of those upon any Board which' the Government have created. I admit, in fact, that they have all the necessary business capacity. But I want to know why the Government try this camouflage on the public. Why should the Ministry lead them to believe that they are protecting industries when, all the time, the people who have been always exploting the country, are continuing to do so ? Why not organize the industries upon legitimate lines? The Government should appoint one or two practical ship-owners, who know all about the business, and a representative from the workers, together with a responsible official - a member of the Government - to control the industry in the best interests of the people. </para>

                            <para>- Then why issue regulations saying that the Government have created bodies when they have merely passed the industries concerned into th'/ hands of those who have always controlled them. Take the Wool Board, or the Shipping Board, or any of the Boards. Let us picture one of them sitting in committee. The Government representative comes along, inquiring, " What have you done this morning ?" The men who know the business, and have always controlled it, reply, " We have decided to increase freights" by £1." The Government man then asks why. The experts are able to show a legitimate reason or excuse, and that is accepted. The fact is that these people are running the Government, and iti is not a case of the Government running the industry. The Government are not representing the people of Australia. The Commonwealth is being run by business interests outside of the Government. Then why do the Government say, " We are prepared to organize industries and to run them on economic lines, thus saving endless expense to the people" ? </para>

                            <para>- The Wool Board is no more right than the Coal Board, or the Shipping Board, or any other Board. The whole idea is a swindle; the business interests have got us in the hollow of their hands, and are exploiting the country for all it is worth. That is the case in relation to every commodity they are handling. If the Government wish to do something for the best interests of the people, it is time they altered the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Boards, and created them upon a new basis. The only effective way to do that is to follow the example of Great Britain. If the Government are going to really take over the shipping industry, say, let them choose some such fully qualified gentleman as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunter</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Cox. Then let the Government appoint a representative of the workers, and, with a Minister of the Crown in control, we shall have the whole community in harmony, and the business managed properly and smoothly. Then, after the war, the industry concerned could be passed back into its natural channel. The workers, being directly represented, would feel that they were being brought into touch with the management of the industry; and if their representative were thus in a position to tell his unions that they were making certain demands which, owing to difficulties in the way were at present impracticable, the men would accept the situation, and so We would break down troubles such as exist to-day. </para>

                        <para>For centuries Labour was a dumb giant serving masters. Labour is no longer dumb; it knows its rights and its indispensable service. The working people of all countries have hearts, aspirations, and loyalty that respond to the need of country. They are willing to give service - but should they be required to bear an unfair share of the burden? In giving- service, the working people give their bodies and their minds - flesh, blood, and spirit. They demand that the Government shall recognise the transcendent value of such service - that every other possession of the nation shall be held subordinate to men, women, and children. - They demand that those provisions protecting the health and life opportunity of the nation shall be the last sacrifices to national defence. </para>
                        <para>The workers are willing to give service - as free men with  a  right to representation in the agencies that control service. They demand representation for their interests and convictions in determining the finances of the war, the Board of  Censors,  food control, and all the forces that dominate life and opportunity. </para>
                        <para>The workers will give- service in the war for freedom and human rights.

                    </quote><para>That is all we ask in Australia. Yet you say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gompers</inline> is loyal, but that we are disloyal. All we are asking at the hands of the Government is that we shall receive a fair deal. I must say that the Minister representing the Naval Department, in an interview this morning, practically conceded certain points, and I am indebted to the Government for those concessions. If they are carried out in their entirety, I am satisfied that good feeling will be restored in. the community. That is all we are asking.' I shall read now an extract from  a  speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins at the Millions Club, in Sydney, with reference to this subject, and I think honorable members will agree that, by reason of his great knowledge of the industrial laws of this country, and his close contact with the workers of Australia, he is in a position to judge of their needs. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins said - </para><quote>
                        <para>What, after all, gentlemen, is that to which we direct all our legislation, all our administration, all our public institutions? It is the service and the benefit of human beings. When we talk of benefits to a country, we mean benefits to the people of that country; when we talk of benefits to a city, we mean to the people of that city. There is no asset so valuable as well nourished, healthy, sane, moral, intelligent men, women, and children. The best country is the country with the largest proportion of such persons. </para>

The other day <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beeby,</inline> speaking in Sydney on behalf of his Government, promised assistance to 1,000 starving men. We do not want the spectre of starvation to stalk through Australia., but, unfortunately, we have evidence of the existence of this condition of affairs in both Sydney and Melbourne. We and other countries are spending millions on war, for the purpose of murdering one another; but it is difficult to secure a few thousand pounds to supply the needs of the workers of this country. This condition of affairs should not be allowed to continue. While our interest may be centred on the other side of the world at the present moment, we should also give some attention to the condition of affairs in Australia. If the Government restore to the workers the conditions that had hitherto existed-, and provide occupation for our men, I  am  satisfied that the Australian worker will rise to the occasion. He has never yet  been known to prove unworthy of his country, and, in spite of what has happened, he will prove worthy of it in the present crisis, if he is treated as an Australian, and not as a Chinaman. </para></speech>

I must confess that I am not one of those who hope for any tangible good to result from the recent Recruiting Conference at Government House. </para>

                            <para>- It is.We are asked to believe the professions of honorable members opposite that they desire harmony in the community. A conference was summoned, under the most solemn conditions, and honorable gentlemen from this House, and others who profess to represent the Democracy of Australia, but do not, attended, and agreed to certain resolutions, which, when carefully examined, mean practically nothing. Notwithstanding their professions of a desire for harmony, the first speech from the other side, after the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> had spoken, was that made by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> every word of which, practically, was a protest against any recruits going from this country at all. We are also asked to believe that because the Government were wrong, because they had done certain things, recruiting had slumped, and that if they amended their ways, members on the other side would be able to help get recruits. I have never been able to believe, however, that there was any hope of co-operation from honorable members who speak in the same strain as the honorable member for Capricornia or the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan).</inline> What was the meaning of the speech delivered by the latter? He said he revered as much as any man in this community the men who had sacrificed their lives and those who were prepared to do so at the Front, but because a certain individual occupied a high office in the Government he was prepared to allow our men to die for want of recruits rather than ask any men to go to their assistance. </para>

                            <para>- That is practically a summing up of what the honorable member said. He told us, in effect, that while the Prime Minister occupied his position in the Commonwealth Government, he would do nothing to get recruits for our men at the Front. That was the tenor of his remarks, as, indeed, it was the tenor of remarks made by other honorable members on the other side. </para>

                            <para>- I point out to the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wallace),</inline> who quoted some remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gompers,</inline> that there is a difference between the attitude of the Federation of Labour in America and that of those who to-day control what was the Labour movement in Australia, in that the Labour Federation of America, together with every other section of the American people, is furnishing its quota of men for the service of their country under a democratic form of compulsory service, and that it was in return for such service. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gompers</inline> asked that certain things shall foe done on behalf of men who are forced to go abroad to fight for the liberties they enjoy. I would remind the honorable member for West Sydney, therefore that under similar conditions he would have the same right to demand those concessions from the Government of this country. The difference between the Labour movement of Australia, as it is to-day; and the working class movement in every Allied country, is that the workers of every other part of the Empire and of the Allied nations, are doing their fair share in this war on the battlefield, and by reason of this service in defence of free institutions, they are entitled to demand that the privileges they enjoy shall be preserved for them. . People who talk of Eberty, but are not prepared to defend it when the time comes, cannot fairly claim any right to free institutions. Honorable members opposite declare that the workers of this country must be represented when great issues are being decided, and they talk as though they really represented the workers. </para>

                            <para>- Accidents will happen, because we have seen how glib-tongued gentlemen, who have never done any labour in their lives, can get into Parliament on the backs of the working people. Unfortunately these accidents have happened with startling frequency in the past few years, with the result that at present the proportion of Labour representatives who can claim any apprenticeship in the ranks of manual workers is surprisingly small. Their claim to represent the working class community must, therefore, be examined very carefully before it is conceded. They occupy a position quite different from that of those who were associated with the Labour movement at a time when any connexion with it involved a risk of one's livelihood. </para>

                            <para>- I was doing what all the leaders of the Labour movement in those days had to do - suffering for my association with it. I have had a rather different experience of the Labour movement from that of some honorable members who most glibly proclaim that they represent the workers of this country, while affirming that other people do not. I say that in many cases honorable members upon this side of the chamber represent more accurately than do honorable members opposite the real aspirations of the Labour movement. I have seen nothing in Australia more tyrannical than the bludgeoning that was resorted to by the bosses of the various Labour organizations for the purpose - of closing the mouths of Labour men who were in favour of the democratic form of compulsory military service at the time of the first referendum. </para>

                            <para>- I have no desire to bandy words over trivialities. But when it is suggested that the Government should make certain concessions in order to obtain the necessary reinforcements for our men at the Front I would point out that the need for recruits is not one which has grown since the railway strike occurred in New South Wales, or since the split took place in the Labour movement. It was the need for reinforcements which impelled the Prime Minister to take the first referendum upon this question; it was because our people were not answering the call for adequate reinforcements in the way they should have done. The suggestion that the failure of recruiting is due to industrial troubles, to what the Prime Minister has done during the recent months, or to the treatment to which unionists have been subjected, is so much idle pretence. The need for men was urgent long before these matters arose. We are not facing to-day the most vital problem of the moment, namely, how we are to get the requisite men. I cannot bring myself to believe that there, is any considerable number of .honorable members on this side of the chamber who imagine that we will get a sufficiency of. recruits even if we concede everything that is asked of us by honorable members opposite. Personally, I cannot see any prospect of our being able to send sufficient reinforcements to the Front this year. Yet to me that is the one thing which* is of vital importance. It is of supreme importance that the men who are now .fighting for the free institutions which we enjoy should not be left to perish for lack of assistance, merely because we have not the courage to do the one thing that is necessary - the one thing which has served to provide the requisite reinforcements in all other belligerent countries. While we steadfastly refuse to take the one step that is necessary, all the troubles put forward by honorable  members opposite to account for the failure of recruiting are merely vain pretences, and the worst feature of the whole business is that while we are talking and wrangling here the men are dying there for want of the aid which we decline to send them. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not intend to follow the line of argument which has been adopted by the honorable member who has just resumed his seat. If there are many speeches delivered in this chamber like that which he has just delivered, recruiting will not be aided very much, and beneficial results cannot be expected to flow from the Conference which was recently held at the Federal Government House. I entirely disagree with the honorable member when he says that the shortage of recruits arose before the split in the Labour party occurred. If he will take the trouble to look up statistics, he will find that prior to that split more men were enlisting than were actually needed, and even up to the time of the second referendum the Minister for Defence stated that we had a reserve upon which we could draw, and which was sufficient to provide us with ample reinforcements. Honorable members upon this ' side of the chamber are equally anxious with Ministerial supporters to reinforce the gallant boys who are fighting at the Front, and it ill-be-" comes any honorable member to say that we are doing nothing in that connexion. I venture to affirm that the position today in regard to recruiting was brought about by the split in the Labour movement at the time of which I speak. Since then a feeling of resentment has been engendered in working men's quarters throughout Australia by reason of the action of the Government of New South Wales and of the Commonwealth Government in inflicting upon this country a strike, which they could have avoided, at a time when we were urgently in need of recruits. The railways of New South Wales have been operated for years without any card system, and the introduction of that system might well have been allowed to stand over until after the termination of the war. Upon the occasion in question the Commonwealth Government refused to discharge its duty by telling the Government of New South Wales that it would manage the dispute with the railway employees, and that it would not permit one State to hold up the industries of the Commonwealth. Quite recently in this House, I pointed out that we required to create an " atmosphere " if we wished to assist recruiting. I am sorry that a speech like that delivered by the honorable member for Illawarra should have been made here, because it <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> not one which is calculated to assist recruiting. I was hopeful that the deliberations of the Conference which was recently held at Government House between the representatives of the various political parties in the Commonwealth would result in some good. I still believe that if things are handled judiciously beneficial results will accrue. I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beeby</inline> has seen fit in to-day's newspapers to qualify any  arrangement which was arrived at by the Conference. Let <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beeby</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> do what is right, and not ask the workers to do so-and-so. Let them say, " In order to bring about a better feeling in the community we are prepared to allow bygones to be bygones. . We are prepared to see that all employees who were displaced as the result of recent industrial troubles are set to work in the various industries. Let us bury the hatchet and reinstate those men who have suffered loss of employment consequent upon the railway strike." Let them say to the employers,' " You must no <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> longer victimize a man who was formerly in your employ. He must be reinstated." We shall then get many more recruits than are offering at the present time. Those who are accustomed to move about amongst the constituencies of working men know well enough the feeling of dissatisfaction which exists there. </para>

                    <para>But I wish to deal more particularly with the question to which reference was made by the honorable member for West Sydney. In the appointment of Boards, consideration should be given, not only to persons having vested interests in the industries to be affected, but also to the workers in those industries, who should receive equal representation with the employers. A number of Boards have been appointed whose members are wholly representatives of the employers and owners. That is true of the Wool Board, the Shipping Board, the Coal Board, and others. But can the community expect to receive fair play from a Board on which only one side is represented? Although there has been a great outcry against the high cost of living, the cost of living is getting higher. The prices of some com- tnoditi.es are regulated by Boards, but the workers have no voice in this matter, though they suffer most from the increases. Until they are given equal representation with other sections of the community, we must expect dissatisfaction. To-day the rich are growing richer, notwithstanding the war, and the poor are getting poorer. This is because of the manipulation of interested individuals. The honorable member for West Sydney referred to the increase in the price of woollen goods. Let me draw the attention of honorable members to the position of a pastoralist referred to in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> in March last. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bracknell,</inline> a station owner near Inverell, New South Wales, with a holding of 24,000 acres, formerly carried on an average 20,000 ewes and from 50 to 100 head of cattle. Ten years before the war, his wool sold at from 12¾d. to 13¼d. per lb. In 1914 the clip was worth 14½d., and in 1915 18½d. In 1916 the price rose to 22½d. In that year he had 20, ewes, with 11,000 lambs at foot, the average yield of wool being 10 lbs.,, and the price he received for it £16,000. This breeder says that his sheep pay all. expenses, what he gets from his wool being clear profit. Is it fair to allow any man to make £16,000 a year at a time like this ? If the price of wool is high because of the demand for it from the Allies, the community, and not particular individuals, should get the advantage. </para>

I think that everything above £400 a year should, at the beginning of the war. have been paid into the Treasury. There would then have been none of the heaping-up of bank accounts which has taken place. </para>

                            <para>- No, it would not. If those who were carrying on certain industries had not been prepared to continue to carry them on under the conditions which I would have prescribed, other persons would have been ready to take their places, and failing them, the Government would have carried on these industries, because the needs of the people must be met. We made a mistake in following the lines laid down by other countries on these matters. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wallace)</inline> referred to the Shipping Board, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is a member. It has power to appoint an Inter-State Board; but this, I understand, is not yet complete, because the Governments of New South Wales and Western Australia have not yet named their nominees - at all events, they had not done so a week ago. Those who have been nominated to the Inter-State Board are, like those who are on the principal Board, representatives of the shipping industry; not one of them is a representative of Labour. The Empire is now fighting with its back to the wall, and should make the best of every ton of shipping it possesses. The Board has, I believe, sent twenty-two boats off this coast, five others -are to follow, and perhaps more may go later. To that I take no exception. But I emphasize the statement that we should make the fullest use of all the vessels that we keep. Is the fullest use being made of them at present? From the information that has been supplied to me, I doubt it. The honorable member for West Sydney named the members of the Board that is dealing with the coal trade and regulating the loading and despatch of boats at the port of Newcastle. I am informed that, because of the existence of two unions since the last industrial trouble, there have been conflicts in connexion with the engagement of labour, and, as a result, boats have been delayed. I am told that those in authority - I do not know whether it is the local representative at Newcastle, or some one else, who is to blame - have refused to accept labour from the union which took part in the strike, giving preference to the so-called loyalists. These are some cases that have been furnished to me - </para>

If she bad taken advantage of three cranes and extra men, she could have been finished about noon on Sunday, and would have been about thirty to forty hours further ahead. She recommenced loading at midnight on Sunday night, at the hydraulic cranes, which could have been avoided by the vessel being shifted to  the  electric cranes. This would, have saved the State Government a considerable amount, as the electric power-house which supplies power for the lighting of the dyke could have been used to load coal into the above vessel. </para>

                <para class="block">If vessels are delayed, ten, twelve, and twenty hours their carrying facilities are not being used to the fullest advantage. The Government should see that this does not continue. There are very many working people throughout the Commonwealth whose livelihood depends on the distribution of coal. The waterside workers are at present having a bad time, because there is little work for them to do. The families of some of them are practically starving, and the Government of New South Wales is setting apart money for their assistance. Many husbands have been unable to get work, except intermittently, since the last strike, because men not belonging to the old unions have received preference. This giving of preference interferes with the success of recruiting. The unionists are accustomed to the work, because they have been doing it all their lives, and they have families to support. You will have to discontinue the differentiation between men. There can be only one union. You cannot have antagonistic unions and give the members of one preference over the members of the other, the employers who control the shipping leaning to those who are against their fellow-unionists. Those who compose the Shipping Board are intrusted with the regulation of freights, but as they all are representatives of the shipping industry they say, " We must have regard to the laws of supply and demand. As tonnage is scarce, and the loading that is offering is great, we are entitled to increased freights." The increasing of freights makes living dearer, though it swells the banking account of those interested in shipping. Nothing has been done to prevent action of this kind. We are allowing those who possess the wealth of the country to acquire more wealth at a time when our boys are risking their lives in the -defence of our liberties and property. We should face the position. Instead of allowing some persons to make money by the decisions of the Boards, we should appoint to these Boards representatives of every class to look after the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. There are in the Coal Employees' Federation about 30,000 members, of whom about 9,000 live in Newcastle and Maitland. That organization should have a voice in the arrangement of matters vitally affecting its members. It should have representation on the Coal Board. At the present time, by reason of the shortage of tonnage, Western Australia is starving for coal; it cannot get sufficient from its own mines. South Australia is in the same position. At Broken Hill, industries are languishing for want of coal. In Victoria, factories are living from hand to mouth in the matter of coal supplies. This state of things is going to get worse. Whom does it affect ? The workers chiefly". The waterside workers feel the pinch, because there is less work for them to do, and those employed in factories are feeling it because the factories cannot continue to employ all their hands. Furthermore, the miners who produce the coal have to work intermittently. The miners, like other classes of the community, are prepared to make sacrifices in a time of national danger, but they ask that all shall be put on the same footing, and equal sacrifices demanded of the whole community. The Government should see that the work in the coal trade is pooled, so that every man in a coal mining district may get a share of what there is to be done. If there is enough work to employ every miner in the district for eight days, let all be employed for that period. Do not let some work eleven days, and others two or three. With the present high cost of living, men cannot make . ends meet when their work is intermittent. No doubt, many of those who are employed regularly are prepared to contribute to help their less1 fortunate brothers, but at present some men are not working at all, having been victimized ever since last August. The Miners Union have contributed nearly £10,000 to keep the wives and children of these men from starving. The Government, however, should put an end to the present state of things. I believe that in Great Britain the workers have been given representation on the various Boards that have been appointed. Yesterday the Prime Minister told us that he had asked Labour representatives to attend conferences, and that they had refused to do so. I believe that the members of the Coal and Shale Miners' Association would be prepared to send a representative to any conference, but they have not had' an opportunity. It is not too late for the Government to recast their proposals, and to provide for the representation of the workers on these Boards. </para>
                <para>To return again to the question of recruiting, I am very glad that there is a better feeling in the community, and I sincerely trust that it will grow. In addition to the obstacles to recruiting to which I have already referred, there are one or two to which attention might also be given. I am pleased that the Minister for Repatriation is endeavouring to provide for returned men. In too many cases, soldiers who have returned incapacitated have been allowed to go without payment of any kind after their discharge; but the Minister, I understand, is making arrangements to remove that grievance. There still remains another matter to which the Government might well give their attention. A man enlists, and before leaving for the Front allots portion of his pay to his wife or to other dependants. Subsequently, while abroad, he is granted furlough, and while on furlough finds it necessary to draw a sum in excess of what he has set apart for himself. Immediately that excess withdrawal is made, a message is sent to Australia to stop an equivalent sum from the payment to be made to his dependants here. The result is that a mother, or wife, or a sister, who has been relying on her fortnightly payments to meet her obligations, is placed in , a most unfortunate position. This should be avoided. The Commonwealth should try to arrive at some means of meeting the situation, even if the money required to keep up the payments to dependants here has to be taken out of the deferred pay coming to the man. It is utterly wrong that the dependant of any soldier at the Front should be left without means of support. </para>
                <para>There is also the case of soldiers who return incapacitated, but are refused a pension on the ground that their incapacity did not arise in connexion with warlike operations. A man, after, perhaps, two years at the Front, returns home iri.; capacitated. He cannot follow his ordinary employment, and although he has a family dependent upon him, he is told that he is not entitled to a pension because his injury did not arise from warlike operations. Cases of this kind are being brought under my notice day after day, and I dare say that is the experience of honorable members generally. </para>

                        <para>- -Perhaps so. In November last, a married man, who had returned incapacitated from the Front, received his discharge; but, although he was unable to work, he received no military pay after his discharge, and was refused a pension on the ground that his incapacity had not resulted from warlike operations. He waited on me while I was at Cessnock last December, and I have been doing what I can to push his claim; but, so far, have not succeeded in obtaining a pension for him. He is unable to work, has no money behind him, and has a wife and small family to support. He was engaged in tunnelling work at Messines, and now that he has returned, can get no help from the Department. Incidents of this kind injure recruiting. Writing to me, he says, "My case is doing a lot of harm to recruiting in this district." Every one knows of it, and such unfair treatment must interfere very seriously with recruiting. The Government should try to remedy grievances of this kind as soon as possible. I believe that the Honorary </para>

                    <para>Another action on the part of the authorities which is also militating against recruiting is of an entirely different kind. Some time ago, a State War Council was appointed in each State, and that Council has the regulation of sport. In every country town, an annual sports meeting is held, and it has been the custom, in connexion with many such gatherings, to have one, or perhaps two, trotting events. No gambling is permitted in connexion with them, yet, although these are purely sports gatherings, trotting events in connexion with them are disallowed in New South Wales to-day. </para>

                            <para>- it can only say that the State Commandant is at the head of the controlling body. By way of illustration, I would point out that there is no better sports meeting in the northern districts of New South Wales than the St. Patrick's Day' sports at Maitland. This annual sports meeting is attended by thousands; but the authorities have prohibited the two trotting events which were always associated with it. While this is so, horse-racing goes on all over the Commonwealth. There is no interference with horse-racing meetings at which gambling is permitted ; but a trotting race, at a purely sports gathering, in connexion with which betting is not allowed, is prohibited. Those who are interested in these sports meetings are naturally soured by such restrictions. They feel it is unfair they should be denied the right to have a couple of trotting events in their programme while horse-race meetings are permitted. Numerous applications have been made to me to secure permission for one or two trotting events at a sports meeting, but all such applications have been turned down by the authorities. This sort of thing does not help recruiting. It does not help us to win the war. It merely gives rise to ill-feeling in the community. Is there any necessity for it? When it was decided that horse-racing should be regulated for the period of the war, a specific number of meetings was allowed every racing club in the Commonwealth; but, trotting having been classified as racing, all" trotting events are disallowed at sports gatherings. A high jump for horses is permitted, but I dare say we shall hear presently that even that has been disallowed. Representatives of rural electorates know that I am correct in saying that this kind of thing does not help recruiting. </para>

                    <para>In conclusion, I have to express the hope that the Government of New South Wales will not indorse the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beeby,</inline> and published to-day. Let the State Government restore the workers to their former position, and, having done so, let them appeal to the manhood of  the country to help on the recruiting movement. In such circumstances, I am confident that they will secure good results. If, on the other hand, we are to have all sorts of conditions imposed - if we are to have " ifs " and " ifs " -  we  shall not make much progress. I doubt whether it is right to have these sectional meetings 'as between State Governments and unionists or employers. The matter is one that should be dealt with by the Commonwealth, since it affects the whole of Australia. In time of war, purely State interests should be subordinated to those of the Commonwealth. We have to safeguard the interests of the nation, and to do our best to prosecute the war to a successful issue. We are all anxious to do that, and when any State takes such action as is calculated to injure recruiting, the Commonwealth should assert its position. There is no limit to our power in time  of  war. </para>

                            <para>- There is such a thing as an abuse of power; but I say unhesitatingly that the control of all matters affecting the war should be undertaken by the Commonwealth. If the Government rise to the occasion, they will do what I have urged. I certainly hope that the State Government of New South Wales will do nothing to retard recruiting. I am anxious to see a better feeling prevailing in the community ; and, while I do not think we can secure an unlimited number of recruits, I certainly do believe-  that we could obtain considerably more than we are getting at present. There is a limit to our man-power resources. In dealing with this phase of the question, we must have regard, not only to our total population, but to the number of men who have already enlisted, and to the number who have volunteered and have been rejected. If that be done, it will be found that the field for recruiting is not as large as many imagine it to be. If we have a united effort and a better political and industrial atmosphere, we should be able, however, to obtain a considerably greater number of recruits than are at present offering. That should be our aim. If the Government will do the right thing - if they will remove the disabilities under which the workers are labouring as the result of industrial troubles and political splits - I shall do the very best I can to help recruiting, just as I did before this trouble happened. "With things as they are one has no hope of success on the recruiting platform; but once the necessary atmosphere is created I am confident that the manhood of Australia, recognising that we are fighting for our very existence, will readily respond to the call to help their brethren on the other side who are taking all risks in the defence of our lives, our liberty, and our homes. </para>

                        <para>.- -I am' sure that we all have listened with interest to the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> than whom there is no more earnest man in this House. I heartily agree with his closing remarks, and am sure we all feel that whether the disabilities to which he has referred be removed or not he will continue to do his duty in the matter of recruiting. We know that"" he is behind the Empire and the flag, and has already made a great sacrifice in allowing his son to go to the Front. Much that the honorable member has said in regard to horse-racing applies with particular  force to my own electorate. I do not hold a brief for horse or pony racing. As a matter of fact, I have attended only two such meetings in my life. But when we find that forty-eight trotting and pony race meetings are permitted in Sydney every year it is difficult to understand why people in the western districts of New South Wales, as well as in other rural electorates, should be denied the right to have one or two trotting events at a sports meeting. I was approached the other day by the secretary of the Forbes Racing Club! on behalf of the Bathurst, Cowra, Canowindra, Forbes, 'and other racing clubs, who desire to hold one meeting per annum. Application was made for the necessary permission, but was absolutely refused. If horse-racing retards recruiting, then it would be a good thing to stop it altogether, but since forty-eight trotting and pony race meetings are permitted in the metropolis of Sydney every year - and I daresay the proportion is the same in Melbourne - there is no reason why residents of country districts should not have some consideration in that respect. We desire to focus all our efforts and bend all our energies in the one direction of winning the war; but this differential treatment of town and country residents militates against successful recruiting. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Hunter said that a resident of Inverell had this year made a profit of £16,000 owing to the increased price of wool. In September last I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> the Commonwealth Statistician, what was the increased profits made since the war by the pastoralists of Australia in respect of their wool. I desired the information in connexion with a speech that I proposed to deliver on the War-times Profits Bill, and the reply I received was that the increased amount for the whole Commonwealth was only £350,000. That amount has to be divided amongst all the pastoralists of Australia. </para>

How, then, can the honorable member say that because two referendums were turned down against us we do not possess the confidence of the people f </para>

It is a purely national question. Whether you are Labour or Nationalist, strip all considerations of party from your minds, and vote on this question purely on national grounds." Surely the honorable member for Capricornia does not include the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lynch)</inline> among the Labour voters on the " No " side? The honorable member for Werriwa was an anti-conscriptionist, and took the platform against conscription, but certainly he was not advocating the Labour cause on that occasion. I object to the utterly hollow sham, hypocrisy, and inconsistency of the statements of s the honorable member for Capricornia. </para>

                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition also said that his party would not be represented at the Imperial Conference. Whom would he send if he did not send the Prime Minister and his assistant? New Zealand has sent its Prime Minister and the previous Leader of the Opposition, who is working in harmony with him. Canada has sent representative men who are not members of the Opposition. The Leader of the Government goes in every case. When the Leader of the Opposition was sitting on this side of the House and his Government sent the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> to England, were we represented at all? Was any word then said about our not being represented. The Leader of the Opposition also  urged  that the House should have met, and that the different claims which Australia had to  make  at the Conference should have been set out in the House. When the honorable member for Bendigo went to England before, were the Australian claims discussed in the House? No, they were never mentioned. The Prime  Minister  has not gone to the Conference on his own initiative, nor  has  the Minister for the Navy. They received a pressing invitation. Cablegrams  came on two occasions  pressing  them to go to England to represent Australia there as Australia should be rep resented . </para>

                            <para>- To form a Fusion Government, and to have representatives in that Government in proportion to the number of his supporters. That was a fair proposition to make. The olive branch was. extended to the Leader of the Opposition, and the gentlemen sitting behind him. Instead of accepting it as patriotic, loyal citizens of the Empire, they turned it down with contempt. If the Leader of the Opposition is not represented at the Conference, the blame lies with the gentlemen on the opposite side, and not with us. Only the other day in the House both the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy repeated that invitation te the Leader of the Opposition. </para>

                            <para>- Australia should be represented at the Conference. After the last Conference the suggestion was made that the islands in the Pacific and other German colonies should be returned to Germany. I set my face against that proposition. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> also suggested the same thing, and I believe many honorable members on the Opposition side are behind him. For the future safety of Australia, not only would I hold on to those possessions, but the object of every true Australian should be to use all his energies and influence to have the various islands in the Pacific south of the equator brought under the suzerainty and control of Australia. </para>

                    <para>I urge the Government to consider seriously the advisability of amending the electoral law, so as to introduce preferential voting for the House of Representatives. There cannot fairly be any opposition to that proposal, because the system of preferential voting is adopted for selection purposes in all our leagues, whether Labour or National. If it is right in that case, it is equally right to apply the same principle to elections for the House of Representatives. </para>

                            <para>- I maintain that it will be a move in the right direction. It will certainly go a long way towards doing away with machine politics. Under present conditions, no one who does not belong to a National or Labour association has the slightest chance at the polls. An election is pending for Flinders, in Victoria. There is a Labour nominee, a National nominee, and a Farmers Union candidate. </para>

                            <para>- Then why does not the honorable member support the proposal for preferential voting, and thus give the farmers a chance of returning a representative to this House against a Labour man? At the last election for the Flinders electorate, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine received a majority of 6,000 votes. I do not know the actual number of votes polled, but let us suppose there are 30,000 voters at the forthcoming by-election for the same electorate. If three gentlemen go to the poll the Labour candidate will probably secure 12,000 votes, and be returned, while his two opponents will divide 18,000 votes between them. With preferential voting, this would be of no consequence, because there would still be a possibility of the contingent votes being cast in such a way as to return a member supporting this party. </para>

I want to tell the honorable member that, on the very morning of the day on which he made this statement, I had been round to the various Departments, and had secured a promise of 3,500 bales of cornsacks for the Farmers and Settlers Co-operative Society of New South Wales. That is only one little thing that I have done for the farmers. Day and night I am working for their interests. Possibly the honorable member was still in bed when I was round in the Departments that morning. We farmers get up early and do things. </para>

I will not use the hackneyed expression that they are the backbone of the country ; but I do maintain that they are the ballast of the country, and that if Australia is kept on an even keel, it will be owing to their efforts. The Commonwealth Government should take a leaf out of the policy of the New South Wales Government, who have guaranteed to the farmers a payment of 4s. per bushel, cash on delivery at the railway station, for the 1918, 1919, and 1920 wheat crops. </para>

We were told by the Governments, State and Federal, which established the Wheat Pool for the 1915-16 crop, that the last shilling for that crop would be paid by November, 1916; but we have not been fully paid yet. In New South Wales3½d. per bushel remains unpaid, in Victoria 4d. per bushel, and in . South Australia not so much. </para>

One thing about the offer made by the New South Wales Government is the definite promise to pay 4s. per bushel cash on delivery. The farmers have received only 3s. per bushel for last year's crop. Every penny of that 3s. is eaten up in expenses. It is the last shilling that counts to the farmer. </para>

                            <para>- I am diametrically opposed to the suggestion made by the Government that the Inter-State Commission should fix the price of beef and mutton in Australia. If Ministers are anxious to burst up the pastoral and grazing industries, let them carry out their suggestion. They could do it in no better way. A little while ago the Minister for Lands in the State of New South Wales suggested that people should cease to grow wheat, because it did not pay them, and take up grazing. Many farmers in that State took the hint, and sold their farming implements, in order to put the proceeds of the sales into sheep and cattle - in the Wyalong district there were as many as eighteen auction sales of implements in one week - but as soon as they had done so, the Federal Government came forward with the suggestion that the price of beef and mutton should be reduced by 2d. per lb. - to the export price of Queensland meat. Since the drought the only State which has been exporting meat is Queensland. In the other States the demand has been so great that there has been no meat available for export. Queensland does not provide fair criterions. In that State, bullocks can be fattened on land that costs £10 an acre, whereas in New South Wales the necessary land costs £30, so that something like three times the amount of money has to be invested to obtain the same result. </para>

                    <para>A great many people are of the opinion that the high price of cattle and sheep is owing to a ring of graziers or combine. I have been interested in grazing for some time, and I am intimately acquainted with a great many graziers; and I never heard of a single' case of the price being fixed by them. We send our stock to Homebush, or some other market, where it is knocked down to the highest bidder. If there is anything we have nothing to do with, it is the fixing of prices. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, without hitting the wrong man. If the honorable member can suggest any way in which the price can be reduced without affecting the men 'to whom I refer, we shall certainly be pleased to hear what he has  to  say. At present we are in the throes of a drought, with the result that graziers have to send their stock into the market. There was no war in 1902, when we had what I suppose is the record drought of Australia. We then lost thousands of cattle and sheep, with the result that beef and  mutton  rose to prohibitive prices, just as is happening at the present time; indeed, in my opinion, if there had been no war, beef and mutton would have attained the same high level.. I have some figures here showing the number and value of the sheep and cattle in Australia before the war as compared with the end of 1915. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am speaking the truth. In 1913 there were in Australia sheep to the number of 78,600,334, whereas at the end of 1915- which are the latest figures - there were 69,257,189, or a shortage of 9,343,145. In other words, we had at the end of 1915 14 sheep <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> of population, as against 16 <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> before the war. In previous good seasons, as in 1875, there have been in some years as many as 20 sheep <inline font-style="italic">per capita;</inline> but if the population increases, and sheep decrease, of course the price must go up. As for cattle, in 1913 there were 11,483,882, whereas in 1915 there were 9,931,416, showing a shortage of 1,552,466. If the Government carry out their proposals, as suggested by the  Chairman  of the Inter-Stale Commission, it means, assuming the average weight of <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> beast at 480 lbs., a reduction of something like £4 a head, or a reduction in the aggregate value of £39,725,664. Assuming the conservative value of 30 lbs., or 5s. for sheep, the Government proposals will mean a reduction in the value of . £17,314,297. In other words, by a stroke of the pen the value of the assets of the graziers of Australia are reduced to the extent of £57,039,961. </para>

                    <para>The working classes are, I think, amply protected. I have never heard of a case before the Arbitration Court, or a Wages Board, in which the first plea was not that increased wages were necessary because of the high cost of living, and the first item always quoted is meat. If the increased price of beef and mutton is covered by increased wages, I submit that the interests of the working classes are protected; and I cannot see where their argument for lower prices comes in. In no country in the world, unless it be South Africa, do the people enjoy such cheap beef and mutton as is enjoyed in Australia to-day, and nowhere are wages so high. I am not saying anything against this state of affairs, because I am pleased to see beef and mutton so cheap; but why should we make it cheaper if in doing so we penalize a useful section of the community ? </para>

I do not say anything against the butchers, because when prices are affected in Sydney by the carcass butchers the retail prices have naturally to come up to the same level. The source of the whole trouble is in the metropolitan centres. </para>

                    <para>I am not quite satisfied with the present constitution of the Arbitration Court. The Judge of that Court <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Justice Higgins)</inline> was appointed for a term of seven years, and then his term was renewed for a further seven years. The work of the Court has developed to great dimensions, and very big issues are involved: A decision given by the Court the other day resulted in an increase of wages in one industry by £4,000,000. I do not wish to debate the rights and wrongs of that decision, but I think that too much power is vested in the hands of one man. Other tribunals which deal with questions of minor importance compared with those dealt with in the Arbitration Court comprise three men. In New South Wales the Land Boards and Land Appeal Courts have each a <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of three, and the Appeal Court of the Supreme Court is composed of a bench of from three to seven Judges. Those Courts often deal with questions of quite minor importance, yet the Arbitration Court - the decisions of which sometimes involve millions of pounds - is controlled by one Judge. </para>

                            <para>- This is not a party question. These two delegates represent not only their own party, but the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. This Parliament, elected by the people, has a right to know what policy our delegates are to put forward. I strongly object to the Prime Minister going to England without being bound in regard to the policy he is to advocate. I agree with those who say that the attitude of the Prime Minister at the Paris Economic Conference when he declared that we must, not only beat Germany to her knees, but also conduct an economic war against her subsequently, is one of the influences that has prolonged the war. If he repeats those speeches at the forthcoming Conference he will not be representing the views of the Australian people. There is a vast public opinion that we cannot beat Germany to her knees. I myself have reached that conclusion, much as I would like to defeat Germany. We must have regard to the facts. One fact is that we are confronted with a very big task, and I say it is not worth the sacrifice of human life involved to continue the war until we absolutely beat the Germans in order to regain the territory we have lost in Belgium and France. </para>

                            <para>- I am not responsible for that. As members of the Labour party we have our individual views, but the only man who speaks for the party is the Leader, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> is not our leader yet. As a party we are anxious to assist the Empire and our Allies to win the war speedily, if that is possible, and we are putting no obstacle in the way of the Government, so far as that is concerned. But any declaration that we intend to beat Germany to her knees and then conduct an economic war only strengthens the determination of the German people  to fight to a finish. Men who go to London to represent the people of this country should not be loud-mouthed about what they intend to do in that direction. I believe that even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George has put before the German people opinions which have misled them as to our aims in this war. I read in the Scottish papers that because of his boastful speeches, from many of which he has had to back down, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George is not as popular as he was in Great Britain. Whilst we are anxious to win the war, any man who, by his speeches, prolongs the struggle a day longer than is necessary, is an enemy to his country and to humanity. We should neglect no steps that are possible to bring about an equitable peace. This Commonwealth must have an influx of population, and to that end we must have the goodwill of people in all parts of the world. We should be amongst the first to say that we " do not subscribe to any policy of beating the Germans <inline font-style="italic">\o</inline> their knees and boycotting them economically afterwards. I believe in a policy of no annexations aud no indemnities. If our delegates have gone to England to advocate an equitable peace1, I wish them God-speed, but if the Prime Minister repeats the speeches he made on . the occasion of his former visit; he will not be representing the views of the Australian people, and will be doing an injury to the Allies and to this country. </para>

                    <para>A paragraph in the Ministerial statement alludes to the gravity of the situation, and states that we must mobilize for the protection of this country. Have we no right as a Parliament to know the reasons for this view concerning the gravity of the situation ? The State Governor of New South Wales, speaking at Bathurst, a few days ago, read a cablegram from the King calling upon his subjects to assist the Empire at this moment on account of the urgent need for more men. The Prime Minister and all the State Governors  have received that cablegram, but the Leader of the Government has put the message in his pocket and withheld its contents from Parliament. I resent the -action of the Prime Minister in neglecting to make available to Parliament the information he has regarding the situation in Europe. -He is not the only man in the community who should have that information. The cablegram was sent, not to W. M. Hughes, but to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, and it was his duty to make known to the people, through Parliament, the nature of the grave situation. I understand that already the Government have called up 40,000 men for home defence. What increase in the gravity of our position has justified the removal of 40,000 additional men from the avenues of industry, and the consequent disorganization of business and dislocation of homes that the sending of these men into camp has involved? In Sydney, on Saturday afternoon, there was quite a commotion. Trams were stopped in the streets to permit the military to ase special trams to take men to Coogee, Botany Bay, Watson's Bay, and other points. What was the reason for this? Was it the intention to cause a sensation, or to get men into the camp with a view to inducing them, when there, to volunteer for service overseas? If that was the reason for what was done, it seems to me a very costly method of recruiting. Employers in a small way have come to me and complained that two or three of their men were taken away from their employment, and their business was upset. We have had no explanation of this, and Parliament does not know the reason why it_ was done. In my view, honorable members will not be doing their duty if they permit the Government to remain in power without explaining these things to the House. It is not too much to ask the Acting Prime Minister to say why these 40,000 men were called up. Is there any special danger to Australia imminent? Are there any raiders on our coast? If so, we ought to know it. </para>

                    <para>According to the Ministerial statement, we are promised a number of Committees for the regulation of industries. One Committee is to be appointed to regulate the prices of commodities. The Government have so far completely failed to regulate the prices of foodstuffs. The matter is being transferred to the Trade and Customs Department, and the Government propose to call to the assistance of the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Massy Greene)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> two keen business men, representatives of the Stock Exchanges or Chambers of Commerce. The Government, in this matter, are really endeavouring to avoid their proper responsibility. There should be a permanent Board, quite apart from the Chambers of Commerce, appointed to deal with the fixing of prices. There should be a Minister in charge of the matter, and he ought to know the cost of materials, and of manufactured articles, and should see that prices are regulated upon a fair margin of profit only. In every State to-day, great profits are being made in many lines. If we take the building trade, the price of galvanized iron for roofing has been increased by more than 100 per cent. I have seen this galvanized iron being made at Lithgow, and I know that there is no need for the present high cost of this building material. The same thing applies to ironmongery, paints, and timber. The shortage of shipping is being used at the present time as an excuse for doubling the price of hardwood timber, although we know that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Allan</inline> Taylor has a fleet of steamers on the north coast shipping timber just as they used to do before the war. No Government is doing its duty in the regulation of prices while this kind of thing is allowed to go on. </para>
                    <para>On the subject of the shipbuilding proposal of the Government, I notice that a statement appears in to-day's newspapers to the effect that America would be prepared to put 3,000,000 into the field this year if she could get the necessary shipping. We are all agreed that shipping is the pivot on which the war is going to turn. The Allies have more men, more wealth, and better equipment, than the Germans, and it is only a. question of making them available. During the last twelve months, the Government have had a golden opportunity to push forward the shipbuilding industry, but they are only now getting the wheels of that industry going. </para>

                            <para>- We had men here who understood shipbuilding. Six months ago the State Government of New South Wales offered to take a contract for the building of ships at Walsh Island. They have a manager there in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler,</inline> and there is no man in Australia who can teach him anything about the shipbuilding industry. He was prepared to enter into a contract for the building of ships, but for some reason, whether it was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hughes</inline> was not good friends with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> or not, I do not know, the offer was not accepted, and no shipbuilding has been carried on at that island. I believe that at the present time contracts have been let for shipbuilding there, but the island might have been used for the purpose six months ago. The Broken Hill Company were prepared to make the necessary plates and angle iron, but something intervened, and nothing was done. At Cockatoo Island, where the <inline font-style="italic">Warrego, Swan,</inline> and another destroyer were recently launched, the great cantilever cranes, and all the other necessary equipment for shipbuilding, have been allowed to remain idle. It is a criminal act on the part of the Government to have so long delayed the construction of ships. We have the men and the material, and if we bent our energies to the building of ships at the present time, we should be doing something to win the war. </para>

When they reached the city, they were disbanded at the railway station, with orders to go down to Martin-place, and when the recruiting meeting started, to jump on to the platform and enlist. That was, no doubt, very nice, but it was only acting the showman. These men had already enlisted, and they were ordered to make a show of enlisting again. As a result, we got word over here that so many men had enlisted »t Martin-place, and there was great blowing of trumpets about it. I hope that recruiting is not going to be carried on in that way. </para>

                            <para>- I ask the Minister to inquire into the statement. If we are really going in for recruiting, and if the Government intend to carry out their promise to place the unions in the position which they occupied before the strike, we should be doing better work if we put all our weight into the business of recruiting at the present time. I for one will be pleased to do my part in it; but I want to see the Government carry out their pledge to re-register the unions, and place them in the position they occupied before the strike. I want them to put the men who have been victimized back into their employment. If they do these things, they will go a long way towards healing the breach in this community. </para>

Once he gives up the right to strike he becomes a slave, and so far as I am concerned I will give no guarantee that there will not be a strike. I hope that the Government will lose no time in giving effect to their promises to reinstate the unions. If they do that, they will have the fullest cooperation, not merely of members on this side, but of the people generally. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to say something in opposition to the departure of the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy, allegedly to represent the views, aspirations, and ideals of Australia at the Imperial Conference. After our experiences of the Prime Minister's hysterical doings, first in Paris, arid then at this table yesterday, when he indorsed the sentiments which he uttered in Paris - notwithstanding that the whole of the Paris resolutions have since been repudiated - one can only insist that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> will not- be representing the views of Australia at. the Imperial Conference. Those statements of his at the Paris Conference have been repudiated by such men as Bonar Law, Asquith, Lloyd George, and  President  Wilson. Yet we heard the Prime Minister say yesterday that he would give the last drop of his blood for those same things. If he is going to attend the Imperial Conference with the retention of those views, of what use will he be either to Australia or to the Allies? </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>While I emphatically  protest  against the Prime Minister representing the Commonwealth in London, I am not so sure that it is not just as well that he has departed from these shores. He certainly cannot do the harm in England that he has done in Australia. He will not have the awful power there which he has held here; and the men controlling the war policy of Britain will not allow that same hysteria, vindictiveness, and spleen to be demonstrated in England that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has shown in Australia. While he, with his distorted vision, can work for the subjugation of everybody in this community to his ideas, we are glad to think that he will not hold the same sway in England. Australia is very well rid of the Prime Minister* and, with all due respect to honorable members who ought to be opposite at the present moment, they are very well rid of him, too. I venture to prophesy that, while .he may return still bearing the title of Prime Minister, he will not retain it long after he has stepped again upon our shores. I trust that, meanwhile,- we shall enter into an era of peacefulness, and that there will be no further signs of the vindictiveness and spleen which have held sway during the past eighteen months or two years. I hope that the people generally, and honorable members opposite, will appreciate  our entrance upon some approach to sane government - of government, at least, not upon vindictive lines, such as has been the case under the chief dictatorship of the Prime Minister. I do not doubt his earnestness, nor do I doubt the earnestness of a mad bull in a china shop. The Prime Minister has created a bitterness - a feeling of unrest, of suspicion, of class hatred - and all to prove that his every action has been right. And, unfortunately, he has not been alone in that respect. There are honorable members who left this party who are continually attacking different sections of the community in the effort to make people think that they alone are on the right track. </para>
                    <para>Before the Prime Minister left, he made certain promises. Personally, I do not give the slightest weight to them; but I hope that those who are now in control - and it is going to be an altogether different control - will take immediate steps to repeal a great number of the regulations under the War Precautions Act. There are many of them which should never have been framed. I anticipate that the Acting Prime Minister will, in the very near future, announce his intention to cancel them. I hope, also, to learn of the steps to be taken to do away altogether with the campaign of vindictiveness and persecution carried on by the Prime Minister. The Acting Prime Minister, and members of Cabinet generally, have a big job ahead to repair the damage done by the gentlemen taking ship to-day. I have hopes, however, that those repairs will be effectively made. There are a hundred and one things which have brought about hostility on the part of, large sections of the community towards the Government; and there are good grounds for that hostility. I myself am hostile, for many reasons. One of those has been represented by the honorable member for Hunter, the honorable member for West Sydney, and others, in dealing with the question of governmental control of shipping, wool, wheat, &amp;c. Last week I dealt with the treatment meted out by agents of shippers to the farmers. The shippers to-day have practical control of the Wheat Board. The Prime Minister magnanimously gave the farmers of the whole of Australia one representative upon that Board. </para>

Unless the Government are prepared to take away some of the plums from the Shipping Ring and allow the farmers to mind their own affairs, in the same way as the wool-growers have been permitted to do, there will be an outbreak of hostility from the rural community. Take the question of the dockages which are now being made by the agents representing the shippers. Instances have come under my notice where dockages up to1s. per bushel have been made for smut.. This wheat may have been slightly smutty, but the dockage has come off, notwithstanding that it has been equal to f.a.q., and even up to 59 and 60 lbs. per bushel in weight. </para>

I have previously indicated in this House the wide powers of discrimination held by agents in the matter of dockage. It does not matter that the weight may be over the standard; if it shows a sign of smut, off comes a big dockage, even up to1s. That is totally wrong. The Government must exercise their powers and secure efficient control. They must devise scientific means of determining what the wheat is worth. It should not be left to the autocratic word of men, some of whom, until but a little while ago, had done nothing all their lives but wield a quill, and who are now dictators. </para>

                    <para>There is also the question of secondhand bags. This, too, is causing a great deal of dissatisfaction, and with some cause. Owing to the laxity of the Government - due to their benevolent attitude in allowing private enterprise to take a hand in business which should have belonged to the Government alone in days such as these - private enterprise was able to fix the price of wheatsacks in the first place. The Commonwealth Government then fixed the price for new sacks. That was right, but it did not go far enough; for all the big companies - Dalgety and Co., and the rest of them - secured the opportunity to control and corner available second-hand sacks. And then, after the corner had been arranged, came the fixing of the price for second hand sacks. Prior to that the figures soared as high as 12s. per dozen, and private enterprise reaped considerable profit from the farmers. It was after this that the fixing of the quotation for second hand sacks came about. That was good and proper; but the authorities did not take the trouble to see that sufficient supplies of new sacks were brought into Australia to meet the demand. Seven months ago several honorable members, together with myself, inquired from the Prime Minister what steps were being taken to see that the farmers were supplied with sacks in sufficient quantities. The right honorable gentleman solemnly and sincerely promised that adequate steps were being taken to protect the farmers. Adequate steps were taken, right enough ; but it was the interests of the profiteers which were protected. Whether it was done with the cognisance of the Government or not, I would not care to say; but there was no excuse for them - no excuse for that wholesale robbing of the rural interests. Then, to add insult to injury, the Government appointed a special Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitton,</inline> to ascertain whose fault it was.  His  report, I understand, will be available shortly. It will not redound to the credit of the </para>
                    <para class="block">Government that if second-hand bags, costing the farmer from 9s. 6d. to 10s. per dozen, are allowed to go into the wheat stacks in New South Wales, deductions should then be made on account of the quality of sacks used. I can quote a case of one farmer who paid from 9s. 6d. to 10s. per dozen for his bags, and when he delivered his wheat the agent docked him ls. per bag. In another case a farmer, who had paid 10s. to 10s. 6d. for second-hand bags, was similarly docked. The interim receipt, pending the arrival of the wheat certificates, states that wheat in bags unfit for shipment overseas shall be docked ls. per bag.u At a station in New South Wales wheat in second-hand bags was placed in a separate stack, the presumption being that the bags were unfit for shipment, but I understand that some of the grain has been sent overseas. The point is that the Wheat Pool benefits by transactions of this nature, but the unfortunate farmer who is docked because he is using secondhand bags is treated very harshly indeed. </para>
                    <para>Another question which I dealt with recently was the complaint that farmers could not get seed wheat in their own districts. I drew the attention of the Government to the case of a farmer who had his land ready for seeding, but was unable to procure fourteen bags of hard Federation seed wheat, notwithstanding that millions of bushels were available within a short distance of his own farm. Many honorable members on the Ministerial side of the House pooh-poohed the idea at the time, but I have now put a concrete case before the House. </para>

                            <para>- Evidently the secretary of the Wheat Board was unaware what types of wheat were stacked at the different stations. It is shameful that farmers who have wheat in the Pool should be required to go to private enterprise to obtain their seed wheat, because the seed wheat must first be sent to Sydney, where, no doubt, it is bought by Foster and Son, seedsmen, who, after they get their cut out of it, then ship it back to the district in which it is grown. These things must be remedied if the Government expect that harmony in the community which is so much talked about at the present time in this House. </para>

                    <para>One other matter which is causing a good deal of dissatisfaction at present is the position with regard to the rabbit and rabbit-skin trade, which is absolutely controlled by a few persons. During the past ten months there has been something very sinister about the control of the rabbit industry in this country, and many disquieting things have been said about the way in which the Government have allowed this business to fall into the hands of a combine, the members of which do just as they please. Immediately I entered the house I approached the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> to see if it was possible to get a price fixed for rabbits. This is not a small matter, because not less than 8,000 people are concerned in this industry throughout Australia. After numberless deputations, letters, and interviews we at last got the Prime Minister to agree that the Price Fixing Commissioner should go into the whole question. We obtained information from all parts of Australia, and placed the facts and figures before the Commissioner, who was ready to fix the price when something peculiar happened. It was suddenly discovered by some one who had a frantic desire to prevent anything being done, that action to control the industry would be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> Many weird theories were devised to keep the combine in full control of the industry, and I say that the Government have not come out of this business with clean hands. I am not prepared to say what Minister is responsible, but I have drawn the attention of the Government to this damnable state of affairs, not once, but many times. </para>

                            <para>- I mean that the Rabbit Combine has done just what it liked in regard to rabbits. To-day it is making huge profits at the expense of the consumers and of the. trappers. The first paltry excuse put forward by the Government for their inaction was that, under the War Precautions Act Regulations, it would be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> to fix the price chat should be paid to the trappers of rabbits. I wrote to the Prime Minister and asked him to make it legal, but he did not even deign to reply to my letter. I did not expect him to reply to it. I repeat that I have practically lived on the door-step of the Price Fixing Commissioner, of the Prime Minister, and of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> in my endeavours to get some measure of redress for the thousands of trappers who are concerned in this industry. When the second contract was about to be entered into, we received a direct promise from the Minister and from the Price Fixing Commissioner that the rates payable to the trappers in Australia would be definitely prescribed. As a result, great jubilation was evinced by the various delegates who attended a conference which had been convened for the purpose of considering this matter. Personally, I was somewhat pessimistic regarding the outcome of that gathering by reason of my unfortunate experience with the Government. I was very doubtful, indeed, as to whether anything favorable to the trappers in Australia would result from it. Then we learned that the contracts had been cancelled, and thus ended the scheme of price- fixing. About this time, for some inscrutable reason, the Government decided to cancel the fixation of prices in regard to rabbit skins. I would like to know at whose behest that cancellation took place. Certain it is that such action operated directly in the interests of the exporters - that is to say, of the buyers. I may state, for the information of honorable members, that for skins for which we receive ls. 2d. per lb., and even less,11s. and 12s. per lb. are being paid in England to-day, and from 9s. 6d. to 10s.6d. per lb. in America. I have placed these facts before the Minister from time to time, so that he cannot plead ignorance of them. Our rabbit trappers are being flagrantly robbed. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that there have been freight difficulties, but every now and again some of the skins getaway. It is undeniable that some persons who are adepts at pulling the strings, can secure sufficient space to permit of their rabbit skins being exported, whilst others cannot do so. That circumstance, in itself, is sufficient to warrant an inquiry into this matter. Three months ago I made charges against the Government; and moved for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the corruption which surrounds the whole business; but the Government refused the appointment of that Committee. What is the position to-day? In New South Wales, we find that the Rabbit Combine is operating along quite new lines. When the Commonwealth Government failed to fix prices in connexion with the industry, this Combine got to work and induced the Meat Board in Sydney, through the Assent-General for New South Wales; to make representations to the British Government, with the result that on the 24th April of this year the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper contained the following announcement: - </para>

                        <para>- The Rabbit Combine has effectively checkmated all attempts to restrict its operations, and has made exorbitant profits with the cognisance of, and evidently with the consent of, the Commonwealth Government.. The contract which will be entered into by the New South Wales Government will be for the supply of about 500,000boxes of skinned rabbits, for which the British Government will pay 17s. a box. Under the contract with the Commonwealth Government, the price paid by the British Government was 19s. a box, including skins. I protest against the subordination of the Commonwealth to a State Government. I believe that the Rabbit Combine has worked the oracle to prevent the trappers of rabbits from getting a fair deal. The Commonwealth Government has made over £300,000 from the rabbit trappers of Australia. That money should have gone into the pockets of the trappers; but, by an unfortunate accident, it went into the coffers of the Commonwealth Government instead, although it belongs morally to the trappers. </para>

                    <para>Let me refer again to the way in which the Holdsworthy Camp, in New South Wales, is conducted. The officers in charge of the Camp seem to desire from the men continual saluting, and the German goose-stepping. Recently, on a wet and stormy evening, they ordered the trooping of colours merely to gratify their own whim. Such ceremonies may be necessary in a training camp, but this cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be so termed, the men composing the guard there being mostly either ineligible for active service or returned soldiers. Oilskins have been served out to the guard, but they are so tattered and worn as to be no protection against the elements. The men should not be required to perform futile and ridiculous ceremonies merely to please the officers in charge of the camp. The fines that have been inflicted at the Camp are such that the Assistant Minister for Defence might well inquire into the matter. One soldier was fined 10s. for being late for the dinner parade, and others have been fined various sums, ranging from ls. to 10s., for appearing at mess with tunics undone, putties off, or clothing in other ways out of conformity with the regulations. The military despots who rule the Camp have created such a position that they are advertising almost fortnightly for guards. That should not be. </para>
                    <para>One other matter. There is a general desire on the part of members, and of the public, that there should be harmony in the community; but some of the members of the Ministerial party are making speeches the tendency of which is to create the reverse of harmony. This afternoon the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lamond)</inline> went out of his way to create bad feeling. He never speaks here without sneering and jeering at the Labour party. </para>

                            <para>- And with which he was reluctant to part. In a speech as hysterical and jingoistic as that of the Prime Minister yesterday, he poured forth venom, and did what he could to prevent the harmony which is so desirable. He jeered at members on this side, stating that we have climbed into our positions from the backs of the workers. There is not one member on this side of the chamber who did not work for his living before he entered Parliament. The honorable member himself battened parasitically on the Labour movement from its inception. He has been fed by it, and enjoyed a cosy job which it provided. He knows what it is to climb to a position from the backs of the workers. Under the guise of a Liberal, he first tried to enter Parliament in opposition to a selected Labour candidate. The Labour movement is generous enough to forgive such conduct. When he saw that the Liberals did not want him, and that the Labour party was becoming powerful, he changed his coat, and thereafter lived upon the workers. He is not of the type that fastens on to a pick and shovel or a shearing machine. He got a job from the Australian Workers Union, and, during the eighteen ' years that he held it, tried frantically to obtain a selection for Parliament. But the rank and file of the Labour movement, with great wisdom, rejected him on every occasion, and, becoming soured by his repeated failures, he again changed his coat. Now, wonder of wonders, he is the mouth-piece of the Employers Federation, and of the vested interests of the community. He preached about climbing into positions from the backs of the workers, but, after eighteen years of battening on the workers, he kicked them aside to get into the pay of some one else. He does not represent the workers of Illawarra. </para>

While- there exist regulations which prevent honorable members from discussing public matters there will be friction, and it will increase: Of what benefit to the country or to the Empire and its Allies are regulations such as the notorious Sinn Fein regulation, which merely vents the spleen of a sectarian clique? There are one hundred and one ways in which disloyalty can be punished; but, at the dictation of some persons outside, the Prime Minister is prepared to do anything to harass a section of a community. I am not Irish, and do not belong to the Roman Catholic Church, but I would not tolerate a regulation such as this that I speak of if it were imposed against my enemies. It is not fair to use war legislation to injure one's political enemies. If the Government is in earnest, the Acting Prime Minister will next week inform the House of the regulations that are to be repealed, and I shall welcome such an announcement. </para>

                    <para>For these statements the Government are responsible. They are responsible for each and all of them. </para>
                    <para>The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> asks what warrant I have for that assertion. </para>
                    <para>My reply is that they are responsible, in the first place, for the statement made in the printed pamphlet outlining the policy of the Government, and which is now being discussed by the House. </para>
                    <para>They are responsible for the statement made by the Governor-General, since such a statement could not have been put forward by him except with the advice of his responsible Ministers. </para>
                    <para>They are responsible, also, for the statements appearing in the newspapers for the reason that there is a censorship which compels every item relating to the war to be  submitted  to Government officers before it can be printed. Therefore, this press statement of an alarmist character must have been submitted to a Government officer. The probabilities are that if was actually inspired by some agency of the Government. </para>
                    <para>Concerning these serious statements by the Ministry, by the Governor-General, and by the press, the Government remain absolutely silent in the National Parliament. They are silent in regard to a question which, we are told, is fraught with the gravest forebodings. Members of this Parliament appear to act like a lot of school children. Beyond a mere question put to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> yesterday in respect to these alarmist paragraphs- a question which the right honorable gentleman brushed aside with the reply that he could give no information in regard to it - the Parliament itself does not appear to have concerned itself in the slightest degree with the safety of this country. </para>
                    <para>Nearly every honorable member opposite can stand in this House, and on platforms outside, and plead for thousands of men to go 12,000 miles across the seas to help Britain in the war in which we are now engaged ; but they treat with contempt admissions by the Government, as well as by the Governor-General and the press, that this war is coming right home to Australia, and that we must get ready to fight on our own shores. This National Parliament apparently thinks it 'has nothing to do with such a matter. </para>
                    <para>This, then, is the attitude of the National Parliament, charged as it is with the responsibility of safeguarding Australia's shores. The defence of Australia is, indeed, its first responsibility. It is not charged with the duty of defending the Empire, or with the responsibility of maintaining inviolate the British shores. But it is charged, under our Constitution, and by the people of Australia, with the responsibility of defending Australia. No graver statements than those just quoted could be made. Yet, in regard to them, responsible Ministers are silent in the National Parliament. The National Parliament has become so disregardful of one of the main purposes of its existence that it does not appear to desire to ask even a question concerning it. </para>
                    <para>Here are other statements by responsible Ministers. On 21st September last the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cook),</inline> referring to expenditure ou our Naval Bases, said - </para>
                    <para>My only fear is that the items are being cut down too much, in view of the international situation. </para>

                    <para>So far as Naval Bases are concerned, the only thing I am uneasy about is as to whether we are getting on with them sufficiently fast. I intend to he quite clear about this matter before very much longer. It seems to me that all the argument is in favour of proceeding with the construction of Bases as well as ships, and with the rapid multiplication of all our enginery of war to the fullest extent, having regard to our position after the war, and the possibilities that may then arise. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Treasurer, now the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> said, on the 13th September last - </para>
                    <para>I say, with the full concurrence of the Government, and particularly of the Minister for Defence, that at present the position of Australia is unsafe. </para>

If it is to be a long-drawn-out struggle, how many men is it wise for Australia to send per month - is it wise to deplete the Whole male population of Australia merely because of the emotions of the people for the time being? Moreover, this is a war in which the resources, not only of man power, but of money, must be considered. Though I was a member of a previous Government which had some responsibility in connexion with this matter of Australia's contribution - and if there is any blame to be attached to that Government I will take my full share - that is no reason why I should not invite attention for, and give support to, ' the suggestions made by Mr.Ryan. </para>

                    <para class="block">As a matter of fact, both these men say that Australia can supply guns and ammunition, if Australian workmen are given an opportunity to make them. But the policy of the Government is to send thousands of skilled artisans to the other end of the world to  make guns, shells, and implements of war, rather than insist that they shall do the work here, spare material, if any, being sent abroad. &lt; Canada is making munitions of various descriptions for the Empire, and I have quoted the right honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cook),</inline> who speaks with some authority when he says that the same could be done in Australia. </para>

                        <para>The provision of a military force adequate to insure local safety and public confidence at a time of attempted invasion is regarded as a paramount duty, and the home defence forces of Australia, it is proposed, should be determined on lines similar to those adopted in Great Britain. The estimated strength of the land forces necessary to do this - consideration being given to the great ocean distances which lie between Australia and the territory of any possible enemies, the armed strength and power of transportation oversea of any conceivable hostile nation, and the extent of territory of the Australian Commonwealth, contrasts with its comparatively small population - is estimated at 80,000 - half to secure the larger cities and defended ports from attack, and the other moiety to operate as a mobile striking' force anywhere in Australia. </para>

                        <para>The consideration of the whole subject as applied to Australia may be summed up by saying that there is no part of the Empire so little liable to attack as Australia, and, therefore, so little in want of a large force for its defence. </para>

Colonel Foster points out the difficulties met in keeping up the lines of communication, and goes on to show that such an expedition would have been a practical impossibility had there been any opposition on the ocean. </para>
                    <para>United States Transport Department reported, says Colonel Foster, that the whole of the United States shipping on the Atlantic coast could not ship more than 60,000 men, while the whole of the shipping of the United States on the Pacific coast could not convey more than 40,000 men. </para>

Britain, with the mightiest mercantile marine in the world, and with the assistance of French transports, was only able to take a quarter of a million of men to South Africa at the rate of 1,000 a day. </para>
                    <para>Yet we have to listen to men who have no faith in Australia, or in the power of Australians to defend themselves on their own shores. "We have heard of the brave deeds of Australian soldiers on Gallipoli; but if the soldiers of this country had to defend Australia on their own soil, there would, indeed, be a new page written in the military history of the world. We are not equipped to-day because we have a Government in power that has one eye only, and is not prepared to do anything for Australia - because the vital necessities of Australian defence are ignored, and because this Parliament, which is charged with the duty of defending Australia, refuses to live up to that duty, insist on knowing what is going on, and demand action adequate to our responsibilities. </para>
                    <para>It is pointed out by Colonel Foster, in his book, <inline font-style="italic">The War and the Empire,</inline> that it requires at least nine or ten tons of shipping to ship one man oversea, with his baggage and equipment. Inquiry and calculation, together with a little faith in Australians, would dispel the assumed helplessness of this country to protect itself. Britain fought many important foreign wars with less population than we have in Australia to-day. . </para>

I am not unmindful of the magnificent performance by the Navy during the last few days at that same port in possession of Germany. This later attack had to take place under cover of a fog, the invention of some of the skilled marine and naval scientists; the Navy was within thirty minutes of its base; and, though it was a wonderful undertaking, the results are not great. It has been impossible, with all the might and majesty of the British, French, and American Fleets, to approach any of the  enemy  coast lines guarded by mines. Is such a defence as that beyond the reach of Australia ? Are we not able to mine our harbors and selected coastal areas, and thus prevent enemy vessels from approaching? </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I am in favour of Australia being put in a position to defend herself, and to do whatever is necessary to that end. I am in favour of the public of this country being allowed to know the facts of the case. If there is one thing more criminal than another, it is the refusal of those in the control of affairs to allow the people to know the international position - to know the great facts of this war in close proximity to our own shores. </para>

                    <para>The Government absolutely refuse to give the public any information  - I am  not allowed to give it even to Parliament, or outside this House. Under the circumstances, the Government may find great Labour conferences meeting presently because of the administration of Defence matters recently, and doing things which should not be done at this time above all others. There is a prejudice growing up against compulsory training, because of pin-pricks and unfairness in its operation, and probably the great working-class organizations will take up an attitude of hostility to that means of defence. </para>
                    <para>If the public were allowed to know the facts they would adopt no such attitude, but because they are not, and because those of us who have made a study of the question are not allowed to put the facts before them, men, in their ignorance, may do something which will be very much to  the  detriment of this country, if it does not lead to disaster. And if such an attitude is taken up, the responsibility must rest on the shoulders of those who have refused to allow the people of this country to know what the facts  are. </para>
                    <para>We were told to-day that the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy left for England yesterday. We are told, also, that 'the position in Australia is critical, and that the preparations for Australia's defence are unsatisfactory. Yet the. Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy are so careless and callous as to Australia's vital interests that, in the midst of these ominous circumstances, they can board a ship to go 12,000 miles to the other side of the world. </para>

                    <para>It has been stated that the Prime Minister has been invited to Britain. How do we knoiw that either he or the Minister for the Navy has been called to London? What is the purpose of their going overseas at the present time? Unfortunately, the German Armies are advancing. Are the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy going to Europe to arrange terms of peace? Every sensible man knows that such a proposal is an absurdity at this stage. To talk peace when the enemy is in the ascendency is to accept his dictation. There was an opportunity to confer as to peace terms, but, unfortunately, that opportunity was not  availed of. Then, for what are they going ? </para>
                    <para>The treatment these two Englishmen have meted out to us in connexion with their mission to England is on a par with the contempt with which this Parliament has been treated' by the Government in regard to other matters of the' highest national importance. Parliament has not been taken into the confidence of the Government.We have not been told what messages, if any, have been received from Great Britain; or, if any have been received, what messages preceded them. "We do not know whether the invitation, if any, was unsought, or was the outcome of representations made to the Imperial Authorities from Australia. We are not told for what purpose these delegates have gone to London, or to what they will commit this country while they are there. And the majority of honorable members of this National Parliament seem to be prepared to accept this humiliating situation. </para>

And before we ask ourselves whether we can send 16,500, or 7,000, or 5,400 men per month across the seas our duty is to ask ourselves: What are our obligations in respect of man power for the home defence of Australia and the maintenance of our industries? When we have answered that question, we shall know what numerical surplus is available for sending overseas. Having insured that our first and paramount obligation to Australia has been adequately met, there will be no more loyal and enthusiastic supporter of everything the Commonwealth can do from one end of the continent to the other to help Great Britain than your humble servant representing Cook in the Parliament of Australia. </para>

                    <para class="block">I desire to know what subjects are to be discussed at this Conference? Is the Conference to deal with the terms of peace, and the things that Australia will be asked to agree to as part of those terms, or is something else to be discussed which will be a means of continuing the war ? Are there to be proposals on the lines of the resolutions of the Paris Economic Conference - proposals which the German military caste may seize upon and circulate from one end of their country to the other in order to hearten the men of Germany to fight to the last ditch for fair treatment? Are the German militarists to be afforded an opportunity of saying that the Allies desire not so much to defeat the Prussian military system as to crush the German people into the dust? The people of Australia have a right to know what matters affecting the welfare of the Commonwealth are <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be discussed at the Conference. The delegates say that they are representing Australia. I say that they represent only one section of Australia, and that the voice of the people of the Commonwealth can only be properly heard when the two large sections of the community are directly represented. What representation at the Conference have the people who elected honorable members on this side of the House? The delegates may assent to conditions to which the people who returned us to Parliament may not be prepared to agree. </para>

                            <para>-I refer the honorable member to the Acting Minister for the Navy. To understand clearly . how the Government have abjectly failed to initiate a real shipping policy it is necessary to trace the whole history of the pottering and paltering attempts that have been made to commence the local construction of ships. In February of last year I brought the matter under the notice of the House. I pointed out the necessity of going in for a vigorous policy of shipbuilding to enable us to assist the Allies to bring the war to a successful conclusion. Nothing was done in the matter until some months later. In June of that year a Conference was called by the Prime Minister, and was held in Melbourne. It was attended by the Prime Minister, the Minister for the Navy, and representatives of New South Wales, Victorian, and South Australian labour organizations interested in the shipbuilding industry. At that Conference the Prime Minister laid before the delegates assembled what he was pleased to call his policy of shipbuilding, and the conditions under which he would allow the industry to be established in Australia. I propose to quote some of the statements which the Prime Minister made from the official report of the proceedings of the Conference. Attached to the report is the statement - </para>

                    <para>I have read the foregoing report, and agree that it is a correct statement. </para>
                    <para class="block">This is signed by " W. M. Hughes," and it is also signed by representatives of the trade unions " W. J. Duggan, R. O'Halloran, T. Davies, J. McLachlan, S. Hampson, and W. A. Brown." These men confirmed the statement of the Prime Minister that the contents of the document are accurate. Honorable members will, therefore, see that I am quoting something quite official. One of the first statements the Prime Minister made at the Conference was the following - </para>
                    <para>Being seized of the vital importance of shipping to the national, economic, and financial welfare of the nation, and the urgent need of increasing, by all means at our disposal, the supply of available tonnage, and realizing that in no way could Australia more effectively aid the Empire in the prosecution of the war than by organizing its industries and encouraging producers to increase the quantity of products for export purposes, and transporting these to Britain and her Allies, the Government decided to launch upon this great national enterprise. </para>
                    <para class="block">They started to talk about launching this great national enterprise, but what were the conditions which the Government sought to impose. They said to the representatives of labour at the Conference, " We will start this shipbuilding industry, which will save the economic life of the nation, and will help to feed the Allied troops that are fighting for us in Flanders - on certain conditions." What are the conditions ? Here are the three basic labour conditions which the Prime Minister considered essential - </para>

                        <para>The labour conditions which the Government consider essential to the success of its proposals arc three: - (1) Continuity of operations. (2) Dilution of labour. (3) Piece-work. It was to consider these that the recent conference of representatives of the unions interested in shipbuilding was called. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I want honorable members particularly to listen to this, bearing in mind the Prime Minister's statement about the economic life of the country being dependent upon our building ships. He said, further, that there should be no shipbuilding unless the unions agreed to the conditions. The Prime Minister said - </para>

                    <para>So that, unless the Government could have their conditions accepted, they were prepared to allow a complete cessation of industrial operations in Australia. It was not, apparently, a question of supplying the Allies with food, or of carrying on industrial operations in Australia as they should be carried on, but a question of breaking down union conditions that have been in force in this country for the last thirty or forty years. Let us contrast this with something else that happened in connexion with shipping. When the Prime Minister last visited Great Britain, he purchased fifteen ships, for which he paid £2,068,000. They were very old ships, and were not in a good condition of repair. In ordinary times, they would not have brought anything like the price that the Prime Minister paid for them. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad that the Minister for Trade and Customs agrees with that statement. Why did the Prime Minister pay that enhanced price for them? It was because shipping was scarce, and because it was a vital necessity to Australia to obtain shipping. It was never suggested then that the Prime Minister should have said to the shipowners who demanded this price, " You must not ask such a price. You must break down all these conditions, and unless you do so we shall not purchase any of your ships." That was not the attitude adopted by the Government when dealing with a wealthy shipping corporation. It was then merely a question of paying the price asked, and getting the ships. I want to say right here, so far as the purchase of those ships was concerned, that I considered the Prime Minister did quite right in purchasing them; but I say. that he should have adopted the same attitude in Australia in connexion with the building of ships. Instead of wasting time holding conferences with union representatives, or anybody else, he should have got to work and started the building of ships. The great essential was shipbuilding, and not the breaking down of trade union conditions. </para>

                            <para>- This is a matter which seems to trouble the Ministry, and especially the Minister for Trade and Customs. The honorable gentleman says that the business could not be controlled bv the unions, and must be controlled by the Government. It is evident that he has not read the agreement very carefully or he would not have made that statement. Here is another quotation from this famous document, which I want honorable members to take particular notice of, because the whole thing turns upon this point - </para>

                            said that he had specially emphasized two points: First, that piece-work would not replace or reduce the minimum wage, but should go to supplement it. Every man employed would get the minimum wage as at present. The rates for piece-work would be fixed, and a man would be entitled to as much more than the minimum wage as he earned. No matter how much a man made on piecework the minimum wage would not be cut down. That was the first and great guarantee that the unions interested were given.

                            <para>- I shall tell the Minister what is wrong with it. It seems to me that the Government have but a very poor idea of how to set to work to make a business a success. If it was true that the conditions imposed by the Prime Minister were not to interfere with the minimum wage, and that the piece-work system was only to supplement the minimum wage, why did the Prime Minister waste words and time in talking to anybody about it? The only condition that the unions have ever asked for have been that the minimum rate of pay should not be interfered with. Provided that was guaranteed they would be satisfied. They were not concerned about anything beyond that. What they were concerned about was the minimum rate of pay. If the statement made by the Prime Minister was correct the waste of time that has occurred in connexion with the starting of the shipbuilding industry has been little short of criminal, in view of the absolute necessity of shipping to carry the products of Australia across the seas to feed the boys who are fighting for us. </para>

What I am saying just now is that if what the Prime Minister set forth was the condition upon which the shipbuilding industry was to be gone on with it should have been started last year, and ships should have been ready to launch by now. All that the Prime Minister had to say to the unions was, "Here is your minimum wage, and if anybody can earn more so much the better," and there would have been no bother at all. </para>

For <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> Salter I hold no ' brief - indeed, we have had many a good old " scrap " together, and I suppose we shall have a few more before we are much older. He has told us that all these arrangements were in hand. He had prints prepared at a cost of £3,500, and then the whole business was thrown overboard, and that money was lost to the Commonwealth. It is truly a scandalous condition of affairs. Matters were suddenly halted, and it was discovered that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curchin</inline> was being imported from Great Britain to carry on shipbuilding in Australia. I desire to know, first, why it was necessary to import any one to undertake the building of standardized vessels out here.. These were to have been standardized ships, ordinary tramps - merely steel boxes - which anybody with any knowledge of shipbuilding at all could have constructed. There were no intricacies more than a man with average knowledge of practical shipbuilding could have successfully carried out. Yet we find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> Salter - the man whom we had imported earlier from Great Britain, who had been given a huge salary, and who was one of the British Admiralty's expert shipbuilders - was not sufficient. Neither was his under manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarke,</inline> another of the Admiralty's expert builders, possessing world-wide experience ; nor. the remainder ' of a staff of experts similarly imported, including draughtsmen from the Admiralty. All these experts were receiving high salaries, and had been brought out because they possessed extra special qualifications for the most intricate class of shipbuilding, namely, the construction of warships. Yet these were all boldly pushed on one side, and another gentleman, of whose qualifications I do not desire to say anything at present, was imported. In view of the fact that we have already these highly-paid imported experts on hand; it is an absolutely criminal waste of money to bring out another to do the work which those now here could have done very properly. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- We have ample experts in Sydney, whose services we would be only too pleased to let Victoria have. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curchin</inline> was imported at a salary of £2,000 per annum to tell us how to build standardized ships. Then it was discovered that it would require more than just that one gentleman to construct the vessels. So they imported five other men - one to be a shipyard manager, at £600 per annum; another to be chief draughtsman, at £520 per annum; another to be foreman iron man, at £400 per annum; another a foreman shipwright, at £400 per annum; and a chief marine engineer, at £1,000 per annum. Here was a total in salaries of £2,920, plus the £2,000 for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curchin,</inline> making, in all, an additional £4,920 pei- annum,, at a time when this country is already heavily burdened. I am not afraid to say that, in the Naval Dockyard, there are to-day quite half-a-dozen ordinary under-foremen  who have had experience iii the big shipbuilding yards of the world, who would be quite capable of undertaking this same work in any part of the Commonwealth at the present time. Why, therefore, should not their services be utilized, instead of going to the expense of importing these men? And, at the same time, what about those others whom we sent to Great Britain to learn shipbuilding, and whose expenses we paid in large sums? They are all back here now, strengthened by knowledge and experience. Why have not their services been secured, instead of importing this latest body of .experts, and at the same time shutting the door of promotion in the face of able young Australians? The whole business shows a scandalous disregard for finance and the welfare of our country. </para>

                    </continue><para>There is also another aspect of the matter. The ships which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> Salter was desirous of building were the ordinary tramp type, to be of a standardized design - following the example of the British Government. However, this plan was suddenly overthrown, and the Government decided to adopt some new. system. They went in for what is known as the Isherwood system. This is a matter of longitudinal framing as distinct from the transverse system of framing in shipbuilding. I promptly made inquiries, and discovered that Messrs. Isherwood, from whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curchin</inline> comes - he was their leading man -are the patentees of this particular design of construction. . The Commonwealth Government are adopting this patent method. Now, the firm of Messrs. Isherwood are not a shipbuilding company; they are an up-to-date business firm, with a -patent for a particular style of construction. I said to myself, "The Commonwealth Government are not getting this for nothing." So I asked certain questions as to what royalties were being paid to Messrs. J. W. Isherwood. Here is the reply. It uses the word "fees." I want honorable members to note the fine way in which this, bit of camouflage comes in : - </para><quote>
                        <para>Pees are payable to J. W. Isherwood at the rate of 3s. 4d. per gross ton, equivalent to about £550 per ship, for the preparation of classification, plans, &amp;c. </para>
                    </quote><para>This is another scandalous thing. It means that the Government are paying a royalty to Messrs. Isherwood of £550 on every ship, when there was absolutely no need for paying anything at all. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Can the honorable member not see that, since these are to be standardized ships - all. of one design - only the one master design is required. In reference to this particular matter, there is £550 paid; but not for the design. No one can tell what amount the Commonwealth will be called upon to pay for ship construction if each one is to cost £550 for the design alone. In my judgment, it is scandalous, especially in view of the fact that in Great Britain to-day standardized ships are being built to a design prepared by experts of the British Admiralty. No royalty is being paid to any firm. \ If there had been any doubt or difficulty about the matter, could not we, in this time of national crisis, have cabled to the British Admiralty asking them to allow us to use their design ? I am sure that, in  such  circumstances, the British Admiralty would have gladly come to our assistance. Instead, however, of applying to the Imperial authorities, some arrangement was made with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> W. Isherwood to pay his firm a certain sum, in order that we might be able to build ships to his design in Australia. Behind all this, also, is the appointment of Isherwood's  manager to the control of shipbuilding in Australia. I leave that with the simple statement that the people of Australia .will demand some explanation from the Government. They will want to know why they are to be called upon to pay this outrageous tax for the right to build ships in this country. </para>

                            <para>- I can give the- Minister the answer in the Prime Minister's own words. He states in his manifesto that " the shipbuilding scheme is now definitely established." The question I have  raised  is of such a serious character that the people of Australia will certainly demand t.o know why  they  have to pay Messrs. J. W. Isherwood and Co.  for  the light to build ships in Australia. Instead of doing some practical work, we have had a lot of "hifalutin" from the Prime Minister, who waves his hands about, talks largely, but does not get down to work. I have some knowledge of this business, and I am prepared at any time to give the Government every  assistance possible in furthering the shipbuilding industry in Australia. It appears, however, that the Government do not -want ' practical suggestions. The Prime Minister, it seems,  prefers  to talk and make statements to the effect that the Commonwealth "shipbuilding scheme is now definitely established." Is it? I think it is established only in their dreams; though I should imagine that the Minister at present in charge of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> has been awakened to-night, and he realizes that the country will demand an answer to the points I have raised. Up to the present the Government have merely paltered and pottered about with this great question. The present position of Australia is not unlike that of Rome, which was burning while Nero fiddled; but in this case it' is a case of Billy "yapping" while-- </para>

I am afraid that we shall have to wait until the " crack o' doom " before we get anything practicable in the way of shipbuilding from this Government. In the meantime, our farmers' produce is lying in the open, exposed to all the elements, and is being devoured by mice, but the one thing practicable to get our wheat to market- the building of ships in Australia - is not being put into operation by this Government. </para>

                            <para>- This attack upon the Prime Minister is remarkable, because it comes from men who but a little while ago joined in electing him Leader of the party, with cheers that almost lifted the roof off that upper room in this building. They all were behind the Prime Minister then, even the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Catts),</inline> and the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs).</inline> I remember we once had a saying of people who were closely associated with each other that they were so friendly that they would swap shirts. Well, that was the position as between the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> and the then member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughe's)</inline> . It was " Billy here " and " Frank there," and I believe that on occasions they even went to the extent of lending each other 5s. if that were necessary at any time. But the position has changed since then. Why are these accusations now levelled at the Prime Minister? Simply because he had the courage to stand up and voice his opinions all over the Commonwealth. When he came back from England prior to the first referendum, who were loudest in their praise of all that he had done? The honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> and the honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jensen)</inline> will know. When he came back everybody praised him, but simply because he has had the courage of his convictions and would not toady to the organizations outside- </para>

                            <para>- To-day the honorable member for Brisbane and other honorable members opposite cannot find language sufficiently strong to condemn the Prime Minister. Why is it? Honorable members opposite must themselves know. Is it because they were too cowardly to go out with him; because their knees trembled with fear at the thought that they would lose their seats if they supported him. But I will not pursue that subject further. Honorable members know that what I say is absolutely true. The honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine),</inline> who condemned the Prime Minister last evening, was in knickerbockers when the right honorable William Morris Hughes was fighting hard in the cause of Labour. </para>

He pleads, as a conscriptionist, that we should call up the manhood of Australia to defend it. I am entirely with him in that contention. The 40,000 men whom it is proposed to call up will not provide a force half sufficient for the purpose. But the honorable member was reported, during the first referendum campaign, to have asked, "Why should we be afraid of an attack by the Germans or anybody else? </para>

                    <para>Last night the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nicholls)</inline> took exception to economic conscription. I say, without hesitation, that if I were an employer of labour no man should remain in my employ who was eligible to carry arms under the conditions laid down in our Defence Act. The most unfortunate thing that ever happened here is that on the outbreak of the war we did not repeal section 4'9 of that Act. The Constitution, in paragraph 6 of section 51, provides that this Parliament shall have power to make laws for the defence of the Commonwealth. Where is the Commonwealth being defended to-day? It is not being defended here, but on the other side of the world. But, unfortunately, we stultified ourselves by inserting in the Defence Act a provision "that no man should be sent overseas to serve in our military Forces without his own consent. But for that provision we should have had the power to send to the other side of the world every man whom it was considered necessary to send to defend Australia. Yet other persons contemplated the possibility of war at that time. In addressing my constituents in 1910, I said that, judging by what was happening elsewhere, and by the circumstance that the whole of the British Fleet had practically been concentrated in the North Sea, we should be at war with Germany within five years. As a matter of fact, we were at war with her within four years. Yet the people of England were so blind that, notwithstanding the fervent appeals of the late Lord Roberts to call up such forces as might be necessary, and to drill and instruct all eligibles in the Old Country, no steps were taken in that direction. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> advocated the same principle at that time with the full approval of the Labour party, of which I was then a member. </para>

We were so foolishly bland that we did not see as far ahead as did the late Lord Roberts and William Morris Hughes when he advocated conscription as far as Australia was concerned. Why did the supporters of the Labour party, who gave us a majority time after time, approve of that policy? Did they think that there would be no occasion to fight? </para>

I have here the official report of the proceedings of that Conference, and I have no hesitation in saying that the honorable member put an entirely wrong construction upon the decisions at which it arrived. He condemned what was done at that gathering, and said, amongst other things, that the Paris Conference had done more to prolong the war than had anything else. Let me read what was done there. I do not intend to weary the House by reading the whole of the decisions arrived at, but I will read sufficient to show that the honorable member has not studied what was done there, and, perhaps unconsciously, misrepresented those resolutions. He said that the resolutions were of such a nature as would be circulated in Germany. </para>

                            <para>- It is a remarkable thing that whatever does not suit honorable members opposite is at once branded as a lie, whereas whatever suits them is always considered to be the truth. The honorable member for Cook is insinuating that the record which I hold in my hand is not correct because something was printed in the newspapers which purported to be the utterances of our Prime Minister. </para>

                            <para>- It does not say anything about fifteen years after the war. If the honorable member will read the report he will see for himself what were the resolutions arrived' at. Other resolutions were passed - ' ' Transitory measures for the period of commercial, industrial, agricultural, and maritime reconstruction of the Allied countries ' ' - meaning that the Allied countries will protect themselves amongst themselves as far as is necessary after the war. Then another series of resolutions was carried - " Permanent measures of mutual assistance and collaboration amongst the Allies." There is nothing in the report of the proceedings of the Conference of the nature alluded to by the honorable member for, Capricornia, who desired to make it appear that we were attempting to permanently destroy after the war all trade and commerce between Germany and ourselves and between Germany and the other Allied nations.  His  animadversions, therefore, upon the Conference and its resolutions were entirely unwarranted. </para>

                    <para>In discussing this question last evening the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> made charges which he cannot possibly substantiate. He has no ground whatever for the statements which he made in condemnation of the Prime Minister. The amendment is clearly aimed at the Prime Minister. The Leader of the Opposition had nothing to say against the honorable member for Parramatta attending- the Imperial Conference; and clearly his objection, and that of the honorable member for Brisbane, was to the attendance of the Prime Minister there. I have known <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> intimately in social, political, business, and union circles ever since I entered this Parliament seventeen years ago, and I say that a straighter and a whiter man does not exist in Australia. </para>
                    <para class="block">On one occasion, when the Prime Minister had' been doing the work of three Ministers, an honorable member, who is not here now, accused him of taking the pay of three Ministers, but the accusation fell flat when it was shown that the right honorable gentleman had handed the money over to the Repatriation Fund. The charges of that kind which have been brought against him occasionally, mere dirt-throwing, fall to the ground, leaving him unblemished. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony)</inline> is here, not as an Australian, not as a Nationalist, but as a member for the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. Whose fault is it that the unions would not'' agree to the terms laid down in respect of shipbuilding? That of members like him, who have incited them to stand out for better conditions. Honorable members opposite talk about profiteering, but what difference is there between the profiteers and those who, when the country is in extreme need, catch it by the throat to make demands on it? The honorable member's address to-night was devoted to the delays in carrying out the shipbuilding programme of the Government. Is the Prime Minister to blame for them ? So far as I know, he has done all that he could. It is not his fault, nor is it that of the Government, that it has been delayed. </para>
                    <para>As for the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> he would not be here if certain members of the unions had their way ; he knows that they tried by all sorts of trickery to oust him. The honorable member for Capricornia said that the Prime Minister was a great intriguer ; but some years ago - the honorable member for Cook knows of this - a cave was formed at the instigation of the honorable member for Capricornia; so that he, at least, cannot reproach the Prime Minister with being an intriguer. I know all about that cave, because I was in it. Some honorable members opposite are in a very uncomfortable position. The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> is where he is because of want of courage ; he has not the pluck to stand up to his convictions. That is what keeps many honorable members where they are. </para>

                    <para>Let me speak of an incident that happened to me on Tuesday last. This is the time for straight talking. I was wearing the Anzac Day badge which I am now wearing - a badge which it is an honour to wear. As I stood on a kerb waiting for a tram, a lorry passed in which coal had been carried. On it were four boys, of ages varying from eleven to fourteen. As they passed, they jeered at my badge, and threw pieces of coal either at me or at it. I ask, Where were they taught to. disrespect such a badge - in their homes or in the schools or elsewhere? Had they been properly taught, they would have respected the badge; yet many children are being taught not to respect it, but to spit on it. I say, in all seriousness, that as things are going, this country will soon be face to face with a civil war. </para>

Those islands are within less than forty hours' steaming of Sydney. I ask the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> to consider that fact.

                            <para>- I am glad to have the honorable member's emphatic assurance that he does not desire anything of this kind.' My feeling is that Australia should have control of every island in the Pacific south of the Equator. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> will bear me out when I say that whilst we were visiting the islands of the Pacific matters came under our observation which' impressed upon us. very strongly their value to Australia and the unfortunate position in which we should be placed if they were in the possession of a hostile Power. I am profoundly convinced that the British flag should fly over every one of these islands. </para>

                    <para>There are in Australia people who entertain kindly feelings towards the German Government. Against the German people as a whole I have nothing to say - some of them, I think, are led in a direction they do not desire - but for the German Government and Prussianism I have a most unkind feeling. I propose, for the enlightenment of these people, to make a brief quotation from a book entitled <inline font-style="italic">With the German Army in the West,</inline> which is being very widely read. The author, Sven Hedin, a Swede, accompanied the German Army to the West Front for the special purpose of recording its victories. Goethe, the poet, was once sent on a similar mission to Valmy. In that instance, the German Army failed, and I hope failure will attend it on this occasion. I am anxious, however, to show those who maintain that England was to some extent responsible for the war that Germany was entirely and absolutely responsible for it. </para>

An article published in theNineteenth <inline font-style="italic">Century and After,</inline> some four years ago, went to show that the assassination of the Crown Prince of Austria was connived at by Germany as an excuse for an attack upon Servia. The facts, as set out in the article, clearly indicate that it was. On the occasion of another eminent person's visit, the route was lined with soldiers, but when the Crown Prince of Austria traversed the same road there was not a soldier to be seen. The funeral of the Crown Prince was also conducted in such a way as to convey the impression that, whilst he was a great man, he was not altogether a desirable personage. Here is an extract from Sven Hedin's work: - </para>

At a Peace Conference held in 1915, the most numerously attended Conference ever held in the United States of America, he said that if he could end the war by holding up his hand, he would not do it, because it was fought in the interests of Democracy and humanity. The German Socialist says the same. In this book Sven Hedin says of an interview he had with some troops - </para>

In actual figures it costs the Commonwealth a good deal more; but I want to show that this Parliament costs the country absolutely nothing. Prior to Federation, we coined gold here. There is no profit on the coinage of gold, but there is on the coinage of silver and bronze, which We were not allowed to coin. Subsequent to Federation, we obtained authority from the Imperial Government to coin both silver and bronze, and the profit comes to a good deal more than the cost of this Parliament; so that this Parliament costs Australia nothing at all. </para>

                            <para>- Then I have been misinformed by the work I am quoting, which says the membership is from 8,000,000 to 10,000,000. It is remarkable that the membership should be only 2,000,000 out of a population of over 100,000,000. That is a very strong commentary upon the force of Labour in the United States of America. </para>

He was on the council of the Waterside Workers Federation, and, like myself, he received a polite note, informing him that his presence was no longer desired as a member of the council. Yet he stands up here and champions the unions as if he were not merely a leading light in the temperance movement, or the chief spiritual adviser to this Chamber, and the guide, philosopher, and friend of everybody here, but a leading light in unionism also. </para>

                    <para>I wish honorable members on the other side would take to heart the indications of trouble in this country. When we hear a man say he has 30,000 followers ready to follow him anywhere, what does it mean ? All the indications we see around us show what is happening. A little while ago I was at a recruiting meeting. One of the audience, who was in mufti, was applauding the  speaker,  and a woman, who stood beside him said, "Why do you not go to the Front ?" He replied, " I have been, and lost one eye there." She said, "It is a pity you did not lose the other." That is the feeling that is extant here. </para>

It is not singular, and I say that we have to be careful; and we must not shut our eyes to what is happening elsewhere. Coming events cast their shadows before. We know what has happened in Russia. We know what is happening in other places. Let us not be driven into the same position by any mistaken idea that we are on the right course in standing by, indifferent to the fate of the British Empire. </para>

                        <para>.- The Ministerial statement, in the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> is nothing but " a necklace of negatives/' It has no sincerity in it. I would like the Government to give honorable members some information as to how they propose to deal with the financial position. I would like them to tell us whether it is their intention to continue meeting the war expenditure out of loan funds, or whether they intend to provide for it out of revenue. At least we should have some statement as to where they will find the necessary revenue for the payment of interest on the money we have borrowed to meet that war expenditure. Honorable members have made no serious attempt to ascertain the financial position of Australia. I was delighted to read the Budget speech delivered in the House of Commons the other day by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law, who pointed out that, notwithstanding the great strain imposed by taxation upon the people of Great Britain, the British Government were able to devote many millions of pounds from revenue to defraying war expenditure. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law told the House of Commons that the income tax would range to 6s. in the £1 on incomes of £2,500 per annum, and that on incomes exceeding that amount there would he a super-tax of 4s. 6d. in the fi. He also stated that incomes up to £500 would be exempt from payment of income tax, as they contributed through the Customs. </para>

                    <para>In Australia we find nothing but evasion of the issue on the part of a Government that was returned to office for the purpose of winning the war. One thing that is necessary to win the war is the finding of the necessary financial means of doing so, but our trouble is that many of the gentlemen who sit on the Treasury bench are connected with public companies and other vested interests. I made a statement in Sydney after the elections on 5th May last, that Australia would regret its action as recorded at that election. We have had no statement from the Ministry justifying their electioneering pledges. The position is serious, more than serious, yet it seems to make no difference to Ministers so long as they are able to raise loans. The last loan has certainly been eminently successful. I see that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is of opinion that the recent loan will realize £42,000,000, but we must not forget that by September next we shall have to raise another £40,000,000'. Our annual war expenditure is between £S0,000,000 and £100,000.000, and I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law, who told the people of Great Britain that the period in which large sums of loan moneys are being spent is the period in which taxation can be imposed .with some justification. But the time must come when there will be no great expenditure of public money, and it will then be impossible to extract by taxation the revenue necessary to pay the interest on the loans, and every man in business, knows that the loan account cannot be used for the payment of interest. Honorable members have only to review the position calmly to see the seriousness of it. Of course, it is all very well for the occupants of the Treasury bench to feel that they have loan money to spend, but the day will come when honorable members on this side will have to square matters up, and it will, indeed, be a hard job to cleat  away the results of the mis deeds of the present Government in the matter of finance. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law, in his Budget statement, said that it is the duty of the Government to levy as much taxation as is bearable without weaken ing the .conduct of the war, and that is very good advice to us in Australia. I presume many thought that it would never be possible to raise such a sum as £42,000,000 in Australia in the time at the disposal of the Government; but the fact must impress on the minds of all that there are many people here accumulating great wealth during the war. This is a fact which cannot be ignored, and I cannot understand why members of Parliament are so indifferent to the importance of these financial questions. </para>
                    <para>There are many ways in which expenditure could be, and ought to be, reduced, both State and Commonwealth. There are too many Parliaments and too many Governors, and I am satisfied that if a plebiscite were taken, the people would be quite prepared to reduce the expenditure in these directions. The cost of the government of Australia is nearly enough to pay the interest on £20,000,000. Some £800,000 is required to pay the Governors' salaries and parliamentary allowances, irrespective of providing for many other offices that are presumed to be necessary. More knowledge as to the real position of the finances ought to be given to honorable members, many of whom are entirely unacquainted with the facts. We have our Estimates aud Supply Bills, but these apply mainly to the wages of the Government servants. </para>
                    <para>Many honorable members on. this side have spoken of the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the many pools and committees connected with commerce and industry, and the Government would be wise in placing on those committees persons other than those concerned in the interests affected. The present system presents many opportunities for procedure that is undesirable, and we all know it is opportunity that causes so many people to do that which is not right. In the interests of the consumers, and of proper administration, some members of Parliament ought to have been appointed to offices of the kind. Every time I rise in this House I. endeavour to impress my fellow members with the importance of the financial situation. If I fail it is not my fault; at any rate, it will not prevent me from persisting, because I feel the day of reckoning must come, and we ought to be prepared to assist the Government if it is intended to take any serious steps. </para>
                    <para>I have not much to say in regard to the recent Conference at Government </para>
                    <para class="block">House. On a previous occasion I expressed the opinion that the Government was not in earnest in that matter, but made use of that Conference in order to get themselves out of the difficulty, not having the courage or the ability to extricate themselves. If the Government will put forward any scheme, I shall be quite prepared at any time to render all the assistance in my power to encourage recruiting. What we require is a display of common sense on both sides, and mutual consideration. We desire, not war, but peace based on reason and justice - not the rule of might, but the rule of right. That was the attitude adopted by the Labour representatives at the Conference. Before the split occurred in the Labour party over the question of conscription, I informed the Prime Minister that, as a representative of East Sydney, I had no authority to vote for conscription, because, in the election of 1914, I pledged myself to do all I could to assist to bring the war to a termination which would be equitable to the race to which I belong. I intend to keep that pledge. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford)</inline> referred to my views regarding the islands in the Pacific. My attitude to this matter has been consistent. At a Labour Conference held in Melbourne in 1885, and attended by the present honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spence),</inline> who was at that time a representative of a miners union, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curley,</inline> of Newcastle, and othp.r prominent Labourites, we gave consideration to a grievance of the farming community. In New Caledonia, maize was being grown by the labour of convicts from Prance, who were being paid the magnificent sum of 6d. per day. The Australian farmer could not produce maize to compete with the product of the cheap labour in the French Colony. As a Protectionist, I was in favour of a heavy duty being placed on imported maize. The Conference appointed a deputation to wait on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Service</inline> - the then Premier of Victoria - and we asked him to provide funds to send us to England as a delegation to ask the British Government to arrange with France for Australia to take over the control of the French islands in the Pacific. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Service</inline> did not grant our request to provide the means ; but the feeling at that time was that the adjacent islands in the Pacific should be under the control of Australia. I am still of the opinion that it would be far better  for  Australia to control those islands, even if they should prove a white elephant, rather than that they should be used by a foreign Power as bases for aeroplanes, submarines, and destructive artillery. </para>
                    <para class="block">In reference to the Pools that have been established to deal with metals, butter, wheat, and other commodities, I feel justified in mentioning a case that came under my notice, and in regard to which I endeavoured to get justice done. A gentleman named Scott held a zinc proposition at a place about 322 miles from Sydney. Zinc from Broken Hill was being sold to the Japanese Government, and he desired from the Commonwealth Government the same consideration for the product of his mine. " The answer he received from the Metal Exchange was that he should pay £500 into the funds of the Zinc Combine ; that he should have no voice in its management; and that he should give the Combine for fifty years control of the output of his mine; or, alternatively, the Combine would act as selling agents for him. Every member of the Zinc Proprietors Association was either a proprietor of or agent for the Broken Hill mines. . This association was appointed by the Government, and if he had allowed the Combine to act as his agents, that body would have taken good care that the mines at Broken Hill had the first call upon the market. Zinc concentrates were selling at £21 per ton prior to the war, and during the war the price has been £51 per ton; and honorable members will understand that this man had no chance of getting a fair deal for the output of his mine. I showed the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> a letter signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baillieu,</inline> the  chairman,  in which the terms I have mentioned were set out, and the Prime Minister could hardly believe that the facts I had stated were true. I mention this case as an instance of the evil of giving absolute control of any industry to a body of men with large vested interests in that industry. If the Government took the zinc concentrates business under their own control, and they were amenable to parliamentary supervision, all the producers would be in a better position. </para>
                    <para>In connexion with the Imperial Conference, I should like to contrast the  courtesy which the Labour Government extended  to the Opposition with the treatment which we have received from the present Government.

                    <para class="block">I direct attention to the fact that, so far no member of the Government, including the two gentlemen who are to represent the Commonwealth at the Conference, has said one word in this House as to what the problems to be discussed at the Conference are. Personally, I believe that there is no necessity at the present time for the holding of any such Conference, and it would not be held if it were not for the persistent agitation of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey,</inline> of New Zealand. In the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of this evening it is stated that General Botha, the Prime Minister of South Africa, is not going to the Conference, and no mention is made of any person who is going in his place. </para>

                            <para>- They are the persons who have been agitating for the1 holding of the. Conference for some time past. Their anxiety for the holding of the Conference has been due to the fear that if an election took place in New Zealand at the present time, they would not be returned to office. The Federal Government are in much the same position, because there has been a vast change in public opinion in Australia since the 5th May last. This change is the fault of the Government, because they do not give the public a lead. I have been a member of the New South Wales Recruiting Committee, and we have never had a lead from the Government. If the public are to be expected to take an interest in a question, they must be given a lead by public men. I hold that the Government are themselves answerable for ' the failure of voluntary recruiting. Many honorable members on the Government side are conscriptionists, and are determined to bring about conscription if they possibly can.. 1 As a re-, suit, they have ignored those who would be prepared to assist them to secure recruits by the voluntary principle. Any one who has any idea of Australian character must know very well that it is not possible to carry conscription in this country. I believe that when the history of Australia comes to be written, it will be for us a glorious record to be able to say that we sent every available man 16,000 miles away from Australia to fight in the interests of the Empire. </para>

In my opinion, it was never the intention of the Government that ships should be built in Australia. That would mean the establishment of an Australian industry, and I believe I could count on the fingers of one hand every honorable member on the Government side who would put himself out of the way in an honest attempt to secure the establishment of industries in Australia. Nearly every honorable member on the other side, including the leaders of the Government, are Free Traders to the backbone. Who would expect the Minister for the Navy or the Prime Minister to assist in the establishment of industries ? Before ever the Prime Minister thought of being a member of Parliament, he used to argue for hours in the little park in Balmain that Free Tr,ade was the only thing to save Australia. </para>

I was a strong supporter of his, and let me say that since he broke away from our party I have never upon any public platform said one insulting word about him, or anything in disparagement of the ability of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 'W.</inline> M. Hughes. I am not going to do it. If I have to gain my seat by abuse, I have a good trade at my fingers' ends, and the respect of the people of the city in which I live, and I can do without a seat at such a price. If there had been any real intention on the part of the Government to build ships in Australia, the construction of vessels might have been started, at a slip alongside the Cockatoo Island Dock, or on the island itself, eighteen months ago. It was not necessary that half-a-dozen ships should be built at one time. The frame of one ship might have been constructed, and it was quite unnecessary to impose conditions regarding piece-work. There would have been no need for the dilution of labour. Honorable members on the other side, perhaps, are not situated like myself. I have served my time to a trade - one which would get me a living to-day. It is a trade for which I would do all in my power to retain its dignity. It was my living, and it has been my natural desire to keep it at a high standard, since it was through that source that I had to maintain my wife and ten children. Those who have not served an apprenticeship to a trade, and become masters of it, cannot understand the feelings of men in a position such as myself. At this late stage, I ask leave to continue my remarks. Leave granted; debate adjourned. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not desire to detain honorable members, but I have an urgent matter to bring forward, in connexion with which I had already approached the Acting Prime Minister earlier in the day.  Lt  is the holding up of this week's issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call.</inline> I have shown to the Minister a copy of the publication. I am not a practical printer, and I have brought this same issue under the notice of other honorable members who also are not practical printers. They admit that, so far as they can see, there is nothing which would direct special attention to the fact that certain paragraphs had been censored. Specific items have been omitted, and the law is that there shall be no indication of censorship in the publication. I do not know the technical details, but it appears that, instead of closing the matter right up, there has been left what I understand is called "full point." It is only the matter of a portion of a line in each case, and would certainly not attract the notice of the public. I trust that the Acting Prime Minister will urge the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> not to further hold up the issue of this week's number. I feel sure that there will be only extra prominence directed to the matter if the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call</inline> does not come out to-morrow. It is now a day overdue, and I ask the Acting Prime Minister to intercede with the Minister for Defence to allow it to appear, because I believe that some of the matter Which has been censored has been already published in other journals in Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Yarra brought the matter under my notice earlier in the day, and I undertook to confer with the Minister for Defence and the Assistant Minister with regard to the censor's action. I am not acquainted with the printing problems which apparently surround this proceeding, nor am I qualified to offer an opinion whether the matter which has been censored should or should not have been omitted. However, I was not able to move the Minister to-day, but I promise that I shall have a further consultation if opportunity offers to-morrow. </para>
