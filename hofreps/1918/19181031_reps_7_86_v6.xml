October) ? 4. Is the officer still assisting the Commission ? 5. Is it proposed that he shall make to the Acting Solicitor-General progress reports of the Commission&#39;s confidential business, and that the Acting &#39;Solicitor-General shall forward the said reports to the Acting Attorney-General, who, in turn, will submit them to the Acting Prime Minister?&#39; </para>

I am not aware at this stage as to whether the Commission proposes to conduct its investigation privately or not, and I have written for information on the subject. The reply to No. 2 is that the officer in question is the Assistant Crown Solicitor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sharwood.</inline> In reply to No. 3,I consider the procedure adopted by that officer quite proper in the circumstances. 4. Ha is still assisting the Commission. Question 5 I cannot answer until I receive in-  formation regarding the procedure of the Commission. </para>

We have no desire to follow German methods; we have been often warned against doing so by honorable members opposite. Further, I am not aware that there are any political prisoners in. Australia. Certain men,, by reason of the laws adopted in consequence of the war, made themselves liable to punishment, and have been punished, but the term &#34; political prisoners&#34; is not an appropriate one to apply to them. I can hold out no hope of their release, unless better cause than that contained in the honorable member&#39;s question is shown. </para>

                            <para>- Is there any such land? mr. GLYNN. - There is none that has not been turned to some account. Steps are being taken, in conjunction with the Repatriation Department, to try to get the best openings for returned soldiers. As a matter of fact, some subdivisions have taken place, but the first instalment of leases will not expire before the end of next year, and obviously we cannot place other persons upon the land until after that date. </para>

However, as it is an urgent matter, will the Prime Minister take an interest in the question and obtain from the Minister for Defence a definite reply as to whether or not it is proposed to put these mothers in the same position as other mothers whose sons have fallen in the war? </para>

                    <para>- I have not heard, of such action, and do not think it has taken place; hut if the honorable member, with his usual solicitude for his constituents,  will give me particulars, I shall have the matter looked into. I should like to add to the statement that I made on the subject a day or two ago that, in view qf the cutting down of the vote in respect of the Federal .Capital works, I am now considering the possibility of the settlement of returned soldiers on that part of the Federal Territory known as the city area extension. </para>

As a matter of fact, tentative offers had previously been made, but I thought it advisable to secure something more definite, and concrete proposals have now been received and are under consideration. The development of these fields, however, does not depend purely upon the efforts of companies. The question of the needs of the Imperial Government is also under consideration, and I hope to be in a position shortly to state what has been done. </para>

                        <para>- All the pamphlets required in connexion with the recruiting ballot have been printed, so that it will  be unnecessary to indulge in more printing in that respect. It is to be regretted that in some cases pamphlets have been sent to people to whom they should not have been addressed ; but this has been largely due to incorrect information supplied from local sources, and to the fact that there is no compulsory means by which information can be obtained in regard to the names of eligibles. </para>

                            <para>- My most recent experience of going on &#34; my own &#34; was when, in connexion with the production of cereals and other primary commodities,I pointed to the necessity for some such investigation as that now suggested in the case of gold, and many of the States, and organizations within the States, took exception to the idea. As a matter of fact, -this is a State function distinctly., and the Commonwealth is interested only ina general way, beyond the special feature that the gold reserve of our note issue is influenced by the gold production. The&#39; primary responsibility rests with the State organizations. </para>

                            <para>- Tie formation of a Tin Producers Association does not involve the fixing of the price of tin. The Allies have, however, created an Inter-Allied Tin &#39;Committee to control the market for tin, and this Committee has fixed the price for tin throughout -the Allied Dominions. There will thus &#39;he -only -one price for the Australian production of tin. I have mot yet received full details of the &#39;scheme, but I have again cabled for particulars. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for New England (Lt.-Colonel Abbott) asked me  a  question on the 24-th &#39;October as to&#39; whether any communication had been received from the New Zealand Government  in  regard  to  proposed reciprocal arrangements whereby soldiers&#39; dependants of one country and resident in the other will receive hell!) if needed, leaving the financial arrangements to be adjusted later on. I then promised to make inquiry. As I informed the honorable member, there is a reciprocal arrangement in &#39;existence between the &#39;Governments of the Commonwealth and New Zealand in connexion with the payment of - soldiers&#39; pensions. Under this arrangement &#39;the Commonwealth pays New Zealand war pensions in Australia,- and the New Zealand Government pays Australian war pensions in the Dominion. An adjustment is made by the debit administration remitting half yearly the balance due. A reciprocal arrangement was made in JM6 between the &#39;Commonwealth and the New Zealand &#39;Governments for the Commonwealth -Government  to  pay separation .allowances to dependants of members of the Australian Imperial .Force resident in New Zealand, and for the New Zealand Government to pay dependants of New &#39;Zealand soldiers resident in Australia. No reciprocal arrangements of this kind, other than those to which I have referred, have been made between the Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments.

He desired to know whether there was any political significance in that fact. Pressed by me to say what he really desired to know, the honorable member asked whether the report had been censored. The report was not censored. I am not aware whether the full text was cabled to the morning press, but if it were, I can only assume that, as the cable had been given full publicity in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> the morning papers did not consider it worth while &#39; to repeat it. That is only my assumption, but there is certainly no ground for the honorable member&#39;s insinuation that the Government had anything to do with the matter. </para>

These rates-, however, were reduced at the- instance of the Ministers1 constituting the Wheat Board. The rates, for 1916-17 were still further reduced. Owing to the. length of time it- has. become necessary to store wheat, a different arrangement for I9,1T-1S was decided upon. The rates for that year are. so low that it is considered that some contractors will  make little,, if any, profit. There is a. point below which it is unwise, in- view of the magnitude of the interests at stake,, to reduce profits. It is considered that that point has now been reached in regard to. the. handling charges. </para>

                    Had Ways and Means been the first order of the day, the House would have anticipated the discussion of a taxation measure. No doubt, honorable members generally were no better informed than myself about the intentions of the Government regarding the Income Tax Bill, I assumed that we were going on with the Electoral Bill. If there were  urgent need for the Income Tax Bill, &#39;I could understand the Treasurer&#39;s proposal, but that will be passed soon enough if it becomes law any time between now and early next year.

                    <para>.- I support the honorable member for Yarra. I do not think that we have had another Treasurer who has approached us more insinuatingly than the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> who is almost generous at times; but I would remind him that the business-paper exists for a certain purpose. On it a Government arranges its proposals in order , with a view to giving honorable members warn-  ing of the business that may be expected to be brought forward for consideration each day. An honorable member interested in, say, Order of the Day No. 3, may propose to make some remarks about the Spirits Bill, but, seeing the Electoral Bill and. the Distillation Bill down for discussion before it, may postpone the collecting of facts on the subject, under the impression that the Bill will not be brought on for a few days. But if the business-paper is to be altered in the manner proposed, such an honorable member may find that the Spirits Bill is made to precede the other two measures, and he may thus be unprepared when the opportunity for discussing it presents itself. The Acting Prime Minister is a very frequent offender in this respect. I have come to the House on several&#39; occasions, and thought that we should not reach a certain Bill for a few days, but in a most gracious way the Acting Prime Minister has leaned across the table, and asked the &#39; Leader of the Opposition whether it would be inconvenient if that particular Bill were taken before other orders of the day which preceded it on the notice-paper. I feel sure that the honorable gentleman will feel no resentment, but will rather give us credit for proper watchfulness in requesting that he will, in future, give due notice of any proposal such as he is making now. </para>

            <para class="block">Paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a, b, c, d,</inline> &#39;and e are the same as those in the existing Act. The alterations embodied in the proposals outlined in the Budget are to be found in paragraphsf, <inline font-style="italic">g,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">h.</inline> The necessity for this resolution and the Bill which will be based upon it is that additional&#39; revenue must be found to meet interest on war loans and war pensions. In 1916, to meet the expanding war expenditure, the rates imposed by the Act of the previous year were increased by 25 per -cent., and those new rates operated for . the years 1916-17 and 1917-18. Again, the demands for interest on war loans and war pensions are such that a further addition is proposed by the Government, equalto30 per cent, increase of the rates charged in the two previous years. Expressed in other words, the intention is -that the tax to be collected in the present financial year shall be 621/2 per cent, in excess of the tax imposed by the first Federal Income Tax Act. It so happens that the 25 per cent, increase, upon which is imposed a30 per cent, increase, comes to an exact 621/2 percent, increase on the original tax. The tax yielded in 1915-16 a sum of &#163;3,932,775; in 1916-17, &#163;5,621,950; in 1917-18, &#163;7,385,543 ; while the estimate for the year1918-19, including the 30 per cent, increase now proposed, is &#163;9,600,000. As explained in a former analysis of the matter the estimate of the original revenue due to the 30 per cent, increase is &#163;2,200,000. </para>
            <para>The statistics for 19 17-18 are not yet available. Figures are not procurable to explain fully the increase in 1917-18 as compared with&#39; 1916-17, but it may be stated at this stage that the increases are due to three factors. The first is the collection in 1917-18 of arrears from the years 1915-16 and 1916-17. In the early stages of a tax the office takes some time to catch up to the assessment work, but in the third year it commences to overtake arrears. The second cause is increased incomes. We have evidence that in many cases the increase has been colossal. The third cause is the . more efficient machinery for collection. That is &#39;to be expected when an office has been running for three or four years. </para>
            <para>The need for a greater income tax is  shown by the expenditure figures, with which I will refresh the minds of honorable members. The war payments out of revenue have been as follows: - 1914-15, &#163;640,217; 1915-16, &#163;3,778,378 ; 1916-17, &#163;8,427,329; 1917-18, &#163;11,856,335; while the estimate for 1918-19 is &#163;21,129,602. It is to me a matter for regret that . the Commonwealth began its levy upon incomes by means : of a . scale -so complicated as . to bewilder . all but the highest mathematicians. An attempt was made to alter the mode of computation, but the difficulty at once presented itself that a new scale would . impose upon some taxpayers increases much in excess of those applicable . to others. &#39;The Government therefore decided to adhere for . this year, at any rate, to the old basis, to which, in spite of its intricacies, the taxpayers have accustomed themselves. As honorable members . are aware, a handbook has . been issued showing the amounts . payable on all . incomes. It -is a ready reckoner that he who runs may read, and before honorable members . commence to . either support or criticise the historic curves that adorn the schedule of the Income Tax Assessment Act, I suggest that they spend a. considerable time in this post-graduate . course. I have found it both illuminating and enervating. </para>

                <para>The tax on lotteries is to be increased from 10 to 13 per cent. The lottery organizers at present are withholding 10 per cent, of each prize. It is thought unwise to attempt to collect an additional 3 per cent, after the money has passed into the hands of the winners ; therefore, the new rate wall apply only from the passing nf the Act. </para>
                <para>The rate for companies has been  fixed  at 2s. 6d. in the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,</inline> which represents slightly more than an increase of 30 per cent., but, is a convenient round sum. This rate will apply only to that portion of the companies&#39; taxable income which has not been distributed to shareholders. The dividends are taxed in the hands of the shareholders at the rates payable by them as individuals. Moneys payable by a company to absentees were formerly taxed at fid. in the &#163;1. The rate now proposed is Sd. </para>

The Government arranged that this tax should not be collected, and we now propose its formal repeal. </para>
                <para>In viewing the effect upon the taxpayers of the new rates, it is necessary to include the income taxes of the States, and examples are given in a printed statement, which will be handed to honorable members later in the day. That the income taxes of Australia have reached high rates is shown by the following comparison with those in Great Britain. In each case the highest State rate has been included. The British tax on the higher incomes is the same for property as for personal exertion. </para>

                <para class="block">The Government recognises that the income tax now proposed will be a serious burden upon the community, but feels sure that the people will cheerfully bear it as part of the cost of maintaining the independence of Australia. There may be differences of opinion, quite irrespective or inclusive of party, as to whether the proposals of the Government are the best that are possible in all the circumstances of the case,- and I take this opportunity of saying very briefly, particularly to my friends opposite who criticised some other forms of taxation emanating from the Budget, that the distinct endeavour I have made in the preparation of the finance proposals and statement of this year has been to leave room for the operations of next year. It is an easy matter, even nowadays, to prepare a Budget that will make the revenue meet the expenditure, that is to say, bridge the difference by cumulative rises, but in making levies for this year one has to keep in sight what it will be possible to do next year. If ever there was a time in national finance when this is an imperative and inevitable duty, it is the present. Even if the war should stop to-day, we all recognise now that our war expenditure must proceed for many months, if not for a year or more, at the same considerable rate, and that our war borrowing would have to keep pace with the outgoings here aud overseas, which would mean on top of this year&#39;s levy another cumulative rise. In former years, when Treasurers of the Commonwealth or of the States were asked to prepare their balance-sheets and their financial proposals, one step only was enough for Parliament and the Administration of the day, but at the present time it would be criminal folly to merely take a glimpse at one year&#39;s operations. There ought to be no party or politics in regard to finance. The more honorable members, irrespective of party feelings, will attempt to study this question, the more they will see that room has been left for operations, whoever may be compelled to conduct them,- next year, and possibly the year afterwards; and close study of the resources of Australia should not discourage us in the belief that the Commonwealth can support the indebtedness which falls upon it as the result of this war. We are still a very wealthy people, with vast diffused wealth- that is easily  mobilizable,  and we are becoming accustomed to credit in such an extraordinary way that what was not money or a  mobilizable  asset previously has now by the general use of the operations of banking institutions become as available to us as if it were actually coin. </para>

                        <para>. - I join with other honorable members on this side in heartily congratulating the Minister in charge of the Bill on the excellent speech he made in introducing the measure. Copies of that speech have been very useful in enabling honorable members to study the proposed alterations in the electoral law. I am perfectly aware that there are really only two important proposals in the measure, namely, the provisions reinstating the postal voting and those which introduce preferential voting; but as the Minister has explained them so fully and well, little remains to be said in regard to them. I would not have spoken upon the second reading had it not been for the discussion that followed the Minister&#39;s speech, particularly the remarks which have fallen from honorable members on the Opposition benches. I agree, with others, that the Bill would not have been necessary if there had been two distinct parties in the House such as existed in 1914. At that time, the party in power was known as the Labour party. It had a distinct platform. That platform was drawn up by a conference of delegates selected by the people controlling the Labour movement throughout Australia, and each and every person who desired to take up political honours in the interests of the Labour party subscribed to it, and was told that, provided he adhered to the platform for three years, no one could say him nay, or remove him from the position he held if he succeeded in being elected to Parliament. He was also told that on the completion of his three years, if he had carried out the planks of the platform, he would be entitled to contest a selection ballot on the platform as agreed to by the preceding conference; but is there any Labour platform in existence to-day? </para>

                            <para>- Where is it? I have listened most attentively to the speeches delivered from the Opposition benches. One honorable member speaks with one voice ; his- neighbour speaks with another. How many honorable members opposite will indorse the platform of the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> ? I admire that honorable member, because he says distinctly what he means, and is not afraid to set before the people the platform in which he believes. How many men are there on the Opposition benches representing constituencies such as mine which are not absolutely Labour seats, who would support the platform laid down by the honorable member? Not one of them would do so. But why does not the honorable member create a party of his own, instead of tacking himself on to the Labour party? Is he not aware that, prior to 1914, members of the Labour party were opposed by gentlemen following the same lines of thought as he does to-day, and with the same policy which he enunciates ? They called themselves Socialists. To-day we find them sitting side by side with their old opponents, and each man has his own distinct platform. In an endeavour to prove that the Labour platform does not exist, I shall quote freely, not from my own views on this important question, but from the utterances of honorable members sitting opposite. Until this dreadful war broke out, the Labour party was a united body, and there was no need for preferential voting, because the two parties in the House were evenly divided, leaving no room for Independents, as was shown by the results of the different elections. That state of affairs does not exist to-day. Parties in the House are split up into fragments. The old Labour party no longer exists. In fact, it is unknown. I believe that there are some honorable members opposite who still adhere to the views which they held when members on this side were associated with them: They still display a little bit of the courage that they had in the old days. Not long ago, I was delighted to read a manifesto issued by the New South Wales members of the Opposition, in which they distinctly declared that they would not be bound by the little coterie that now controls&#34; the remnant of the old Labour party of Australia. That party is controlled to-day, not by the great mass of the workers outside, but by one or two individuals in each of the States. In New South Wales to-day, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boote,</inline> editor of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> has set himself up as the Messiah of the Labour movement, and has declared that out of it he will build something great. I do not know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boote,</inline> but his writings suggest that he is the very personification of the chief character in <inline font-style="italic">Caesar&#39;s</inline><inline font-style="italic">Column,</inline> a book that was written in reply to Bellamy&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Looking Backward.</inline></para>

                    <para>I have referred to this incident to illustrate the necessity for the introduction of preferential voting - a system which will enable men with the courage of the honorable member for Macquarie to fight a clean fight where the workers desire them to seek election to Parliament. By means of preferential voting we shall be able to deprive this self-appointed Messiah of the Labour movement of the power to determine who shall, and who shall not, stand for election to Parliament in the interests of the workers. Under such a system the people themselves will alone determine who shall represent them. Where there are many political parties preferential voting is necessary to afford all sections an opportunity to secure representation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carroll,</inline> who is evidently a gentleman in authority at Lith-  gow, said, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Lithgow Mercury -</inline> ire was a member of what was known as the extreme industrial wing of the movement. In the Federal sphere a number of members of the Labour party had endeavoured to create a split by their ill-advised action in regard to the recruiting ballot. They had advised the leagues and unions to vote contrary to the request of the Perth Conference. This the industrialists at any rate resented, especially as in the past they had looked in vain for a lead from the politicians, who in no sense lod the movement, and in some instances did not fairly represent it. </para>
                    <para class="block">This again shows the necessity for a preferential voting system, and although honorable members of the Opposition have not the courage to publicly say so, I know that they welcome the proposal. </para>

I am proving out of the mouths of members of the Opposition that preferential voting is necessary, because there are more than two political parties in Australia, and because even the Official Labour party is divided within itself. I am showing that that solidarity of which we hear so much in connexion with the Official Labour movement does not in reality exist. Speaking at the Lithgow demonstration to which I have already referred, the honorable member for Macquarie gave further evidence in support of preferential voting, so that every man seeking election to Parliament may secure a fair deal .

If they disapproved of his action and thought he had done something detrimental to the movement, they had a perfect right to put him out. when he asked the people to give him their votes he pledged himself to voluntary recruiting, and he had a right to stick to that agreement; but if the ballot was decided as the Political Labour League executive apparently desired, it meant that any man who went on the recruiting platform was a scab. </para>

                        <para>And when this &#34; manifesto &#34; tells us that to vote &#34;Yes&#34; would give the Government the alternative of introducing conscription by regulation of Statute law, we can neither admire the intelligence that put forth such a rotten argument, nor the spirit that moves them to prompt the Government to violate its solemn pledges to the country. &#34; But so long as we stand firmly together they can do no harm, nor do I imagine for a moment they have any such intention.&#34; Nevertheless, the issuing of their manifesto &#34; in opposition to the recommendation of the Inter-State Conference, is a serious blunder, suggestive of an inflated, sense of self-importance, and the sooner they realize it and get their own measurements more correctly, the better it will be for them and all concerned.&#34; &#165;hat is choice language to be used by a man whose writings sink into insignificance when compared with those of Robert Blatchford and Sidney Webb, lecturer in political economy at the London University, or with those of the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> who at one time did journalistic work in the interests of Labour. What right has this man to say that members of the Opposition have no intelligence merely because they dare to differ from him? This man Boote preaches, not Democracy, but the worst form of autocracy. He would take to himself the right to determine who should be returned to this Parliament. In other words, no man seeking to- represent Labour should be returned unless he bears <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boote&#39;s</inline> hall mark. The honorable member for Macquarie is to be commended for the stand he has taken in opposition to such Kaiserism. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boote</inline> is more autocratic than the Kaiser himself. </para>

As a member of the Electoral Commission I travelled throughout Australia - not only in the big cities, but in the smaller towns and hamlets. We inquired into allegations of corruption at the elections, and though these were probed to the very core, not one was substantiated. On the contrary, we found that the Electoral Office is controlled -by gentlemen who are above suspicion; indeed, I would be quite willing to contest my constituency without employing a scrutineer. The electoral officers who were examined by the Commission were asked some very keen pertinent questions, and every question was satisfactorily answered. The fact that the Electoral Office came out of an ordeal of this kind with flying colours leads me to think that the honorable member for Darling ia-. not correct in saying that some one attempted to intimidate him, and that when he made a complaint no notice was taken of it. </para>

                        <para>Referendum involves a choice - it involves ft free  choice  - liberty to say Yes, and liberty to say No. Consequently since it would be in no sense disloyal to utilize that liberty to vote either Yes or No, it is not disloyal to advise either Yes or No. But members of Parliament who advise No must take full responsibility for the fact that they are recommending the opposite course to that recommended by Conference; they are asking- that members of the organization should prefer their recommendation to that of Conference. For the reason given they may perhaps be within their strict rights, since a choice of policy is specifically remitted by Conference to the organization &#34;for decision. &#39; But the advice is distinctly hazardous, and is most unlikely to be accepted. </para>

                            <para>- This amending Bill, if it goes through, will be most useful to many honorable members opposite. At one time in the history of this House there was a proposal to increase the salaries of honorable members, and some representatives were against it. I do not think, however, that&#34; those honorable members were anxious that the_ motion should be negatived; and so it is with some honorable members in regard to preferential voting. They are opposing the Bill, but they are praying all the time that it might become law. </para>

                    <para>I believe there is necessity for this Bill now, although that was not so in 1914. At the present time there are not only two parties in this House; indeed, it would be hard to say how many parties there are, or what may happen when we go before the electors. Under the party system of to-day, we can give the electors a fair deal only by carrying this measure. Look at the state of things in the Swan division. </para>

No wonder that he is jubilant. They will sit side by side until they have to appeal to the electors under a system of preferential voting, and what will the result be then ?

                    <para>Reference has been made to the complication of the voting arrangements. Personally I dislike having two systems, and I ask what is to prevent the electors from marking the Senate voting ballot-papers  1,&#34; &#34; 2,&#34; &#34;3,&#34; the same value being given to each vote. There is not much fear of that system not being understood by the electors. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> C. Douglas, when the first Commonwealth election in Tasmania was conducted under the Hare system, it was found, according to a joint report of the Returning  Officer and of the Government Statistician, that the percentage of in valid papers was 1.44 per cent, for the Senate and 1.88 per cent, for the House of Representatives. I take that statement from an excellent paper on., the Hare-Clark system, summarizing an address given at Newtown, Tasmania, before the local branch of the Australian Natives Association. The Hare-Clark system was at that time new in Tasmania, and the facts justify the belief that we have nothing to fear in adopting it. The electors have sufficient intelligence to know how to record their votes- under it. </para>
                    <para>Very able articles have appeared in the press concerning the introduction of proportional voting for the Senate at the same time as preferential voting for this House. I should have no objection to it could it be shown that the counting of votes would not take more than a reasonable length of time. </para>

                            <para>The electoral law should not he forged as a party weapon, but should aim at making it possible for every elector to record his vote. Apparently, about 77,000 electors were unable to vote at the elections in consequence of the abolition of postal voting facilities, many of whom would -be the mothers of our people, fulfilling the noblest duties of life, and would have a keener personal interest in the government of the country than many who recorded votes. We therefore suggest the amendment of the Act to provide for postal voting prior to the day of election, with sufficient statutory safeguards. </para>

Women canvassers saw me, and expressed regret that there was no provision in the law under which electors who could not go to the polling booths could exercise the suffrage. They asked me to do my best on the Commission and in Parliament to alter the law in that respect. Those who are prevented by sickness or other unavoidable circumstances from going to the polling booths should be allowed to record their votes in some other* way. I welcome the reintroduction of postal voting, and the Minister is to bo commended for the manner in which he has provided for it. Possibly, in Committee, the safeguards may be strengthened, but great care has been exercised in providing for them.

Under this Bill the envelope must bc handed back to the elector, and he is subject to a penalty if he does not post it to the Returning Officer. It  is the  duty of the latter to keep a numerically marked list of all postal certificates and ballot-papers sent out by him. </para>

But I ask Ministers why they are not prepared to try on the dog what they propose to give to the pup. If preferential voting is good enough for the House of Representatives, surely it is good enough for the Senate. The senators, however, have said that if it is applied to the Senate they will throw out the whole Bill. The honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> said that he&#39; was in favour of postal voting, and that people had waited on him when he was travelling with the Electoral Commission and asked for the privilege of voting by post when they were sick. Does not the honorable member see the anomaly of allow-  ing a sick or infirm woman to vote by post for the House of Representatives, but to refuse to allow her to vote for the Senate ? </para>

                            <para>- The Chief Electoral Officer has reported that duplicate votes and votes recorded in the names of dead persons are very few. There is no reason why there should be many. In the old days people resorted to improper practices in order to get a vote because of the villainous electoral Acts which were then in operation. I recollect that at on&#169; place in Queensland the magistrate sat on the bench and struck off the roll eighty names, although fifty of the men affected were present in Court to answer the objection. The police, however, formed a cordon in the front of the Court,- and the men at the back could not get forward to answer when their names&#39; were called. The policeman merely said, &#34; No appearance, your worship,&#34;and his worship thereupon struck the name off the roll. But when an appeal was made to the Supreme Court every one of  those names was reinstated. On another occasion, the agent of the Pastoralists Union, Marshall by name, sent to every elector in the Barcaldine Division who was thought to have voted for Labour a notice telling him that his vote was challenged. We had nobody to defend our interests, and some of us were forced to study the Electoral Act very closely. This agent applied for all those names which he challenged to be struck off the roll. But he overlooked that section in the Act which provided that the &#34;objector must be on a roll. When the objections were heard in Court the pastoralists were represented by a couple of solicitors from Rockhampton and a. barrister. Two ordinary &#34; bush-whackers &#39;* were looking after the interests of the workers. After the objections had been made, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vaughan,</inline> the police magistrate, declared that he could not find the name of Marshall, &#39;the objector, on the roll. The lawyers tried to bluff by saying he was on the Brisbane roll, or some other roll. The cases were adjourned, and when the hearing was continued a week later there was no appearance of the lawyers to represent the Pastoralists Union; the two &#34;bushwhackers &#34; had knocked them out on  a  technical point. I have mentioned these instances of what we had to battle against in the early days of the Labour party. I remember that after the strike in 1891 George Fairbairn, now a member of the Senate, said to us, &#34; Instead of striking,- . why not send men from your own ranks to Parliament in order that they may tell the Legislature what the workers require?&#34; We did that. </para>

                            <para>- That was the trouble. The cushions were too soft, the whisky too strong, and the tucker too good. The consequence was that directly we commenced to put <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fairbairn</inline> &#39;s advice into practice, an amendment of the franchise was introduced. However, the Labour party kept pegging away, and from a representation of two or three members in the State Parliament in 1893, it has grown until there is in power in Queensland to-day a Labour Government that will remain in office for a long time. The Ryan Government are doing so much good for the people who returned them  that the other fellow looks on forlorn and hopeless. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Denison referred to intimidation. I remember that my opponent in 1901, George Edward Bunning, before he left his station to go electioneering, asked his manager how many votes he could expect to get on the station. The manager replied, &#34; Every one, sir.&#34; At that time, the votes were counted wherever they were recorded. Unfortunately for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bunning,</inline> he received only one vote on the station, and every man in the locality claimed that he had recorded it. Bunning said, &#34; I cannot believe any of you, so I will sack the lot.&#34; That was the last of the policy of intimidation on the stations, because the first Electoral Act passed by this Parliament - and I give credit to the present Minister for Home and Territories for his share in framing what was a very good, although not quite perfect, Act - provided that all boxes containing less than 100 votes must be sealed and sent to the Returning Officer, and by him mixed with other votes before they were counted. That prevented the station-owner knowing how his employees had voted. We had&#39; a rough time in the early days of the Labour movement. </para>

                            <para>- In the whole of my electorate, I do not know of a single case of even attempted intimidation. The scene has changed. To-day the Australian Workers Union and not the station owner, is the boss. At one time, the policemen, the magistrates, the Judges, the soldiers, and the gatling guns all belonged to the Government, of the day. To-day, Labour is boss. Now they are our soldiers, our gatling guns, our policemen, our Judges, and our prisons ; and if you do not obey our laws, we will put you in pur gaols. </para>

                            <para>- I would allow seamen to vote by post, and I would allow any person who is sick, or believes that he will be sick on polling day, to vote in the same way so long as it is made a penal offence to canvass for postal votes. Do not let us fool ourselves over the matter. We know very well how these votes are obtained. We know the tales canvassers toll. On one occasion, I heard my own character from a woman at Toowoomba. 1 asked her did she know the man to whom she was referring? She said that she had known him all his life, and that everything he had made was got by gambling and by taking people down. In fact, she described him as being a regular speller. She was referring to myself. If we prevent individual canvassing for postal votes, we shall remove as much danger as possible, and make VOl,ing by post as pure as  voting at the ballot-box. </para>

The honorable member has probably learned that some people are honest through fear of being found out; and when they are found out, they are still regarded as strictly honest, because the other fellow has done exactly what he has prosecuted them for doing. There are men in Queensland who are not in gaol, but who ought to be there, who have imprisoned persons for committing offences for which they themselves ought to have been punished. </para>

                            <para>- I do. Nothing gives me greater pleasure. When I remember the vicissitudes through which we have passed since 1S91, it is a marvel to me that we are here at all. On one occasion I saw a cartoon in a Melbourne paper picturing a Labour man with, hobnailed boots, half-a-dozen hairs sticking out representing a moustache, and a couple of fangs protruding from his mouth. He  was wearing bowyangs, a belt, a shirt, and no coat, and two or three hairs were sticking out through a hole in his hat. The cartoon bore the words : &#34; This is how Australia is going to be ruled.&#34; In passing, I wish to show what has been done by the Labour party. Australia would have been in a queer pickle had it not been for, the Labour party&#39;s policy in regard to the &#34; tin-pot &#34; Navy, about which the Liberal Opposition talked so much. Although hairs were sticking out through holes in our hats, and although our boots were hobnailed, we had brains enough to do something for the land of our birth or our adoption, and we practically saved Australia for the Empire. </para>

                            <para>- I am pleased to hear it. The Minister&#39;s statement removes some of the opposition that I had to this Bill. While the Minister -was moving the  second reading of the Bill, I- inquired whether, under the preferential voting system, plumping would be permissible. He replied in the negative. This gives rise to another difficulty. Out of three candidates for one electorate there might bo only one whom an elector considered to be worthy of a moment&#39;s consideration. He might regard the other two as political wasters. In such circumstances, why should he he compelled to vote for all three candidates in two of whom he had absolutely no confidence? </para>

                            <para>- . Not at all. I do not think my party won a single seat by means of preferential voting. Every victory secured by the Labour party was, I believe, in a straight-out fight as between two candidates. The application of preferential voting to elections for the House of Representatives, and the continuance of the present system of voting in the case of the Senate elections, will serve to befog the electors, and must lead to a great increase in the number of informal votes. If preferential voting is to be applied to elections for the House of Representatives, it should also be applied to Senate elections. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; I was under a misapprehension. The honorable gentleman, from the inception of Federation, has consistently advocated proportional representation, and but for the immense majorities that Labour has secured on different occasions, he would, no doubt, before now have charmed us into the adoption of the proportional representation system. Discussing it on one occasion, he declared that under it the fellow who came along seeking election to this House after we had been here for a few years, would have no possible chance against the sitting member. I was unable, however, to &#34; swallow &#34; that. I was satisfied with the system we had then in vogue, and I am satisfied with it now. I do not think that the adoption of preferential voting will help to put me out of Parliament, so that in opposing it I am not actuated by any personal consideration. I take the view that the less complicated our electoral machinery is the better it will be for the people. As the honorable member for Wakefield said. &#34;I am for the people every time.&#34; The honorable member is a great Democrat, and desires to secure the true value of every vote, but just so far as to put him back into Parliament. Is it necessary at this time to introduce this legislation ? </para>

                            <para>- I have no desire to hang up any business. I take up very little of the time of this House; but my political existence is at stake, and if I do not defend myself, the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> will not, unless, of course, it is in a Police Court, and I pay a good fat fee. I do not wonder at every honorable -member wishing to say something on this measure, for many of us, if it be passed, may be singing our &#34; swan .song.&#34; </para>

                    <para>I know it is a forlorn hope to oppose the postal vote as it is provided for in the Bill. The late Charles Cameron Kingston used to say, &#34; You can talk and talk; so long as 1 have the numbers I do not want to talk at all &#34; ; and -that is the present position in a nut-shell. I believe all Ministers have an idea of improving the electoral machinery, and some of it needs amendment; but, taking everything into consideration, I think our Electoral Act compares favorably with that of any of the States. </para>
                    <para>Does it not seem an anomaly and an injustice to the taxpayers of Australia that we should have seven Electoral Offices in this country? There is a State Electoral Department and also a Commonwealth Electoral Department in each of the States, though I am pleased to know that the Minister has great hopes of bringing all the different Departments under one head. I know that the honorable gentleman has advocated a reform of this kind for years, and at one time was sanguine as to the States joining with the Commonwealth and operating on one roll. If the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> desires to do something for the people for whom he is <inline font-style="italic">bo</inline> anxious, he will strive to get South Australia to do as has been done in Tasmania, where a combined roll has been found to work well. If the Federal and State electoral systems are not exactly the same, the difficulty can, as the Minister has told us, be overcome by distinguishing the Federal and State voters by a star, or asterisk. The cost of compiling the rolls runs into hundreds of thousands of pounds, and much saving will result from a joint roll. When Federation was being advocated, the great argument was the expense that would be saved. We were told that, with a High Court for Australia, some of the State Courts would be done away with, or so deprived of business that the number of Judges could be reduced. </para>

                            <para>- At a Conference in Brisbane I told some State Ministers that a change might come much sooner than they expected, and that they would be compelled to join in an arrangement with the Commonwealth. The State expenditure, as apart from that of the Commonwealth, is going ahead by leaps and bounds, instead of being reduced. </para>

                    <para>The cost of the compilation of the rolls is an instance of unnecessary expenditure. On  one  occasion in Brisbane I saw a policeman on one side of the street taking names for the Commonwealth roll, and another policeman on the other side collecting names for the State roll. It is only fair to say that each side of the street was in a different district; nevertheless, there was the fact of this duplication, and unless we do something the expanse will go on as in the past. </para>
                    <para>I know that it is of no use opposing the postal vote, but I impress on the .Minister that if he desires to make it secure - and no man desires to deprive the sick and infirm of the franchise - the Government will make it a penal offence to canvass anybody for such a vote. At one election in Queensland a whole bunch of justices of the peace - hundreds in one day - were gazetted, and for what? To go round canvassing for postal votes. We do not desire any such scandal in connexion with the Commonwealth. This incident made every one in Queensland afraid of the postal vote; in fact, those who were responsible found their action recoil upon them to such an extent that the Government was put out of office. The postal vote is all right so long as it is properly and honestly safeguarded and worked; it is canvassers that cause the trouble. I am sure that if the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> were behind the door sometimes when Labour canvassers, especially ladies, are at work, and heard his own character discussed, he would not think he was the same man. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not. I recognise that this is mainly a machinery measure; and I sincerely hope that, with help from both sides, we shall &#34; lick &#34; it into workable shape. I regard electoral Bills as non-party measures, and I do not think that any honorable member wishes to take an advantage over another - though  nowadays it would seem that everything is party. A few weeks ago a young lady, who asked me what my politics were, was surprised at my reply that I had no politics. She thought that a man without politics was like a dog without a tail. </para>

                        <para>.- When the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Page)</inline> commenced his speech he seemed to be in strong opposition to almost every clause of the measure, but I think that when he realizes that in regard to several matters he was mistaken, the Bill will receive his &#39;support in Committee. Indeed, he has promised to support it. After the experience of the past few days, will any one say that our electoral methods are satisfactory? At the present time there are a number of political parties in Australia. There are the Official Labour party, the National Labour party, and the National Liberal party - now joined in the National Federation - the Country party, the Returned Soldiers party, the Prohibitionist party, and others. Are we going to so frame our law that only two parties can successfully present candidates for election? The Swan division, which was represented by the late Lord Forrest, is now to be represented by a man who has received only about  6,000  of the  18,000  votes polled at the election - a preposterous state of affairs, which should not be allowed to continue. We must devise some method whereby the representation of the people will be more equitable. </para>

                    <para>The most important part of an Electoral Bill is that providing the machinery for enrolment. The Constitution and the Electoral Act are the foundation of Parliament, and we should endeavour to provide that every person qualified for enrolment shall be enrolled, and that no person can be enrolled more than once. The existing law leaves the door open to unscrupulous agents and organizers. Time after time I have noticed that, within a day or two of the issue of a writ for an election, an enormous number of claims is sent to the various Electoral Registrars. I do not blame one party more than another for this. It is the result of party organisation. Those names are placed, on the rolls whether the applications are justified or not. In my opinion, a revision Court should deal with enrolment. Our electoral law has been in force since  1901.  We have provided for compulsory enrolment, with a penalty for failure to enroll, and there is no reason why every qualified person should not have his name on the roll. To further facilitate enrolment, young persons about to come of age and immigrants who had been in the country for three months should be allowed to apply for enrolment three months before the date on which they will become entitled to exercise the franchise. These applications should go before a revision Court, the elector not having to attend unless his enrolment was objected to. </para>

At the present time a man may apply to be enrolled for a Melbourne division, stating that his name is already on the roll for, say, Ballarat or Bendigo. The Department thereupon puts his name on the roll on the division for which he seeks enrolment, and then sends word to Ballarat or to Bendigo that his name is to be taken off the roll there. But it may never have been on that roll, and he may have been enrolled for Geelong or some other place. A name  should  not be placed on a new roll until it has been taken off the old roll. </para>

                            <para>- Objection has been taken to the system of proportional voting on the score of trouble and delay, but surely the card system of checking will cause worse delay. I know that the card system, if well operated, is a fairly good one, but in regard to such an enrolment as that of, say, John Smith, working on railway construction in some remote place, a signature difficult to decipher, and no definite address, it must happen  that names get on and are kept on a number of rolls. </para>

                    <para>I have always favoured postal voting, though I think that strong safeguards are required. I agree with the honorable member for Maranoa that it should be a penal offence to tout for votes, particularly for postal votes. I know that the Minister keenly desires to provide for the clean conduct of elections, and he might consider whether he could not amend the measure, so as to make it a penal offence for any person to tout or to associate himself with touting for postal votes. I represent the biggest constituency in Australia, and perhaps the biggest constituency in the world. Many of my constituents have gone out into the  Never-Never  country, and, in view of their hardships, deserve every consideration. It is impossible for a station or a business to be left without some one in charge. Some of the booths in the Dampier Division are 60 or 80 miles apart, and others are separated by even greater distances on the Pilbara and Gascoyne fields. A man, his wife, and two or three employees cannot all get away at the same time, even though there may be a polling booth within 15 miles of the homestead. I should have preferred to see the right given to vote by post to electors residing 10 miles from a polling booth. Will any one say that the sick, or mothers and prospective mothers, should be disfranchised? There are 140,000 births in Australia during a year. Why should a third of that number of mothers - or say 47,000 women- be disfranchised by being unable to vote by post? The Labour party acknowledged the principle of postal voting when it provided that seamen and others who anticipated being on the water on polling day should be able to vote by post. The seaman can go to the Registrar and&#39; record his vote. The system is good, provided that it is properly safeguarded. </para>

                    <para>I have had a good deal of experience of preferential voting in Western Australia, where the system has been in operation for a long time. Lately I have been studying the electoral methods operating in different countries, and I think that the preferential voting system is far ahead of any other as a means of affording every section in the community an opportunity of sending its representative to the poll. No other system appears to do that. At present men are returned by merely a relative majority. Can anybody justify a system which gives such a result as that in the Swan by-election, held on Saturday ? If the votes polled for the two parties were at all approximate it might be argued that the number of candidates reduced the majority of the successful Labour representative, and that, had only two candidates gone to the poll, he would still have won. But it is clear from the polling in the Swan electorate that the majority of the electors were in favour of the return of a National party representative. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member need only study the polling in the Swan electorate,, in connexion, with the last Senate election to discover the preponderance of National party supporters in that constituency. I suppose the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Corboy</inline> was a returned soldier gave him a little additional support, and probably there has been, as there always is between any two elections, a little change in public feeling. But the poll on Saturday was very similar to the polling, at the last Senate election, and there cannot be the slightest doubt about the National sympathies of the constituency. </para>

                            <para>- It is. In New South Wales, and in many European countries, the second-ballot system is in operation. I do not think that there :&#39;ould be any worse electoral method than that. It opens the door to all sorts of abuse. That is proved by report after report. A Committee of the French Chamber of Deputies has reported officially that &#34; the abolition of the second ballots, with the traffic in votes which they cause, will not be the least of the advantages &#34; which are expected from the adoption of the system of proportional representation. </para>

                            <para>- If four candidates stand, and none gets an absolute majority, the two leading candidates again stand for election on a later date. In the interim all sorts of corrupt practices are resorted to. One authority which I have been studying records that at the German general elections in 1907 the Social Democrats polled 3,259,029 votes, which entitled them, on a proportional basis, to 115 seats; but the number of seats which they won as the result of the second ballot was only 43; whilst the Centre party, which polled 2,179,743 votes, entitling it to only 77 seats, actually secured 105 seats. It is clearly shown that the practice of one party working in with another party after the first election leads to all sorts of  intrigues,  which defeat the result which would have been obtained had the first election been conducted on either the preferential or proportional system. I believe in the compulsory application of the preferential system. When it was first introduced in Western Australia, it was not obligatory on the elector to vote for the candidates in the order of his preference; but experience showed that compulsion was necessary in order to make the system complete. To-day, compulsion is applied in almost every country where the preferential system is in operation, and undoubtedly it has been very effective. Every section in the community is enabled to send a candidate to the poll. Surely, when we have adult suffrage and payment of members, in order to enable every class to be represented, it is right that we should provide the most effective means to enable the majority of the people to return to Parliament the man whom they consider best fitted to represent them. </para>

Here is an informative extract from the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> about the attitude taken up by the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> in regard to the war aims enunciated bv the Inter-State Labour Conference in Perth. At this stage, I take exception to honorable members alluding to that gathering as the Perth Conference. It was merely a convention held in Perth, and honorable members have no right to throw disgrace upon the most loyal part of Australia by describing it as &#34; the Perth Conference.&#34; The Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> says - </para>

The Federal Labour Convention, which is the body duly constituted for the purpose, is quite entitled to alter the policy, even that promulgated at the Federal elections last year, if it thinks fit, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Finlayson</inline> and every other Labour representative is bound by it. </para>

The candidate&#39;s pledge to the electors becomes contemptuous, and it is scandalous to think that at the present time the electors can choose only between a candidate so bound and one pre-selected by the National Federation. An instance of what happens was afforded by the last Senate election in South Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon stood as an independent candidate, but the people voted for one or other of the party tickets.

                    <para class="block">How can simplicity be the aim of this Bill, which requires the elector to enter the box with two ballot-papers, on one of which he shall signify by numerals the order of his preference, whilst on the other he must indicate his intentions by making a cross against the name of each candidate for whom he intends to vote ? When we are dealing with millions of people, many of whom understand very little of politics aud electoral methods, confusion must result from that dual system. There are two ways of overcoming the difficulty. The first is to divide each State into three divisions for the Senate. I do not think that system would meet with popular favour, but it would be better than the present method. </para>
                    <para>For the election of senators I would like to see each State cut up into three electorates, observing community of interest as far as possible, and adopting the preferential system of voting. Otherwise we should have proportional representation, for the Senate. Are honorable members opposite satisfied with what has occurred in the past under the block vote? At the 1910 elections, at which eighteen senators were returned, 4,018,119 votes were cast throughout the Commonwealth. Of these votes, Labour candidates polled 2,021,090, or 50.3 per cent., while candidates supported by other parties polled 1.997,029 votes, or 49.7 per cent. The difference between the two parties was only 0.6 per cent., yet Labour secured the whole of the eighteen seats. The opposite result was achieved at the last election, all the seats falling to the National party. Surely a system which can bring about such results is wrong.  The  only objection to the adoption of proportional voting is said by its opponents to be the enormous delay that will be unavoidable by applying the system to Senate elections, but this  is  absurd. </para>
                    <para>The supporters of the preferential vote and proportional voting have lately gained a great victory  in-  the British House of Commons by motions carried in connexion with the provisions in the Irish  Home  Rule Bill for proportional representation for the Irish Senate and House of Commons respectively.  The  following motions were passed: - </para>

                    <para>The  argument has &#34; been advanced that proportional voting should also be adopted for House of Representatives elections. It might be applicable in Victoria or in  New  South Wales, where there are large centres of population, but it would be eminently unsatisfactory if applied to Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, and Western australia. For instance, Western Australia returns only five members to this House, but they and the three senators standing for election at the same time would be elected on absolutely the same basis  if  proportional voting  applied  to the elections  of  both  Houses. </para>
                    <para>The best system of securing justice to the people is to adopt preferential voting.  Let  me point out my own experience. I had not the slightest desire to become a member  of  this House, but  at  the  request of  the Liberal party in 1913  I  consented  to  contest the Dampier seat. </para>
                    <para class="block">Shortly after coming into the House the double dissolution took place, and when I went back to Western Australia I found that the Country party were anxious to have me nominate as their candidate, but as that would have entailed my signing a pledge and submitting to pre-selection, I objected. I must always have absolute freedom, other than my pledges on the public platform. It was a fairly strong organization, and it felt that it was justified in putting up a candidate, but it refrained from doing so, as it realized that if a third candidate was in the field the Labour candidate would be returned. At the next election we came to better terms, and I was accepted as the Country party&#39;s candidate as well as the candidate for the National party. Why should not a powerful organization such as the Country party is be entitled to nominate a candidate for election to this House? Why should we stand up to it or any other party with a gun and say, &#34;You must not put up your man; you must accept our man or go without representation&#34;? Yet that is just what happens in various electorates, and it may happen te honorable members opposite if they should happen to become divided among themselves. In fixing our electoral laws surely we should do all we can to see that the people are fairly represented in the National Parliament. Therefore when we are in Committee I hope that we shall have the support of honorable members in framing a measure which will achieve that object. </para>

                        <para>. - I am unable to discover any urgent need for the introduction of this measure in time of war. I have been at considerable pains to ascertain whether, at the last general election, any promise was made by the Government to the people of Australia, or to our boys at the Front that, during the course of the war, our electoral system would be amended. I have failed to find any such promise, but, in the course of my investigations, I have discovered a clear and distinct pledge given, not only to those resident in Australia, but to the men who are fighting  in the trenches for us, that Labour legislation would remain untouched. During the campaign the Government issued a little paper entitled <inline font-style="italic">All for Australia,</inline> and, under the title, which is printed in heavy black type, there appeared the words, &#34; A newspaper to explain the aims and objects of the National Win the War Party (Ministerialists).&#34; The copy I have before me is dated Thursday, 12th April.. 1917. This little newspaper was distributed broadcast amongst the soldiers in the trenches in Prance, as well as amongst those in camp in England, Egypt, and elsewhere. </para>

A very dear friend of mine sent me this copy of it as showing what the Government were promising the boys at the Front. In his covering letter to me. he said, &#34; Do your best to keep this win-the-war crowd up to its promise. &#34; I ask the Government now to keep their promise that Labour  legislation  would be untouched, and that Labour laws would be administered in a sympathetic way. This newspaper will tell its own tale as to the gross and flagrant way in which the Government are breaking their promises. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister is out to win, tie, or wrangle. I invite honorable members to examine this newspaper for themselves. If they do, they will see that it is an official publication issued by the Win-the-war party. When the boys went away, the system of voting was by placing a cross against the name of the candidate favoured. Now there is to be an attempt to wipe out that system, so far as this Chamber is concerned. It will be a complete change in the electoral methods which were in vogue when our soldiers departed for the war. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite aware of that, but that is no real difficulty in the way of applying to the one Chamber what is sought to be applied to the other. All that would be required for the Senate&#39; would be to make the numerals opposite to the names of any three candidates of exactly the same relative value. If that were done the whole difficulty would be solved. &#39;The same principle is involved whether the people are asked to vote for one or one dozen candidates, so long as the values to be placed opposite to the names of all are identical. Unless the systems are uniform there will be nothing but confusion from one end of the country to the other on election day, when candidates are to be selected for both Houses of the Federal Legislature. The people will have one set of instructions for the Representatives candidates, and a, totally different set of instructions in the matter of electing Senate candidates. That must be altered, or our whole electoral system will break down. </para>

                            <para>- People who are accustomed to the old system of merely placing a cross against their selected candidate may put No. 1 opposite their choice, and leave all the other names unmarked. My point is that while a vote can be effective - while it can achieve the purpose the elector desires - it ought to be allowed. A candidate might perhaps have 1,000 such papers, and all these votes would be declared informal, although a majority of the electors might desire him to be their representative. </para>

                            <para>- It does not matter why; the point is that they did, thus proving that people are not yet educated up to this system of voting. This preselection ballot resulted in the candidate to whom I refer dropping out and somebody else becoming the candidate. This tends to make a farce and a travesty of elections. Let us take as an illustration an election in which there are four candidates, A,  B,  0, and D. When the ballot-box is opened, and the first preference votes are counted, A 13 found to have received 2,000 votes, B 2,371, C 1,031, and D 1,100. The candidate receiving the least number of votes is C, and he drops out. But supposing that for D 120 people had voted, putting merely No. 1 opposite his name and giving no other contingent votes, then D would lose that number of votes as informal, his total thereby being reduced to 980. Then D would have dropped out instead of C, although if C had dropped out in the ordinary way probably a large proportion of <inline font-style="italic">C&#39;a</inline> votes would have been transferred to D, and it would have been quite possible for D to become the elected representative. Again, if 1,000 voters had merely put No. 1 opposite A, recording no contingent votes, then A would have dropped out of the ballot, although there might be a majority of electors who desired him to stay in. </para>

                            <para>- That does not matter; the point is that under the system proposed people who vote for a candidate may be deprived of the right of giving effect to their vote on a mere technicality. Honorable _ members should realize that the second, third, or fourth vote is never counted until the candidate drops out, and the vote is always effective while a candidate is in the ballot. If a candidate receives sufficient No. 1 votes to keep him in the ballot, it is immaterial to him how people have voted secondly, thirdly, fourthly, or fifthly on his ballot-papers. The main point is that the voters desire a certain person to be in a ballot, and their votes are, I contend, effective. While a vote can be effective, it should be counted, but when it is not effective - that is to say, if the candidate in the ordinary way has dropped out - then that candidate&#39;s vote has become exhausted, and becomes informal of its own volition, as it were. I wish honorable members not to view this matter from a party point of view, but to give it the most careful consideration, for it is clear that an injustice may be done. </para>

When a candidate has not sufficient No. 1 votes to keep him in, the No. 2. preferential votes become effective, and&#39; have the same relative value as No. 1 votes. When a vote is recorded for a person who is in the ballot, and who may probably win, why should it be declared informal ? </para>

                            <para>- If this Bill is an act of generosity on their part, or if they are feeling the prickings of an uneasy conscience, perhaps it will remedy the great .wrong that was done to our party at the last election, and next time return us to power. But, joking apart, this question of informality of votes is a serious matter. Up to the present, we have been fairly liberal in our interpretation of our electoral laws. So long as a voter has indicated his intention his vote has been allowed, and I am pleading for something along the same lines to be introduced into this measure. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing of the sort. Under the preferential system of voting the main consideration for a candidate is to get the No. 1 vote. If he does not get sufficient of these votes he will be out of the ballot. I cannot emphasize this point too strongly. If a candidate has 100 votes to his credit, those votes become informal in the ordinary way if they contain no indication of any preference beyond No. 1. In Committee, I intend to move an amendment to give effect to the ideas I have outlined. </para>

                        <para>.- The measure which the Government have brought down is very bulky, but most of its provisions may be left to the Committee stage. The Bill introduces a principle which, though well known in some of the States, is quite new to the Federal Parliament. I cannot understand how members, especially those opposite, can fail to recognise the democratic nature of this intention to introduce preferential voting. Surely if Parliament is to be a reflex -of the people&#39;s opinions, the people should have the fullest opportunity of electing whom they desire to fill the seats. Under our present system, if three candidates are running, and if two happen to be on one side, and one a 0 Labour representative on the other, some one is asked to withdraw so that there shall not be any vote splitting. If, however, two or three men persist in seeking election on one side of politics, the opposing side running one candidate usually wins on a substantial minority vote. The recent election for the Swan division in Western Australia illustrates this point. In this case there were four candidates, one of whom was a Labour representative, and he has won with a little more than one-third of the votes cast. Is there anything democratic about that? </para>

                            <para>- That would not have made the position any better. The objection I take to the present system is that in some circumstances it enables a minority vote to prevail, and I say that members of this Parliament should come here as representing a majority of those who take the trouble to go to the poll. I cannot understand how a party that is always talking about democratic principles should object to this measure. To them, apparently, the word &#34;democratic&#34; is like the word &#34; Mesopotamia &#34; as it appeared to the old lady - a blessed word. They seem to think that if they can describe anything as democratic it is quite good enough. There could be no more democratic form of election than that which is proposed by the Government in the measure now before the House. The principle has been in operation with satisfaction in several of the States. </para>

                    <para>I think the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> urged that the Government should attach provisions penalizing any outside organization which might endeavour to influence candidates to stand down or in .any other way interfere with them. I do not think the honorable member need have any fear on that score if the principle operates in the </para>
                    <para class="block">Commonwealth as it is working in the States. In Tasmania, if there are five or six candidates of a particular line of thought offering, the organization which, they represent does not interfere with them in any way, but merely asks supporters to vote, for these candidate? in their order of preference. The organization is careful not to take up any particular candidate. The system works eery well in Tasmania, and I do not see why it should not be quite as satisfactory throughout the Commonwealth.  Indeed, I am quite sure it would, if the electors only realized that the franchise is a privilege, to be used to the best of their ability, and with a view to having their political opinions represented. If the public will only regard this measure in that sense, and not allow outside. people to pull the strings, or monkey with the system by asking them to vote first for their own candidate, and then to give their second preference votes to a man on the opposite side because they are afraid of some one else cutting their candidate out, the principle will work satisfactorily. Those States which have adopted this principle are not anxious to give it up, because they know it operates so fairly. It gives the public the widest range of choice, and that, surely, is democratic. Moreover, when a man is elected he knows that he is the representative of the majority of those who went to the poll. Quite&#39; the opposite to this happened in the by-election that has just been decided in &#34;Western Australia. A little while ago, when the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> was seeking election, considerable pressure had to be brought to bear on the farmers&#39; candidate to induce him to withdraw, and thus avoid splitting the vote. Why should that be necessary? Why should not the public have the right to vote for five or six candidates if that number offer? Would it not be better, and would it not be educative to those who have political aspirations, if the people had a wide range of selection? It would give all candidates a chance to show the public what they are made of as politicians. </para>
                    <para>Honorable members opposite have come out into the open to oppose this system on all sorts of flimsy pretexts. I cannot understand why they take up this  attitude,  because, if they are holding a preselection ballot, or are doing anything within their own leagues, they adopt this very system. </para>

                            <para>- It may be; but we are not now dealing with that system of voting. Preferential voting has proved itself effective when applied to constituencies returning only one member, and it is more than time that it was adopted in Federal elections. </para>

                    <para>To my mind, the lack of provision for a system of proportional voting, or some system of voting other than the block-vote system, for the Senate constitutes a  serious  omission from the Bill. A change in the method of- conducting Senate elections is even more needed than a change in the method of conducting elections for this House. Here, by reason of the fact that the States are represented by divisions, each returning one member, there is a more adequate representation of the public mind than is obtainable in the Senate, where a small majority in each State can prevent the minority from being represented. The chief objection to the present system of voting, so far as it applies to the House of Representatives elections, is that the public has not a sufficient range of choice, being confined practically to two opposing candidates. In 1910, when eighteen Senate seats had to be filled, the Labour party secured every seat, although the difference between the Liberal and Labour votes polled was very small. At the last Senate election, eighteen Nationalists were returned, and had there been a double dissolution every senator would now be a Nationalist, Labour being wholly without representation. </para>

                            <para>- I do, though there may be a practical objection to it, in the difficulty of counting the votes. Sometimes, under the proportional system, as many as twenty or thirty counts would have to be made to determine a result, and when  some  millions of votes had to be counted and re-counted, as in the case of a State like New South Wales, a large amount of time might be consumed in the process. Before the quota could be arrived at, it would be necessary to ascertain exactly how many votes had been polled. I do not say that this is a fatal objection. Possibly Tasmanian officials could show how the counting could be done fairly quickly. Something would be gained so far as Senate elections were concerned by dividing each State into three electorates, each with its own centre. It is very rarely that double dissolutions will take place. The results of the last convinced most persons that they are to be approached with great caution. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not. Under that system, New South Wales and Victoria would have all the representation, and remote parts of the Commonwealth would have little opportunity to make known their wants, and to advertise their resources. If, for the purposes of Senate elections, each State were divided into three electorates, with one candidate to be elected for each, the Senate voting could be on the same lines as that for the House of Representatives. </para>

                    <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> made a promise at Launceston that something would be done to alter the present electoral system. At the last election there was the risk that the National cause might suffer because of the rivalry of National candidates, and one of these withdrew on the understanding that the Government would introduce a system of preferential Voting at future elections. It was understood, in Tasmania at any rate, that the change would apply to elections for both Houses of the Parliament. </para>
                    <para>I am glad that the Government have returned to the principle of the postal vote. Why that vote was abolished I fail to understand. I have never heard a valid argument in favour of its abolition. I recognise that many persons who desire to exercise the franchise may be prevented from attending a polling booth upon polling day, and to enable them to. record their votes the system of voting by post, provided it be surrounded with adequate safeguards, is an eminently desirable one. In the matter of providing proper safeguards against fraud and manipulation, -I understand that the Queensland Act is practically a. perfect one. Why, then, cannot this Parliament follow the lines which have been laid down in that Statute? I think that the proposed limit of 15 miles from a polling place in connexion with the exercise of the postal vote should be considerably curtailed. Personally, I favour a reduction of the distance to either 5 or 7 miles. The Bill contains a new principle in that it will permit an elector who believes that on polling day he will be more than 10 miles distant from a polling booth to record his vote beforehand. That will, doubtless, prove a great convenience; but if it will necessitate the appointment of any considerable number of additional electoral registrars, I do not think that the expenditure incurred in giving effect to it will be warranted. However, that is a small matter, which can be better dealt with in </para>
                    <para class="block">Committee. I do hope that the Government will not rest satisfied with reforming the electoral system for the return of members to this House, but will earnestly grapple with the problem of how to provide for proper representation in the Senate. </para>

                        <para>.- I recognise that this is purely a Bill for consideration in Committee. But there are one or two points connected with it to which I desire to refer. In the first place, I protest against the Government attempting to alter our electoral system while so many men are absent from this country fighting the battles of the Empire. This Parliament promised those men that during their absence &#34; not one stone in the temple of &#39;Labour would be overturned,&#34; and it has a right to honour that promise. At the last election, too, Ministers told the people that they would not destroy any Act on our statute-book. </para>

                            <para>- That may be the honorable member&#39;s opinion, but it is not mine. I protest against the proposal to restore the postal vote, because I believe that the postal voting system leads to corruption. The honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> has affirmed that he has never heard a valid argument in support of the abolition of postal voting. Need I remind him of what takes place under that system? Whenever a keen electoral contest is in progress the canvassers for the rival candidates immediately get to work. They visit the different hospitals, .and, first of all, make floral gifts to tie patients. Then they commence to talk politics to them, with the result that the inmates, as well as the entire staffs of these institutions, are annoyed by their attentions. It is not in the interests of the sick that the system of voting by post is desired, but in the interests of political candidates themselves. </para>

                            <para>- In regard to the system of preferential voting for this Chamber I would point out that at the present time we are endeavouring to secure uniformity in the matter of our Commonwealth and. State electoral rolls. Here is an opportunity to secure uniformity in respect of our electoral systems of voting. We are departing from uniformity in connexion with the ballot by proposing that the electors shall indicate by numerals their preference in voting for the House of Representatives, and their choice for the Senate by placing , a cross Opposite the names of the favoured candidates. </para>

                            <para>-Is the Minister prepared to carry the system to its logical conclusion? If it is right that people should be represented in Parliament according to their numbers, the principle should be carried further, and parties should be similarly represented in the Cabinet. The principal body in connexion with our system of government is the Executive; and if the Minister sincerely believes in the principle of proportional representation, he should be prepared to extend it to the Treasury bench. There is proportional representation on the Works Committee and the Public Accounts Committee : let us extend it to the Cabinet. </para>

For my own part, I shall carry out every promise I made to the electors, regardless of the decisions of any conference. This Bill may have been intended as a reform, but, in my opinion, lt represents a backward step, and it will not achieve much. We have more important matters to deal with than a Bill which is introduced for the particular benefit of the present Government. We know that the Government are apprehensive of the farmers nominating candidates at the next general election. </para>

                        <para>. - This is largely a  Bill  to be dealt with in Committee. New South Wales  is  the one State in the Commonwealth which has not the preferential system of voting, and every argument which the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony)</inline> used has been used and exploded in State after State. However, some points&#39; have been raised by honorable members on the Opposition side with which I agree. We could not make a greater mistake than to provide that the elector shall signify his choice  by -  placing a cross against the names of Senate candidates and numerals against the names of candidates for the House of Representatives when the election for the two Houses takes place on the same day. I believe that if we operate that dual system, at least 25 per cent, of the votes recorded  will  be informal. </para>

                    <para>I think the time, has arrived for an alteration in the system of electing the Senate. The present system is crude in the extreme, and nothing could be more unjust. At the last  general election the party to which I belong secured the whole of the eighteen seats in another place. I say deliberately it should not have done so. The total vote cast for the Liberal candidates was 1,172,126, and they secured, the whole eighteen seats; while 825,568 electors throughout the whole of the Commonwealth failed to secure one representative in the Senate. In New South Wales, the Liberals polled 54 per cent, aud Labour 46 per cent. The representation should have been two Liberal senators and one Labour senator. In Victoria, the Liberals polled 54 per cent, and Labour 46 per cent., but in Queensland the result was worse still. There the Liberal party polled 50.9 per cent., and the Labour party 49.1 per cent., but practically half the electors failed to secure any representation, as three Liberal senators were returned. Can any one say that the result of that Senate election was not a travesty on representation? In the election of 1914, following the double dissolution, Labour, polling a bare majority of the entire votes of the Commonwealth, secured thirty-one seats in the Senate, and the Liberal party gained only Ave. If we had had proportional representation, the two parties would have secured exactly eighteen seats each. It is possible for one party to secure the whole of the voting power in the Senate after a double dissolution. As a matter of fact, if there had been a double dissolution twelve months ago, it is practically certain that there would not have been one Labour representative in the Senate to-day. I am one of those who think that that is not a good thing. On the actual results of the poll, if we had had proportional representation at the last election, the Liberal party would have secured twelve seats in the Senate, and the Labour party six. I should like to quote the figures for a number of previous elections, because they show what a complete travesty of representation is brought about by our present system. </para>

                            <para>- it is the duty of this House to do what it thinks is right, and leave the Senate to do what it thinks is right also. If we think proportional representation ought to apply to the Senate, we should put it iu the Bill, and take our chance of what the Senate chooses to dp. So strongly do I hold that view, that I intend to support the amendment that is to be moved in Committee to apply proportional representation to Senate elections, and I sincerely hope it will be carried. That will get rid of the great objection which has been urged in this debate, that to have one system of voting for the House of Representatives, and another for the Senate on the same day, can result only in hopeless confusion in the minds of a certain percentage of our electorates, while it will not secure the proper representation of all parties, as a good system should do. </para>

Edwards, who was very &#39;highly esteemed when he sat in this House for North Sydney, once said that there was more intrigue in one pre-selection than in three elections, and that statement was cheered by both sides. I have always held that no organization has the right to come between the electors and any one who desires to represent them. The choice of the electors should be as wide as possible, and it is not right for any organization - Liberal, Labour, Nationalist, or Socialist - to say to a man, &#34; Unless you will come to us, and lodge your nomination with us, and let us decide whether you may go before the electors or not, you have no chance.&#34; That is a travesty. on representative government. </para>

                            <para>- In my elections I have found that the financial assistance has indeed been all on one side, and that side was not mine. If a party likes to run only one candidate, there is no reason why it should be compelled to run more. I differ entirely from the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers),</inline> who would prevent a party selecting only one&#39; candidate. If, a party chooses to select one candidate only why should it not do so? But the Bill will have a very advantageous effect upon those parties which lake a wider grip of national government. Why should not the Farmers&#39; party run candidates ? Why should the people in a country constituency in Victoria be compelled to come down to a little clique in Melbourne for a decision as to who their candidate shall be? That kind of thing is a travesty on representative government, and one of the reasons why I hail this Bill with delight is the fact that it will put a stop to it by giving free access to the electors for those who desire to offer their services to them. It is said that the introduction of this system will be the means of bringing out many more candidates, and that those who have been fortunate enough to bo returned unopposed on several occasions will now have to contest elections, but if the electors desire to have a choice, surely it is not our place to hinder them ? </para>

                    <para>When the Bill goes into Committee I hope it will be taken out of the realm of party politics, and that we shall endeavour to secure proportional voting for the Senate, a uniform system of voting for both Houses as far as possible, and the establishment of the postal vote, thereby enabling sick people &#39; and persons who cannot get to the poll the opportunity to record their votes. In some country districts 3 miles are as much as 8 or 10 miles in a city or a suburb. </para>

                        <para>.- If we could just forget the past when we arc discussing this Bill we could much more easily arrive at a satisfactory re- suit. It is quite refreshing to hear honorable members on the Government side saying that this is not a party measure,  and telling us what they, propose to do when we are in Committee, but I have heard them say the same thing before, and the result has always been the same. The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams)</inline> may perhaps be much less open to the charge of not standing by his statements when votes are taken than other honorable members are, because on several occasions even during this session he has given us exhibitions of his independence, but we know that when it comes to a vote the Government have the majority, and the Bill which they bring forward is the measure which&#39; goes through. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> has given us no indication that we may hope for the acceptance of any amendments which will accord with the views of those honorable members who have expressed their opposition to certain of the provisions of the measure. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I have endeavoured to discover the reasons which have actuated the Government in bringing forward the Bill. We were informed by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> when the House met that on this occasion we were to consider urgent financial measures necessary for the conduct of the war, and I can only imagine that this Bill has been introduced in order to give him an occasional relief. This is one of those Bills which can be taken up and dropped as the, occasion requires in order to give a respite to the Treasurer from the strain of being continually in the House piloting his financial proposals through. There is certainly no urgency for the Bill. There has been no demand for it. </para>

                            <para>- If a promise was given that this Bill would be introduced I congratulate the Government on &#39; having decided to honour at least one promise. There is no other pledge that the Government or their supporters gave at the last election which they have had the decency to keep. In fact, the Government is a Ministry of broken pledges, and if this Bill is an indication of their return to honorable methods I congratulate them. </para>

                    <para>I take immediate exception to clause 3, which provides that nothing in the Bill shall affect the provisions of &#39; the Commonwealth Electoral (War Time) Act 1917, which Act disfranchised naturalized British subjects born in enemy countries, and therefore the contention of supporters on- the Government side that this Bill. does not disfranchise any one fails utterly. The Electoral&#39; (War Time) Act was a special measure brought in for a particular purpose during war time, and that purpose having been satisfied, rightly or wrongly in the result, its provisions ought to have been wiped out by this new Bill which is supposed to be a consolidating measure and the one authoritative piece of electoral machinery for this country. The Government are perpetuating in this Bill what was recognised then, and is more clearly recognised now, as a distinct blot on our electoral machinery. The War-time Electoral Act also provided for additional, questions being put to voters when desiring to record their votes. Honorable members will remember the irritation caused by those questions. </para>
                    <para>There is, however, one provision of the War-time Electoral Act to which I venture to give my assent, and I am surprised that the Minister has not seen his way to include it in this Bill, because it operated with very satisfactory results to the Government when applied under the War-time Electoral Act. It was also recommended by the Electoral. Commission. I refer to the provision for a party vote. A good deal has been said about the preferential vote for the House of Representatives and proportional voting for the Senate; but there is no provision in this Bill to enable an elector to vote for a particular political party. </para>

                            <para>- I can see no reason why a candidate should not be. distinguished by the name of the political  party to which, he belongs. I should certainly have no objection to my name appearing on a ballot-paper as that of the Labour candidate, and I do not think that my opponent would be likely to object if distinguished by the name of the political party to which he belonged. In connexion, for instance, with the byelection which has just taken place for the electoral division of Swan, what objection could there be if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.- Corboy</inline> had been described on the ballot-paper as the Labour candidate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges</inline> as the  National candidate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> as the farmers&#39; candidate, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> as the prohibition candidate? If that course had been adopted, it would have afforded a clear guide to the electors in recording their votes. What wc desire in connexion with all our electoral machinery is to enable t&#39;he electors to record an intelligent vote, in order that we may secure a satisfactory result from elections. </para>

                            <para>- It is not that the. elector requires to be told what a particular candidate  13,  but that a number of people desire to vote for a party candidate, and are not concerned about the individual at all. If on the ballot-paper the names pf the candidates were followed by the names of the parties they support, it would be of great assistance to the general voter. We should have no other desire than that every candidate shall be given a fair deal; and if people wish to vote for a particular political party, they should be given an unmistakable opportunity to do so. This is much more necessary in connexion with an election for the Senate than in connexion with an election for the House of Representatives. Many of the objections raised on the Government side to voting under the present system for the Senate might be overcome by having a party description of the candidates on . the Senate ballot-papers. The electors could, then vote in one vote for Labour party candidates or National party candidates, or the candidates of any other political party contesting Senate seats. This proposal was re- commended by the Electoral Commission as a simple method of overcoming what apparently, under the provisions of this Bill, will constitute a very serious difficulty. </para>

                    <para>A matter to which I invite the attention of the Minister is the provision in - regard to the appointment of the Commissioners who are to be responsible for dividing the States into electoral divisions. It is proposed that three shall be appointed, and the Bill specifies who and what two of. the Commissioners shall be. One is to be the Chief Electoral Officer, and another the Surveyor-General of a State, or some officer having similar qualifications. There is no suggestion as .to who is to be the third Distribution Commissioner. He is evidently to be &#39;a Government nominee, who may, and . probably will, be a distinctly party man, because no Government having charge of the electoral machinery will take any chances. Every Government that introduces an Electoral Bill, however anxious they may be to see that its provisions are just and fair, will naturally be prejudiced in their own favour. They will not include provisions in the Bill which will be of advantage to the other side. If the Labour party were in charge of this Bill, they would make its provisions as satisfactory to themselves as possible, and the party in charge of it now will naturally do the same. The third Distribution Commissioner will, therefore, inevitably be  a Government nominee - some man in whom the Government have confidence that he will see that the States are divided into electoral divisions in a way that will be satisfactory to them. Previously, in dealing with electoral measures, I have suggested that, in addition to the Chief Electoral Officer, there is one man in the Commonwealth who might most appropriately be appointed a member of the Electoral Distribution Commission. The Surveyors-General of the States are properly ap-&#39; pointed members of this Commission ; but, in my view, the Commonwealth Statistician is, before all, the one man qualified to decide what should be the division of population upon which our electoral representation should be based. I suggest  to the Minister that he might consider the possibility of stating clearly in this Bill that the Distribution Commission shall include three specified persons, and that the Commonwealth Statistician shall be one of the three. </para>

My experience of Commonwealth electoral affairs is that, where we have Commonwealth officers conducting elections, we get a fair deal, but when others are introduced we lose the advantage of the sense of responsibility which is upon Commonwealth officers, and that is &#34;disadvantageous, not merely to one party, but to the whole election. Immediately a suspicion arises in the minds of the people on either side that an election is not being conducted fairly, there is a decided disadvantage accruing. </para>

I think that members of Parliament should have no say whatever in the matter. &#34;We are interested in these electoral divisions. Naturally, if I can influence the Minister or the Government, or, through them, the Electoral Distribution Commission, to cut up the Brisbane division in such a\ way as to bo favorable to me, I am going to do it. But it should not be possible for me to do it. I do not think that members of Parliament should have any say whatever in the matter, or any influence in the division of the States into electoral divisions. The Distribution Commission should have full, absolute, and final power in the matter., </para>

                    <para>There is a clause in the Bill relating to the qualifications and disqualifications for enrolment and voting, and it is provided that only persons over , the age . of twenty-one years shall be allowed to vote. The War-time Electoral Act, however, provides that soldiers, sailors, nurses, and others enlisted for active service shall be entitled to vote whether their names are on the roll or not. When that measure was before the House I submitted an amendment providing that every citizen of eighteen years of age should be given the right to vote. I believe in that principle to-day more strongly than I did when the War-time Electoral Bill was before us.  We have imposed upon youths of eighteen years of age the responsibilities of citizenship, and we should accord them the privileges of citizenship. I should like to see in this Bill a clause providing that  every  man and woman who has been enrolled for active service in connexion with this war shall, because of that fact, be entitled to vote regardless of whether or not he or she has reached the age of twenty-one years. In Committee I shall* propose to amend clause 39 by providing that any soldier, sailor, nurse, or any other person who has been accepted for active service during this war shall be entitled to be enrolled. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so; therefore my amendment would apply to a comparatively small number.

For obvious reasons they may not have been able to secure enrolment. </para>

                            <para>- I certainly would not. I think we should have it clearly and specifically set out in this Bill that any man or woman who has been enrolled for active service shall be entitled to vote irrespective of his or her age. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment of which I have given notice. It will be but a very small recognition of the work of the men and women who have gone on active service in connexion with this war. At the most its virtue will expire- within a very short period, since the men and women under twenty-one, and therefore ordinarily disentitled to- be enrolled, will be few in number. A year or two hence they will be able to comply with all the usual qualifications. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> makes a suggestion that I should like the Minister to consider, and that is whether he cannot see his way to accept eighteen years as the qualifying age for enrolment throughout Australia. There is no particular virtue in the age of twenty-one years. A man does not, as if by magic, become wise on reaching the age of twenty-one years. </para>

Under this Bill, no provision is made for the substitution of a candidate. The only provision we have, and which gives either party, or any individual, - the right  to nominate another candidate in the circumstance of the original candidate dying between the date of nomination and election day, is contained in the War-time Act. I cannot understand why the Minister has not included in this measure a permanent provision as part of our. . electoral machinery. It is set out in the war-time measure to which I have alluded that if .any candidate dies between nomination day and polling day, the leader of either party shall have the right to nominate another candidate in his stead. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister does not. But instead of two parties, we are more likely to have five or six. _ This principle will only aggravate and intensify the party system. I have no  objection  to the party system as such. It is easily the finest system of government the world knows to-day. Of course, there is a still better system. We shall grow out of the present party method into something better; but we shall not do so by bringing about half-a-dozen different parties instead of two. One inevitable result of this Bill, under its provisions relating particularly to preferential voting, will be that instead of two candidates, with a straight-out fight, there will be at least four candidates in nearly every electorate. </para>

                            <para>- I had not intended to refer just yet to the Caucus, but had reserved it for a later part of my speech, when I intended to show that there is a. good deal of misconception and of deliberate misrepresentation regarding it. </para>

                    <para>There is another provision in the Bill to which I venture to draw the attention of the Minister. Probably I shall not secure, and do not expect to secure, the approval of the. Minister, and, perhaps, that of honorable members; but I am here to express my personal opinions. I should like to see Part xvi. of the Bill cut out altogether. That is the part which deals with the limitation of electoral expenses; and I do not see the slightest reason for its retention. I know the reason that the part is inserted, but I am not at all convinced that any limitation has the slightest effect on the expenditure of any party. We all know that, although the Act imposes a certain limit in this regard on candidates for both Houses, and also imposes the necessity for a return of expenditure within a certain time, none of the returns sent in are reliable. </para>

                            <para>- It may be a check, but it is not an effective check, and in my opinion it is of no advantage to anybody. Of course, candidates may say in favour of the provision that it enables them to point out to their supporters that their expenditure is limited, and that if the election is to be won by money it must be found by somebody else. Who can imagine the honorable member for the Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> allowing an election to fail for the sake of a few  pounds ?  His  &#163;100 would disappear, and he himself not know where it had gone, and nobody would ask him. Although the Labour party have suffered in the past for lack of funds, while their opponents were rolling in wealth, the fact remains that this limitation is a mere pretence, professing as it does to do something that it cannot do. There is no serious objection to preferential voting, and I am quite willing to accept it if it is thought that it will enable us to arrive at a fair expression of the will of the electors. </para>

I have no objection to the principle of preferential voting, because I believe it will work just as much . in favour of the Labour party as in favour of other candidates. If there is to be,&#39; as I have suggested, four candidates in each electorate, I think the Labour men will stand a very good chance of being one of the first, two in the first round. They will have as good a chance of getting preferential votes as the &#34; other fellow,&#34; and from a party point of view I do not think it will hurt us in any way. </para>

                    <para>Postal voting, however, stands on a different footing, and, generally speaking, I do not object to the principle. It i3 only reasonable and proper that every opportunity should be afforded to the electors to record their votes, and I am prepared to go -to extreme limits to give every man and woman that opportunity. But - I have not yet seen a system of postal voting work out satisfactorily. Every system that has yet been tried, State and Federal, has proved itself seriously open to corruption and intrigue. </para>

                            <para>- But the postal system seems peculiarly susceptible to these influences. It is supposed to apply particularly to sick people. As a matter of fact, we know that thousands of people who were not sick, and had no expectation of being sick, on the day of election exercised this particular privilege. We all know, too, that it was intended to apply particularly to women, but that thousands of men who expected to be sick on polling day voted by post at previous elections. And most of these sick people, strange to say, were to be found in the cities, and not in the country districts. </para>

                    <para>We have not yet evolved any system of postal voting which eliminates the possibility of abuse by people for whom it was not meant, and who have no right to use it. In this BUI, it is proposed to open the door still wider, because postal voting is to be made applicable, not only to people who are sick or expect to be sick, but to people who are not living within 15 miles of a polling booth, or who expect to be travelling By rail or steamer on polling day. My only hope is that when the Bill is in Committee we may be able to insert some provision which will, as far as possible, protect elections from fraud or corruption. </para>

                    <para>I am sorry that the Bill makes no provision for the enfranchisement or representation of Commonwealth .citizens resident in our Territories. We are extending our Territories, and now we have not only the Federal  Capital,  the Northern Territory, Norfolk Island, and Papua, but probably after the war we shall also be administering New Guinea. It is not fair, and it &#34;is not creditable to Australia, that there should be on Australian soil people qualified to vote, but who have neither that right nor any representation in our Parliament. I know it is a difficult and delicate question to handle,- and that it is not easy satisfactorily to give these people direct representation. The only method I can think of is to attach each of those Territories some State electoral division. Although there may be some argument in favour of the Territories jointly having, say, one senator to represent them, and one member in the House of ^Representatives, I&#39; would object most strenuously to. any suggestion that any such senator or member of this House be limited in the exercise of his privileges, and allowed to vote only on questions affecting the Territories-. Any representative so appointed should have exactly the same rights and privileges as other members. This suggestion has been made to get over the difficulty. I think most honorable members honestly believe that these people should be represented, but the &#39;question is how to do this satisfactorily and equitably. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but we must look forward to the time when some arrangement will have to bo made for their representation in the Federal Parliament. If in the Federal Capital Territory the Government projects are proceeded with, there will be a fully equipped Arsenal, and yet a large number of people there will be disfranchised. I have heard the Minister express the opinion that these people in our Territories should have some consideration, but this Bill makes no provision in that direction. In Committee I hope bo submit a few amendments which I trust will be accepted if there ia. anything at all in the argument that the Bill is non-party in character. If members on the Ministerial side of the House approve of principles which we on this side advocate, I hope they will vote for them. As far as I am concerned, I can promise that if I approve of principles which they are advocating, I will cross the floor with them. </para>

                        <para>- That may have been the experience in the past. The honorable member may be familiar with what has taken place in the dark ages; but that is no justification for the intrusion of party spirit into the discussion of this Bill. I have made a few mental notes of the debate, and regret to say that there has been&#39;, perhaps unconsciously and unintentionally, some exhibition of party spirit. One of the earlier Opposition speakers said, I think, that the &#34; other side,&#34; meaning the Ministerial supporters, &#34; are getting ready to wipe us out.&#34; But, in my opinion, every member wishes to give the electors of Australia &#38; fair and square deal. Our endeavour must be, not to suppress, but to give opportunity for the expression of, the political views of the electors. The essential provisions of the Bill are those dealing with preferential voting and restoring postal voting. It has been said that we have no right to make any radical alteration of our . electoral system while out soldiers are absent from Australia, and the promise that &#34; not a stone in the temple of Labour will be touched until the war is over,&#34; alleged to have been made by. a very distinguished citizen, has been referred to in support of this contention. We, on this side, have, been accused of ignoring that promise. It has been said about me personally that my election was won on that promise, though I had not heard it until I entered this House. The establishment of preferential voting in no way affects the promise. Practically every returned soldiers&#39; organization in Australia strongly favours preferential voting, and has carried a resolution to that effect. The provisions of the Bill are all in the interests of the soldier, because they make his voting more effective. What could be more ridiculous than the result of the Swan election? Within a week or two we shall have here as the representative of that division a gentleman for whom were cast only about one third of the total number of votes polled at the election. Those who object to preferential voting support an ineffective method of election which, in several instances, so  faT  as this House is concerned, has brought about the gross misrepresentation of the electors. However, as the hour is late, I ask leave to continue my speech to-morrow. - Leave granted; debate adjourned. </para>
