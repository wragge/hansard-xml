                            <para>.- The sneering of the Leader of the Government at the Leader of the Labour party exhibited in the opening remarks of the Prime Minister might well come under the parliamentary rule against tedious repetition. Notwithstanding that the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> is the soul of generosity in, his references to' the Prime Minister, the latter rarely rises to reply to him without indulging in sneering and insulting remarks. </para>

                    <para> It was characteristic of the Prime Minister that he should denounce both Democracy and the referendum because the result of the referendum was not acceptable to him, and the Democracy of this country does not agree with him. Let me read a passage which I think appropriate to the present occasion - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>There is surely some moral obliquity about a nature such as his. No act that he commits, no party that he betrays, no cause that be abandons affects him at all. He regards himself as the selected and favoured agent of Providence. Everything that he does he does for the very best! He does it because there is nothing else that can be done to conserve the welfare of the people and the interests of the nation. To realize this noble ideal, he has assassinated Governments, abandoned friends to the wolves, deserted principles, and deceived the people. . . He is the political mercenary of Australia. He will lead any party - he will follow none. He is faithful to only one thing - himself. . . . What a career his has been. In his hands at various times have rested the banners of every party in this country. He has proclaimed them all; he has held them all; he has betrayed" them all..... He stands to-day under the banner of the Employers Federation, under the banner of every vested interest, of every powerful monopoly. </para>

                    <para class="block">That might well be Hughes on Hughes, though it happens to be ' Hughes on Deakin, in 1909.

                    <para>For audacity <inline font-style="italic">in excelsis</inline> commend me to the complaint of the Prime Minister that the Leader of the Opposition did not; review the war situation. Such a review is primarily the responsibility of the Leader of the Government. It was his duly, when he met the House last week, to report upon the progress of the war. Not only did he not do that, but he has never yet made such a report to Parliament since the war began. When we met last, after an adjournment of three months, we had no such report; when the Budget for the year was introduced there was no such report. The Prime' Minister taunted the Leader of the Opposition with not having performed a duty which he himself has neglected throughout in the most barefaced manner. Furthermore, by the application of the censorship, he has prevented the Leader of the Opposition from obtaining knowledge of the facts upon which alone he could make a statement concerning the war. Compare the Prime Minister's inaction . in this matter with the practice in Great Britain. There is no occasion on which the British Parliament re-assembles after adjournments which are shorter than ours, on which some responsible Minister does not review the war situation. But from the commencement of the war to the present time, we have had no reports from this Government concerning the operations of the Allies and Australia's war activities. There has been no consultation with Parliament. We are kept absolutely ignorant by -this would-be dictator. The Prime Minister has failed also to report upon the great war-trading services of this country in which millions of our money are invested. We have had no report on our great shipping line, and know nothing of the Government control of the shipping belonging to private firms, except what we learn from the newspapers, very much- to the disadvantage of Government management. </para>
                    <para>The . Prime Minister offers to efface himself. For whom does he speak ? Does he speak for the Cabinet in this matter? I pause for an answer. There is none. Does he speak for his party ? <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> answer. </para>

                            <para>- Then the Government party has not been consulted. The honorable gentlemen opposite, by their laughter, seem to regard the matter as a huge joke. What . does this random; loose offer mean? Does it mean the maintenance of existing causes of disunity for which the Prime Minister and his Government are responsible ? It may be interpreted to mean that the right honorable gentleman would make a place in the Ministry for the Leader of the Opposition. It may mean an offer to form a National party by the amalgamation of all parties. It may mean an offer of the fair distribution of the responsibilities of office. It is, however, very vague, very indefinite, and disowned by both Ministers and members of the Prime Minister's party. It is a strategic offer not meant to be accepted. </para>

                    <para>Before dealing with this so-called offer in more detail, it is necessary to review the development of the affairs of this country. In spite of the misrepresentations, and vile calumnies hurled at the party with which I am associated, it stands in the same position in relation to the war to-day as it did at the outbreak of the war. We well remember the tragic events of July, 1914, the assassination of an Austrian prince on Bosnian soil, the ultimatum levelled at Servia, the impossible conditions of that ultimatum, the declaration by Austria that she would declare war on Servia if its terms were not completely fulfilled, Russia coming to the assistance of Servia, the declaration by France that she would stand by her Russian ally, and the attempt  by Germany to forestall France by the invasion of Belgium, which brought Great Britain into the war in order to honour the public law of Europe and treaties publicly made by her.' In standing by Great Britain in that enterprise Australia did not act with any one section of the people, but with all classes and creeds, including the great Labour movement. While it has suited the opponents of Labour to pretend that they seek to abolish party lines, for party purposes they have set out to prejudice the great Australian Labour movement by foul libels on- its aims and objects in connexion with the war. I repeat that Labour to-day stands where it did at the beginning of the war - </para>

We had great efforts put forth to assist Great Britain. Anything of material consequence that has been done in connexion with Australia's  part  in  the  war has been done under a Labour Administration. I ask honorable members opposite to point to one thing of any consequence that has been done  by them  since  they  have taken the place of the Labour Government. They cannot do so. They are as dumb as oysters. They have done absolutely nothing of any consequence. </para>

                            <para>- Australia is not singular in that respect. There have been strikes in every country at war - in France, Britain, Italy, and America, and in Germany as well. The only strike of any consequence in Australia during the war was that provoked by a despotism that plotted and planned the smashing of organized labour. We had peace, harmony, concord, and unity In Australia until W. M. Hughes assumed control. Before he went to London, his control in Australia was but nominal. It- was upon his return from Great Britain that the apple of discord was thrown into this country, and ever since then the war efforts of Australia have been paralyzed. There has been some talk of German propaganda. If the Germans had desired to propagate dissension in any country they could not have done better than by employing W. M. Hughes to do it in Australia. He has done their work better than they could have done it themselves. Any German attempt from outside to interfere in Australia would, have solidified the country, but this man has gone about creating dissension, discord, ' 'and disruption everywhere. In order to show what had been done until he came back from Great Britain, let me quote a few words of a speech which he delivered in London, before the Pilgrims' Club on the 17th March, 1916. He said- </para>

                    <para>He abused the censorship in the most shockingly partisan fashion. There has been no interference with the .press of Russia to outdo his manipulation of the newspapers of this country. </para>
                    <para>He sought to pollute the ballot box.After certain Ministers had refused him authority to pass regulations which would permit of military interference at the ballot-boxes, he got a couple of other Ministers together and had those regulations passed, upon which three of his colleagues resigned. 'He sent out orders that the press of the country was not to let the people know of the resignation of those Ministers; and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> had not been Acting Minister for Defence at the time, and had not threatened to order a military guard to lock up the censors if they interfered, the fact would not have reached the people through the press, and there would have been military intimidation at the polling booths. As late as the night before the poll, in the vicinity of 5,000 urgent telegrams were sent out to the electoral officers throughout Australia to withdraw those infamous regulations, because, this coward was' not plucky enough to stand up to them when his trickery was exposed to <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> public. </para>

                    <para>Mr. J. H. Catts</para>
                    <para class="block">And, worst of all, the whole of that campaign has been shown by subsequent events to be absolutely unnecessary. The division in the country, the discord, the disunion, the interference with Australia's war efforts were shown to have been the consequences of the extravagant, the unreasonable, military demands that the Prime Minister.. put before the country. </para>
                    <para>After the campaign we had a meeting of the Labour party, but the honorable gentleman did not meet the party willingly ; this brave man was forced to do so by a signed petition of members. Then, when he found that his leadership was challenged, as it was  challenged  in the National party a week ago, and that he was not able to manipulate the members of the Labour party as he has since manipulated the members of the National party, and that there was a majority against him, he was too base to remain and . receive the vote of his colleagues. He would be leader or' nothing. He walked out of the meeting, and asked those who were prepared to support him to go with -him. He was never expelled from the Federal Parliamentary Labour party; any statements that he was <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> expelled are unmitigated falsehoods. </para>
                    <para>It is true that he was ex.pelled from the outside organizations. It has been said over and over again that the expulsion took place for no valid  reason - that he was merely the victim of the dictation of the outside Labour bodies. When W. M. Hughes became a member of the Labour party he signed a pledge to abide by the platform of that (party, and upon a|l details associated with the- carrying out of the platform to accept the- decision of a majority of the Parliamentary Labour party in  Caucus  assembled. In carrying out the Labour programme of national defence the Labour party interpreted its attitude towards conscription for service overseas in a section in the Defence Act which it has placed on the statute-book of Australia. Section 49 reads - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Members of the Defence Force who are members of the Military Forces shall not be required, unless they voluntarily agree to do so, to serve beyond the limits of the Commonwealth and those of any territory under the authority of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">When that decision was arrived at by the Labour party, and  incorporated  in legislation, it became, equally with the declared planks, part of the platform of the party. When W. M. Hughes violated that decision he violated the platform of the party, and for that he suffered, like every other man who had violated the platform before him. </para>
                    <para>After deserting his own party the right honorable gentleman attempted unsuccessfully to form a National Labour Federation. He set out vindictively to smash the movement that took him from the gutter and raised him to eminence. He would have carried on by himself if he could have done so, but finding that he could not, he resolved to enter into a coalition with his life-long political opponents - the men who had derided him from every platform. We well remember the resultant wrangle for jobs. Negotiations took place over a lengthy period in regard to the division of the loaves and fishes, the Ministerial portfolios, and only recently we had another illustration of the same tactics. History repeats itself with the right honorable gentleman. Almost simultaneously with the Coalition negotiations, the Labour party received a hypocritical invitation to join with the man who a few weeks before had left its ranks and attempted to set up another organization for the purpose of smashing the Australian Labour movement. In face of the base slanders uttered against Labour, that offer was meant only to be refused. </para>
                    <para>The activities of the Coalition Government were no less remarkable. Then, as now, being defeated at a conscription referendum, the Prime Minister desired to escape to England. The Coalition party would not allow him to go by himself, and appointed two others to accompany and watch him. </para>
                    <para>The Prime Minister sought to have the life of Parliament extended until the end of the war to enable him and other Labour pledge-breakers to hold their seats, in spite of public opinion. The proposal was to extend the life of Parliament till the end of the war and six months thereafter by an interference on the part of the British Government with the self-governing rights guaranteed to us under the Constitution. </para>
                    <para>Do we not remember that the difficulties of the Government were so great in connexion with that proposed delegation and the attempt to extend the life of Parliament that we had the scandal associated with the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Beady?</inline> The majority of members in another place carried a resolution demanding the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into what was supposed to be the bribery and corruption connected with the Beady incident, which arose out of the necessity to get a majority in another place to carry out the decisions of the Coalition Government. While the Ready incident remains without a public, inquiry, and the futile demands of the Senate for the appointment of a Royal Commission stand on the public records, and the Government show themselves afraid to face an inquiry, we can come only to the conclusion that the refusal is. prompted by the knowledge that bribery and corruption took place which could not be covered up. </para>
                    <para>Then, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> rose in his place in Parliament, and explained that the same tricks had been tried on him, that all sorts of offers had been made to him, the Prime Minister sought to break down the privileges of Parliament by dragging into the Law Courts of the country a very poor man who could not afford to defend himself there. That action has since been settled by the Prime Minister paying the whole of the costs of both sides. </para>
                    <para>The circumstances associated with the resignation of one Tasmanian senator were so obnoxious to two Liberal senators from that State .that they threatened to vote against the Government in regard to the proposed delegation to the Imperial Conference, and thus forced' the Government unwillingly to face the electors. </para>
                    <para>It is true that by purloining from the outside recruiting organizations the name of "Win-the-waT," and smashing that organization in order to get a party advantage, and because of the disruption of the Labour party, which up to that time could not be sufficiently explained to the people, and because they pledged themselves that, they would not bring in conscription, although  they had sworn before Heaven that the government of the country . could not be carried on without it, they were returned again to power. I am compelled to confess, also, that the clumsy tactics on the part of Labour assisted tbem. At any rate, they returned with a majority about the same as that previously held by Labour.' </para>
                    <para>What has this party, with its. great majority, done to win the war? Honorable members opposite have put a tax on single men as a means of introducing economic compulsion ; they increased the salaries of Ministers by voting £1,650 into the Ministerial pool to be shared amongst members of the Government at the rate of about £200 each ; and they passed a bogus Repatriation Act, which does not guarantee a single thing to any soldier. Beyond those efforts they have not attempted any measures which can be said to be designed to assist in winning the war. </para>
                    <para>Last year we had a brief session, and an adjournment in September, because we were given tp understand Ministers- desired a spell. Some of our friends said that the Government were tired of criticism and desired to get away from' it. As a matter of fact, that adjournment took place in order that the Government might secretly, and behind the backs of the people, arrange another conscription campaign, and take their opponents at an unfair advantage. Just before the adjournment the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine)</inline> appealed to the Leader of the Government to state publicly to the House the reason for it. He said that there were matters of great national importance which must be dealt with, and he invited the Leader of the Government to take the House candidly into his confidence and tell it the reason for the adjournment. </para>
                    <para>The Prime Minister has said something as to the Germanic attack upon Italy being one of the reasons for the referendum. The arrangements for the conscription campaign were made, however, before the first news of that attack had reached Australia. </para>

The most serious inroad made upon our liberty, since the time of the Stuarts.

But who would take the word of these discredited men as against the evidence of soldiers whom we know? </para>

An honorable member is using his position in this House to engage in something which helps our enemies and injures our friends. I can only say, for my own part, that, if the rules of the House do not prevent this, it amounts to a kind of treason. </para>

If the privileges of- honorable members can be frittered away by a majority in this chamber, the minority will be denied the right of free speech. Already outside this building the Government have power to censor any utterance which may be made. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister for the Navy has asked my ruling as to whether the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts)</inline> is in order in making certain references to a nation which is in alliance with Great Britain at the present time. In anticipation of such a matter arising, I have had a consultation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and I find that I am absolutely bound by our own rules and Standing Orders. The honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McDonald)</inline> has argued that, as a matter of privilege, every honorable member is entitled to say in this chamber whatever he may deem it necessary to say. I do not construe the privileges of honorable members in that way at all. Under our Standing Orders nobody has a right to make statements in this chamber which are calculated to embitter relations between any of the allied nations. That is my construction of our Standing Orders. Obviously, the framers of those orders were unable to make provision for every contingency that might arise, and where no special provision has been made, we are directed by standing order 1 to recognise what is the practice of the British House of Commons in similar circumstances. I am Satisfied that the  Speaker  of the British House of Commons would not permit any reference to be made to an allied nation of the character that was made by the honorable member for Cook. I rule, therefore, that the honorable member is not in order. </para>

                                <para>- I do not intend to persist, against your ruling, in my criticism of the Power to which I have previously referred. Then I hold in my hand a review called <inline font-style="italic">The New East,</inline> which opens with a message from His Royal Highness Prince Arthur of Connaught, a member of the Royal family. That magazine contains an , article from which I quoted at public meetings during the recent campaign, for which action I was haled before the Court. Then there is another article dealing with the same question, published in the <inline font-style="italic">Chicago Tribune</inline> of 6th November. Of course, under your ruling, I am not at liberty to mention the contents of these articles. But evidently an article which it is quite proper to print in a Japanese magazine with an introduction to it by a member- of the Royal family,- and facts of importance, published broadcast in America and England, must not be mentioned in this great country of ours, notwithstanding its vaunted freedom. </para>

                                <para>- I come now to the military partisan political censorship of the daily press in the interests of this Government and against its opponents. Last week a statement was made by a New South Wales Minister in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzgerald,</inline> who complained of the way in which the military censorship affected public news. The Minister for Defence at once exclaimed, "I challenge him to give an instance." Well, the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun,</inline> on Sunday last, supplied an instance, and here it is - </para>

                            <para class="block">On December 11, when the referendum campaign was in full swing, a cable message of 228 words lodged in London at 2.45 p.m. on December 10 and addressed to the <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keith</inline> Murdoch, its London representative, described how the Australians in France were training and preparing. In the course of this message the following passages occurred :  - " Considerable sections have been playing football and attending the races and horse show's. Some have motored to seaside resorts, the British supplying a fleet of transports for the purpose. The difficulty with football ls that the New South Wales Brigade play Rugby, the Victorians play the Australian game, and composite brigades have mixed rules. Inter-brigade contests are impossible, but there is keen competition and rivalry between battalions. Some teams claim international players, and their games attract great crowds, but soldiering is never allowed to sink into the background." </para>

                            <para>None will dispute that this is war news, that it is war news of peculiar concern to every Australian, that it came from London, and that it was censored. The message was delivered at this office, and after its receipt the Censor's Department directed that the sentences quoted should be expunged. They, therefore, had to be omitted from the cable story which was printed. </para>

                                asked for only one instance. We have given it, and anybody who cares to read between the lines can see that it was not only censorship, but censorship of a particularly poisonous kind, because it was political censorship for party purposes. If

                        <para class="block">We know that Ministers went about the country telling . the electors that our soldiers in the trenches were being done to death because they were unable to obtain leave, and that conscription was necessary in order that they might be given reasonable spells from nerve-racking duty at the Front.. The Labour movement is passionately devoted to the interests of our Australian soldiers, but to allow the Government to use our soldiers is a different matter. Ministers indulged in a lying campaign from one end of this country to the other - a campaign which' would have been exposed had the facts been allowed to appear in the public press. Those facts were suppressed, not for military reasons, but for political party purposes, in order that the electors might be denied the facts necessary to enable them to base a sound judgment on the conscription issue. </para>

                            <para>It is officially estimated that the regulation which made it illegal for persons of enemy birth or descent to vote to-day, had the effect of disfranchising, approximately, between 80,000 and 100,000 persons in the Commonwealth. </para>

They were not disfranchised on account of their line of descent, but because it is known that the great bulk of them are young Australians, and the young Australian of all lines of descent is opposed to conscription. It was their age, and not their line of descent, that caused them to be disfranchised? </para>
                        <para>Now, let us see the attitude of this Government towards Germans. When the Australian workmen were forced on strike a little time ago, while the wharf labourers refused to have Germans in their union, or to work alongside them, this Government used Germans and other foreigners for the purpose of defeating our own Australian workmen who were on strike. </para>

Only those soldiers who could go to the booth voted there, and the box was afterwards taken around the beds* in the hospital. The result of that vote gave a majority against conscription of 174. I have that information from military officers who have a knowledge of the facts. </para>

The bribe of more portfolios may keep those looking for favours quiet. But there can only be one end, and that is disaster. There was only one thing proper to be done in the circumstances. After the Government resigned, the proper course was for the Governor-General to send for the recognised Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition informed him that he believed he could carry on. He should then have been given a commission to form a Government. </para><interjection>

                                <para>- It is well that the public should know that there was at least one alternative before the Government and the Governor-General. The proper course was to call on the Labour party to occupy the Treasury bench. Then, if the majority of members did not wish this party to hold office, if they did not agree with the war-time programme we were prepared to place before them, they could have put it out. That is what was right, in the circumstances; and although members may think that they have escaped the consequences of their action, I tell them that the longer they go on as they are going on at present the sorrier will be the mess into which they will land themselves. </para>

                        <para>Can this Government make a. success of voluntary recruiting after it has divided the country as it has done, and when Ministers are occupying the Treasury bench in defiance . of the will of the people? The Government, except technically, has no constitutional authority, and its recruiting efforts, whether by the voluntary or any other system, will not and cannot 'now succeed. They are discredited. No intending recruit can take the word of publicly acknowledged pledge breakers. </para>
                        <para>The Leader of the Government read some old resolution passed by the Political Labour League of <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> South "Wales regarding recruiting in an attempt to misrepresent this party, but I would remind the House that the leader of the movement in that State is vice-president of the State recruiting body. Further, there is a Federal Labour member for each State representing our movement on the Federal Parliamentary Recruiting Committee. </para>
                        <para>The right honorable gentleman spoke of our war aims, and caricatured and misrepresented some resolutions carried at a State conference. There has been no resolution regarding peace carried by a Federal conference of the body, and no member of the Labour party of this House is bound in the matter.What the Prime Minister caricatured was a series of peace resolutions of a State conference, passed as a suggestion to the Federal conference. I shall have an opportunity, at a later stage, to put all these resolutions on record, and shall ask that they be compared with what has been said by  President  Wilson, and what has been urged by the Labour bodies of America and Great Britain on the" subject. The comparison will not be to the disadvantage of the Labour movement in Australia. </para>
                        <para>This gentleman, who caricatures our attitude toward recruiting, who misrepresents1 our war aims, who falsifies our position in regard to peace terms, now says, " I ask you to join us in a coalition." Does not that offer prove that he knows that what he has said about the ' Labour party is absolutely untrue? If he believes what he has said to be true, he is a traitor to his country in making, the offer. How can he ask men whom he has pilloried to join him if he believes what he has said about them ? </para>
                        <para>I do not consider his offer <inline font-style="italic">bond fide.</inline> Had it been, Ministers would not have hung on to office like limpets. Why has there been this underground engineering to retain his position, if the Prime Minister has been ready to leave office? </para>
                        <para>We hear, now, that he is going to London. It is understood that the Premier of New South Wales has received a long cable message from the Agent-General of that State, informing him that the Prime Minister is going to London, and stating the matters with which he is to be asked to deal. Australia should be represented in London by Australians, not misrepresented by imported jingoes. We had the same exhibition after the last referendum campaign. The Prime Minister then wished to scuttle back to London. </para>
                        <para>So long as W. M. Hughes leads the Government, he will be an obstacle to the harmony and union of this country. If he wishes to prove his <inline font-style="italic">bona fides,</inline> and to restore good feeling, let him do what the Empire asks the German Kaiser to do Let him consent to reparation, restoration and guarantees. Let him rehabilitate the industrial organizations and trade unions in their full rights and privileges as enjoyed prior to the conscription referendum in 1916, of which they have been deprived; let him restore their employment to the men who have been victimized wholesale throughout the country; let him give absolute and ' unequivocal guarantees that conscription for service oversea has been finally and absolutely abandoned. It does not lie in the mouth of this man, stained with guilt against Democracy, without any attempt at reparation for the great wrongs he has committed, to offer coalition to us. </para>

When you have got rid of this Welsh Kaiserism in Australia, you will have taken a long step towards restoring harmony and unity here. I am ready to help, not this Government of publicly-confessed pledge breakers and union smashers, but any other Government on that side, in giving assistance to Great Britain in this war, but what is done must be based on attention to Australia's vital needs. I am for Australia first. I made that statement in the previous conscription campaign, long before a celebrated clergyman had uttered it. The curse of this country has been that a number of men imported from overseas are more concerned about giving a little assistance to Great Britain at great disadvantage to Australia than in caring what becomes of Australia in the future. We have got into our present position mainly because there has been a dictatorship, with Prussianism and Kaiserism, in this country, which has refused to allow Parliament to consider measures for the safety of Australia or the help of the Empire. There is a means of bringing about unity, harmony, and concord in* this country; and the first step towards bringing it about is reparation for the wrongs done by this Government, and the disappearance from office of the man who is the main cause of the disruption and disunity in our midst to-day. I can quote articles from the whole of the " Nationalist " press of Australia in support of what I say.

His  whole conduct of the campaign shows a want of appreciation of the instincts of his countrymen, of which the most marked are resentment at the appearance of dictation or coercion, and the desire to- see fairplay between any two parties, whatever the merits of their quarrel. In this campaign charges have been uttered and threats used which make it impossible to regard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> as a minister of reconciliation. Reconciliation, however, is a duty which must be the foundation of the policy of his successor. </para>

That quotation expresses the view of the great bulk of "Nationalist" opinion throughout the length and breadth of Australia.

It will probably be expected that one who w.as not en'tirely .dissociated from the circumstances that have led to the present extraordinary position in federal politics should take an early opportunity of stating  his position in connexion with the whole matter. Reference has-been made to various party meetings. I remind honorable members that one of the unfortunate tilings in connexion with party meetings is that, there being no reliable or honorable source by which, information can be given to the press as to what takes place at those meetings, except, of course, the official communications by the leader of the party, they cannot rely in the least on conjectures which appear in the newspapers as to what has been said or done at the meetings.' I say now, as I have always said, that in the clash of party politics we are apt to forget the infinitely more important matters that  should engage our attention. To my mind, the question of maintaining reinforcements for our troops which are fighting; for us at the Front is infinitely more important than the matter of who occupies, or who should occupy, the Treasury bench. That is the position which I have always maintained, and I shall approach the matters before the Chamber from that stand-point. </para>

And we have done it with our eyes open. The position in which we find ourselves to-day is not entirely the fault of those who voted "No." As I have said on many platforms, the majority of the people who voted " No " on the former occasion, as on this occasion, were not disloyal to the Empire. </para>

                                <para>- I do not object, to reasonable interjections in answer to some point that I have made, but interjections such as that to which the honorable member has just given utterance are of no earthly use. The man who would deny that there are disloyal elements in Australia must be blind. Of course, there are disloyal elements here as well as in other  parts  of the Empire. But. when we consider the enormous benefits and advantages which Australians have enjoyed, and in the enjoyment of which we are  protected  ; when we look at the fact that in no .other part of the British Empire does the blood which we inherited from our British ancestors flow with greater purity, it is inconceivable  that the majority of the ' people of Australia are not infused with the same traditions, thoughts, and sympathies as those which must have infused, and must still infuse, all the other parts of the Empire that have already risen to the great MCa. sion in which we as a people are engaged. Conscription has been made the sport of party conflict, of political fears, and of political ambitions, and as the net result of all that has happened , we find that today Australia is paralyzed and inert. It is unable to carry out' those duties which every other part of the Empire is endeavouring to carry out. Whereas Canada,. New Zealand, and Great Britain have gone on actually doing what they pledged themselves to do,- to throw in their whole strength if it might be required - Australia did so nominally at the beginning of the war - we alone, for the second time, have declared to the world, " We' have gone so far - by those men who felt the call . and had the courage to volunteer to face the dangers threatening the country - we have gone so far, and-  we shall go no further. </para>

                                <para>- I may not be blameless; all that I claim is that I have been consistent. My review dates from the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> then leader of the Labour party, returned from Ens-land. I, with most of -my friends on this side of the House, were members of the Liberal party. But, having regard "to the views expressed by the Prime Minister and the attitude that he had adopted, I welcomed him back to Australia as the war leader of this country. Some of those who are now associated with him as followers were not entirely satisfied with the complete adherence I gave to his views and 'leadership. I believed then that the one thing essential to Australia during that crisis - and there is just as great a crisis now - was that there should be a united and firm leadership, and I thought that in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> that leadership was to be found. Week after week elapsed without <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> announcing what his policy was to be, but during those many weeks there was a continually increasing agitation amongst the Labour organizations against conscription. Public men and members of the unions were getting more and more drawn into a position of opposition to conscription - until finally, when the Labour Government led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> - instead of adopting the constitutional .course, the strong course, in fact the only course that would have succeeded, namely, introducing a Bill in Parliament for the carrying out of the policy which the Government considered necessary, and taking all the risks incidental thereto - suddenly announced to the House and the .people that this, of all questions, was not to be* shouldered by the Government, but was to be submitted to a referendum of the people, there was already a consolidated anti-conscription sentiment. </para>

                        <para>Permit me to say a word or two to honorable members on the Opposition side, as well as on this side, on the subject of the referendum. In his speech on Friday the Prime Minister said that the direct voice of the people on all matters of public enactment had always been a plank of the party to which he has belonged. It was never the plank of any  party  to which I belonged, and I am sure that honorable members opposite, however they may differ from me on most points of political discussion, will listen to me when I tell them that I believe that this practice of Parliament refusing to perform its representative duties when difficulties arise, and resorting to a machine which shunts those difficulties on to the people who elected Parliament, is, so far from being an instrument of Democracy, an expedient which strikes at the very root of representative Government; and representative Government is the very foundation of Democracy. Reference was made by the Prime Minister to a man whom he  regards,  and I regard, as the greatest of Democrats - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para class="block">Abraham Lincoln. The Prime Minister said that the referendum had been, in the opinion of the Labour party, a means of carrying out Lincoln's great apothegm, " Government of the people, by the people, and for the people," but he paraphrased "by the people" by saying " by the direct vote or action of the people." Anybody who has studied the actions or writings of that great American will be- convinced that if anybody had suggested to him that by " government of the people by the people '' was meant Parliament shirking the responsibility of deliberation, determination, co-relation of facts, and all those abts which constitute the purpose for which representative institutions are created - that government by the people meant Parliament shuffling off the responsibilities placed on its shoulders by the people, and leaving difficult questions to be determined by the people themselves - his wise eyes would have opened in wonder and amazement at such an interpretation. The referendum was not part of practical politics in his lifetime, but I think I have a- right to infer from what I know of the man's mind, his history, his actions, his wisdom, his deep sympathy with the people, and the high and lofty conception he had of the duties of "a Parliament elected by the people, that he would have said that we are charged with the high responsibility of bringing together all the information obtainable about any question, of deliberating it over and over again, weighing opposing views, and gradually, on behalf of the people, arriving at a decision which the people are not capable of making, not because they lark intelligence or knowledge, but because they are engaged in their own businesses, and have elected Parliament to decide these matters for them. I agree with the Prime Minister that if the result of this referendum has proved anything, it has proved that the referendum in a country like Australia, with a people like the Australians, and on such a subject, at all events, is not a fit instrument for Democracy. </para>
                            <para>Our Constitution, indeed, provides for what is called a referendum. But what is it ? Is it anything like the referendum on this subject? Has it any family resemblance to it? No. The Constitution declares that when Parliament desires to amend the Constitution, and does in fact pass an amendment of it, going through all the stages of deliberation, information, and conclusion in fashioning and perfecting its new instrument of government, it must go still further. The Constitution says to Parliament, "You cannot carry this particular law into effect without obtaining for it the assent of the people." Honorable members will recognise that that is a veto of the people, by referendum, on an Act of Parliament carried through in accordance with parliamentary principles and methods, and to which the Parliament has given its united wisdom. But a referendum on such a question as conscription is not in accordance with the spirit of our Constitution. The Constitution declares that the laws pf this country are to be made by Parliament, elected by the citizens of Australia, and assumes thereby that Parliament is to take the full responsibility of making those laws. The Parliament must take that responsibility in the way that it has always been accepted in every British country. It must be prepared to go before the constituencies and accept responsibility for its actions. . </para>
                            <para>If there is any question which, it appears to me, ought not under any circumstances to have been thrown suddenly upon the decision of a people torn by conflicting emotions, affected by all kinds of passions, from the highest to the lowest - from the deepest emotions felt by those whose nearest and dearest are dying, to the low selfishness of the man who does not care who is dying as long as he is safe - it is the very question which has already been submitted twice to the people. It was first submitted and went to the vote on 28th October, 1916. We know the result of that vote. I am not going to dwell upon its effect, either inside or beyond Australia. From my point of view, it was deplorable. After that vote was taken, the National party was formed, and an election was held on 5th May, 1917. I propose to speak plainly on this subject, which is vital to our country. The National party was formed, and the pledge which has been so often referred to was given - the pledge that during the life of this Parliament, which was -then being elected, conscription would not be introduced, either by Act of Parliament or by regulation, without being again referred to the people. It was also part of the pledge that the question would be referred to the people if the safety of Australia demanded it. It has been said that such a pledge was essential to the creation of a National party from the heterogeneous elements out of which it could alone be created. It was also said that without such a pledge or compromise it followed that the National party would not have been able to secure its return at the polls. I join issue with both of those positions. I contend that it was possible to form a National party without any such compromising pledge at all. I say, , moreover, that I believe, and am justified in the belief, that although without that pledge the general elections of 5th May last would probably not have returned to Parliament such a large number of National members as it did, it would assuredly have returned them with a good working majority. </para>
                            <para>What was the result of that general election ? The result was that which was acclaimed as a huge victory. In fact, it created a hobbled Parliament. Everything that has happened since that time has been the result of that unfortunate and false position. After that, need I refer to the humiliating record of the voluntary system of recruiting? I think the greatest efforts were made by the Government ana by the Director of Recruiting, by means of those agencies which he had then at his command, to appeal in every possible direction to those who had not yet seen their duty in this matter. We know, as a matter of fact, that the result was a gradually diminishing stream of recruits. That stream became practically a trickle,  obviously,  clearly, and demonstrably incapable of fulfilling the requirements of our troops at the Front. Putting aside altogether the general promise which bad been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> and indorsed by the whole of the people of this country, that we would give our last man and our last shilling, it was obviously incapable even of supplying the reinforcements necessary to maintain those divisions already at the Front. </para>

                                <para>- It is absolutely  true,  and is involved in the statement made by a responsible Government that they could not carry on without conscription. In November last, within, I think, six months of this party going into office to try to enable Australia to take her proper part in winning the war, to endeavour to carry out- Australia's part by the voluntary system, they had cast upon them the onus of stating to the country that they could not continue the government of the country, and would not attempt to do so, without conscription. That implies, if it does not express, a complete and final condemnation of the voluntary system as a means of securing recruits. That was my position at that time. That was the decision to which the Government came. I am not at all concerned with the various views put before the House as to what led immediately to that decision. The Government met on Wednesday, the 7th, after having been separated for some weeks ; and I think I am right in assuming that, in the exercise of their own judgment, having regard to the terrible events in Europe, they saw that conscription was necessary - that the time had arrived when there must be conscription, or they could not continue to carry out the policy on which they were elected as a Government. The decision was certainly arrived at in a hurry ; and my main" regret is that the members of the 'Government did not take into their counsel, not necessarily myself, although I should have been willing and anxious to tender personally the advice I had tendered on the platform, and show reasons for it - but other men capable of forming a judgment as to the trend of public opinion in New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria, not to mention Western Australia. If the Government had given a little time to the matter they would have found that amongst the strongest supporters of the conscriptionist policy the antagonism to deciding it by referendum was growing, and had grown, to very great proportions. That is a point on which I regret the Government did not take time to get advice. I believe to-day, notwithstanding the vote that has been given, that a different conclusion would have been arrived at; that had the Government taken time to seek and consider the advice of the greatest supporters they had in the policy to which they had pledged themselves, they would not have again gone to the people by referendum, but would have had a general election in the ordinary constitutional way. Had they done that I believe they would have succeeded; if not, they would, at all events, have gone down with their colours nailed to the mast, and would, in a constitutional way, have thrown the whole responsibility on the other side to find the policy that would succeed in maintaining our forces abroad. There is one criticism about going to the country on such a question which I have heard from several persons; that is, how would the appeal of the House of Representatives on such a subject relieve the members of the Senate from the pledge they had given ? </para>

                                <para>- A very simple position. We have first to ask what the pledge was. The members of the Senate did not give any pledge other than that the Government gave. It was not worded in any other way, and related to no other time or period or subject - it was the same pledge, and it was a pledge they gave by supporting the Government. What was that pledge? It was made on a general election of members of this House, and was limited to the duration of the Parliament then being elected ; therefore, the pledge of the members of the Senate was necessarily so limited. </para>

                                <para>- That may be so, but the pledge related merely to that period; and the interjection shows, not that the honorable member has not attempted to follow me, but that he has not succeeded in following the argument. However that may be, the pledge related only to the duration of the Parliament then being elected, and to one question. When it is said, as it will be said by some of the supporters of the National party outside, and, probably, believed by many inside the House, that a dissolution would not have resulted in the victory of our party, even with reduced numbers, I desire to point out that even the vote which has been taken, under all the disadvantageous circumstances - some of which I shall refer to presently - was a vote turned by only the per cent. of the people who voted - that is, if we could have got that 31/4 per cent, to vote " Yes," the result would have been the other way. After all, it cannot be considered an overwhelming "No" vote. It is a decisive "No" victory; and my friends opposite are entitled to the benefit of that; but to draw from that the inference that if the Government had gone to the country it would necessarily have lost its whole majority, is, in my opinion, not at all proved. </para>

                        <para>I know that a member who suggests, directly or indirectly, to his fellow members, a dissolution in any shape or form, is about as popular as a nurse who comes into a ward with a large jar of treacle and brimstone, the latter predominating. I do not expect, nor have I at any time expected, such a suggestion to be popular with the majority of honorable members on either side; but that suggestion is, of course, rendered impossible from our point of view on this side by the vote which has been taken. Common sense shows us that, having put this issue to the people - in the false way, as I claim - by referendum, to immediately afterwards, in a constitutional way, ask them to reverse their vote, would be a hopeless political procedure. I cannot help thinking that, unless something even more serious if possible than the present position of the war arises, it would be almost impracticable for Parliament, without dissolving, to do what in my opinion it .ought originally to have done - exercised its own judgment on its own knowledge, and passed the legislation necessary for the war. That is the result of the referendum vote - we are politically crippled for the time being. In view of the war as it presents itself now - in view of the fact that, as we learn from the news, hundreds of thousands of our foes are massing in an endeavour to break our line, which we have failed, or are about to fail, in" taking our share in maintaining - in view of the terrible danger that still threatens us, a danger greater than any during the war, excepting, perhaps, at the beginning, and, possibly, at one period since, when the Germans nearly got to Calais - at such a time the interests of parties, or of a Government, do not- weigh at all, as compared with the great issue of how Australia is to be got to perform her part. The  majority  which has been obtained against conscription is, as I have said, a per cent, majority. But we must also regard the matter from this point of view : that many considerations besides the mere exercise of the judgment that conscription was not necessary influenced that vote. I do not think that any of mv honorable friends  opposite  will deny that the "No" vote included the votes of many thousands of persons, and especially of women, who did not deliberately exercise a judgment upon the war necessity of conscription for Australia, but who simply could not, and would not, take upon themselves the responsibility of directly voting to send somebody else's son to the Front. </para>

                                <para>- I do not see how it could. But we know that it applied to the "No" vote. No sentimentalist would vote "Yes" unless he felt impelled to do so by a strong sense of duty, but a great many people voted " No " because sentimentalism  influenced  their judgment. It is this 'consideration which accounts for a considerable portion of the "No" votes. It applies not merely to women, but also to a large number of men who acted from sentimental motives! But there is still another element which must be taken into acx count in  connexion  with the ' ' No ' ' vote. I have already referred to the fact that prior to the decision of the Government to put this question to a referendum, there had been for some weeks a perfectly clear and strong expression of opinion amongst thousands and thousands of the strongest supporters of Conscription throughout Australia - especially in New South Wales and Queensland - against the adoption of that course. They desired that Parliament should shoulder the responsibility which rightly belongs to it. If the Government contemplated doing such a foolish thing as submitting the question of conscription to a referendum, obviously the very worst time to do it was when their own supporters were advising that it should not be done. When the Government practically said to their own supporters, " You must adopt this course whether you like it or not," manifestly they could not expect to excite the strongest enthusiasm amongst them. I believe that amongst those who abstained from voting " Yes," the number of which was not in;considerable, were many persons who, perhaps, either did' not strongly desire conscription, or were not violently opposed to it, but who. strongly resented having put upon them the responsibility which directly attached to Parliament. Considering all the circumstances of the case, the result was, I think, amazing. But the result of a referendum has no constitutional effect whatever. The Constitution requires the Parliament of Australia, elected by the people of Australia, to make the law 3 of Australia. By implication tit excludes the shirking of that responsibility by. throwing it on to the shoulders of the people. The mere taking of a referendum is to act contrary to the spirit, if not the letter, of the Constitution. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly. The carrying of a referendum does not  carry  with it any constitutional power. A "Yes" vote would not have vested Parliament with any power which it did not previously possess, and a ' ' No ' ' vote does not take away from Parliament any responsibility that was already thrown upon it. Its only effect has been to create an enormous amount of irritation which militates against active service in war. Owing to this unfortunate step, for practical purposes all our activities have been paralyzed. </para>

When once the Ministry engaged in a campaign of this kind, a public protest against the means adopted by its leaders would have been an act of hostility which would have tended to weaken them. Had I protested I would have been doing my best to kill conscription. However, I do not intend to discuss that question now, because there are much greater matters claiming my attention. But, as the Prime Minister has said, I did make certain representations to him in reference to the censorship. I do not agree with everything that has been said in this connexion, but I do say that the Prime Minister endeavoured to conduct the campaign which he had started  with all the powers in his possession, and under these circumstances those who did not desire to hurt him were bound to help him. </para>

                                <para>- A disclaimer during the campaign? I do not know that I would. I do not feel competent to judge any other man's position in this matter. All I can say is that I stated my own position definitely; that I could not be a member of a Government which would attempt to govern without the powers of conscription. That was my position. That is my position to-day. I find that other members in this party expressly disclaimed being bound by that pledge. Many of them, without expressly disclaiming being bound by it, believe that it was not made on their behalf, and that they are not bound by it. As to the latter part of that, I took a different view; but the fact remains. The referendum having been defeated, and the pledge having been given by  the Government that it would not continue to govern, without conscription, in the circumstances which have taken place are the Government, or the members of the Government - because this is a matter, not of the Government, but of the members of the Government, from the Prime Minister down - maintaining that pledge in spirit, as well as in effect? Let me review exactly what happened, so far as we know it. Having myself indorsed the pledge, having countersigned it, so to speak, having thrown the whole of my political existence 'behind it, for the present, at all events, or so long .as the circumstances exist, I feel more bound, perhaps, than other members are to see that that pledge is honorably observed. What took place was this : It is true that we see here, at the present moment, a Government consisting of the identical members of that Ministry which, a few weeks ago, said they could not continue to govern without the power of conscription. They to-day occupy places on the Government bench, although not intending, so far as we know, to introduce conscription, or an equivalent for conscription, at present. That is a position which every one, inside and outside the House, must see requires a justification. The question is, " is the justification sufficient " ? Soon after the " No " vote was recorded, the Leader of the late Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> tendered the unconditional surrender of his position to the Governor-General. He attached no conditions to it. The Governor-General was then absolutely free. In the natural course, he sent; for the Leader of the Opposition. I do not know, nor do I seek to know, what advice the Leader of the Opposition gave, but, apparently, he was unable to give an assurance which the Governor-General could accept that he would  be prepared to form and carry on a stable Government. The honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts)</inline> certainly said that his party authorized him to give that assurance. </para>

If there is one thing honorable members will give me credit for, whether they agree with me or not, it is an attempt to state the case fairly. There was, of course, [l-09- another course open to the Governor-General, and it is of some importance in connexion with the present position of the Government. He might have granted to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> had he asked for it, a dissolution. That is of some importance, because the unconditional surrender by the Prime Minister of his commission, throwing the whole unlimited power into the hands of the Governor-General to exhaust the House, or to ascertain by what means he could find a stable Government, made it quite possible, for the Leader of the Opposition to ask for, and possibly obtain, a dissolution, whereby he might have received, according to his own view, the support of .the country, and been- returned with a party large enough to carry on a stable Government. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member may take all the press reports of everything said from the beginning to be entirely incorrect. Statements were made in the press about a speech supposed to have been made by myself at that meeting - a report which has gone from one end of Australia to the other and been commented on - in which, amongst other things,-, it was stated that I had acclaimed in the very highest terms of praise all the conduct of the recent campaign by the Prime Minister,. One cannot contradict all these statements at such a time without giving away something. If you say you did not say something, they ask, " Then what did you say ? " So that the best and fairest tiling, in the circumstances, is to say nothing. The honorable member for Yarra, then, was unable to form a Government. The Governor-General decided, at that stage at all events, that it was undesirable, in any circumstances, to grant a dissolution. That necessarily, therefore, threw him back on this party as the only source from which a stable Government could be formed. The Governor-General appears to have satisfied himself on the information he obtained that there was no other source than the leader of that party, no other man who could form a Government capable of carrying on the government of the country.

                                <para>- I should have liked to hear from the Prime Minister some statement to the effect that he did all he could to enable another Government, to be formed from the party which has a majority in both Houses, but which would not include those members who had said they could not and would not carry on without conscription. I assumed that something of the kind was done. I have no right to inquire into the communications that passed between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes, Mr. Cook,</inline> and any other members from whom the Governor-General sought information, but we had a right to assume that each member of the Government satisfied himself that he individually had made every effort to see if a Government could be formed from the ranks of those not bound by the pledge. I do not feel entirely satisfied with the position. </para>

The only other alternative is to regard the Ministry as a Government of necessity, and of last resort.

                                <para>- No, and I should like , an explicit statement on the point from the members of the Government. This goes beyond any  question of party. The course taken by the Government has to be justified before the public, and I hope that we shall have a statement that every effort was made by all the members of the Government, before they resumed office, to see if it were not possible to form a Government out of the same party with a majority in both Houses, and which would be able to carry on without raising any question of dishonouring pledges. The Government have taken office with a heavy load of responsibility, and I want to say plainly that, if they contemplate carrying .on by patching up the old voluntary system to secure a few more recruits, or in any way minimizing the immediate duty which is cast upon the country at the present time, to obtain reinforcements, assuredly they will be accused, and not with impropriety, of not having kept full faith with the people. Whether they can justify themselves in assuming office under existing circumstances will ultimately depend upon how far they can carry on without introducing, if not conscription, some equivalent alternative which will secure the men necessary to maintain our reinforcements. </para>

                        <para>So much for the past. "We are more concerned with the future, and the duty which lies upon the Government rests equally upon every member of this Parliament. If anything, it is laid more heavily upon members opposite, because they are the people who blocked the only effective way of securing reinforcements. In the discussion of a vote of no confidence it is not usual to indulge in any remarks that are not of a party nature, but I want to break through that rule by saying that I have never stated that the majority of those who voted against conscription were in any way governed by sentiments of disloyalty. I recognise that that Official Labour party, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> is the Leader, is, like every other party organization - including members supporting the Government- a mixed party, and contains various elements within its ranks. No doubt it has behind it all the elements to which I refer, including the elements of disloyalty, but the bulk of its support comes from the ranks of labour as represented by unionism iu Australia, and as regards that part of the party I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> to beware of the influence of the extremists who, from time to time, would force the party into a false position. I have never said, and I do not say now, that that party is disloyal. I believe the great body of the unionists are absolutely loyal- and that they have given ample evidence of it. </para>

It is possible that some persons may have had what the honorable member suggests in their mind, but it was certainly never in mine. It is possible that the thing that defeated conscription amongst  a great body of the people was the influence exercised upon them by the dread that existed amongst the loyal section of the workers that the conscription movement was directed against unionism. </para>

                                <para>- That is another line of argument. I . think that the Leader of the Opposition is endeavouring to draw a red herring across my trail. Whether or not he has a sufficient number of members on his side to enable him to form a Government and give effect to his policy, it is certain that he1 has quite enough members on his side, if they are earnest citizens of the Commonwealth, to help the majority in this Parliament to carry out some policy to assist Australia. I think that we may, therefore, call upon the honorable gentleman, as leader of the party that has deliberately and intentionally defeated what we believe to be the only method to save the honour of Australia, to come forward and make suggestions. </para>

                        <para>I have strenuously endeavoured to avoid referring to any of the irritation aroused by the recent conflict. I hope that nothing I say will increase the bitterness and irritation which the reference of such a subject to the people necessarily created. We have to look to the future, and to decide what is to be done. I should like to make a suggestion for honorable members opposite to think about. Apart altogether from who mav be carrying on  the  government of the Commonwealth, could we not have a conference of three or four honorable members from each side to talk quietly over ways and means to meet the necessity for reinforcements? I do not suggest anything like a War Council such as we had before. For one thing that Council consisted of too many persons, and was a sort of small Parliament. </para>

                                <para>- It had no power, and I do not suggest that the conference I propose should have power, but could we not get into consultation in some way? I have been a  conscriptionist;  and, perhaps, the most consistent conscriptionist here but I shall do my best tq assist in making alternative suggestions until such time as that policy can be given effect, if necessary. There are certain suggestions which I should like to make. I believe that if we came together and discussed in an informal way all the possibilities of the very difficult position in which we are, we might arrive at something which, though not entirely in  accord  with the views of either side, would represent a workable way out of the supreme difficulty and danger in which our country stands at the present time. That is a suggestion which' I venture to throw out, and any assistance I can render in that direction will be willingly given. </para>

                                <para>- It is a purely personal suggestion. Intentionally I have not mentioned it to any member of the Government, because I desired it to be taken as a suggestion from myself for what it is worth. I believe that it is quite possible, without throwing the Government into the hands of the honorable member for Yarra and his  party,  that we should receive the full support and assistance! which, when the present bitterness dies down, I feel sure they will be prepared to render. I have taken longer than I intended, but I have felt that in " the existing circumstances and at this time it is no longer right or safe for people who hold such strong opinions as I do on that which I regard as vital to the future safety and honour of the country to remain silent. It is for thi3 reason that I have taken advantage of the present opportunity to state clearly, if not fully, the opinions I hold. </para>

                            <para>.  - The honorable gentleman who has just resumed his seat is always worth listening to, and, perhaps, most of all, when one most disagrees with him. Certain of his statements this afternoon have left me in some doubt whether he sees his way as clearly as he usually does.  His  arguments seemed to me to be somewhat laboured. He was evidently speaking with' difficulty, because of certain things in his mind that he said during .the referendum campaign, and which he found it somewhat uncomfortable to remember at this particular juncture. In regard to his last suggestion I might be allowed to say that the Labour party stand today in regard to the war exactly where it stood when the war broke out. The manifesto we issued to the people in 1914 represents our policy to-day.- </para>

                                <para>- May I remind the honorable member for Flinders, in regard to the suggestion he has just made, that there can be no objection at any time to members of this House conferring in regard to the war, and I challenge him or any other man on that side to say that this party has at any time shown lukewarmness or lack of interest in the war, or that it has opposed the proposals of the Government, except in the matter of conscription, for the carrying out of the war. We have clean hands and a pure record so far as our connexion with the war" is concerned. When suggestions have to be made, we shall be as ready to offer them as* we have been hitherto. But it was strange to hear the honorable member for Flinders, whose political experience is so great, say that it is our duty t to offer suggestions to the Government. </para>

                                <para>- I am not_ actuated in this matter by party spirit. It was at the suggestion of the Liberal party that the Labour party was not called in. We do not object to that. Whether we like it or not, the decision of the Governor-General is binding on us. We are not complaining that we were not allowed to form a Government, but we say that the Government in power must propound its policy, so that we may know where we can assist it, and where we may find it necessary to oppose it. The Government are responsible for the carrying on of the administration of the affairs of the country. Members of the Liberal party were  elected  to " win the war." If now, after ten months, Ministers are so barren of ideas that, having been refused the power to  conscribe,  they are" compelled to plead to the Opposition for suggestions, they should not continue to occupy the Treasury bench. The honorable member for Flinders has said that the immediate introduction of conscription is out of the question. I am sorry that to that extent he has abandoned his position. He has been looked upon as the high priest of conscription, which he has hitherto advocated in all circumstances. He is reported' to have said at Hawthorn, during the recent campaign - </para>

                            <para>Conscription will come, if not in the way proposed by the Ministry, then in another. If the people will not take the responsibility of sanctioning conscription by a direct vote, Parliament must take the responsibility of enforcing it by Act of Parliament. The issue is the National Government with conscription against the Labour Government without conscription. No. Government formed on the National side would allow conscription to be dropped. </para>

                        <para class="block">If what the honorable and learned gentleman said then* is right, how does he justify his present statement that the immediate introduction of conscription is out of the question? Is it because there was a heavy " No " majority against conscription, or is it because of any change in the situation? Before and during the conscription campaign we were told of the gravity of the position, and it was said that only conscription could save Australia and the Empire. May I ask the honorable and learned member what would justify the introduction of conscription ? </para>

                                <para>- That is a doctrine from which I entirely dissent. It embodies a moral standard which I do not think the honorable gentleman would apply generally. The doctrine that a thing is justifiable only because it will succeed is a very regrettable one. The only reason why a thing should be done is because it is right. The people of Australia have a second time, by a greatly increased majority, said that conscription must not be employed in our share of the war, and that declaration should be accepted by the Government, by the honorable and, learned member, and by every one else as final, unless they are prepared to again stir up the animosity, bitterness, and antagonism which, unfortunately, was rife during the recent campaign, and which the honorable and learned member has deprecated. We want these feelings to die down, and the sooner the better. It is the desire of every honorable member of this Parliament, without exception, that Australia should make every effort she can in this war; but unity of action cannot be secured while conscription is still talked about. The honorable and learned member for Flinders, will render a service to the country, and greatly assist his own cause, if he stops talking about the introduction of conscription, either in the immediate future or at any other time. He said that he had not accused us of being disloyal, and that he believed that the majority who voted " No *' were not disloyal. May I remind him of a speech which he made at Dandenong, and which was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Art/ug</inline> of the 12th October, 1916, as follows:- </para>

                            <para>What we did on 28th October could never be undone. The honour of Australia once lost could never be regained. The fight was between patriotism .and .disloyalty. The man who voted " No " was a man who was willing to weaken the arm of the Government at this time, and he who would do that in a national peril was a traitor to his country. The Government was supported by the whole of the Opposition, while the opponents of the Government were supported by the Industrial Workers of the World. He who voted " No " would strike a deadly blow at the honour and safety of his country. Were there any present who were willing, on 28th October, to have their names enrolled on the ragged; sickly regiment of pro-Germans, disloyalists, and the Industrial Workers of the World ? When those at the back of the hall heard the truth there were few who would enroll themselves in that regiment. </para>

                        <para class="block">It is very good, even at this belated time, to find the honorable member for Flinders willing to give credit to those who voted " No," or to the majority of them, by saying that they were not actuated by disloyal sentiments; and it will go a long way towards allaying the differences, disruptions, and antagonisms rampant in the community to-day if he will induce the members of his party, the Ministry, and particularly the Prime Minister, to drop their continual gibing at members of this party that they are pro-Germans, that they are disloyalists, and that they are indifferent to the Empire's needs. Even now, because I claim that members of this party should not be asked to offer suggestions, it is said that we are prepared, from party feelings, to let the interests of Australia and the Empire go. The less we hear of that statement the better. </para>

Of course, the figures are lower than in the previous year, but the stream of recruits, as the reservoir from which it is drawn is depleted, must necessarily decline. No other country can show such a record in regard to voluntary recruiting as Australia can show.. No disparaging utterance worthy of credence, or that can be substantiated, can justify any complaint in regard to Australia's response in this war. It has been simply magnificent.

The suggestion, of their having been sent through the operation of some form of domestic conscription comes only from the conscriptionists. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Flinders made the remark.. When my boy was in camp, it was thrown up at me that I had not sent him. Unionists, who are so splendidly represented at the Front bv their sons, who are saving and guarding the honour of Australia, did not send their boys, and therefore I hope that the honorable member will also drop that kind of talk. The honorable member will find that it is quite easy to justify what has been done through voluntary recruiting. I trust that he will remember that the young men of Australia have responded willingly and nobly. There is no need to suggest that they were sent by their parents, or that they had to be forced to go for economic reasons, or otherwise. </para>

                        <para>The honorable member for Flinders  made a very unfortunate remark at the beginning of his speech when he said that Australia stood self-humiliated and self-shamed. He is entitled to his opinion, but I do not think that it comes with very good grace from any one to suggest that the people of Australia were actuated by motives other than those which appeared to them sufficient to justify their voting as they did. It was a most unfair and uncalled-for remark that the Prime Minister made when he suggested that many of the people who voted " No " had led the Government to believe that they would vote "Yes." He practically accused his supporters of perjury. The honorable member for Flinders should be above making such a petty and unfortunate remark as to .say that the people of Australia are self-humiliated and self-shamed. Honour's wounds are always self-inflicted. The people of Australia are not in the least degree humiliated or shamed by the vote given on the 20th December last. People in other parts of the world do not agree with the honorable member for Flinders.

These quotations show that people in other parts of. the world do not concur in what the honorable member for Flinders has said regarding the recent decision. So far from the people of Australia feeling humiliation "or shame, they have a feeling of relief and pride; they glory in the fact that they alone, among the nations of the world", have dared to be free of the curse of militarism. The poll which was taken in 1916 was the greatest blow for freedom that the world has ever known; and, after another twelve months' experience and fuller knowledge and further investigation, so far from conscription being more attractive to the people of Australia, it has become, like vice -  a monster of so frightful mien, </para>

                        <para>The speech he delivered this afternoon shows that he has no definite policy other than conscription; bereft of the power of conscription, he is politically bankrupt. His only idea of carrying on the war is by compulsion, and he pitifully appeals to the Opposition to assist with suggestions as to how Australia shall continue to play her part. Australia will continue to fight in this war. There can be no difficulty in securing a continuation of the magnificent response the Australian people have already made,. and if the Government are ready to hear suggestions, let them declare their policy, and they will find that members of the Opposition are not at all unwilling to give every assistance in the prosecution of the war. </para>
                        <para>The honorable member for Flinders tried to make a point of the contention that conscription ought not to have been the subject of a referendum. With that argument I entirely agree. From the time that the conscription proposal was first brought forward my attitude has been that human life and religion are not fit and proper subjects for a referendum decision - that no majority, even though it be 99 per cent., has any right to bind an individual in regard to those most intimate and sacred personal matters. </para>

In saying that conscription ought not to have been submitted to a referendum, the honorable member for Flinders is again unfortunate, because at Dandenong, on the 26th January, 1917, he said, " He did not think it would be foolish to appeal again to the people on the conscription question," and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman,</inline> the Premier of New South Wales, said on 24th October, 1916, "I see no reason why conscription, if defeated, should not be introduced again and yet again." </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member won his election in exceptional circumstances, for there can be no doubt as to the influences which were operating at the last general election. My point is that the question, of conscription ought not at any time to be referred to the people. To begin with, I do not think it was the right policy for the Government to adopt. If the Prime Minister had had the courage he professes to have, and which some people wrongly attribute to him, and had introduced into this House a policy of conscription when he returned from London in 1916, that would have been the act of a statesman. I believe conscription would have been carried in those circumstances, and from some points of view the result would have been much better for Australia than the holding of two referendums, because they have stirred up so much trouble that they  have been a very unfortunate experience for the whole community. </para>

Surely for the time being the Prime Minister must have forgotten the position he occupied.  His  disparaging references to the Leader of the Opposition and .the character of his speech generally came with exceeding bad grace from the Leader of the Government of Australia. Whatever may be the intellectual deficiencies of the Leader of the Opposition they are more than made good by his honesty of character. It is rather interesting to note that in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of the 10th instant) - and I think it was the only Melbourne newspaper to publish the message - there appeared a cablegram setting out that in commenting upon the possibilities of the political situation in Australia - </para>

                        <para class="block">When we remember that this opinion is in direct and severe contrast to the opinion which the public generally hold with regard to the Prime Minister, we can well understand why he should feel so jealous of a man less brilliant than he is, but having to his credit a record of honesty of purpose and of loyalty to conviction. </para>
                        <para>The Prime Minister complained that the Leader of the Opposition in his speech had made no reference to the great war. I venture to point out that this no-confidence motion is riot an attack upon the Government because of its war policy. It deals entirely with the conduct of affairs during the referendum. When the Ministry are prepared with their war policy, if they have one - when they come to the House and say what they propose to do now that they have been denied the power of conscription - it will be time enough for the Opposition to submit a motion of want of confidence in the Government policy, or something in the nature of an alternative. This, however, is not the time for the Opposition to do anything of the kind. The censure motion now before the House deals entirely with four different matters relating to the conduct of the Government during the recent referendum and to those four different matters - the pledges of Ministers, the censorship, the prosecution of public men, and the denial of Statute public rights to Australian-born citizens -  the Leader of the Opposition confined his speech. In regard to the Bendigo pledge, the position is clear and explicit. Speaking at Bendigo on the 12th November, the Prime Minister gave a lead to his party and to the country. He said - </para>

                            <para class="block">That pledge was repeated in almost parrotlike fashion by nearly every member of the Ministry, and by a large number of their supporters. Every speech made by them was punctuated with threats as to what the Government would do if they did not get this power. The threat of resignation was the one thing perpetually held before the people. As I have previously mentioned, the honorable member forFlinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine)</inline> stated clearly at Bathurst on 1st December, and it was repeated by a number of the supporters of the Government, that the question before the country was conscription, with the National Government, or no-conscription with a Tudor . Government. The pledges were quite explicit, and that they were so understood by the country is easily gathered from the way the press and the people referred to them as the campaign proceeded, and have since referred to them. I propose to make a few quotations from the Melbourne newspapers as showing how the country interpreted the Bendigo pledge. I shall quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> and a reference to the files of newspapers published in the other States will show that the same interpretation was placed upon the pledge in every State of the Commonwealth.

                                <para>- I do not say that we ought not to seek the Prime Minister's brains, and use them to every possible advantage. It is interesting to notice how <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and his Ministry, as well as the members of the party, interpret that pledge. They said , " We have kept our pledge and have resigned, and the Governor-General has said that we are still the people to carry on the government of the country." M»v Hughes is my authority for the statement that he, after making his statement in the Caucus meeting, after his return from Government House, was requested by 'his party to accept a commission to form a Ministry.' They regard the pledge given by the Prime Minister as having been satisfied, and all honorable conduct fulfilled, by a resignation at 10.30 a.m., and the reacceptance of office about 10.30 p.m. on the same date. During the interval, we are told, the Governor-General satisfied himself that Parliament had been exhausted in regard to those who were qualified to carry on the government. I hold the opinion very strongly that, the Ministry having resigned in order to keep their pledge, the Governor-General had no other course open to him than to send for the Leader of the Opposition, and invite him to form a Ministry. </para>

                                <para>- I do not desire to do so, but merely to point out that, constitutionally, the Leader of the Opposition ' ought, without question, to have been invited' to form a Government, and, if he were willing to do so, the  responsi-bility  of the Governor-General should have ended. It was for  this  Parliament to determine, probably in a very short and summary fashion, whether the Leader of the Opposition should be allowed to carry, on'; indeed, the Prime Minister said that the Government formed by the Opposition could not have existed for more than a few hours. No one could have complained, because the majority must rule. </para>

Let him, before such measures are put . to the test, resign his seat and contest the electorate upon his changed opinions.

                        <para>I notice that in the resolutions carried by the National party two things were evidently borne in mind, first, that on no account was the Official Labour party to have a chance of forming a Government, and secondly, that there should be no dis-. solution. The first was a calamity which  was  to be opposed by every possible m'eans. and the second embodied one of the reasons which the Governor-General submitted as actuating him in his refusal to commission the Leader of the Opposition to form a Cabinet. Very well. Perhaps these things will be resurrected later. Certainly the memories of the people have received an impression during the last three months which can never be forgotten, and which will inevitably rise up to haunt those who will seek their suffrages at the next election. </para>

No honorable member can view, with anything approaching complacency, the situation as we find it to-day. After three aud a half years of war we have still to 'confess that we have not made the progress which we feel we ought to have made with the resources at our command. I do not think that we are out of the wood yet. I believe that there is still a long road and a hard road before the Allies. While some of the statements concerning the position of the Central Powers may be exaggerated, I believe that they yet possess heavy reserves of power, and that there is a good deal of hard, solid, serious work before the Allied Forces. But I am far from believing that the position is as serious as the Prime Minister would have us believe. In his speech at Bendigo on 12th November, the right honorable gentleman said - </para>

                        <para class="block">It is remarkable that the New Zealand <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> characterized <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt's</inline> statement, " The present position was as black as it well nigh could be," as an untruth, an electioneering indiscretion employed to influence votes for conscription. The New Zealand Minister for Defence went further and said, " The Australian Government could not have received information from the Imperial authorities which would not have also been sent to the New Zealand Government, and nothing similar to what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> said had come to New Zealand." ' I do not believe the Government had any authority to make these statements; neither do I believe that they were correct. I do not believe this Government is in possession of any more information than any other Government, or that they know any more than the public about the war situation. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman,</inline> the Premier of New South Wales, was recently in London, he was banqueted at the House of Commons. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, made some very nice references to the part Australia had played in the war, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman,</inline> in reply to the toast of his health, made a statement to this effect, " I appeal to the Imperial Government to take the Dominions more into their confidence.  We have a right to know more of the position of affairs in Europe, but we are being kept in the dark. Australia, that has done so well, has a right to be told exactly what the position is, and what the aims of the Allies are." The London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> reported that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hodge,</inline> the Minister for Labour in the Imperial Government, dramatically rose and said, " I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> that lie knows as much about the war as we do. I am a member of the Imperial Cabinet, but I know no more about it than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> does."

                                <para>- I am not suggesting that for a moment. My object is to show that what the Prime Minister and the Postmaster-General, as well as other Ministers, said during the referendum campaign, and what was echoed by their supporters in regard to the seriousness of the position, was not justified by the facts. The quotations I have given are extracts from speeches made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Douglas</inline> Haig7 and other responsible military authorities, whose statements are absolutely in contradiction to those made by the Prime Minister and his supporters. If it is true that things aTe worse now than ever before, then we must .have been fed up with countless lies during the past few months, because one has only to look at the headlines in the papers to see records of success after success, and victory after victory. </para>

                                <para>- The quotations are from the newspapers, and if any twisting has been done, the charge must be against the newspapers, and not against me. Might I point out that if the position is so black to-day, then it amounts to a confession of incompetence and failure on the part of the Government, which set out to win the war? After having been in office for about eight months, they tell us that the position is worse than before. " We have lost the war; we stand on the brink of a volcano; on the edge of a precipice," said the Postmaster -General ; and, said the Prime Minister, " Unless we get conscription, the tide of 'battle having turned against us, defeat is certain." </para>

The Postmaster-General was a member of the Caucus when the Prime Minister was challenged at a private meeting to produce the cable, and he could not, or did not. Neither do I believe that this later cable, asking for 7,000 men a month, has been received from the War Council. </para>

                                <para>- If what the Prime Minister has told us is correct,- then, instead of asking for a smaller  number than  last year, the Government should have no hesitation whatever in calling upon every man, and there would be no doubt about securing the services of a large number if exaggerated and contradictory statements had not been made about the position. No one believes that 7,000 men a month are required to replace the casualties. Neither do I believe that 7,000 men. a month would be more than a drop in the bucket if the position is as bad as the Prime Minister has said. </para>

The -fact that those men have not been returned is not due to anything for which Australia is responsible, nor is it because of any lack of reinforcements, and certainly not entirely because of a shortage of shipping. I suppose every honorable member of this House has, at different times, made applications for the return, for domestic reasons, of- a certain number of men from the first division. </para>

When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> who was then Prime Minister, was in South Africa, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was . in charge of the Government here, a number of members on hie own side, led by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roberts,</inline> the then member for Adelaide, proposed an amendment in the Defence Bill. Honorable members who were here will remember that the moment the amendment, was carried against the Government <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> reported progress on the Bill. During the dinner adjournment he summoned a meeting of the Caucus and demanded to know where he was. As a result of that meeting he came down here after the dinner adjournment, and, like a little lamb, allowed the amendment to go through. But he was never driven by any man ! I can remember that on another occasion he came to a Caucus meeting and tried to induce us to withdraw a certain Bill . He pleaded with us to withdraw it, and pointed out how bad it would be. The Caucus said, " No, we, are going on with that Bill," and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> came down from the Caucus room to his chair at the table and made a splendid speech in favour of the Bill he had opposed upstairs.  Yet he was never driven by any man ! When he came back from London, he said to the Caucus, ' ' I believe that conscription is the only and the proper policy to pursue." The Caucus said "No." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> we are told, was never driven by any man, but after some private consultations ' with a few Ministers and some members of the party, he came to the Caucus next day with a compromise proposal for a referendum. </para>

                            <para>I daresay we could keep on as we did last session, but there is no honour, no usefulness in a position such as that. I have made up my mind that I cannot stay in the responsible position I hold to-day unless the people give me an accession of strength. I hope that we, as Liberals, will never resort to the tricks and subterfuges that are practised by the other side in order to stay in , power and enjoy the emoluments of office. Liberalism means constitutional rule. I will not stay in power to be made a football of by anybody or by any party. </para>

Abusive epithets must cease, and the disgraceful statements concerning the character of those who opposed conscription must cease.

Why does not the honorable member go to his native land and try to get those there to agree to conscription ? Perhaps with his wonderful oratory and his equity bar manner of speaking, as with a lump of pudding in his mouth, he might be able to convert them. It ill-became him to cast slurs and insults on this Australia of ours, seeing that he is not man enough to go to England. I do not know of any occasion on which he has gone upon the platform to assist the voluntary recruiting movement, nor do I know that he has offered his services for the war. I know that one of his best supporters at Mornington, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lindley,</inline> was willing, with another who had thrown out a challenge, to clean his car should he be man enough to go. I have not heard that he lent his money to Australia without interest when she called on her children in her hour of need.

Even throughout the conscription campaign, if young men in the flush of youth, and moved by the impulse of their rich,' red blood, voluntarily offered themselves for service abroad, I was ready to take their names. I have appeared on the recruiting platform, and this House honoured me by accepting my suggestion that moving pictures should be used to stimulate recruiting. Yet in the pulpit of the House of God, at St. Paul's, Archdeacon Hindley lied about me - because, I presume, he had read the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> newspaper. When I complained to the  Archbishop  and asked for justice, I was told that the only church court before which a clergyman could be cited to appear was a heresy court, and that ,the Archbishop did not think that Archdeacon Hindley had committed heresy. I did not accuse him of heresy. But if a clergyman were found knocking about the streets of Melbourne drunk and disorderly, or if he were accused - as the Rev. James Ronald was falsely accused - of telling a filthy yarn, someone should be able to exercise authority over him. The Archbishop did not wish to exercise authority over the Archdeacon. </para>

                        <para>Instead of allowing our wheat to rot and be destroyed by mice, we should take steps to grist it into flour, and the offal could be used in stock raising, as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hagelthorn.</inline> Two thousand lbs. of - flour is the equivalent of 3,000 lbs. of wheat, and that means that two ships laden with flour would equal in foodstuffs value three ships laden with wheat. In that way we should effect an economy of 33J per cent, in our shipping. A vessel can make two and a half voyages from Sydney to San Francisco in the same time as is occupied on the voyage from Australia to Plymouth or London. ' If there were a saving of only 50 per cent., in time we could do with one ship the same work as is done by two ships travelling on the old route from Australia to London. Moreover, the journey across the Pacific is perfectly safe, but there is danger from submarines and mines as soon as a vessel passes the Cape of Good Hope or enters the Red Sea. By following the Sydney-San Francisco route, the cargoes of foodstuffs would be safe across the Pacific and across the United States, a further distance of 3,500 miles, and, by a concentration of their defensive boats, the Allies could efficiently safeguard the journey from the eastern coast of America to Europe. One ship, making the average voyage, could then take as much produce in the same time as six ships making the longer voyage from Melbourne to London. With the precautions that have to be taken, the voyage to England occupies now about eight to ten weeks. The average voyage across the Atlantic occupies only seven to eight days, so that a ship could travel that route seven times as against one voyage from Melbourne to England by the longer route. Our shipping, if regulated in that way, would render great assistance to the Allies. </para>
                        <para>In 1912 I made a suggestion that a system of patriotic finance should be instituted, commencing with the conversion of the State debts. I estimated, and my figures were checked by keen accountants, that at least £20, 000,000 coul'd be saved in this way, and I suggested that Australia should make a gift of that sum to the Homeland. I prophesied that the money spinners in the United Kingdom) almost the greatest financial kings of the universe,- would immediately say that the stock issued by the Commonwealth would be a far greater security than the stock issued by a State. We should be carrying out the old idea of Euclid that the whole is always greater than a part. Moreover, they would say that that money should be spent in the building of warships for the defence of the British' flag and the British race, to protect the trade routes of the Empire, and thus insure that Britain would be able to import her food requirements. As long as Britain can feed her people,- she can stand four-square against all the world, but if anything should Interfere with her food supplies, Britain may go down. I proposed that scheme as one way in which we could show our loyalty and love of the Motherland. At that time both the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> were warning us of Germany's ambitions.

Just as Rome, when the heart of Italy was attacked, had to call in her far-flung legions to protect it, so Britain has had to recall her Fleets from, not only the eastern seas, but our seas, to do duty in the North Sea, the most terrible in the world. There to-day Britain, I am glad to say, is stronger and greater than ever she was in the possession of those terrible engines of destruction with which to protect the world's liberties.

The honorable member, because of that vote, declares in his autocratic and oligarchical way that it is " disgraced and dishonoured." One wonders why he does not go to the home of his birth, and induce it to accept conscription.  His  wonderful eloquence, perhaps, might have effect there. He has been very eloquent when speaking at public meetings held in town halls to which admission could be obtained only by ticket. We could not hire a town hall, but when the honorable member applied  for such a building it was at once placed at his disposal. If he loves the land from which he came, let him go back to it and try to persuade its people to adopt conscription. As the honorable member is present, I shall repeat the statement I made in his absence, that I do not know of his having ever spoken from any voluntary enlisting platform, nor do ,1 know that he has offered his services to his country, or offered this country the use of his money free of interest. We have raised by way of war loans over £100,000,000, but, so far as I know, a sum of only £1,120 has been loaned to the Commonwealth free of interest. </para>

I hope to see the adoption of such a policy of Protection as will enable Australia to be entirely self-contained. I should like to see a preference granted to the products of the Homeland in recognition of what the Homeland has done for us. To the four nations, like a four-leaved shamrock, in the northern seas, let us by all means give a 10 per cent, or 20 per cent, preference over the noble Allies who, equally with ourselves, are fighting in the deluge of blood and carnage called "war." *" Let us give our Allies a preference, if you will, over the neutral countries, and give those neutral countries an absolute prohibition, if you will, against all enemy countries. The Allies represent something like 1,400,000,000 people as against 134,000,000. Germany and Austria are entrenched as it were against us like those beleaguered stone-walled cities of the past that used to stand out for five, seven, or ten years against the foe. The only difference is that in modern warfare they dig themselves in and have vast areas of land for the cultivation of foodstuffs. . The time will come - and I hope it will come before Easter brings happiness to children if not to adults - when peace will be with us. </para>
                        <para>I want this beloved Australia of ours bo be' independent and self-supporting. We should build up amongst our people a pride and glory in Australian products. I hope we shall never return to the days of my youth when anything described as " Colonial " was considered to be inferior. Then again we should certainly go in for the proper fixing of prices. I have already explained to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> that it is an easy matter to put on a small sheet of paper the price ,at which meat, sugar, flour, and other foodstuffs may be purchased over the counter. If such a notice were put up in every post-office, all the people in the immediate vicinity would know exactly what they had to pay. More important still is the necessity for the publication of the name of some Government officer to whom the citizen could write- in the case of any overcharge being made, the duty of prosecuting the offending tradesman being laid upon that officer. .When I made the suggestion, I was told that it would be taken into consideration ; . but what really happened was the issue of a <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> so splendidly printed as to justify a compliment to the printer. In that <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> we have column after column showing the price of bread. What was the cost of the issue of that <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> I do not know, but it was not printed at the Government Printing Office, but by an outside printer. I do not blame the printing firm for undertaking the work, nor do I desire to mention any name; I merely desire, as I have intimated, to compliment the printer on the splendid work he turned out. It seems to me, however, somewhat ridiculous to issue such a <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> when a simple notice such' as I have suggested could be exhibited in every post-office. </para>

                                <para>- I am sure that every father and mother in Australia would wish that that suggestion had been acted upon. Lord Rhondda, in England, has said that war famines are not created te- enable dealers in food to engage in profiteering, and  President  Wilson has said that neither the American nor any other Government should be bled by extortionists. In America, one of the President's officers, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Danielswas</inline> given power to take over the steel plate industry ; and this has resulted in the saving of about £20,000,000 in three months. Co-operative societies are trying to do a little, but it i9 little they can do in this connexion. A most ridiculous fact in Australia is that a horse, worth about £20, cost the Government between £200 and £300; and, further, there was an " honorary " organizer for one of the charities at a salary of £500 a year. In addition, we have had frauds on the Government connected with phantom regiments, while widows and children have had to wait long for the money necessary for their support. Even the honorable member for Flinders, with all his legal knowledge, found it a very difficult task to whitewash the crowd opposite; in fact, it was not a whitewash, but a zebra effect - a sort of <inline font-style="italic">camouflage.</inline></para>

In my opinion, there were two honest men in the Government, who would not have broken their pledge had it not b_een for their loyalty to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet; but there is a greater loyalty, and that is loyalty to Australia and its people. The present Governmenthave crept into power under the stolen name of the "Win-the-war party," and the Director of Recruiting was man enough to say that if he had the power h'e would punish them for doing so. Is there any one in Parliament, or outside, who does not desire to win the war ? If there is such a man, then I have a quarrel with him. </para>
                        <para>The Prime Minister has said that Australia cries for  help  in the shape of conscription of human life; but we do not hear anything about a vote of the people in regard to conscription of wealth, for which I think there would be even a bigger majority than in the case of the last referendum. Our mother, Australia, cried on all her people for help, and her sons and daughters responded -to the extent of £101,000,000 at 4$ per cent. The mother generously paid the 4^ per cent. How much of the money was lent free of interest? Eleven hundred and twenty pounds. Actually, out of every £100 invested in our war loans to-day, only id. and a minute fraction of id. is lent free of interest. In these circumstances, where are the noble patriots? </para>

                                <para>- That in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> was published on the 8th November last year, and the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> was printed on the 22nd November. The latter is the fuller article of the two. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Grice - and I take it that no honorable member opposite will dispute his standing as a financial authority - said that if a man is receiving an income of £5,500 from our war loans, <inline font-style="italic">h.6</inline> will be getting more than 6 per cent, on "his money, whereas if he derives an income of £30,000 from this source he will be getting nearly 7 per cent. Now, if the same individual obtained an equal income from land he would be called upon to na,V State and Federal income tax, State and Federal land tax, and a super-tax. But under existing conditions, owing to the action of the Ministry of the day, so long as his money is invested in our war loans, he is exempted from this taxation. I hold that this condition of affairs must be altered. There is an old proverb in China that one must endeavour to save his face, just as the honorable member for Flinders has endeavoured to-day to save his fa,ce. notwithstanding that the Ministry have broken their pledge. The alteration might be effected when the war has ended by giving notice that all sums in excess of £1,000 or £5,000 invested by individuals who are not willing that their income from .our war loans should be taxed, should be returned to them on a certain date. </para>

                        <para>I come now to the question of war profits. I do not think any Liberal Premier of Victoria will ever again issue a list such as that which I hold in my hand - a list comprising the names of 265 individuals, firms, or companies who pay income tax. Some of these individuals, firms, or companies have made in profits during war time more than £100,000 a year in excess of the profits made by them in peace time. One firm made in 1916 more than £100,000 in excess of the profits which it made iu 1914. These firms in 1915 made £412,888 in excess of the profits of the previous year, whilst in 1916 they made a profit of £1,521,000. I have always maintained that after allowing business men a profit, say, of 10 per cent, or their average profit for the three pre-war years, the balance should revert to the State. That would prevent the unjust raising of the prices of foodstuffs, or the accumulation of war profits which takes place in <inline font-style="italic">war</inline> time. Anybody who makes undue profits during war time is an enemy of Australia just as much as are our foes at the Front. </para>
                        <para>I recognise that there are many persons in the community who honestly desire to encourage voluntary recruiting. In such circumstances what' can be done? Quite recently,, under one roof in the Sydney Town Hall, men were enlisted a3 strike breakers at the rate of los. per day. They were not called upon to risk their lives. Yet the soldiers leaving our shores to fight for these strike breakers receive only 5s. per day, with ls. per day deferred pay. Seeing that the remuneration of the strike breakers was fixed by the capitalists themselves at 15s. per day, surely the nav of our soldiers should be increased to that amount. How can we expect the fathers of families who are in receipt of 14s., 15s., and 16s. per day to go to the Front for 5s. per day? Four shillings of this last-named sum is allotted to the wives who are left behind, and an additional 44d. is paid on account of each child under sixteen years of age. What a paltry pittance. I wish to God the Governor-General and the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> had to feed their children on 4£d. per day. But the common soldiers' children receive that amount. Then the families get a little assistance from the patriotic societies, and if they only chance to know a few of the members of those organizations things go along smoothly enough. I hope that the Democracy of Australia will some day declare that the private shall receive the same pay as the officer. Give the Commander-in-Chief £100 a year more if you like, but pay him only the same pension. What are the pension's  given to our privates ? I desire to impress upon honorable members that in , the Defence Department we pay a hundred men salaries- in excess of that received by the  Commander-in-Chief  of the Swiss Army in war time, although he has under him 300,000 men. We also pay fifteen men more than Count von ' Moltke received when he led the victorious Prussians, 1,500,000 strong, into France and conquered it. I have here one of these laws - for anything that will cause me to be fined or imprisoned for breaking it is a law, whether it is called a regulation or anything else - providing that a major-general shall receive £1,200 a year. Above the major-general is a lieutenant-general who, I suppose, would receive £200 more, or about £28 per week. Above him is a general, who, I suppose, would receive about £30 per week. However, to speak from the book, I note that a' major-general gets £24 per week and also a field allowance of 15s. per day, for seven days in a week, making £29 5s. in all. I ask, as I asked the people outside, could not his wife save a good deal of money from that £24 per week? Is she not much better able to save than the -wife of John Brown on 5s. per day? Why should there be such a difference? Have they not each one soul and one body ? We shall never have a democratic Army until all ranks are clothed, fed, and paid the same, giving the Commander-in-Chief a little more. I hope the curse of military government will be ended with this war. All old-age pensioners, no matter what they have been in previous years, can claim only the same amount. The same applies to invalid pensioners, and women in their hour of trial, when they claim the maternity allowance for the. God-given gift of motherhood, can receive only the same allowance. If you want to crush down the military system, let the power of the people always be dominant. Whether I have been on this or- the other side of the House, I have always asked if the civil power was dominant over the military power. I asked that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> was /in control, and I was always told' that it was. If we were not certain, we moved amendments to make it so. All those pledges have been broken, not by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> but by his successor. </para>
                        <para>Can any honorable member quote me a single instance in Melbourne where the widow of a man who has made the supreme sacrifice of his life at the Front has been given a house free of rent 1 In one case only was an amount sufficient for the purpose given, and that was raised by the kindness of neighbours. But in Sydney, according to the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of 29th July last, there were 300 widows in their own little four-roomed brick cottages, some of them at Daceyville, at the nominal charge of ls. per year as long as they lived or remained widows. Why is that not done in "Victoria or the other States? The same article shows that in cases where there are no houses for them their rents are paid for them. There are half-a-dozen places in New South Wales where the widows of soldiers are being looked after. What has been done in Victoria? The Victorian Government dismissed 200 returned soldiers from the  Railway  Department. Will that help recruiting? Will that encourage all the men who meet and talk to them to go to the ' Front ?

                        <para>Then there were promises made by big companies to reinstate men in their positions on return. I believe the Commonwealth Bank has been guilty of breaking' promises of that kind. I asked that the names of the firms who had broken their word to soldiers should be displayed at the post-offices for the people to read. I am sure that 99 out of every 100 Australians, if they read that a firm had not kept its promise to a soldier when he returned, would take their custom elsewhere. My suggestion would have been a good way to punish firms of that kind, but perhaps it was too drastic for the Prime Minister to adopt - at any rate, he could not see his way clear to do it. </para>
                        <para>Now, as to the way some men have been treated. According to a petition presented to this House, twenty-four or twenty-five men, all of whom had been to the Front, were punished severely.. One was charged with joining in a meeting, and with disobedience of an order. The sentence was eighteen months' hard labour; but that is very mild compared with some of the others which follow. Another private, charged with" being absent without leave, and with insubordinate language to a noncommissioned officer, was sentenced to three years' penal servitude. Another, charged with disobeying an order, bad language, and escaping from custody, was given five years' penal servitude. And so the merry list goes on - merry as hell! Another concrete example : According to an article reprinted in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 22nd 'March, 1917, certain men were sent into the desert in Egypt with three days' supply of water to build a railway. They finished the water in a day and a half, and when they could not get water for the balance of the three days, they ceased the work. They were court-martialled , and sentenced to terms ranging from two or five years. After being landed in Long Bay gaol, Sydney,  they  were removed to the Goulburn gaol shackled by a blacksmith. That is a case of leg-irons with a vengeance. </para>

                        <para>The Prime Minister stated that he had actually seen a soldier wearing a "Yes" button struck. If that was so, I am very sorry for it; but let me repeat what I heard with my own ears said . by a man wearing an officer's uniform. When the newspaper was handed on board the ship with the announcement that the " Noes " had a majority, this officer actually said, "I wish I had every man and woman who voted " No " in front of my Gatling guns, and I would shoot every one of them." That officer went oyer at his own expense to hound down  Colonel Crouch  because he was fighting with the privates on the " No " side. He went over to Tasmania to interrupt a meeting. I did not know him from a wow then. He was dressed in private clothes, and he interrupted me when I was speaking. I said, "If you do not sit down and wait for question time, I will have you turned out." He was turned out under Regulation 306, issued last year. What do honorable members . think of this officer having a loaded waddy hidden in his coat? He was so proud of it on the ship next day that he was waving it about. What about the officers who, in uniform, and against the law - and they should understand the law - attended a meeting to destroy any chance of  Colonel Crouch  speaking? Thank the Lord the officer T have referred to was not an Australian, but, like the honorable member for Flinders, came from another place. </para>
                        <para>The only period in history that I can compare our times with is that of England under Walpole, and I would like to remind the honorable member for Flinders that the vote of the people on this referendum clearly indicates that the wisdom of the electors is greater than that of any chance Ministry owing its position to a chance majority. The people who pay have the right to say how the money shall be spent, and I shall never be content until they have the initiative and recall, not by permission of this Parliament, but as their right under "the Constitution. I shall never be content until they have the right by .a petition signed by thirty out of every 100 electors to declare any seat vacant. When they have that privilege we shall not have the spectacle of Ministry and members- breaking their sacred pledges made to the people. I believe that if the honorable member for Flinders has his way we would have conscription to-morrow, and I remember how he robbed every man in the State Public Service of a portion of his citizenship. But I also remember how that proposal was thrown out unanimously by both Houses. </para>

                        <para>We have been told that France has been bled white, but on the other hand I learned from perhaps the best informed American that has ever come to Australia that the United States has over 1,000,000 men in England and France. In the latter country, I understand, the American recruits now total 960,000. It will be remembered that when General Joffre proceeded to America as a commission, after the declaration of war, he advised the United States Government to send their recruits to France at once in order that they might be trained in the theatre of war. In addition to this information I made inquiries of a high official in the Defence Department, and was told that America now had about 1,000,000 men in training in France, equal to fifty divisions. </para>

Is it the chairmanship of a commission representing all the Overseas  Dominions? If it is, then I venture to prophesy that meetings will be held throughout the length and breadth of Australia, and resolutions will be carried, informing the people of the, Mother Country that we are glad to get fid of him, but cannot compliment them on taking him, especially if he treats them as he  treats us.  Let there be no mistake about this pledge breaking. Every member of this House, who votes against this censure motion, and in support of the Government in the farce of resigning and going back to office within ten hours, will be a party to the policy of breaking faith with the Australian public. In a recent issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Graphic</inline> there appears a splendid cartoon, showing William Morris Hughes and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook's</inline> noses tied together by the word " conscription," and containing the following statement under the heading - " The basis of Representative Government " - </para>

It was a question that rose far above the party, as it stood oat before the Commonwealth as a simple one of truth and honour; indeed, it was a moral and so a religious one, that it became unthinkable among men of honour that there could be any other course but resignation. What kind of a lesson in truth-telling would it be to a million young Australians if the highest in the land broke his publicly-proclaimed word, and to offer to resign and at once agree to continue, would be an unreality and a mere sham. He did not think that the promise applied to the other members of the same party, but it unquestionably did to the Government themselves. In principle the matter was just the same as the cause of the present war. England kept her word to Belgium, and entered into the conflict with all its frightful consequences, while Germany broke her's. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roosevelt</inline> had said that had England not kept her word she could never have lifted up her head among the nations again, and so in this case, if a definite promise were treated as a scrap of paper, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and his Ministry would be everlastingly dishonoured and debased. </para>

                        <para>It is said that in the southern States of America there were only three Christian ministers who advocated the abolition bf slavery because it was against the law of God. The rest held it to be in accordance with Scripture and Divine right. I am glad to be able here to put on record the names of ministers of religion who took the right side in connexion with the question of conscription, and held the making of a military caste to be against the Christian religion. . I mention the names of Charles Strong, of the Australian Church, Melbourne; Frederick  Sinclaire  of the Free Religious Fellowship, Melbourne; H. Hope Hume, Congregational Minister, Victoria; F. Clemens, Baptist Church, Murrumbeena, Victoria;. A. Rivett, Independent, New South Wales ; W. H. Beale, Methodist, <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> South Wales; B Lynden Webb, Methodist, New South Wales; William Cooper, Australian representative of the Society of Friends; and Arthur J. Prowse, Presbyterian, Tasmania. I would rather be in the company of those men in the next world than in that of the howlers for blood from the platforms of those advocating conscription. Even the possession of a name the same as that of the Prime Minister could not save the Rev. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hughes,</inline> of Rockhampton, Queensland, because he happened to be against conscription, and the leaders of his church got rid of him. </para>

I have lived in Wedderburn for about thirty years, and know all the people in and around the town. There is no such person as Reg. W. Turnbull living in Wedderburn. I know each and every Turnbull living in the whole district. The only Turnbull in Wedderburn is Walter Turnbull, a butcher, who is childless. I believe the letter said to have been received by Reg. W. Turnbull to be a fabrication,' made for the purpose of improperly influencing votes in favour of conscription. </para>

                            made this solemn declaration in such a way as to render himself liable for perjury if what he stated were proved not to be true, and he subsequently addressed public meetings from the 6th December, 1917, to the 12th of that month, in support of the statement he made. This man has other brave sons at the Front. Yet the conscriptionists could not help lying, even about those who had so distinguished themselves.
                        </para>
                        <para>We may rest assured that the breaking of pledges by this Ministry will not be forgotten, and cannot be explained away. After this Parliament has been to the country, the Ministerial party will not have its present strength, and I am willing to wager, for the benefit of a hospital, that in every instance in which a Ministerialist crawls back, his majority will have been reduced if he has defended the breaking of the promise of the Government. This promise has been broken as vilely as the treaty which guaranteed Belgium's freedom was broken by the Germans, but without the excuse which the Germans had, which was that what they did was necessary' in the interests of their country. Are Ministers afraid that, should they go out of office, their Departments may be searched ? I should like" to see copies of all the telegrams that have been sent to the Front. Birdwood is a good General, possibly, but in political matters, and so far as voting is concerned, he is a perfect little  "Birdy."  Whenever did he get a vote in England, Ireland, or Scotland as a man? He never had a vote in any of those countries as a man. They do not give men the right to vote there. I doubt if more than 1 per cent. of the single men at the Front who have gone from the Four Kingdoms have the right to vote. No son who lives in his father's house can vote unless he is a lodger there. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith,</inline> when Prime Minister of England, had his name taken off the electoral list because he was living in a house owned by his wife, and had not arranged to be enrolled as a lodger. Yet they dare to interfere in Australian matters. </para>
                        <para>I firmly believe that there is or was a Sixth Division at the Front. In my opinion, it is lying hypocrisy to deny the fact, and I have said so on the platform. Allowing 20,000 to a division, we have five divisions at the Front, that is, 100,000 men; 15,000 men in Egypt and Mesopotamia, and over 6,000 men on our Australian Fleet- making 121,000 Then I have had a letter from my grand nephew, another letter from another boy whom I have nursed, and a third letter from a boy whom I brought into the world - all of them written from the Front - in which it is said that there is a Sixth Division. Did not an officer own at a public meeting - I have the report here - that there is a Sixth Division. Yet men have been punished with fine or imprisonment for saying so. What is to be done to Ministers who have broken a pledge given to the Australian public? I ask those who have read Lecky's account of the bribery, and corruption in Walpole's time to compare it with the state of affairs under the present Government. </para>

                            <para>. - Apparently, for new ethics, a new standard of morals, and may be a new brand of conscience, one must come to the Federal Parliament. I am not concerned with what may happen to honorable members opposite. I would view, with a certain amount of satisfaction, their absence in, say, a little over two years' time, especially the absence of those who have proved traitors to their trust ; but I object to any party or to any set of politicians dragging an institution in the mire, and thus, causing the public to distrust it. Every member of this Parliament must bear the disgrace attaching to this institution by reason of the lack of conscience and morals shown by our honorable friends opposite. I do not say that any one member of the Government party is responsible for what has happened. Every one of them, including the anti-conscriptionist from Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lynch)',</inline> is responsible for what happened during the past few months, and must accept that responsibility. </para>

The honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pigott)</inline> must accept responsibility for what has occurred during the past six weeks; he cannot disclaim it while he keeps silence and sits behind the" present Ministry, the so-called new Ministry, which went out one door and came in another immediately, and has not yet offered an apology to the Australian people for so doing. Every honorable member opposite must accept responsibility for the pledges that were given, even the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine),</inline> and even the only anti-conscriptionist on the Government benches. It was decided, when the referendum .was first mooted, that it would not be made vital to the existence of the Government, but friend Holman, of the same ilk and type as many honorable members opposite, and brother in political treachery to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> journeyed to Melbourne. </para>

It is useless for the honorable member to attempt to disclaim responsibility while he sits on the Government benches. At any rate, the Ministry, in order to get the support of the National party in New South Wales, which has almost drowned itself by putting a millstone around its neck, gave in to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman,</inline> and made the referendum a vital question.

If they want this Government they know what they have to do, but if they are prepared to hand over the reins to the parties who ran the strike, to men who would withdraw Australia from the war, to men who stand for Sinn  Feinism  and Industrial Workers of the  Worldism,  they have only to vote " No " </para>

                            <para>The Government have made a definite and welcome assertion of ' the principle of Government responsibility in an issue vital to our national honour and safety. No other course would have been possible. The Government say, in effect, " You must choose between  cur party with conscription and the Official Labour party without conscription." In that pledge the Government must, not be allowed to stand alone. All members sitting behind the Government, are bound by it in honour, or they cease to be Government supporters. Hence, no Ministry can be formed on the National side of the House which will attempt to carry on government without conscription. It is clear, therefore, that, should the electors from any of the motives that may actuate them, decline the responsibility of sanctioning conscription by a direct vote, one of two things must happen - either the government of this country must be handed to the Tudor party, or the National party in Parliament must take the full responsibility of its policy, even should that necessitate an appeal to the constituents in the ordinary manner provided by the Constitution. </para>

                                <para>- Until to-night I thought he was the only honest and honorable man in the National party. I have no desire to make a personal attack upon the honorable member for Flinders, but I desire to say something of his conduct as a public man, and the awful dissension, bitterness, loss, and victimization that the honorable gentleman has caused during his term in public life. There are many other men in the community of kindred natures, who stand aloof and cold from everything and everybody and go blundering on, caring nothing for the harm which may  befall  those who stand in their way.

In 1914 he was mainly responsible for the double dissolution of the Federal Parliamen't over the question of preference to unionists. He had no small hand in the conscription referendum of 1916, and he had a very big hand in the referendum of 1917. Not once has he been on the right track. But within a couple of months he will be urging the National party to enforce conscription without reference to the people at all. </para><interjection>

                                <para>- The honorable member has been very unfortunate in respect of every public matter he has supported, and his career shows clearly that he does not understand what the  Australian  people need or desire, or what they will tolerate. Every matter of importance that has been advocated by the honorable member for Flinders has been rejected by the people. Until recently the best that people could say of the honorable member was that he was honest in his intentions, but his speech to-day, vague and indefinite as it was, made one wonder whether he has not ceased to be that which both his friends and enemies thought him. I should like to know where the honorable member stands, and whether he intends to support the National party. No matter how much he may claim that he could not during the campaign attack the party of which he was a member, he must accept responsibility for the introduction of government by the Prime Minister and Government Printer and the attempted incarceration of public men. </para>

                        </continue><para>I believe that a number of people voted and advocated conscription for ulterior and vile motives. It has been alleged that we have in the Labour party and supporting us all "the Sinn Feiners, all the Industrial' Workers of the World, all the disloyalists, all the pro-Germans, and all the enemies of Australia, Great Britain," the Allies, and civilization. But in the National party, and amongst those who voted for  conscription - including, at least, one honorable member who is not present to-night - are men who desired the introduction  of  conscription as a means of getting cheap labour. If that  is  not their desire their actions at least justify that suspicion. During the referendum campaign I travelled the whole  of  the western part of New South Wales, and I found that every station, with rare exceptions, from Nyngan westward,- employed. Chinamen, and every squatter who employed Chinamen in preference to white men and . returned soldiers was a conscriptionist. At that time, according to the Labour Minister in New South Wales <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beeby),</inline> there were over 300 returned soldiers in that State who wanted work, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beeby</inline> supplicated those patriotic employers almost on bended knees, " For God's sake, give work to these returned soldiers." But they preferred Chinamen. Are Industrial Workers of the World or disloyalists  Worse  than such men ? There sits  on  the Government benches an honorable member who employs Chinamen on his  : station.  I will not say he employs them in preference to returned soldiers, but the fact remains that he does not employ returned soldiers. </para><interjection>

                            - My statement cannot be challenged. Any man in the west of New South Wales who will pay proper wages can get men. When patriotic squatocracy employs' Chinamen on its stations in preference to returned soldiers, is there any wonder that there is bitterness in our midst and suspicion of everything the National party advocates? Honorable members opposite must accept their responsibility for this state of affairs. In the district of Byrock, taking into account the youngest babe and the oldest inhabitant, there are 140 white souls. Surrounding the district are quite a large number of stations owned by patriots and flag-flappers who visit the " local railway station to cheer and " Godsave" departing recruits, and who, on the back trip, probably, take five or ten Chinamen with them. At no time can one .travel on that western train without seeing, it may be six, ten, or twenty Chinese, either travelling up the line or returning from &amp; job. That is an everyday occurrence. I  believe  that there are as many Chinese as white souls travelling on that line. While there are 140 whites in the district of Byrock, there are 90 Chines© employed on "patriotic" conscriptionists' stations. In that district more Chinese than white men are employed. It would seem, therefore, that every station-owner and every manager for the big companies is advocating conscription only that his vile ends may be achieved. These people are employing Chinese, although we have no conscription, while the returned soldier is carrying his swag all over this country.  While  he is on his pension of 7s. 6d. or 10s. per week Chinese are preferred by the station-owner. One of the prominent and leading conscriptionists in the district of Cobar is a stock and station agent. Sycophant-  like he must do what those who employ him want, or his living will go.  His  advocacy of conscription is equal to that of the honorable member for Flinders, and he proudly displayed in his office window about 14th November last a card bearing the words : " Wanted five scrub-cutters, Chinamen preferred." That sort of thing is common. I repeat that there are more Chinamen than whites employed in ring-barking and scrub-cutting on the stations of western New South Wales.

                                <para>- Prior to the great stampede. Shortly afterwards- on 12th November - the Prime . Minister, speaking at Bendigo, said that there was a very grave shortage, and that it had been necessary to break up the 5th Division in order to provide reinforcements for the other four. Now, either the Prime Minister or the Minister for- Defence was telling lies in regard to that matter. When Premier Ryan was haled before the Court, and when the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts)</inline> was similarly dealt with, it appeared from evidence given on oath by several responsible officers' in the Defence Department, that the Prime Minister was lying. Their statements made on oath were in effect that the 5th Division did not have to be broken up. Somebody was lying. Who was it? The point to which . I take exception is that ©very member of the Labour party was watched, spied upon, and dogged, his meetings being attended by spies and petty Pinkertons in order that he should not tell that one lie. The only people who were capable of lying during that campaign, according to the summing up of our friends opposite, were members of the Labour party. </para>

                                <para>- The position is very plain. The Prim© Minister has refused to allow any member of the Nationalist party to be prosecuted. That is a definite and distinct statement. * A't no time have the provisions of the " great lie ' ' regulation been brought into operation against any conscriptionist. I know of at least two applications that have been made to the Prime Minister to prosecute persons on the conscription side, and to which no reply has been given. The regulation waa passed to " gag " the nocon.scriptionists of this country. The ' ' on© lie" regulation was like the light. It' turned out to be, not a cracker, but only a wet squib. There is still worse to come. The people of this country have to pay the piper. If the Prime Minister or his colleagues had to pool their salaries to pay for this wicked and wanton waste of the people's money there might be some satisfaction in it. -But what right has the Prime Minister or any member of the National party to go in for mad and experimental legislation of such a vindictive character as that of the "one lie" regulation framed under the War Precautions. Act. </para>

                                <para>- Although only a regulation it has just as much force as an Act of Parliament. The two men mainly concerned are, of course, the Prime Minister and the Government Printer, but members of the National party stood by, and saw public men haled before magistrates, and charged with faked charges- charges which even conscriptionist magistrates turned down on the ground that they -were loosely drawn, experimental, and based on Gilbert and Sullivan regulations. The trouble is that the Australian people have to pay for tha vindictiveness which sought to " gag " anti-conscriptionists and the Labour party, and prevent them putting their views before the public. ' My own particular case arose from the fact that I wrote an article for the <inline font-style="italic">Worker.</inline> This article was really an extract from the appeal made by the organizer of the Fruit and Vegetable Fund in Sydney. The appeal stated that there were 1,200 wives of soldiers at' the Front on the books, and that to these women were handed parcels of fruit and vegetables, of which they were in need. The appeal further stated that there were 400 wives of soldiers at the Front who could not be placed on the books owing to the lack of cash, and that there were 4,300 children dependent on these 1,600 mothers. These are facts which -the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> ought to take into consideration, if _ he has not . already done so. In my article I simply stated the facts briefly, and Chen added a comment that the position would be accentuated a hundredfold if conscription were carried. Then the busybodies, the Pinkertons, the spies in tHe Darling electorate, got to work, and prevailed on some one to take action against me. I mention this case, not because it is my own, hut because it is on  a  par with the whole of . the prosecutions that were entered into in order to apply the " gag," and not allow us to tell our constituents what was happening in Australia. Because of that comment, it was decided by the legal  fraternity who conduct the business of the National party that I had committed an offence by making a misrepresentation of facts. On this ground I was to be haled before a conscriptionist magistrate. </para>

The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Joseph Cook)</inline> reviewed that pamphlet, though probably he' does not know that it cost the secretary of the league £50. Does the honorable member think that the pamphlet was worthit? </para>

                    <para>.- Is the Postmaster- General aware that married letter carriers,, who have been  rejected  for the Forces, are being displaced by young men who have returned from the Front? In one case I have in my mind, a young single man who is in receipt of a pension of 30s. a week has replaced a married man. If that is all the Government are able to do in the way of repatriation, it is time the Minister in charge looked into the matter, and endeavoured to make some change. I feel quite sure that returned soldiers, especially those in receipt of pensions of 30s., are not anxious to have married men discharged in order to find places for themselves. I ask the Postmaster-General to be good enough to see whether the facts are as stated. </para>
