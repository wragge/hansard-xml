      <para>PRIVATE GORDON McDONALD. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BOYD.</inline>- According to this morning&#39;s newspaper, Private Gordon McDonald, to whose case I drew attention last week, has had his passage paid to Sydney, and there has been found wearing the ribbons of the D.C.M., the M.O., the Croix de Guerre, and the D.S.O., showing clearly that his case is a mental one. Moreover, he was sent to this country as a mental case. I ask the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> therefore, if he will see that this man, instead of being confined in a civil prison, is sent to a hospital or other institution where he can be treated as a mental case? </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. WATT.</inline>- I was not in the chamber throughout the delivery of the speech made by the honorable member last week, and therefore missed most of his remarks on this case, though from what I did hear, it appeared to me that he had not gone the right way to get it properly considered, and perhaps the case has been, to some extent, prejudiced in consequence. When this morning, I read the newspaper report, to which the honorable member has referred, it occurred to me that the man must be bordering on insanity, or, at least, suffering from temporary aberration. I propose to ask the Minister for Defence to consider the case with me as early as possible. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. TUDOR.</inline>- Will the Acting Prime Ministeralso ascertain the names of the persons from whom the ribbons were obtained which it is alleged the man was wearing? It was impossible for him to make them himself, and those who supplied him with them are the persons who should be punished. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. WATT.</inline>- The Department does its best to prevent the improper use of military symbols and badges. The subject of the honorable member&#39;s question may form part of the inquiry. </para>

            <para>- I do not propose to follow the course suggested. Great Britain has raised loans in the United States of America, not, because of her poverty or her inability to borrow from her own people, but, in conjunction with the French nation, chiefly to provide exchange value which was running heavily against her Allies on the Continent of Europe. Canada, on the other hand, is the neighbour of the United States of America. But Canada, in addition to raising loans from her own people, has become, in one sense, a creditor of Great Britain. I think that Australia should, so far as her circumstances will permit, raise as much money as she needs for war purposes from her own people. </para>

            <para>- I am getting rather timid in regard to the wowsers. I ask if it is to-day, and in honour of the soldiers who are returning to-day, that a badge of blue is to be worn on the uniforms of invalided men to prevent them from getting drink? As it seems to me that the regulation requiring this badge to be worn brings the men almost under the Aboriginals Protection Act, I ask whether the Minister for Defence has considered the advisability of having their faces painted black? I have been requested by soldiers themselves to raise this matter. </para>

Does the Acting Prime Minister consider that this state of affairs is in the best interests of departmental efficiency, and can he state what are the reasons for the remarkable delay in filling the vacancies ? </para>

            <para>- I do not think that important administrative offices should, as a practice, be left vacant, or put in charge of acting officials for any length of time. Broadly speaking, if men suitable for the vacancies present themselves, or are available, they should be appointed as promptly as possible, so that the responsibilities of the administration may fall upon permanent officials who are properly qualified to carry them. The chief reason why this and former Governments have delayed the appointment of a Public Service Commissioner is the need for an amendment of the Public Service Act, and the consideration incidental thereto of the advisability of commissioning the Post Office. If it were decided to put the Postal Department under a permanent Commission of administration, the work of the Public Service Commissioner would be materially lessened. But until the question has been analyzed in the light of all the facts, it has been considered advisable to delay the appointment of a Public Service Commissioner. </para>

            <para>- No. It is not an easy matter to explain, but if the honorable member, who is interested in this question, would call at my Department I &#39;should be glad to show him the exact position. The arrangements we have made for financing the primary products is the chief cause for the present expansion of the note issue. I think I have explained to the House that the obligations which we feel we have to undertake in regard to wool, wheat, butter, and related products amount to something like &#163;76,000,000. All these arrangements have to be dealt with by the banks, and in some cases shipments cannot be effected. That is the main cause for the expansion of the note issue. </para>

              <para>- What appears to the honorable member to be impertinent might be quite reasonable in the view of the ordinary loyalist. The object of the inquiry is to ascertain if men of doubtful loyalty are employed in any Department, and particularly in the Navy Department and the Department of Defence. I endeavoured to induce the magistrate to inquire at an early date into one case which upon representations made to me, seemed to be needful of more despatch; but he has laid out his programme of work in a very systematic way and rather objects to any interference with it. I shall see how far the honorable member&#39;s suggestion can be met. </para>

          <para>Mr.FENTON. - I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister a question relating to a gentleman whose case has to be inquired into by the magistrate. He came to this country when two and a half years of age; has been thirty years in the Public Service ; and has been under suspension from 1st January last, since when he has received no salary. He is the only public servant in the list of persons of enemy birth who is in this sorry plight. Will the honorable gentleman expedite the consideration of his case so that he may know what his position is ? At present he is not allowed to earn his living in his ordinary capacity. </para>

              <para>Attention is directed to the reply given by the Prime Minister to the honorable member&#39;s question of 25th January last in this connexion. It may now be added that, in a despatch dated 7th December, 1917, the High Commissioner, London, stated that the case of the Australian civilian prisoners atRuhleben had all along been kept closely under notice, and everything possible had been done to meet all reasonable requirements, and to obviate, as far as possible, irregular supply of food and clothing. The High Commissioner also stated that, despite their best efforts, the lot of the civilians atRuhleben must continue to be irksome and hard to bear, and it might be quite reasonably expected that there would be a certain amount of dissatisfaction and complaint; but every tiling possible was being done to alleviate their condition. With a view, however, to obtaining the latest information in regard to both military and civilian prisoners of war, the High Commissioner was asked, on 23rd May, to furnish full particulars in regard to the conditions at present governing repatriation and exchange of same; but no reply is yet to hand. 2 and 3. In March last, the Government approved, on the recommendation of the High Commissioner, of the Australian Bed Cross taking over the care of the Australian civilian prisoners of war atRuhleben, at an estimated cost of &#163;2,000 per annum. </para>

            <para>- That is another matter which is dealt with in the Bill, but not in  this  particular amendment. The principle of the Bill is to allow mining companies to set aside a certain amount of money out of their income for development. Wealthy companies generally pursue that policy. If the money is not used it is brought to account in the following year, and income tax is paid upon it. That is a perfectly feasible scheme of mining development. The Senate&#39;s amendment is to apply to companies who spend their money as they earn it. Small companies are not able, as a definite act of policy, to say that they will set aside out of an income of &#163;50,000 earned during the year, a sum of &#163;20,000 for development in the following year. As the money comes in they spend it on development work, and at the particular moment it is not earning income. </para>

            <para>- The check is to assume that a certain amount of wisdom will be displayed in controlling the operations of these companies. They will not put money into the ground unless it is used for developmental work. They would just as soon pay it to the Income Tax Commissioner as spend it on unnecessary and useless work. The proposal contained in the Senate&#39;s amendment is a perfectly sound one. It will help smaller companies in a way which Parliament has already decided to help larger companies. Another phase of the matter will be covered by the next amendment. </para>

            <para>- The Commissioner has decided that the appropriation must be made at the annual, meeting. This provision will be a protection to the small company, which may be earning &#163;400 or &#163;500 a month, and expending about &#163;700 in development work, with calls for the purpose of providing the balance. .Without the amendment, the Commissioner will not allow for this expenditure, because it has not been appropriated at the end of the financial year. </para>

          <para>.- 1 take no exception to some concession being given to mining companies or parties for developmental work. I had a few years&#39; experience as a working miner, and I know that such a concession is essential. A very vital difference can be drawn between a man engaged in farming or grazing, and the man engaged in developmental work in mining. Notwithstanding the fact that we have very able men, including geologists, in the employ of the Government, to tell us where we may hope to look for success, I have found very often, as a working miner, that their knowledge does not extend far beyond the point of the miner&#39;s pick. While the major part of the greatness of Australia is due to the mining industry, and it is one to be fostered, the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falkiner)</inline> is, I think, on perfectly safe ground in calling attention to the fact that some consideration should be shown to the man on the land. No doubt there are high prices for wool and stock and so forth, and we producers are earning, perhaps, better incomes than we did before the war; but it should be remembered that, under present circumstances, we are compelled to neglect the work of permanent improvement and maintenance, owing to the fabulous prices of fencing wire, and all we require in this connexion. So far as I am aware, we are not allowed to set aside a certain proportion of our incomes to provide for these necessaries in the years to come; and in this direction we deserve consideration. Galvanized iron is &#163;100 to &#163;120 a ton in small quantities, while fencing wire is almost unobtainable ; and we ought to be allowed to withold a certain amount or portion of our income today in order to be able to face the lean years and maintain our present standard of production if not of prices. </para>

          <para>.- The honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lynch)</inline> has presented a somewhat good case, but I am always loath to make any exemptions of the kind in a taxation measure. There are other industries besides farming which are burdened with high prices, and the whole subject is a very &#34;ticklish&#34; one. Of course, the mining community has, perhaps, the most pugilistic of representatives in this House, and possibly to that is due the proposal to extend this privilege. In a business with which I am connected in Sydney it was proposed to set aside a certain sum for the purpose of realization in the following year, and it was hoped that some allowance in taxation would have been permitted ; but when I interviewed the Commissioner I found there was no hope at all, although the money was for developmental purposes. Once we &#34;start making exemptions in an Income Tax Bill  we  never know where we shall be able to stop&#39;. </para>

            <para>- All the same, the Government ought to be extremely cautious in granting exemptions. Under existing taxation many large exemptions are granted to which, when the Budget is before us, I shall draw attention, in order to expose the state of affairs. Taxation is required now more than at any other period in our history, and nothing should be done to interfere with the revenue. 1. have invested money in mining. As  a  young man I was fortunate enough to get on to good alluvial and make a  few  pounds, but subsequently I was persuaded by some agents in Sydney to go into  a reef  speculation, only to find that I had put my money into a load of stone. </para>

            <para>- From all I can gabber, more money has been lost than gained in gold mining. We, on this side, offered some objection to the exemptions in the War-time Profits Tax Bill, but  Ave were  outvoted ; and I suppose it is only human nature for vested interests to see only one side. I have no desire to discourage developmental mining, if only for the reason that I believe on this will depend the future  prosperity of the Northern Territory, if a proper policy is adopted. There is a fear, I am told, that development in the Northern Territory might diminish- land values in the States, and this may be the reason why mining in that part of Australia is being kept back. Under the circumstances, I shall offer no opposition to the amendment, leaving the Government to take the responsibility for their action. </para>

          <para>.- There is a great deal to he said for the view put forward by the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falkiner).</inline> At the same time I cannot help feeling that the safeguards asked for by interjection by some honorable members while the Treasurer was speaking, would be very difficult to apply in connexion with the general exemption, although I admit that if we are to have an exemption at all, this amendment must be made. The Treasurer says that we are safeguarded against a mining company throwing its money into the ground by the fact that the company would sooner give the money to the Treasury. That is just what such a company will not do. If the Treasurer were managing a gold mining company, and bad the choice of paying &#163;10,000 into the Treasury or spending &#163;10,000 on another hole in the ground - which might yield something, but in which he would not invest unless he were required to pay the &#163;10,000 to the Treasury as an alternative - it is certain that he would apply the money to the new speculation. </para>

            <para>- I have already said that if we allow an exemption at all, we cannot very well deny the force and justice of this amendment. But I am dealing with the general question of exempting mining companies. Much has been heard in this House from time to time regarding the value of the mining industry to Australia. So far as our legislation goes, that industry boils down to gold mining because, in another measure that was dealt with by the House recently, the only exemption granted was to that industry. The statistics prove that for every &#163;1 worth  of  gold taken out of the ground; 25s. is put into the ground. It is quite true that the 25s. does not all come from Australia, and that whilst the English investor has paid heavily to get the pound&#39;s worth of gold from the ground, the Australian investor has not paid nearly as much. We must remember, however, that money for speculative ventures will become scarce - indeed, Western Australia experienced the scarcity before the war - and in future  money   for mining purposes will have to come from Australian sources. That being so, I cannot see why we should give any policy encouragement to such an industry. There is a reason for giving a policy encouragement to the primary industries, and those other industries which are endeavouring to convert the primary products into manufactured articles. If that were done, we should greatly benefit Australian production and increase our wealth. </para>

I am not arguing in favour of &#34;any exemptions, but if we give them at all, they should go to the industries that are likely to be of most benefit to the country. The mining industry is only a tithe of the importance of, firstly, the pastoral, agricultural, and other big primary industries; and, secondly, the industries which aim at turning out our raw products in manufactured form. Australia has never had a policy which aimed at encouraging those industries. </para>

          <para>.- The amendment embraces a very proper principle, and later I shall ask the Government to extend it to other primary industries. What is proper for one industry is proper for others. The honorable member for &#39;Hume claims the extension of the exemption to the pastoral industry. I claim the same advantage for farming. The expenditure on rabbit destruction is an instance. The poison carts may go over the country week after week, and have no appreciable effect upon the rabbits, but an allowance is made for that expenditure. Yet if a man operates in a business-like fashion, digging out the&#39; rabbits, destroying all cover, and eventually exterminating the pest, he gets no allowance for his expenditure. There is  a  case in point in New South Wales.  The  graziers in the Western District found the rabbits swarming in. </para>

          <para>. -The object of this amendment is to place gifts in kind purchased and immediately presented to a patriotic fund on a parity in the matter of deductions with gifts in cash. At present a deduction is allowed in respect of gifts in cash to such funds, but not in respect of gifts in kind. It is perfectly clear that that is inequitable. The effect is to induce people to put money into patriotic funds when it might be more advisable that they should invest the money in the purchase of comforts. To illustrate the matter by a case that occurs to me. The Victoria Racing Club, with the assistance of the business men associated with it, are doing very good work by purchasing comforts to advantage for the men at the Front. They might adopt another course, and pay &#163;5,000 or &#163;10,000 in cash into a patriotic fund. They buy well - tobacco, clothing, and other comforts, and no doubt to greater advantage than these articles could be purchased by the patriotic fund. </para>

            <para>- That wouldnot be covered by the amendment. If a man purchases from his income any gift, in preference to making his contribution in cash, he will, under the amendment, receive the same consideration as if he made a cash contribution. The amendment may not go far enough, but that is as far as it goes. </para>

            <para>- I remind the honorable member that we are dealing with an income tax. If we were dealing with a wealth tax, a gift of a block of land might fairly be treated in the same way as a cash gift from income, but it is for the Committee to determine whether when dealing with an income tax it will treat in the same way a man who transfers assets as a man who makes a gift from income. The purpose of this amendment, which was carried with the concurrence of the Government in the Senate, is to place a man who purchases things and presents them at once to a patriotic fund, which may often be better than a presentation of cash, in the same position in the matter of deductions as the man who makes a cash gift to a patriotic fund.

          <para>. - I am very sorry that it is proposed to provide for any deduction at all in respect of these gifts to patriotic funds, though I sympathize very much with those who spend their time in endeavouring to secure collections. I imagine that the people who have approached the Government in connexion with this matter are the secretaries to these patriotic funds, who have experienced extreme difficulty at times in getting money from people. They probably thought that if the Government could offer contributors&#39; to the funds some inducement in the way of exemption from income tax, it might possibly lead to better subscriptions. Personally, I believe that the prospect of an exemption from income tax in respect of a gift to one of these funds does not weigh at all with the average contributor. When a man is asked to subscribe to a fund, and writes out a cheque for the purpose, it does not occur, I believe, to one in a thousand that by making the contribution he will secure a deduction from the amount of his income tax. </para>

            <para>- I think there is a reason. It is a very easy matter to make a deduction in respect of a cash contribution. The income tax officers will have no difficulty in dealing with a stated amount. But take the case of a man who gives a motor car. I remember the case of a man who presented a motor car to the Defence Department. It used up so much petrol that it cost about 9d. a mile to run it. The man was glad to get rid of the thing. It was given for patriotic reasons; but it would have been better for the Defence Department if they had never accepted the gift. </para>

            <para>- I understand that, for the purpose of repatriation, gifts in kind are treated exactly the same as gifts in cash. I had. in mind a difficulty such as this: Suppose a man promises an area of wheat. He is putting in the wheat, but he is unable to deliver the gift  until the crop matures, and is harvested. How could we have immediate delivery of the gift in a case like that? </para>

          <para>.- While agreeing with the principle embodied in the Senate&#39;s amendment, I -think it should go further. I fail to see why a man who purchases something which he afterwards gives to a patriotic fund, should be exempted from taxation, whilst another man who donates something to a similar fund should he taxed upon his gift. I have in my -mind the case of a man who purchases a horse for &#163;25, and presents it to a patriotic organization to be raffled.  Under  this Bill he will be exempted from taxation on that amount, whilst another gentleman who donates a horse which may he worth &#163;50 - an animal which he has bred himself - will be granted no exemption. </para>

            <para>- Similarly, a person may purchase an acre of land for the purpose of giving it to a patriotic society. He will secure an exemption to the value of the gift, whereas another person who owns a much more valuable piece of land and donates it to the same organization will not obtain exemption. I know of a case in which a piece of land was raffled in the innterests of the Red Cross. Very much to his credit, the land was donated by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, who received no exemption in regard to the gift. But if he had purchased that piece of land and then presented it to the Red Cross he would have been granted an exemption. </para>

We are anxious that he should know how deeply we appreciate the great sacrifices he has made for his country, and we hope that, for those services, there will be years and years of acknowledgment for him at the hands of the people of this country. </para>

The Leader of the Opposition has said that he hopes the day is not far distant when our boys who are now at the Front will return to us. I re-echo that hope. Our boys have done splendidly. They have stuck it out, and will continue to stick it out, but, nevertheless, we all hope that this awful business will come to an end as soon as possible, so that the fine fellows over there - and they are fine fellows - may return to their hearths and homes in Australia. </para>

          <para>. - This amendment by the Senate deals - as did the two previous amendments - with clause 14. An alteration has been made, in another place, to the provision bearing upon gifts to charitable institutions, and the amendment is one which some honorable members, perhaps, will not approve. The original law was that gifts exceeding &#163;20 each to charitable institutions, if verified to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, were deductable under the Income Tax Act. A proposal to make that provision slightly more liberal was not accepted by this Committee in originally dealing with the Bill, due largely, I think, to confusion. The Senate&#39;s amendment now proposes to give exemption in connexion with gifts of 21s. and upwards. That appears too small, and would, if it were enacted, create much trouble and confusion in verifying the amounts in the Taxation Office. I ask that the Committee accept the Senate&#39;s amendment, with an amendment that the sum shall be &#163;5. That would restore the principle hitherto embodied in our legislation, and would give wider scope to it. A person donating &#163;5 could secure a receipt without difficulty, and his <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> could be easily provable. </para>

          <para>. - If the Acting Prime Minister will look up the debate upon the Bill in Committee he will note that the reason why we struck out the subparagraph referring to gifts of this character was that we were informed by the Minister then in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Glynn) that it would involve a considerable loss of revenue. In my opinion, however, there should be no exemption. After all - as was pointed out strongly before - one man who donated &#163;.1 out of his small means might be giving relatively more generously than an individual who presented &#163;100. I hope the whole question of exemption in this respect will be kept out of the Bill. We should make no distinctions. If, however, the Minister deems it necessary to re-enact the provision, and to amend the Senate&#39;s amendment, as he has proposed, T shall feel bound to support the Government. I trust that that will not be necessary. </para>

        <para>I  desire briefly to refer to an incident mentioned by the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pigott)</inline> this morning. I have never claimed exemption upon the kind of gift in question, and I did not desire to do so in the present case. When I raffled a block of land for the Comforts Fund I was aware that I ran a risk of being prosecuted by the Crown. But I did not object to that so much,  because I thought  that that would be a good advertisement for the raffle. </para>

            <para>- When I  wa3  informed that I could not get permission from the Crown Law Department, I went on with the raffle just the same, without that permission, since I believed that a large number of people would learn that the raffle was being conducted, upon reading press reports of the Court proceedings, which, of course, would be a farbetter advertisement for the charitable object itself than I could secure by paying for an ordinary announcement in the usual way. I might add that the block in question was worth only about &#163;50; but the public subscribed, in sixpences, &#163;430 net for the benefit of the fund. Would it not have been a. rotten position if I had claimed exemption on that &#163;50 gift in such circumstances? </para>

          <para>.- I object to the proposed exemption for another reason besides that which the honorable member for Eden-Monaro has stressed; and it is for exactly the same reason as that we are not granting the benefit of interest to future subscribers to war loans. If the exemption stands, it will amount to this: that the people best able to pay will receive the greatest benefit. The charities will get the money in any&#39; case, if the whole principle is done away with. </para>

            <para>-  No. There were two crosscurrents in the Committee. First, there were those honorable members who objected to any deduction for charitable gifts; and then there were those who thought the exemption was not low enough. The two forces joined for the excision of the whole paragraph. </para>

            <para>- The main objection appears to be as to the difficulty of satisfying the Taxation Commissioner with respect to the verification of donations, because, in country districts, for example, many working men do their bit towards the upkeep of country hospitals by paying their half-crowns into the funds. Those persons, in many instances, come within the ambit of taxation. The idea has been to fix a minimum, which would be easy of verification by the taxation officials; and that is why I have proposed that the sum should be &#163;5. The main objection comes, however, from quite a new school of thought within this chamber.&#39; I refer to those honorable members who say, &#34; Why grant any remission of income taxation at all?&#34; </para>

        <para>I may say that I have had experience upon this subject. We introduced an amendment of this kind into the Victorian income tax laws many years ago. It was the first of the nature in Australia; and I assure honorable members that it had a pronouncedly harmful effect upon contributions to charitable institutions. The Crown thereupon took the attitude that in granting deductions for donations of that kind it could afford to lose the revenue providing that the destination of the money was the coffers of the charitable institutions of the State. If that held good at that time, it is even more emphasized to-day. Charities are having a very bad time with respect to their funds. State revenues, if they have not been depleted altogether, are, at any rate, shrinking. The incomes of private individuals are having more and more demands made upon them for patriotic purposes. Altogether, honorable members should not resist the proposal of the Government. From the stand.-point nf expediency it has been found advisable, because it has acted as an incentive, inducing people to give more generously to charitable institutions. I hope, therefore, that the amendment before the &#39;Committee will be considered in this spirit, and that honorable members will accept the suggested  amendment with the amendment I have made. </para>

            <para>- I think that if exemptions are to be allowed, the poorer man, who may be able to contribute a guinea to charitable institutions, should be in exactly the same position as the man who gives a donation of &#163;5. Let me take the case of a member of Parliament as an illustration. We all know that, in some of the large country constituencies, with a number  of hospitals and other charitable institutions, the ordinary member could not afford to put down his <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> here and &#163;5 there all round, but he could give a guinea here and a guinea there and thus spread over the whole of his constituency a very wide charitable vote. </para>

            <para>- That may be so. For a long time I have held that our charitable institutions have not been on a proper basis, and I believe that in every State to-day there is in contemplation legislation which will have the effect of placing the burden of supporting these institutions upon the shoulders of the whole community. I regret to know that the position is not satisfactory with regard to them, but if I can get another member to call for a division with me I shall vote against the proposal of the Treasurer, because I think it will have the effect merely of wiping out one system and putting in its place something worse. </para>

          <para>.- The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has, in my judgment, put his finger on the value of * the concession which the Act allows by pointing out that if funds are not raised voluntarily, there will be an obligation on the Commonwealth and States for the support of the funds of institutions referred to. In the many public appeals that I have made, I have found it was a great incentive to the people when I was able to say that no tax would be levied on the amount of gifts. There is another reason for the proposal, namely, to influence, if possible, the man who is not in the habit of making contributions. Unfortunately, this class of man is to be found everywhere. He sits back and never assesses his <inline font-style="italic">own</inline> conscience as to what he owes to  our patriotic movements or war movements; but I am bound to say that, right throughout Wannon and Corangamite, there are very few of these men.I remember, however, that on one occasion, when I was. appealing to the people of one town to beat a neighbouring one which had raised &#163;475, and I wanted only a few more pounds, that, alalthough almost every man, woman, and child in the town had contributed, there was one, the wealthiest man in the whole community, from whom I could not get a &#34;bob.&#34; In a sense, this amendment will givea small relief to the generous giver, and the other man will have to make up a little more by way of taxation. I am sorry to know that, in . all of our taxation proposals, we have never yet been . able todevise a scheme which would particularly hit the man who will not give voluntarily tocharitable institutions.Some time ago, we did bring down a Bill imposing certain financial obligations on a section of the community; but it was so completely distorted in this House, that finally it took the shape of a bachelor tax - a proposal which was advocated <inline font-style="italic">on- more</inline> than one occasion by the ex-member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Sharpe).</inline> However, I do not want to pursue that subject further. I think the Committee would be well-advised , to accept the proposal submitted by the Treasurer. </para>

          <para>.- It seems to me a remarkable argument that we are going to inspire gifts to the charitable institutions by&#39; granting exemption from income tax upon the amount fixed by the Treasurer&#39;s amendment. If that reasoning were sound, then I say that the lower the amount is fixed the wider will be the inspiration to give. By the exemption from income tax on gifts to charities of over &#163;5, a comparatively small section of the community will be affected, but if exemption is made allowable in respect of gifts of &#163;11s., the field will be widened. </para>

            <para>-  I say that the proposal will grant relief to the man least entitled to it, and I point out that the charitable institutions of this country do not derive their revenue so much from large donations as from a large number of small givers. It is this multitude of donations . which is so much to be desired, because it widens the constituency of charitable institutions, and awakens public interest in their welfare. I think that the Government&#39;s intention will probably be misunderstood, because it does appear to be a concession to the man who is able to give a big donation as against the man who is not able to give so generously. Probably few honorable members will be prepared to go, as far as I am, because I take practically the same view with regard to all patriotic donations. I know that many people would consider it contemptible to include their charitable donations in their income tax returns, in order to get relief from income taxation, but in this amendment an inducement is being held out to men who are able to contribute a larger amount to do that. I do not think men estimate the size of their contributions to charities by the extent of their prospective freedom from income tex. </para>

            <para>- I do not agree with it in that case either, but the patriotic funds are temporary and the others are permanent institutions, which will always appeal to us. The man who gives &#163;5 deserves the concession perhaps less in proportion than the man who can -give only &#163;1 ls.

          <para>. -  I am inclined to support the view of the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> as regards donations both to charitable institutions and patriotic funds. I do not believe one man out of a hundred thinks about a possible exemption from income tax when giving a charitable donation, but if the argument of the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> is correct, then the wider the field is extended the greater the benefit conferred. The only argument put forward by the Acting Prime Minister was that certain experience in Victoria went to show that donations to charitable institutions were multiplied because they were recognised by the Land Tax Commissioner. I am sorry &#187; that those people were not willing to trust the recording angel rather than the taxation authorities to keep the accounts for them. I hope the chastening effects of the war, together with that development of the higher virtues which privations always bring to nations as well as to individuals, will evolve a higher standard among Victorian taxpayers. I trust that their example, as quoted, will not set the standard for the rest of Australia. Let us at least show that we have the grace to be ashamed of ourselves, and not put forward selfish reasons to buttress people&#39;s promptings towards right-doing. </para>

          <para>.- The Acting Prime Minister has a large reservoir from which he can supply a great amount of plausibility, by means of which he seems able to electrify honorable members on the other side to such an extent that they break away from principles to which they originally adhered. I oppose this proposal, not on account of the plausibility of the Acting Prime Minister, but purely on principle. When the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> was speaking, the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond)</inline> made a remark about honorable members giving donations as a bribe. I may inform the Committee that I gave donations long before I ever sought a seat in this House. I was a prospective candidate fo!r over thirty years, for, in the opinion of a large number of people in New South Wales, I was fit to hold the position of a member of Parliament. However, I always refused their request. Every honorable member who has spoken on this question has tried to show the Acting Prime Minister that the person who gives a guinea may be just as deserving of the concession as the person who gives &#163;5, and yet will get no exemption from taxation. I do not think the Acting Prime Minister will be very pleased with himself when he comes to review his decision on this .point, because there are many people in the community who continuously give small amounts to hospitals out of their small means purely for the sake of charity, while a large number of people who give larger donations have an ulterior motive. </para>

            <para>- The- Acting . Prime Minister&#39;s mind is very small on this matter, but I have a large and open mind. The public outside will view the question in much the same way as I do, because I do not think there should be any exemptions at all for donations of this kind. Any person who is in a position to give &#163;5 ought to do so without any other motive than that of pure charity. No reason has been put forward for increasing the amount from 21s., as proposed by the Senate, to &#163;5, other than what is running through the mind of the Acting Prime Minister; . butthere are people with bigger . minds, who cannot see that the alteration is going to be of any benefit. My view is that no taxation benefit should accrue to any one simply because he gives a donation to charity. An American once defined charity to me as the raising of &#163;1, taking 17s. 6d. for expenses, and giving the remaining halfcrown to charity. The Acting Prime Minister seems to think that this concession will make some people in the community more liberal, and there may, perhaps, be something in that point, especially in the case of those whose incomes are taxed on the higher scale. If the war goes on we may see our income tax as high as 10s. 6d. in the &#163;1, and, if that happens, a man who gives &#163;5 to charity and gets credit for it in his income tax schedule will really only have given about half. The Acting Prime Minister will be in accord with the mind of the people of Australia if he gives way to the arguments which have been advanced here today. We are advocating a sound principle, and, although sentiment is very good at times, Parliament should in all its actions be governed by some principle. The proposal to exempt only amounts of &#163;5 and over undoubtedly does an injustice to the man who can afford to give no more than &#163;11s. The Acting Prime Minister will be wise in his day and generation if he allows himself to be so swayed by argument as to accept the Senate&#39;s amendment, instead of sticking hard and fast to the ideas he has enunciated. </para>

          <para>.- The honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> asks for a principle. The principle has already been given by the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers),</inline> who showed that there is a per fectly natural desire on our part to equalize as far as possible the position of those people who have been in the habit of giving liberally to charitable and other institutions, as compared with other people with equal means who have consistently refused to give anything whatever. The Committee accepted that principle when it agreed to allow deductions from the taxable income for contributions for patriotic and war purposes. I want to put the point of view of hospitals, particularly country hospitals. They have performed, and are performing, magnificent service, and it is owing largely, I understand, to representations made by the managers of those institutions that the Senate has tried to replace in the Bill the provision which was struck out in this Chamber in a careless moment, and without real intention. I have pleasure in supporting either the Senate&#39;s amendment or that proposed by the Minister, entirely in the interests of the hospitals, and particularly the country hospitals, of Australia. </para>

          <para>. - This amendment by the Senate incorporates the provisions of proposed new sections 50a and 50b for which the Bill, as it left this House, provided.It practically contains nothing new to the provision passed by us; but it modifies in some respects the general effect and area of the original clause. The object of the amendment is to embrace the agency provision with the employer&#39;s provision, to which we &#39;agreed. The notice which honorable members - and particularly honorable members of the Opposition - asked should be given is now embodied in the amalgamated provision inserted by the Senate. I think it will be useful and workable, and will not inflict hardships on either employers or employees. It will enable recovery of the tax in certain cases where the whereabouts of the . taxpayer are difficult or impossible to ascertain. In such a case the responsibility of obeying the order of the Commissioner will be thrown, after due notice, upon the agent for the taxpayer, I move - </para>

        <para>Mr.CHARLTON.-I admit that; but I opposed the principle, and it was chiefly as the result of my opposition that the discussion took place. While this Amendment modifies, to a certain extent, the original provision, it is difficult to understand how an employer can be expected to locate a defaulting taxpayer when the Commissioner cannot. </para>

          <para>. -  That is not the procedure. The honorable member would be entitled to make these deductions from this amendment if he were not aware of what took place when this question was last considered by us.  I  showed then that what was already the practice of the Department would operate in cases of this kind. I pointed out that employers, under the present law, furnished lists of employees receiving over a certain amount per annum. The Commissioner, looking down these lists, sometimes sees the names of what appear to be <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> taxpayers. I promised, however, that, before taking any of the steps for which the clause provides, he  would  issue a notice requiring such persons, who were <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> taxpayers, to furnish returns. I said that when such a return was submitted, the Commissioner would assess the amount of tax payable, and that this machinery &#34;would then come into operation. If, on the other hand, after demand to send in such <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> return, default is still made, this provision will provide the Commissioner with a lever to secure the amount at which the taxpayer is assessed. That is the procedure followed in many  cases,  and it iwill facilitate the collection of the tax in a number of instances without duress or hardship to any individual. </para>

If the amendment read that -notice shall be sent to the employer of any person who is a defaulting taxpayer, pointing out that he is a defaulter, and requiring the employer to deduct from his wages the amount of the tax due, I could understand it; but the amendment, as it stands, does not provide for anything of the kind. It says that a copy of the notice shall be sent &#34; to the last known place of address of the taxpayer.&#34; </para>

          <para>. - This is one of five amendments to which  I  propose that we do not agree.  It  is not an absolutely vital matter, but it appears to me that the House of Representatives took the wiser course in providing minimum penalties  in  this Bill for the first time. The Department&#39;s view is that there should be minimum penalties fixed,  in  order to give an approximation to uniformity in the matter of penalties  in  minor cases.  In  one State a magistrate may  inflict a nominal fine of 5s. for some offence, whereas in another State the penalty for the same offence committed in exactly the same circumstances may be fixed at &#163;5. The Department has information showing that there is an extraordinary and inexplicable disparity in regard to penalties, probably arising out of the idiosyncrasies of magistrates throughout Australia. </para>

            <para>- I think it does. At any rate, the States are recognising it more and more by providing minimum and maximum penalties- In making provision for so wide an area as we have in Australia, it seems to me that magistrates, in adjudicating on cases of default, ought to be guided by the legislature as to the gravity of the offence. We provide a maximum to show how far he can go, and we consider that there ought to be a minimum, to show that he cannot go below a certain amount. In one provision of the Bill we have made the minimum &#163;2 and the maximum &#163;200, and in this particular case we made the minimum &#163;5 and the maximum &#163;50; and, as it is desirable to preserve some due relationship between the minimum and maximum penalties, I propose to amend the clause as it left this House by reducing the minimum penalty from &#163;5 to &#163;1. With that object in view, I move - </para>

        <para class="block">This clause, which deals with the penalty inflicted for a minor default, caused a good deal of debate in this Chamber. A large number of senators opposed it, and as there was no hope of carrying it, the Minister compromised by agreeing to delete it, and effect an amendment in clause 41, which would render a delinquent in the matter of lodging returns liable to a penalty of &#163;1, or 10 per cent, of the tax, whichever should happen to be the greater. </para>

If honorable members will really be serious about an amendment, and stick to it, they will get their way from the Government. The principle in the clause is a new one. I am afraid that if we attempt to insist that a magistrate must inflict some penalty, the provision will prove abortive. </para>

        <para>Honorable members will recollect that we had some difficulty in determining whether a man who does not wilfully make a false return shall be prosecuted. The Senate has <inline font-style="italic">taken</inline> the middle course of allowing a prosecution although the Department, may not be prepared to&#39; prove that the offence has been wilful, and to put the onus on the defendant to prove that he has acted through inadvertence, a fact which in most cases he will be able to show. The new clause has apparently been copied from the Industries Preservation Act. This is not, perhaps, a very desirable principle of legislation or jurisprudence, but in certain cases it has been found desirable, under the Customs Act, for instance, and the factory laws of the States. &#39;It is adopted in certain cases where the knowledge of the act and intention is more in the control of the defendant than of the prosecuting authorities. I think this amendment will protect the taxpayer who might have suffered under the stringency of the original provision. </para>

          <para>.- This is the first year of many in which there has been no export of apples from Australia. For many years past the Commonwealth has been exporting from. 1,000,000&#39; to 1,250,000 bushels of apples, but this year, owing to the lack of shipping space, there is- no outlet for the fruit. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> acting in conjunction with the Ministers of Agriculture in the applegrowing States, represented to the Imperial authorities that this industry was practically crippled, and offered to supply the Home Government with evaporated apples. The Imperial authorities agreed to take so many tons of evaporated apples at a price of 7d. per lb. Fifty pounds of apples are required to produce six pounds of evaporated fruit, and the fruit-growers throughout Australia represented to the Government that the price offered by the Imperial authorities was not sufficient to enable them to carry on their industry. The- Government, therefore, having regard to the position in which the fruitgrowers are placed through being unable to export, decided to assist the industry by offering a bonus of 10 per cent, on dried fruit. </para>

            <para>- If people choose to put their money into machinery for the evaporation of fruit, that is their concern. Already evaporating machinery has been erected, and I think hundreds of thousands of bushels of apples have been treated in Tasmania. Even with the assistance of the bonus, the price of &#39;7d. per pound will not pay the apple-growers. The last season has been for them the worst on record. Good apples were obtainable in the market at 3s. and 3s. 6d. per case. I believe that there is no precedent for such prices at this time of the year. The representatives of the applegrowing States asked the Prime Minister for some assistance for their industry, because they have been unable to export the untreated fruit, and because the price offered by the evaporators is so small, and the Government thought it necessary to give them some help, if only to the extent represented by the bounty. </para>

            <para>- Many growers in Tasmania have shipped apples to England year after year at a loss. Now and again they strike a fairly good market in Sydney at the end of a season, when they receive from 8s. to11s. per case, and that is what keeps them going. There are many who have sent fruit to London who have realized splendid prices, and yet the same fruit by a different shipment has brought a very poor price. </para>

            <para>- I believe that prior to leaving Australia the Prime Minister received a deputation from fruit-growers in Western Australia, who pointed out to him that they were at present seriously handicapped by freight to Melbourne and Sydney, which are their markets. I  understand that the Prime Minister consented that if their fruit did not realize a certain price the Treasurer would come to their assistance to the extent of 9d. per case, the difference in freight between Tasmania and Sydney and Fremantle and Sydney. But this Bill does not deal with that matter in any way. </para>

            <para>- All that I have to say with regard to this, proposition is that even if the bonus be agreed to the fruitgrowers will derive but very little assistance from it. The position is that the growers must evaporate their fruit or let it rot, because they cannot obtain shipping space. They are forced by the stress of circumstances to send it . to the evaporators at1s. 6d. per bushel, and the proposed, bounty of 10 per cent, on that will amount to a mere nothing. </para>

            <para>- That is so, because this training will, no doubt, be sought not only in Victoria, but throughout the Commonwealth. The honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falkiner),</inline> who knows all about this business, will recognise that if these men are engaged only in picking burrs out of wool and piece picking, they are not learning wool classing and wool sorting. </para>

            <para>- It is quite possible that, from lack of knowledge of the business, they have not accurately explained what they are doing. They feel that advantage is being taken of them, because they are doing work for which they are not paid, by the company, which would have to be done by ordinary tradesmen if they were not employed. At the same time, they are not learning anything. </para>

            <para>- I wish now to refer to the report of the Inter-State Commission upon the question of fixing meat prices. We have been told that Cabinet will meet to-morrow morning, when it will probably arrive at a decision on this matter. But it must not be forgotten that the question of the fixation of the prices of meat was referred to the Inter-State Commission on the9th August last year, and that on the 3rd October of that year the Inter-State Commission furnished their first report dealing with prices in Victoria. On the 20th December of the same year Messrs. Piddington, Swinburne, and Mills made a report upon it, dealing with New South Wales and Queensland. Yet these reports were not made available until the 25th April of the present year. Now, there is a feeling abroad that this all-important question is being utterly lost sight of by the Government. It will be recollected that at the inquiry conducted in New South Wales a very strong Bar, consisting of eight or ten members, represented the interests of those persons who are concerned in keeping up the prices of meat, whilst the consumers were not represented at all. The people feel keenly upon this matter, and I ask the Postmaster-General to urge upon the Acting Prime Minister the necessity for early action being taken by the Government, particularly in view of the present extraordinarily high prices of meat. As a matter of fact, the report of the Inter-State Commission conclusively proves that to-day the meat producers are receiving &#163;27,000,000 per annum more than they would receive if they were obtaining pre-war prices. </para>

          <para>.- I think that the first matter referred, to by the Leader of the Opposition is worthy of prompt attention. The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> and myself have been interviewed by several of the returned soldiers who are employed in this city by the Australian Estates and Mortgage Company. In two instances the men have been station workers for most of their lives, and they thought that the present afforded them a splendid opportunity of learning wool sorting and wool classing. But they say that they are only being employed in picking burrs out of the wool. I trust that something will be done for them. </para>

        <para>Dr.MALONEY. - But, under existing conditions, the men are not receiving a dog&#39;s show. Is it worth while employing men for eight hours a day to pick burra out ofwool? I would further point out that these returned soldiers are only receiving 42s. per week, less their pension of 15s. - in other words, 27s. per week. I do not think they should be kept upon their feet for eight hours a day, especially in view of the fact that the majority of them have been wounded. </para>
