                        <para>- The regulation seems not. to affect the matter which the honorable member has in mind, namely, what censorship regulations under the War Precautions Act should stand. This regulation is merely an alteration of practice in regard to proof of service. It merely says that instead of it being necessary to serve a notice on three persons connected with a printing office, service on any one of them will be effective. </para>

He had a considerable length of time in which to frame  his  list of suggestions, but I have not had half an hour since that list was received to give attention to it. However, the Acting Attorney-General is looking into the matter, and we shall let the House know as soon as possible the result of our investigation. </para>

I was not a member of the Conference, but, as I read the report, I gather that the procedure adopted was as follows :  - Objections were lodged by those who may be regarded as representatives of the Official Labour party at the Conference to certain practices and regulations which they claimed to be hindrances to recruiting. The representatives of the Government, headed by the Prime Minister, considered those representations and gave their answers, showing what the Government were prepared to do. There was a great desire on the part of the Government to conclude the Conference with an amiable contract, but that was not secured. In the mean time, Ministers, in the utmost good faith, are going on with their part of the bargain, and they propose to appeal to those who are responsible for the movement which is represented by honorable members opposite to fulfil in the same good spirit their undertakings or obligations, moral or otherwise. </para>

At the present time, the Minister in charge of shipbuilding is dealing with a proposition regarding the coal trade ; and, if his scheme is accomplished, it will mean a more regular distribution of work in given collieries. I hope that this may be achieved as a result of the conferences that are to follow shortly. </para>

                        <para>- Order ! It is not only desirable, but very essential, that I should hear questions which are submitted without notice; but it is impossible for me to hear some owing to audible conversations and interchanges across the chamber. There is also growing up among honorable members generally a habit of interjecting a reply as soon as an honorable member rises to ask a question of a Minister. I ask honorable members to cease this practice, and allow proceedings to be conducted in a manner which is more in accord with the dignity of the House and the rules which govern its procedure. </para>

I have one case where a cablegram left london on 22nd March, and arrived at Nanango, Queensland, in my electorate, on the 11th May, and a letter confirming despatch of the cable reached its destination the same day. I have had several cases of this kind brought under my notice, in one of which it took nearly three months to transmit a cable to the Commonwealth Bank, London, authorizing payment of &#163;30 to a wounded soldier. </para>

                            <para>- On a recent occasion I answered a similar question, to the effect that the Defence Department has no control over the sending of cables. That rests with the cable companies, who explain that the delays are due to pressure of business. I shall, however, undertake to see what can be done in the way of expediting cablegrams to and from soldiers. </para>

If Ministers generally were to reply to every newspaper comment upon their utterances they would have very little time for anything else. The article I read with my customary haste, and I know that the writer was guessing with regard to certain statements I had made, and, in order to furnish pabulum for the article, had guessed wrongly. I have no occasion to reconcile either of the statements, because they are not mutually conflicting. </para>

                        <para>A consignment of 250 chests of tea from Hong Kong, which arrived in November, 1916, was found upon examination not to comply with the standard prescribed by the Customs regulations, in that it was deficient in aqueous extract. The goods were accordingly seized as forfeited. On 6th December, 1916, a request was made for permission to re-export the tea to Russia. As this particular shipment appeared to be deserving of somewhat more lenient treatment than some of the previous shipments dealt with by the Department, and also in view of the extreme desirability of avoiding economic waste, the Comptroller-General, on 7th March, 1917, decided to permit . the re-shipment of the tea to Russia. At a later stage permission was given for exportation to the United States of America, it having been shown that tea of similar quality had been admitted into that country as being of the standard required. Shipment was effected in February, 1918. The delay in exporting the goods was due to inability to obtain space on vessels. </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>Are the Ministry aware that the Defence Department are discharging members of the Australian Imperial Force who have lost their limbs at the Front before the men have been fitted with artificial limbs? That is not the practice in England. There, men are not discharged until they are supplied with artificial limbs. Will the Government undertake to see that no man who requires an artificial limb is discharged from the Australian Imperial Force until he has been fitted with one? </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>The answer to the honorable member&#39;s question is as follows : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>In some instances men who have lost a limb are discharged from the service before they have been fitted with an artificial replacement. </para>
                        <para class="block">In all cases returned wounded men are discharged not later than six months from date of arrival from overseas, when they are placed on pension &#39;if necessary. All amputation cases are placed on pension. The provision of an artificial limb is made as soon as the amputation stump is ready to receive it and the limb can be provided. It is not proposed to extend the period of six months referred to above, the adopted procedure having been found to work well in practice. Further, I am advised that renewals and repairs are provided by the Repatriation Department, which utilizes the services of private limb makers until such time as the Commonwealth Limb Factory is in a position to supply all requirements with reasonable promptness. </para>
                        <para>Directly a man is discharged, whether he has been fitted with a limb or not, he is entitled to the benefits of the Repatriation Scheme, which provides sustenance until the applicant has been given reasonable facilities for re-establishment. </para>

                        <para>.- I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> with the sentiments expressed by whom I am entirely in accord. The honorable gentleman has taken this course, not with the object of holding up the Government to public ridicule, but to protect the young male population of Australia. After the amendment had been discussed for some time, the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> announced that the whole question was to be considered at a meeting of the Cabinet this morning. It is singular that the Government should not have made that announcement until the last moment. Honorable members opposite assert that they are opposed to any system that would enable the child population of Australia to break away from parental control, but they plead that they cannot support this amendment since its adoption would prevent the Government from raising the loan of &#163;80.000,000 to be authorized by the Bill. There is no justification for that plea. The amendment could be carried without interfering in the least with the desire of the Government to pass this War Loan Bill. I am confident that if any honorable member opposite had a boy of eighteen who desired to enlist, he would not allow him to do so at that age, nor would he compel him to enlist against his will. I do not know whether the Government intend to propose any modification of the system under which it is no longer necessary for youths between eighteen and twenty-one years, of age to obtain the consent of their parents to their enlistment; but we shall not be satisfied with anything less than its complete withdrawal. It would be far less harmful to the community to permit men over fifty years to enlist than it is to allow these lads to go to the Front without their parents&#39; consent. A youth of eighteen or nineteen years of age is. physically unfit to bear the strain of active service. He is not sufficiently developed to be able successfully to undergo the hardships associated with actual warfare. If we have reached a stage when Great Britain and its Allies are dependent upon the child population of Australia to pull them out of the mire, then it is nearly time that some one in authority cried, &#34; Stop the war.&#34; </para>

                    <para>One aspect of this question which must not be overlooked is the fact that there is a very serious possibility of these lads not being able to bear the strain of hospital treatment. Should any of them be seriously injured or wounded, there is every reason to believe that many of them would not be sufficiently developed - would not have the heart - to carry them through a severe operation. That, in itself, is another serious objection to the Government&#39;s proposal. No one can object to youths of eighteen or nineteen being allowed to enlist with the consent of their parents ; but when it is proposed that they shall be free, to enlist without such consent the position is altogether different. Many boys of eighteen would be glad to break away from the control of their parents, and to enlist under any condition. At no time in life is a youth more in need of the advice and guidance of his parents than when he is between eighteen and twenty-one years of age, and if our lads be free from all parental restraint in this regard, there is a possibility of their being led into the greatest of temptations. I do not say that will happen in every case, but in many instances it will, and the training which their parents have given them will be thrown to the winds. </para>
                    <para>After the war had been going on for two years, Germany found it necessary to call up lads of eighteen, and to that action the people of our Empire took very serious exception. It was said that Germany was murdering its young population by putting such boys in the firing line. But while we condemned as brutal this action on their part, we are now proposing to do the same thing. Parents will not be content to allow their boys to be enticed away by any military inducement, and they will seek the first opportunity of giving practical expression to their views. I have heard of cases where mothers are sore afraid that this decision on the part of the Government will lead to their boys of eighteen disregarding parental control. It is, to say the least, remarkable that this, of all Governments, should have come to the conclusion that, while a lad of eighteen is not sufficiently developed to be intrusted with the franchise, he is well enough developed to shoulder a rifle, and to protect those who are far more capable of fighting than he is. If lads are permitted to enlist at the age of eighteen, they will break down in the firing line. They may stand the strain of training and transport, but they cannot stand the strain of actual warfare, because their hearts are not sufficiently developed, and their physique is not good enough. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to deal with this matter without bias. I do not say that no one should leave Australia to fight for the British Empire. I have never attempted to prevent any person from enlisting, and, under the voluntary system, I would give encouragement to any one who deemed it his duty to go. But I would not encourage a lad of eighteen to enlist, and I take the gravest exception to the offering of inducements to such lads to leave their homes to go to the war. The position of parents should receive the gravest consideration. Many parents have got their eldest sons at the war, and they do not wish to lose their whole family by sending away the lads of eighteen or nineteen years of age still at home. When all the sons have gone, the happiness of a home vanishes, and the pleasure of the parents in their home life disappears. Recruiting has been very successful during the past two or three weeks, for which we must give credit to the strenuous efforts of the Minister for Recruiting. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. If, however, we continue to offer inducements to youths of eighteen, the number of volunteers will decrease, because parents will be embittered against the recruiting movement. At the present time there is a scarcity of agricultural labour in the. country, and lads who are not capable of shouldering a rifle can take the place of absent agricultural workers. We cannot afford to dispense with the services of all who are accustomed to farm life. Then, again, there are scores of lads of eighteen who are apprentices, their parents having incurred considerable expense in giving them the opportunity to learn a trade. If they are enticed from the factory Or workshop before they have served their articles, the money of the parents will have been spent in vain. Under the present arrangements, however, lads of. eighteen can leave their workshops, and go straight to the recruiting officer. They know that if they do so their fathers can say nothing to them. In many cases when lads of eighteen or twenty have been wounded they have died of a broken heart, crying for their parents. I do not say that all of them would do that, because the average Australian does not cry for anything, but there are lighthearted lads who, finding that they have left the shores of Australia and the parental home, practically die of a broken heart. Many of these lads have never been away from home in their lives before, and the new life which they are called on to lead is wholly strange to them, and they cannot stand the strain of it. Nothing has been said to show that the enlistment of lads between the ages of eighteen and nineteen will serve the interests of the Empire. Indeed, the Empire would be better without them as soldiers. The figures show that during the past two or three weeks the recruits offering have been numerous enough to make it unnecessary to take lads under the age of twenty-one years. The Government might, perhaps, take lads into camp and keep them there until they became twenty-one years of age, if they wished to become soldiers; but even in a camp a boy is away from parental control, and cannot benefit by the advice of his parents, and it is to lads of eighteen and nineteen years of age that parental control and advice are most valuable. At that period lads are mostly easily led into temptation. A young man of twenty-one or twenty-two is not so easily taken into bad company. It is a deplorable thing that boys should be asked to shoulder a rifle while robust men remain behind. </para>

                            <para>- There are few men in this House who are not better able than lads of eighteen to shoulder a rifle. One or two of them may have reached the time of senile decay, but most of them are fitter than lads of eighteen. Yet they sit back and offer inducements to lads of eighteen to enlist. The man of fifty or fifty-five, and even the man of sixty, is better able to fight than the lad of eighteen. The older man goes on a platform and says, &#34;I would to God that I were only twenty-one years of age,&#34; but in his heart he is glad that he is over fifty. That has been the attitude of honorable members opposite since the beginning of the war. </para>

                            <para>- They have done it, and they are doing it to-day. At the same time they are asking us to assist recruiting to the fullest possible extent. Honorable members on this side of the House have done considerably more in many instances than honorable members opposite in the matter of recruiting. We have never shirked our responsibility in regard to the war. We are just as anxious to see Great Britain come out of the war victorious, and to see the war brought to a speedy and most effective settlement, as are honorable members opposite. We have done everything possible to advance the interests of Great Britain, but we will not suffer any indignity or injustice to be cast upon the parents of Australian youths, nor, if it can be avoided, will we permit those youths to be offered inducements to break away from their parental control. When this amendment is put to the vote honorable members opposite will say, &#34; We cannot vote for it, because we need the &#163;80,000,000;&#34; but there is nothing in the world to stop them getting the money. There is not one honorable member on the Government side of the House who would consent to his own child enlisting at eighteen years of age. </para>

                            <para>- Then if honorable members will not compel their sous to enlist at eighteen years of age, why should they offer an inducement to children to enlist at that age? They know very well that these children cannot successfully carry out the work that they would have to perform. If one man&#39;s child has enlisted at eighteen years of age - and unfortunately many have paid the supreme sacrifice - it is not a sufficient guarantee that the child of another parent should enlist at that age. If it is a good proposition to enlist these lads, why did <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine make the astounding statement that under no circumstances would he permit a child under the age of twenty-one years to go into camp for the purpose of training or enlisting for service overseas. Honorable members know well that the people of Australia will not tolerate an iniquitous regulation which will permit children to break away from their homes at the age of eighteen years, and I cannot understand why the Government have even attempted to introduce it. Possibly they had a certain motive for their action, but they must see now that the regulation is not acceptable to the people, and I sincerely hope that they will withdraw it in the very near future. If they do not do so there will be serious trouble. I do not know what form that trouble will take. </para>

                            <para>- I would. If he were twenty-one years of age, I would assist him if he desired to do so; but I would prevent him from enlisting before he &#39;reached that age, and I would deem it a most iniquitous law that would permit him to do it, despite my attempt to prevent him. I protest against the introduction of any system that will deprive parents of rights  which they have enjoyed since the establishment of a White Australia. Never previously in the history of this country have the people been confronted with such an iniquitous regulation. Parents have always held&#39; it as a sacred right that they can advise their children until they attain the age of twenty-one years. They have always been responsible for the actions of their children who are not twenty-one years of age, but now we find that their responsibility is wiped out of existence, and the moment a child reaches the age of eighteen years he is to become his own master, and do as he likes. No matter what advice his parents may tender to him, he can refuse to obey their will and their wishes. A child of eighteen years of age may take exception to certain advice tendered to him by his parents, and. although at the time he may not have had the slightest intention of enlisting, he can now turn round, and say to the parents, &#34; I do not want your advice. I will enlist, and go off to the military camp, and you will no longer be my bosses.&#34; If this regulation continues in force, there will be disruption from one end of Australia to the other, and recruiting will not continue to flourish as it is now doing. Possibly the interest displayed by the people of Australia in regard to the war will diminish to some extent. I hope that such will not be the case, but those parents whose sons will enlist without their consent must display hostility towards the rules and regulations laid down by the Defence Department. I hope that the amendment will be carried. </para>

                            <para>- That was a statement which originated with Captain Burkett, and has found support from honorable members opposite. On the other hand, the honorable member for Macquarie says that we do not require this new system, because the recruiting figures are quite good enough without these youths. Both statements cannot be true. I draw the attention of the honorable member for Macquarie, who has been responsible for the use of the last illustration, to the two statements in order that he may see that he has not solved the problem at all, be cause he collides violently with some of his colleagues opposite who hold the opposite view.&#34; </para>

                    <para>I wish to explain very briefly to the House why the Government felt obliged to take the steps which it has taken, and before I sit down I wish to explain to what stage the Government has arrived as a result of its deliberations on the matter. It is perfectly plain from proofs beyond any doubt whatever that reinforcements of a minimum amount per month are needed for our own Armies abroad. The examination by the Chief Justice that was recently undertaken has sent to rest the number of phases of disputed figures that used to confront us at every point, and I think now we meet on common ground. Whether we believe in the war or not, so long as our troops are there and take part in any offensive, in all human probability we can assess the minimum number required for a given month or several months. </para>

                            <para>- Provided our troops are maintained in the same number of brigades and battalions as were formed when the war started. I do not wish to worry honorable members with any analysis of past problems as to whether so many men are required per month or not, but, having determined that there is an irreducible minimum of men required to maintain our divisions at their fighting strength, it is perfectly plain that we have to secure those numbers. Many a time and oft, as honorable members could see if they had an opportunity of perusing some of the correspondence and cables that have passed between Australia and Great Britain, the British war authorities have drawn attention to, as it is their bounden duty to do, and stressed, the urgency of keeping up the numbers necessary to maintain our divisions at their full fighting strength. We know that several battalions have already been &#34; scrapped,&#34; to put it plainly. They have been withdrawn from brigades in order to form reinforcements of other battalions; and we are also informed - and I ask the House to take this as authentic, and, if any honorable member doubts it, to apply to me for information privately - that further withdrawals of battalions are in contemplation. These are the influences that induced the Government,in view of the Recruiting Conference of  His Excellency  the Governor-General, to consider the necessity for all the activity we could bring to bear in order to secure sufficient recruits. The position to us is serious, and it is our duty to act; and in acting we have apparently come into collision with the views of a large number of people in the community. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to make it as plain as I can - and the facts are checkable by honorable members - that it has been almost the immemorial practice for Great Britain, in recruiting for the regular Army, to take boys of eighteen without parental consent. Long before this or any recent war, boys of eighteen could enter the British Army, and certain legal rights were given to them as majors, while certain other rights, for purely legal purposes, were retained by the parents. That was the old recruiting system; and all through this war, both before and after conscription, it has been the British practice. Here, in one of the Dominions which is fighting the man power problem in quite its own way - probably a wrong way, but we have to do it - we have followed the lead of the mother of the nation from whose loins we came. When we are accused of endeavouring to destroy parental responsibility and control, I ask honorable members to recollect that probably parental control is stronger in the land from which our kinsmen came than in any part of the world. </para>

                            <para>- That interjection is rather too recondite for me. At any rate, the English have a way of hiding their grief in a way not observed in other nations. Another view which the Defence Department felt bound to stress for the consideration of the Government was that all through the war there have been young men enlisting under the age of twenty-one, in some cases lying, in a generous spirit of patriotism, about their parents&#39; consent. These young men have gone into camp, and have frequently been taken away by indignant parents after months of training, all the time devoted to them thus being wasted. . This has proved a vast expense, and of no good really to the parents, to the home, or the enlisted soldiers. On one occasion a boy enlisted four times, and remained in camp until almost the maximum time, when he was taken away by his father. On inquiry, there was reasonable ground to believe that the father, who was not as patriotic as his son, had allowed this to be done because the boy&#39;s wages were bigger in camp than they were outside, and the father was feeding on them. The boy desired to enlist and go abroad, and yet at the last moment the parent exercised his control, and withdrew him. </para>

This was given to me by the Defence Department as, perhaps, the most conspicuous case. Another instance was that of a family of two sons, one over the age of twenty-one, who had offered for service and been rejected, the other eighteen years and seven months old. This latter youth, who was employed at fair wages, enlisted, but he was withdrawn by the father on the plea that the latter desired to enjoy the benefit of the boy&#39;s earnings, the boy having no power to serve against the decision of his father. Close inquiries were made into the circumstances of the family, and it was found that the father was in steady employment, with no financial difficulties, and the Defence Department regarded the treatment of the son by the father as improper, and hurtful to the true recruiting spirit. </para>

                    <para>I have given the facts as to the British practice, and as to the Australian tendency that induced the Government to arrive at its- decision. I speak very plainly when I say that representations against the proposal have come to the Government from men and women in all quarters, who are helpful to the nation&#39;s cause, and anxious to help it. We realize as well as anybody could that we are driven back to the voluntary system, and must operate it as our only system. We are doing so in the best spirit; but it cannot thrive unless it has the general concurrence of the people. If in its operation we make an error of judgment, or go further in stressing the needs of the war than the people themselves are prepared to approve, voluntary recruiting will inevitably be prejudiced. As we have said unmistakably to the people at the Recruiting Conference and elsewhere, we propose to operate this system as far as possible, and the Government would be wanting in its sense of responsibility if it did not take into account representations that indicate a strong feeling among the people. </para>
                    <para>This very week, on Tuesday and today, the Government have considered the matter, having before it all the facts the Defence authorities have at their disposal, and we have come to the conclusion that we ought to modify the system in three distinct respects. I ask honorable members on both sides to notice what these modifications are. First of all, we propose that, instead of allowing young men to enlist without parental consent at eighteen, they shall not be able to do so until they are nineteen. Then, instead of keeping the enlisted soldier out of camp for six months, as originally proposed, until he has attained the age of eighteen and a half, he may, on enlistment, go straight into camp. The question then arises as to how soon such a soldier is likely to reach the firing line, and, in regard to that, we are dependent to a great extent on the records of the Defence Department. As honorable members know, shipping is difficult and slow, and the whole desire of the Commanders-in-Chief of the Army is to get our men into training elsewhere as soon as possible, so that they may learn modern methods. In this way many months sometimes may elapse before men are shipped; but, assuming that two months&#39; training takes place before the men are sent away after recruiting, and assuming, which is a low average, that it bakes them two months to reach their camp at the other end of the world, there are inevitably seven to eight months&#39; training, which under the conditions of modern warfare- </para>

                    <para>The other condition which I desire to explain is that where there are two or more sons in a family, and one of those sons is now serving with the Australian Imperial Force, while the other is under age, between nineteen and twenty-one - we do not propose to accept the remaining son without parental consent. Where the family has made its offering in fair proportion, we retain the condition of consent. If there are three sons, and two are serving, then parental consent will be necessary in the case of the remaining one. </para>
                    <para>There is another proposal which, perhaps, honorable members may consider as going too far. We make it, however, with the object of showing that the military authority itself, against which so many people in the community seem to be turning, is not to decide some of the issues connected with the matter. Where, subject to these&#39; two other arrangements, a person between the ages of nineteen and twenty-one enlists without parental consent, the parents may lodge with the District Commandant within ten days of the soldier entering camp, an objection, with the grounds thereof. The objection will be sent to the State Recruiting Committee for decision, and if the Committee upholds it on any of the grounds submitted, the man concerned will not be trained without the consent of the parents. </para>
                    <para>These are the three amendments which, we think, will bring the system into line with the sentiment of the people and aid recruiting. We must get recruits, or fail in our war aims. I was glad to hear from the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nicholls)</inline> that he is not against obtaining recruits, although I admit that his speech would lead one to believe that his attitude has been very negative. True, he has not adopted anything like the militant attitude against the war that some honorable members opposite have attempted, and. his spirit is also that of his leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor.</inline> The latter gentleman has stood on the platform scores of times all through the war, very often with men like myself, and has strongly appealed to that impulse of duty and patriotism which young men should feel. </para>

                            <para>- I think that is right; at any rate, he has done his full share, and any one who questions that statement will receive contradiction from the Government. That is the spirit in which I ask honorable members to accept the proposals of the Government. There is still a little of that feeling which was visible for months when the Prime Minister wass in charge. Why should there be, after the Conference that was held? The Government is depending on the spirit which actuates the more moderate and sensible amongst honorable members opposite. We have no undertaking of co-operation from any of those gentlemen, but we go on hoping that they will do as the Government are doing. If they do, I have no doubt the people will see that, in the matter of recruiting, there is unity in Australia, and that the old division has been wiped out for the purposes of the war. If that spirit continues to actuate us we can keep our Army reinforced - if not, we cannot do so. Having been refused the right to adopt any other method, the Government loyally accepted the present one. I ask honorable members not to make this a party question. I have not endeavoured to do so. All the representations that have come to me from members of this House have been treated regardless of party, and, if possible, I desire the whole question to be dealt with absolutely on a non-party basis. I have been particularly careful - I do not say this in my own praise, but to emphasize the attitude of the Government - not to say one word since the Conference, that might lead to a recrudescence of the antipathies and antagonisms which absolutely disfigured our attitude in the middle distance of the war. If honorable members opposite will grip that point of view, and help the Government, I feel certain that, in the absence of further political differences, we shall be able to get sufficient recruits by the voluntary method. </para>

                        <para>.We all feel a degree of satisfaction after hearing the announcement that the Government have modified to some extent their policy in regard to the enlistment of lads between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one years. We give the Government credit for the alteration they have made, but, at the same time, their concession will not, in my opinion, be satisfactory to the people of Australia. We all agree that recruiting is a question above party considerations. It is a matter that affects, not only all Australia, but the whole of the Allies, and in those circumstances we are all anxious to do what is best for the cause we espouse. I quite realize the position in which the Government are placed. The Acting Prime Minister has said that the Government have received advice from the War Office to the effect that certain battalions are being broken up for the purpose of reinforcing other battalions. That is a very serious development, but, though I am anxious to see the strength of our Forces at the Front fully maintained, I feel that I would be lacking in my duty if I were to agree to deprive parents of the right of veto in regard to the enlistment of lads under twenty-one years of age. Up till the present, parental consent for the enlistment of minors has been necessary, and the Acting Prime Minister has stated that some people have taken advantage of that condition. He mentioned a case of a father who was opposed to the war, but permitted his lad to remain in camp until he was nearly twenty-one years of age, because he was getting more pay as a soldier than he received in his previous employment. Then his parent refused his consent. Any man guilty of such an action is unworthy to be an Australian citizen. That case was probably exceptional; I believe there are few parents who would  &#39; sponge &#39; &#39; on the Commonwealth to that extent. But the occurrence of such cases does not justify us in adopting a policy which will not meet with the approval of Australian fathers and mothers generally. The Government&#39;s amended proposals are an improvement, because in future a lad must be nineteen years of age before he is enlisted without the consent of his parents. The Acting Prime Minister has said that in the event of him being two months in camp in Australia, two months on the voyage, and eight months in camp in Europe, he would be twenty years of age before he entered the firing line. It is a fact, however, that many lads have reached the firing line in a much shorter time than twelve months, and that is just as likely to occur in the future. There may be some men whom the authorities consider sufficiently trained after three months to take their places in the firing line, and if there was an urgent need for reinforcements they would not hesitate to send them to the Front. It is quite possible that some men may reach the firing line within five or six months of enlistment. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>But even if it be true that they will not reach the Front before they are twenty years of age, I contend, despite my strong desire to reinforce our boys, that that age is too young. I have held that view from the commencement of the war. One upon whose judgment I place great reliance wrote to me from the Front saying, &#34;Whatever yon, as a representative man, do, be sure not to allow lads under twenty-one years of age to come here. Many young fellows have already failed because they are physically unable to do the work that is required of them.&#34; We know that many young men under twenty-one years of age failed on some of the marches in Egypt during the hot weather. Those incidents prove that those men had not a sufficiently developed physique to enable them to withstand the hardships of the campaign. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The gentleman whom I have already quoted said that many men over thirty-six years of age, like the boys under twenty-one years of age, were unable to stand the strain. They developed certain troubles, and, in consequence, were returned to Australia. We know that many men between the ages of forty and forty-five years have been returned. Some of them never reached the Front. Others did arrive in France, but the severity of the winter before last brought on rheumatism and other troubles, and rendered them&#39; unfit for further service. Some honorable members have had considerable trouble in regard to the pensions of such men, because it has been contended that they did not become incapacitated through military causes. Our past experiences should make us very careful, notwithstanding what the Acting Prime Minister has said regarding the British Government enlisting lads of from eighteen years upwards. We in Australia have not to follow any precedent. I hope we shall make our own precedents in matters of this kind. We have always realized that the young men and women of this country should be subject to parental control until they are twenty-one years of age. That principle is recognised in our legislation, and in many other ways. </para>

                    <para>Do not honorable members realize that lads between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one are often led away by a spirit of adventure? After hearing certain speeches, or reading war literature, they come to the conclusion that they would like to be at the Front, just us many boys who attend picture shows are carried away by some &#34; Deadwood Dick &#34; drama. They decide to take their future in their own hands, and they escape from parental control. That is not the best thing that can happen for the future of the lads, or of the Commonwealth. After all, the future of a man depends on the extent to which he has the advantage of sound parental control. Once he is removed from that influence no one can say what will happen to him. What need is there for us to take away from parents the right to give or withhold their consent to the enlistment of minors? The new policy will not make a great deal of difference to recruiting; it has not done so in the past. I say, unhesitatingly, that Captain Carmichael has done more to promote a revival of recruiting than has any other man in the Commonwealth. I wish to give him every credit for what he has done. The Governor-General&#39;s Conference has had good results; and the present Minister for .Recruiting <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Orchard)</inline> is doing valuable work. If we continue along the lines at present being followed, with a view to promoting a better feeling and understanding in the community, I have not the slightest doubt that we shall be able to get a large number of men for reinforcements without depriving parents of the control of their boys. </para>
                    <para>It may be said that already many young fellows under twenty-one years of age are serving at the Front. The answer is that, in those cases, the consent of the parents was given. After all, a mother knows more about her boy than does anybody else. She knows his constitutional strength or weakness; she knows the extent to which he is able to withstand cold weather ; and she is well able to judge whether he is strong enough to endure the rigours of a severe winter in France. A mother may refuse her consent, not because of any lack of patriotism, but because she feels that by allowing her son to go to the Front she would be doing something which will probably .prove detrimental to his future health, without helping the Empire, inasmuch as he might never be fit to render any service. By the time he reached Europe, he might develop sickness, and be returned to Australia, having involved the Commonwealth in considerable cost, without having given anything in return. Many mothers have consented to the enlistment of their boys under twenty-one years&#39; because they have known them to be sufficiently strong to endure the hardships of a campaign, and to efficiently discharge the duties of a soldier. I think the Government can do no better than abide by the judgment of the parents. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nicholls)</inline> referred to the position of apprentices. Many lads under twenty-one years of age are apprenticed to some trade, and if they are to be permitted, on reaching twenty years of age, to enlist without the consent of their parents, their apprenticeship will be broken. When they return after two or three years of open air life, . will they be likely to return to the trade which they were learning? Even if they are still inclined for it, they will have become men by that time, and having received a soldier&#39;s pay for some years they will not consent to complete their apprenticeship at possibly 15s. per week. In professions also are many lads whose parents have incurred considerable expense in connexion with their education or articles. Possibly the parents have had to pay a premium of &#163;100 to article lads to some profession for a term of five years. Having served for about two years, they may be getting 5s. a week, with the prospect of &#163;1 a week in the fifth year. If those lads enlist and return after two or three years, the difficulty then will be to get them to resume their studies. If they will not do that, the parents will have lost the money they have paid, and the lad&#39;s professional prospects will have been blighted. There are many reasons why lads between nineteen and twenty-one years of age should  not be permitted to judge for themselves. The decision ought to be left to the parents, a great majority of whom, I believe, if they think that the lad will be of service to his country without detriment to his health and future, will willingly give their consent. That has been our experience up to the present time. In those circumstances, why should we at this stage introduce a regulation to dispense with the preliminary consent of the  parents?  Honorable members will argue that the Government intend to permit parents to object within ten days of a lad&#39;s enlistment, but in many cases the parents will have no knowledge of what has happened, and will not be able to lodge any objection within the prescribed time. But even if they do know, and are able to object, within ten days, that objection would have to be dea&#39;lt with by the State War Council. In some cases, the Council may consider it valid, and allow the lad to be discharged; in others, it will&#39; decide that the reasons are inadequate, and refuse to grant discharges. We shall then have one set of parents saying, &#34; How is it that So-and-So&#39;s boys, who are no younger than ours, were discharged, while our boys have been compelled to go to the Front?&#34; Bad feeling is likely to be created in this way, and it certainly will not help recruiting. I believe, on the contrary, it will do considerable harm. A mother&#39;s feelings are easily hurt; and&#39; once the mothers of these lads of eighteen are roused by the action of the Government in permitting them to enlist without the consent of their parents, the movement will spread to the case of young men over twenty-one, and the result will be disastrous to recruiting. We have been working very, hard to put recruiting on a better level, and the position to-day is better than it was. We should be careful, therefore, to do nothing that will put a damper on the movement. It is unfortunate that so much trouble should have been created in the community because of certain differences of opinion; but since an effort has been made to smooth away those differences, I shall make no further reference to them. I repeat, however, that this matter demands the very closest attention. It is not a party question, and I, hope honorable members opposite will not treat it as such. The Government have certainly modified their original proposal, but to me it is still unsatisfactory; and it would be in the interests of the recruiting movement if the Government abandoned it altogether. Once the mothers understand that they are to have no control over their lads, so far as enlistment is concerned, we shall have public meetings all over the country to protest against the action of the Government, and immense harm will be done to the general principle of recruiting. </para>
                    <para>I want, now, to make a brief reference to the financial position. We are now asked to grant authority for the raising of a further loan of &#163;80,000,000. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> is acting wisely in making his arrangements early. To insure success, it is well that the people should have ample opportunity to subscribe; and from that point of view, therefore, the Treasurer is well advised in proposing to get his loan on the market as soon as possible. He is also to be commended for his decision that the income from this loan shall be liable to taxation. Had Parliament followed the advice offered by the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> who was then Treasurer, no part of the last loan would have been exempt from taxation. We have discovered, at last, that we have made a mistake; but for that mistake I am not going to find fault with any one. When we set out to raise our war loans locally, we did not know what were the financial possibilities of the Commonwealth. We were launching upon an unknown sea, and it was felt that it would be well to offer some special inducement to the people. We, consequently, determined that income from the first war loan should be free from taxation, and that system has since been followed. Up to the present time, the Government have received authority to raise &#163;168,000,000; and of that amount &#163;149,325,058 has been raised, leaving &#163;18,674,942 still to be raised under the existing authority. This Bill will give the Government authority to raise a further sum of &#163;80,000,000, and it is estimated that our war expenditure for next year will reach that amount. I venture to say that for the following year it will be considerably more, even if the war is soon brought to a close. When the war is over, we shall have to incur much expense in bringing our men back to Australia, and every week, by reason of the increased enlistments, will bring with it fresh demands upon the Treasury. The longer the war continues, the greater will be the cost; and, even if it ends shortly, we cannot hope to get away from the present rate of expenditure upon it for some two or three years. I anticipate that our war loan indebtedness will, at the very least, reach &#163;400,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- I think so. This is an enormous load for the Commonwealth to carry, but it is inescapable. It is imperative that we should be very careful in dealing with our finances, and, for  that reason alone, I think the Treasurer is justified in proposing that the income from investments in this loan shall be liable to taxation. Our total war loan debt is &#163;197,507,169, and the income derived by subscribers, taking the rate of interest at 4&#163; per cent., is &#163;8,880,000 per annum. That is a very big sum, and a tax of 6d. in the &#163;1 upon it - which would be a very moderate rate - would yield a revenue of &#163;220,000 per annum. &#34;We are losing that revenue, but we shall avoid further loss of the kind if, in the case of all future borrowings, we do away with the exemption from taxation. In connexion with the last loan, subscribers had the option of accepting 4&#163; per cent, free of taxation, or 5 per cent, without such an exemption. But, of the &#163;42,500,000 raised, only &#163;6,500,000 was taken up at the 5 per cent rate. There can be no doubt that that. &#163;6,500,000 was taken up by people who, if they pay income tax at all, come under the lowest rates, and that the bulk of those who put their money into the loan at 4&#163; per cent, are in receipt of high incomes, and would have had to pay a high rate of income tax had they not been exempt. We have thus lost a very considerable amount of revenue. </para>

                    <para>I have no time for those who are urging the repudiation of the agreement into which we have entered in regard to the exemption of previous war loans from taxation. Parliament, having solemnly entered into such an agreement, we must carry it out, irrespective of what the cost to the country may be. To do anything else would be to violate the honour of Parliament. As to the method of financing the war, I have a different view from that held by the Government; but I shall not refer to it to-day. The community is not going to be helped in the prosecution of the war by the encouragement of the feeling that there is a disposition on the part of. any section of the community to urge the repudiation of what has been done. That is a point that we need to emphasize. We have to finance the war, and money is just as essential to its prosecution as men are. That being so, we have a right to stand by the compact made, no matter what may be our view to-day as to the proper method of raising the money we require. </para>
                    <para>In addition to our &#39;war loan indebtedness, we owe the British Government &#163;30,560,000 for the maintenance of our troops. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> told us that he has informed the British Exchequer that in future he is going to promptly pay the amounts due to it under this heading. That seems to me a very big undertaking. I do not say that it should not have been given. I think it should have been, but I cannot see how we are going to give effect to it. It means that our present war expenditure of &#163;80,000,000 per annum will be increased by another &#163;10,000,000, and it is questionable whether we can raise that amount of money. The last loan was undoubtedly a huge success; it was double that of the previous loan, but even now we have only sufficient money in hand to meet the requirements of the next six months. </para>

The great bulk of the money we have been borrowing has gone into circulation here, and has consequently returned quickly into its usual channels, so that it has been soon made available for the next loan. But to the extent that we spend our money abroad we must diminish the amount available for local loans. I hope we shall succeed with our local borrowings. It is the duty of every man, at a time of national crisis, to put his money into the war loans,, and I have no time for the man who abstains from subscribing to a war loan because he is able to obtain a higher rate of interest in other directions. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Many persons availed themselves of the offer of the banks to advance money at a special rate of interest for investment in the loan. We have met that position by legislation, so far as we could. Probably most of those who could advance money under these circumstances have already done so. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. And probably we shall not .get as much money when next we float a loan from persons prepared to mortgage property to make advances. Those who have been patriotic enough to do that cannot do it a second time. Consequently, that source of revenue is a diminishing one. Where, then, are we to get what is required ? </para>

                            <para>- We need to get those who have made the deposits in the savings banks to subscribe- to the war loans. If they were ready to put all their money into the war loans, we should have over-subscription, but Parliament would always indemnify the Government for taking more than it had authority to borrow. It is to be hoped that those who have money will realize that it is necessary for them to lend it to the Government. If they do not lend it, they must expect heavier taxation. In any case, the taxation must increase. The Treasurer has told us that our interest bill is now over &#163;10,000,000 a year, and if within a couple of years we double our debt, it will be &#163;20,000,000 a year, which is as much as prior to the war we required for carrying on the affairs of the Commonwealth. On this reasoning the expenditure of the Commonwealth will be twice as much two years hence as it was before the war. We have lost a large source of revenue by exempting from income taxation the interest on earlier loans. That will not he done again, but we must seek ways and means for meeting our interest hill and sinking fund. My view1 is we shall have to increase the income taxation. J have  always  urged that the exemption should not be less than &#163;200, but there should be a substantial increase in the taxation on large incomes. </para>

                            <para>- It is to be remembered, however, that the cost of living is 33 r&#62;er cent, higher now than it was before the war began. Certainly the taxation should be heavier on incomes above a certain amount. It is not enough . to levy a tax of ls. 6d. or 2s. in the &#163;1 on incomes of &#163;800 or &#39;&#163;1,000; their taxation should be higher. Furthermore, our taxation law should be simplified. Very few persons can understand it, however carefully they may study the explanation and curves. </para>

Parents will complain that their boys are being taken away from their control whilst still under age. 1 hope, therefore, that further consideration will be given to the matter, and that before the debate concludes, Ministers will be able to see their way to allow things to remain as they were before the regulation was framed. </para>

                            <para>- My action then would have depended to some extent on the nature of the debate;. but, broadly speaking, I agree with honorable members opposite that parental control should not be weakened. However, they have not gone to work in the way that I think they should have done, and therefore, as a Government supporter who knows the absolute necessity of passing this War Loan Bill, I must vote against the amendment. </para>

                    <para>The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has put before us a set of very valuable figures, containing a great deal of information. It would not be my intention to traverse them now, even if I had the schedule before me. What has impressed itself on my mind is the enormous indebtedness of Australia, which amounts to something like &#163;609,000,000, taking Commonwealth and States obligations together. Under these circumstances it is almost criminal to contemplate the continuance of large expenditure on new works. I have never lent a kindly ear to the enticements of the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cook)</inline> regarding expenditure on Naval Bases. From many points of view Naval Bases must be regarded as necessary, but expenditure on them cannot be of any value during the war, unless the war is to outlast the longest calculations. Therefore, an effort should be made to reduce this expenditure. Wherever expenditure can be discontinued without interfering with the prosecution of the war, the Government should discontinue it until the piping times of peace come again. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The honorable &#39; member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> said that a solemn promise had been made by Australia regarding the finding of money for the prosecution of the war. A promise binding on the Commonwealth has been made in regard to the finding of both men and money. But while we are committed to voluntary effort for the finding of men, we resort to compulsion for the finding of money. Those who have money must contribute to the revenue, whether they wish to do so or not. Under the altered loan conditions, we have to see that those who have money have the position presented to them in terms which will induce them to subscribe. It must be made clear to the wealthy, and to others who have money which they should contribute to the war loans - many of these, unfortunately, have not yet contributed - that they must choose between two alternatives. Money must be obtained. We must carry this fight to a finish, and for that we require money. Therefore those in the community who have money must lend it to the Government. We should say to them, &#34; You must either contribute to the war loan, and receive a fair interest for your money, or foot the bill in the shape of taxation.&#34; I am satisfied that people, who have money and have not contributed to the war loan, would do so if this alternative were presented to them. If I had money available, it would be infinitely better for me to have war bonds in my possession than to pay a lump sum in the shape of taxation, and part with it for ever. The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has referred to the solemn pledge given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> that is, in regard to the last man and the last shilling. We cannot afford to lose this war. If we do, we lose everything which we prize most highly. </para>

                            <para>- I object to certain means which were adopted for raising money on the last war loan flotation. We must popularize our loans if we wish to make them a success, and in order to do that we must appeal to the most solid and best-thinking people in the community. If our loans do not commend themselves to the judgment of such people, they will be failures. But a method was adopted in connexion with the last loan to which serious objection was taken by a large section of the community, and I was one of a deputation representative of that section of the people which protested against the introduction of a lottery system of cash prizes for investors in the loan. The more we appeal for contributions in that way the more we shall be compelled to do so. Previously people were asked to lend their money from the highest and most patriotic motive, namely, for the good of the Empire; but now a certain number of people are asked to do so from selfish reasons. It is encouraging the gambling spirit to ask a man to put &#163;1 in with the chance of drawing out &#163;1,000. Before this debate concludes I hope that we shall have some statement from the Acting Prime Minister as to his intentions in this regard. If I had my way I would have a clause attached to this Bill which would render it impossible for the Treasurer to appeal for contributions in this way, because anything that tends to weaken the moral conception of the people is wrong. * </para>

                            <para>- I suggest that we should revert to the previous system of appealing to people to. subscribe to the loans on their merits, and not in the expectation of receiving cash prizes for their investments. Another objection to the system which has been adopted is that it is only available to large traders and mercantile people. The Leader of the Opposition will agree with me that if anything is of a commercial advantage to one section of the community, it should also be of equal advantage to those who are in a small way of business. In regard to the last loan, what was done was to go to large, well-known wealthy firms. </para>

The more we do this sort of thing, the more we shall be compelled to do it. Why should I put my money into a war loan on the conditions prescribed, which give me no possible advantage, while an appeal is made to other people to put their money into it under conditions which give them the possibility of securing a substantial cash advantage? It is a wrong principle to adopt, and it will operate against the success of our future loans. </para>

                            <para>- I condemn the system of Tattersall&#39;s altogether. , I have presented these views, &#39; not as my own, although they do represent my own, but as those of a very large section of people in the Commonwealth. I feel justified in saying that the persons who are to be relied upon to make the launching of a loan a success are those who have a higher conception of their duty to the Commonwealth and the Empire as a whole than to put their money into a loan with the hope of getting a cash advantage out of it. &#34;We ought to be able to finance the war without appealing to the lower feelings of the community - to selfishness, or to the desire for sordid gain. Of course, an appeal to such sentiments might enlarge the number of subscribers, but I question very much whether many people will be drawn in as subscribers in that way who would not otherwise be subscribers. However, I view it as a matter of urgent and of great importance. The war will not be completed until the people of the world arise to a higher conception of their moral obligations; yet here we are pandering to the gambling spirit of the community. I deprecate the running of spinning-jennies in our streets. It is a vicious method of raising money. The further we get away from that sort of thing, the more we shall elevate the race, and make it worthy. I hope that my remarks will be brought under the notice of the Treasurer, and that, in due course, some statement will be made which will satisfy honorable members that a system which is objectionable to thousands of people, and an offence to them, will not be continued in regard to future loans. These people did not ask that any steps should be taken in regard to the matter in connexion with the last loan. The system was in active operation when it came under their notice; but they immediately took steps to express their resentment, and ask that there should be an alteration in regard to future loans. On behalf of these people, I ask the Government to give some assurance that there shall be no further continuance of a system which is in itself an inherent evil, and which cannot possibly have any good effect on the community at large. </para>

                    <para>Our financial obligations are very serious. As the Treasurer pointed out last night, we have raised the following loans : -In 1915, &#163;13,000,000; in 1916, &#163;44,000,000; in 1917, &#163;42,000,000; and this year, &#163;43,000,000. All these loans will be maturing at an early date, as well as the new flotations which are ahead of us, and for which provision will have to be made. The renewals of these loans will have to be liquidated in some way or another, probably at higher rates of interest. We cannot, therefore, view the financial position ahead of us with any degree of equanimity. It must cause every serious minded man in the community a considerable amount of concern. I have been told by traders, more particularly those in the clothing and boot lines, of the tremendous extravagance of individual people in dress and other commodities in every-day use. People have not yet awakened to the fact that if there is urgent need for public economy there is also need for private economy; but the time will come when we shall find ourselves up against a wall. Up to the present we have enjoyed an entirely fictitious prosperity, due to the free circulation of money - principally war expenditure - in the shape of allowances to the relatives of soldiers at the Front. This, as I say, cannot last indefinitely, and we shall soon have to face the cruel facts. The public expenditure should be reduced by the Government wherever possible, whether in connexion with the Federal Capital, Naval Bases, or any other public utility. Every penny ought to be conserved, not only by the Government, but by the individual members of the community, because, while we have escaped the many disabilities under which the people of Great Britain are suffering, we shall, if the war continues, begin to know something of them. In the meantime, we ought to prepare our minds to meet the conditions which must obtain in the near future. </para>

                        <para>.- I rise to support both the motion and the amendment. It is much to be regretted that the Government have made any such  proposal as that dealt with in the amendment, and for which I do not think that the Government could obtain the approval of any father of a family. How would honorable members, especially those who are prepared to go on the recruiting platform, answer the question, should it be put to them, as to what must be the effects of a loosening of parental control in Australia? Personally, I am very fortunate in having most dutiful children, who have the greatest respect for their parents; but, in any case, I cannot see any reason for the action of the Government. As hitherto, boys of eighteen could be permitted to enlist with their parents&#39; consent, and then no harm could, be done. I should like to bring under the notice of honorable members the brutal and unjustifiable treatment by the Government of those concerned when it is sought to withdraw a minor from service. In a case which came under my notice, two boys, both under age, enlisted and went to the Front without their parents&#39; consent. The eldest boy was killed before he was twenty, and the second son, just over eighteen, was wounded in the same action and removed to hospital in England. The father, who was a good Presbyterian, had highly disapproved of the lie which the lads told to the recruiting authorities, but finally decided&#39; that it would be better to let them go. When one had been killed, he suggested to me that he thought it was time he had the wounded son home again ; and he was the more moved to this attitude by the fact that, in the meantime, his wife had died. When I wrote to the Department representing the views of the father, I received a reply to the effect that if a telegram were sent to Great Britain, and the boy recalled, all the moneys due to him at the time of his leaving the Old Country, and from then onward, .would be forfeited. </para>

                    <para>The other day the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney),</inline> in the course of his remarks, made some reference to the Ten Commandments; and as one who has always endeavoured throughout my life to observe them, I regret that the Government are disposed to ignore them so sadly. If the community as a whole paid more attention to the Ten Commandments it would  be much better, not  only for ind.ivid.ual progress, but for the progress of civilization generally. The </para>
                    <para class="block">Government, however, in their disregard of the feelings and wishes of parents, do not show any keen appreciation of the holy commands ; and I think they would be well advised, now that they have- modified their proposals so far, to abandon them altogether. This, I think, would prove of advantage to recruiting, and at the same time remove a stigma from the fair name of Australia. Of all countries in the world, there is none in which there is more necessity for- the exercise of parental control than in Australia. Here boys of eighteen are full- of activity, intelligent, and, thanks to our grand educational system, educated, and fairly able to cope with the world; but, however that may be, parental control is highly necessary for the energetic youth of the country, and the Government would be carrying out the wishes of Australia as a whole if they reverted to the old system of recruiting. After all, the parents, and those who advise them, are the best judges of a boy&#39;s fitness for service, not the boy himself. </para>
                    <para>As to the Loan Bill, what I say may not meet with the approbation of some honorable members, but it is said in the interests of Australia ; and if the Government do not place the finances on a proper footing, I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that I endeavoured to suggest what ought to be done. I do not rely entirely upon my own opinions, but shall quote authorities and figures, and shall cite the example of the British Government in war finance. If Australia had followed, on the same lines, we should now have been in a state of financial stability, instead of running on to the rocks. . The Government in these financial matters ought not to rely entirely on their own knowledge, but seek the advice of others more expert than themselves, just as is done in private business. I suppose honorable members will he surprised to learn that Great Britain defrayed half the cost of the Napoleonic and Crimean wars out of revenue, and that at a time when the creation of wealth was not nearly so easy as it is to-day. When the present war started, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKenna</inline> was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and in the first year of war his Budget showed a surplus of some millions of pounds, which had been raised by additional taxation. </para>

                        Law, who succeeded him, seems to have departed from the policy of his predecessor. After all, something more is required in war-time than mere expenditure of money to carry on the government as in times of peace. But in Australia we have done no more than that. We have made no special provision for the extraordinary circumstances created by the war. We have acted just like a child who, having been given a penny, spends it in &#34;the first lolly shop, and thinks no more about it.  There does not seem to be anybody who realizes the financial position in which we are placed,

Nor does anybody seem to fully grasp the need for devising further means of raising revenue to meet the exceptional disbursements connected with the war. There is, apparently, a belief on the part of some people that there is some mysterious fund which can be tapped by borrowing, not by taxation. That view, however, is disproved by the revenue raised by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain.

I ask honorable members to recollect that much of the State borrowings have been invested in public utilities, which furnish revenue to pay the interest  and sinking fund ; but war expenditure is altogether unproductive, and there is no income to meet the interest except that obtained in general revenue from the taxpayers. Those figures are my  justification  for saying that in war-time more money ought to he obtained from the people by taxation than is being obtained at the present time. </para>

                            <para>- Whether a quorum is present or not, there seems to be a lack of interest in the nation&#39;s welfare, so far as finance is concerned. Even though I am an advocate of higher taxation, I am prepared to admit that the war cannot be entirely financed out of revenue; but when we find the Government raising huge sums by loan, the people outside become curious as to where all the money is coining from, and why more is not available, through taxation, for the needs of the country. The raising of money by loan, and the neglect to increase the revenue from taxation, is creating discontent amongst the working classes. The belief that, under the present system, many people are fattening on the war, naturally gives rise to discontent among the working classes. There is good ground for that belief. In Great Britain, war revenue to the extent of &#163;1,691,694,913 was raised by taxation between 1st August, 1914, and 2nd March last. Nearly 20 per cent, of Great Britain&#39;s war expenditure is being provided for out of revenue. That is something more in the nature of sound finance than anything done by the present Commonwealth Government in financing this war. In respect of the State debts, there are many revenue producing public utilities to show for the outlay, but in respect of the greater part of our war loan indebtedness no revenue is derived. I have endeavoured to impress upon the Government the urgent necessity for the imposition of additional taxation to find the revenue necessary to pay the interest on our borrowings. Before the war, we had an expenditure of about &#163;26,000,000 a year. That was what it cost us to conduct the affairs of the Commonwealth in peace time, and honorable members opposite were continually complaining that the expenditure was excessive. Since then, however, we have increased our ordinary expenditure by &#163;10,000,000 or &#163;12,000,000 a year for interest, and the. Government are doing nothing to provide for that increase. I maintain that long before now the Government should have taken steps to raise additional revenue. Their delay in this respect is due to ulterior motives which are not commendable. While the war is going on, many people in our community are becoming exceedingly rich, and now is the time to obtain more revenue by direct taxation. When the war is over, the wealthy classes will urge that additional revenue should be obtained through the Customs- House. They will be prepared in this way to squeeze the industrial section of the community in order to save their own pockets. Our income tax ought to be higher than it is. Those in receipt of an income of &#163;500 per annum should be paying 2s. in the &#163;1, and incomes between &#163;500 and &#163;1,000 per annum should be taxable up to 6s. or 7s. in the &#163;1. In the case of all incomes in excess of &#163;1,000 a year, there should be a super tax of 4s. 6d. or 5s. in the &#163;1. Such taxation would not cripple industry. Those who wanted to produce would be able under it to get some return from their labours, while at the same time they&#39; would be making a reasonable contribution to the cost of the war. As it ls, we shall have to go in for intense culture, and take care to speed up our industrial activities. The present position is wholly unjustifiable, and it is no wonder that the industrial section of the community is suspicious in regard  to it. We have the most intelligent Democracy in the world, and when a Government plays fast and loose with an intelligent Democracy, something is sure to happen. &#34;Unlike the Commonwealth Ministry, the British Government are not content to simply bring in a Bill to authorize a loan of &#163;80,000,000, to put it before honorable members with a few well-chosen remarks, and to rely on Providence to do the rest. This is the sort of finance in which South Sea Island cannibals might indulge. I well remember what was done in my own State some years ago in regard to the raising of revenue by the selling of Crown lands, and in other directions, but I thought that, . in the National Parliament something approaching a sound system of finance would be secured. I sometimes think that I would better employ my time if, instead of remaining in the chamber hour  after  hour, I were to remain in one of the ante-rooms, and read a book; but I have determined, if possible, to rouse honorable members to a true appreciation of the dangers of the present financial position. We cannot go on for all time as we are to-day. The slip-shod financial methods adopted by the Government must have an effect on the general public. If we were getting in by direct- taxation, what we ought to be raising, there would be more economy outside, and we should not be leaving to posterity a financial load which they cannot possibly carry. I recognise that we cannot finance the war wholly out of revenue, but I think we should at least endeavour to raise as much as possible by way of taxation. Taxation of course, is not popular, and the party that could go before the electors at election time, and say, &#34; If returned, we will reduce the taxation by one-half,&#34; would be sure of victory. We know, however, that it is impossible to avoid additional taxation, and honorable members should have the courage to tell the people that additional taxation is necessary. After the war, we shall have a slump. Some time must necessarily elapse after the war before the men who are fighting for us are able to return to their former avocations, and to become income producers. </para>

                            <para>- I think I did say to the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> that a man would be justified in raising a loan if, by doing so, he could improve his business, and so increase his income. I have never said anything against the policy of borrowing. Loan money can be put to good use in both public and private enterprises, but the point I wish to emphasize to-night is that we cannot afford to go on borrowing, and at the same time to disregard legitimate opportunities for taxation. It seems to be thought that untold wealth is stored away, to be advanced to the Government at 4 or 5 per cent. I have put these matters in my blunt way. Some may say that I do not understand the subject; I am prepared for such criticism. It is the duty of Ministers to see that the ship of State does not run on the rocks, and to apply to Parliament for money when it is needed. But I am not a believer in the &#34;boom, borrow, and bust&#34; policy of some public men. I shall vote for the Bil&#93; as well as for the amendment. </para>

                            <para>- I assume from the interjection that it is the honorable member&#39;s intention to force the amendment to a division. I strongly object to that course. In my opinion, the amendment should not have been moved. How can any of us conscientiously vote for an amendment the carrying of which would mean the putting aside, at all events for a time, of a Bill necessary for the prosecution of the war ? It is unfair of the Opposition to try to entrap members in this way. The Leader of the Opposition could have brought forward for discussion on the Defence Bill the enlistment of boys of eighteen. This is a Bill to authorize the raising and spending of &#163;80,000,000 for war purposes, and in connexion with it we have to ask the questions, &#34; Are we going on with the war, or are we to pull out? Are our men, who have done such excellent work at the Front, to be properly equipped and reinforced?&#34; One might think, after listening to the speeches of the supporters of the amendment, that the Empire was not at war, and that things were not so critical as they are, when not one of us knows what the position may be tomorrow. For the first time in the history of Great Britain the Prime Minister of that country has appealed to the Dominions and every section of the Empire to give it what help  they  could. Honorable members opposite are trying to prevent help from being given. I cannot understand their actions. They pretend that their desire is to protect the youth of the Commonwealth, and to support parental respect. There is not a man on this side who is not desirous that the young persons of the community shall  obey  and respect their parents, though honorable members opposite would have the public believe that that is not so. </para>

                            <para>- They -will not. I regret that I have to speak as I shall speak to-night. When the war started, I dropped party politics. The honorable member for Wentworth and myself were until then bitterly opposed in politics, and said hard things of each other; but we are now on the same side. Since the war began I have not uttered an unkind word in this House. For twelve months the Liberal party supported the party led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> because they said, &#34; We are at war, and we do not wish to cause any trouble under such circumstances.&#34; I have pursued the same line of conduct. The most bitter abuse and. misrepresentation have been turned upon me by some of the members of the Opposition, but I have made no complaint from my place in the chamber, because I have feared that by speaking harshly I might prevent men from doing their duty in the&#39; getting of reinforcements. But what is the present position? Regardless of consequences, the Leader of the Opposition has moved an amendment the effect of which, if carried, would &#39;be to delay the action necessary for the proper prosecution of the war. Does he not care a jot whether the men at the Front are supported or not, or whether the good name they have won for Australia is maintained <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Is it no concern of his that the admiration which the French have for Australia - shall continue ? We read that the French peasantry return to their homes directly the Australians appear on the battlefield, and that the roads travelled by our men are. bestrewn with flowers, scattered by the grateful people who have suffered in this war in a .way which many of those sitting on the opposite benches cannot realize. I am of the opinion, and I shall support my remarks with the evidence, that the Leader of the Opposition is not heart and soul in favour of the amendment. I exempt from what I am about to say the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> a man who has sent his only son to the war; a man who represents hundreds at the Front, and who has done much to secure recruits, realizing that our men are fighting in the interests of the Empire and of Australia. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> too, has a son at the Front. He has been forced into the action that he is now taking by an outside irresponsible body, the body that expelled from the Labour party the Right Honorable William Morris Hughes and <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> of the Labour party who now support him. This outside body has called on the honorable member for Yarra to move the amendment, as I shall prove before I sit down. </para>

                            <para>- I was never more in earnest. I regret that I have to speak like this of a man with whom I sat for so many years. He knows that I have never departed in the least from the Labour platform, that I have stuck to all my pledges. It is for that reason that I feel so keenly the action that was taken against me. Honorable members opposite see the light, they know what is the right thing to do, but they dare not do it because of the pressure that is put on them by the Trades Hall, by those who say, &#34; We shall fly over our building, not the Australian flag, but the red flag,&#34; the flag &#34; that is now flying over Petrograd, where society is in a state of anarchy. It is those who insist on flying the red flag who have given their instruction to the honorable member for Yarra. With what object ? So that more men may not be sent to the war. The amendment has been moved to prevent the Government from getting money to send men to the Front. I must speak to-night as I have never yet spoken since I was forced to leave the Labour party. I aim forced into speaking as I am doing to-night, because the honorable member or some of his emissaries will come into my electorate, as they have done previously, and try to side-track this issue, and say, &#34; Smith voted to get your son sent to the Front when he will not go himself.&#34; That sort of talk will not go down. That parrot-cry will not appeal to the people of Denison. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member says, &#34; Hear, hear,&#34; and apparently it does not matter to him what flag flies there. In times of peace, we may fly what flag we please, but when the best blood of the community is being shed at the Front, the Union Jack and the Australian flags should be the only flags. He no doubt is very thankful to be in the safety afforded by Australia. He simply smiles while thousands are losing their lives in order that he and I may live in security. </para>

Here, men in humble positions will to-night eat a meal such as the King himself will not have; and that is simply because the men we admire so much are holding back the enemy at the Front. Mothers are giving son after son to the service of the country. </para>

We all are apt at times, in the heat of the moment, to say things which in cooler moments we regret, I admit that, perhaps, the honorable member may have received considerable provocation from the nature of the remarks of the honorable member for Denison ; but, at the same time, there are certain rules by which the House is governed, and which the honorable member for Brisbane knows as well as I do. I ask the honorable member to obey those rules, and withdraw the expression of which he has made use. </para>

I have appealed several times, and honorable members must see that interjections, especially those of a personal nature, only lead to disorder. In accordance with our Standing Orders, when the  Speaker  is addressing the House, absolute silence must be observed, and it is disrespectful to the Chair that honorable members should be commenting when the  Speaker  is trying to explain the position. I ask honorable members to remember the dignity of their own institution. A certain respect is due, not to me personally, but to the office I hold, and that respect I must insist on being observed. I therefore ask honorable members to cease interjections, especially those of an offensive &#39;and personal character toward one another, which can only lead to grave disorder. </para>

These men have withdrawn from a movement controlled, not by the old Labour party, but by men who have wormed themselves in, and are bringing disaster on the Labour cause. With all the emphasis at my command I repeat that it is cruel to ask the House to vote on the amendment before us. The motion is for the second reading of a Bill to authorize the raising and expenditure of &#163;80,000,000 for war purposes, and the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> is - </para>

                <para class="block">I remind honorable members that any one voting against the amendment tonight will not be voting in favour of the boys concerned disobeying their parents, but for the second reading of the Bill before us, which, as I say, is to raise money in order to carry on the war. Any member who votes against the motion for the second reading will vote against the carrying on of the war. If we do not raise money we cannot send men to the Froud; and I intend to vote for the Bill, because I desire to see this war carried on to the finish, and, I pray Almighty God, victoriously. I know Germany as it is, and I, for one, unhesitatingly say that I do not desire to come under German rule. However, if we do not use our best endeavours to come out victorious, we shall certainly experience that rule. I have offered my services at the Front, and I ask the honorable member for Brisbane whether he has done the same? </para>

I have done everything that lay in my power to assist every Government that has been in office since the commencement of the war. I intend to continue that attitude, because I realize the seriousness of the position, and because it behoves each one of us to do his utmost to insure the success of the Allies. I do not wish to state in detail the circumstances governing my course of action. I am willing to tell any honorable member privately what I have done in connexion with this war, but I do not wish to give my actions publicity in the House, and so provide some honorable members with an opportunity of charging me with egotism. </para>

                <para>There would be no need for the amendment that i3 before the House if the mass of the people had realized the seriousness of the position, and had done their duty to Australia and to the Empire. If the men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five had responded to the .call of duty as they should have done, we should not have been called upon to discuss this question at all. No doubt before the Government made the regulation in regard to the enlistment of minors, they gave the matter very careful consideration. They have no desire, as the majority of members on this side have no desire, to send to the Front young men under twenty-one  years  of age if they can get in other ways the necessary reinforcements. We cannot do that, and are we, therefore, to allow our army to disappear? Are we to break up one division after another in order to reinforce the others? I hope not. I trust that we shall do our utmost to send to the Front as many men as Australia can spare. The honorable member for Macquarie asked this afternoon, &#34;What about our industries?&#34; Where will be our industries if the Allies lose and Germany wins this war? If honorable members understood what Germany was doing before the outbreak of war, we should not hear such remarks as fell from the lips of the honorable member. I urge him to read a book that is available in the Library, and which explains how, for many years past, Germany had been penetrating every country and ousting local industries. The circumstances of one Italian bank furnish a case in point. Speaking from memory, of 1,000,000 shares in the institution, only 180,000 were held by Germans. Yet the bank was controlled by Germany because of the wonderful commercial and financial organization of the German people. </para>

We know that the ambition of the Prussian military caste was to govern the world as they governed Germany, to spread their so-called &#34;kultur&#34; world-wide. Because of that  ambition  they precipitated the present war. I do not think I take this matter too seriously. I have read much and thought much, and I heard the Prime Minister speak as never man spoke before, when he addressed the then Labour party on his return from Europe.

                        <para>- He told us that the reinforcements required were 32,000 men in the first month and 16,500 men in every subsequent month. Would that we had been able to send that number! What a part they would have played in this war at the present time! Do honorable members think the Germans would have been as successful as they were in the recent drive? Think how close we were to defeat and to the destruction of the Empire. Will honorable members say that the number of men mentioned by the Prime Minister was not required? I was prepared to help to send the reinforcements that he said were necessary, just as I am prepared to vote money tonight for the one purpose of winning this war. Did the Prime Minister give that estimate on his own initiative? Decidedly not. He was guided by the advice of the War Council of Great Britain. Those experts in war told us that so many men were required, and have not subsequent events proved that their estimate was correct? Every man must realize the value which those men would be at the Front to-day. We read with delight that the Germans dread the Australians. We are told that the Australians, when raiding at night, are able to find their way in the dark in a marvellous fashion, that the Germans look upon them with horror, but that the women of France rejoice when they know that Australians are protecting them. We have read in history how the people besieged in Lucknow during the Indian mutiny heard with joy the strains of &#34; The Campbells are Coming &#34; from the bagpipes of the relieving Army. I predict that some day a poem will be written, the theme of which will be the joy of the people of France when they heard that the Australians were coming - not as aggressors, not as men desirous of acquiring wealth for themselves, or of altering the Government of any country, but as men desirous only of giving freedom to all peoples and retaining the freedom which they enjoy in this great and glorious country of Australia. Yet to-day, politically speaking, we are at each other&#39;s throats, and are trying to work all kinds of points against one another. The Opposition is intent upon discrediting the Government, who are working as no Government ever worked before. I should say the same if a Government composed of honorable members opposite were in power, because the work of Ministers of State has grown out of all proportion to what it was before the Avar. Ministers and their officers are working strenuously with the one object of doing their best for Australia. Yet honorable members opposite are trying to block a measure that will provide the Commonwealth with the wherewithal to continue the war to a victorious end. Their object is not to insure the winning of the war, but to provide themselves with political capital to be used on the public platform in about two years&#39; time. The time will come when the Leader of the Opposition will realize, as possibly he realizes now, that the step he has taken is not a good party move. The Opposition made a mistake in proposing such an amendment on this measure. I can vote conscientiously against the amendment and for the Bill, because I do not wish to embarrass the Government at the present time. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> put the matter in a nutshell when he said that it would be impossible for the Government to carry on if this amendment were carried. The Leader of the Opposition heard the Government&#39;s explanation, and I begged of him to withdraw his amendment. I may assure the House that the members of this party have not been consulted on this question at any party meeting. For the regulation in regard to the enlistment of minors the Government  alone are responsible. Members on this side are as free as air to vote as they like on this question; but are they going to embarrass the Government by supporting this amendment, simply because honorable members opposite desire to tell the people that they were opposed to sending boys of eighteen to the Front ? The Government have made a very considerable concession. In the circumstances, the  statement  made by the Acting Prime Minister should receive at least fair and reasonable consideration. The Government&#39;s action should not have been condemned as it has been by some honorable members. Realizing the critical position in Europe to-day, surely the Opposition would he justified in withdrawing the amendment. </para>

                <para>I have explained the reasons for my attitude. It. was with keen regret that I deemed it necessary to hit hard honorable members with whom I was previously associated. One honorable member was called to order earlier in the proceedings on account of a statement he made, and I wish him to realize that my attack upon him was provoked by his interjections, and from a feeling of consideration for my sick wife. In conclusion, I heartily congratulate the Acting Prime Minister on the very clear statement he made to the House last night regarding Australia&#39;s financial position. He pointed out the .serious condition of our finances, and impressed upon all of us how essential it is to encourage every industry, and not to penalize a going concern. He showed that we ought not to take a shilling more from the taxpayer than is required by the Government to&#39; pay for the cost of administration and provide interest and sinking fund on the money we are borrowing. To adopt the policy some honorable members have suggested would be disastrous to this country. I once warned a former Treasurer that if he introduced a certain tax his action would be equivalent to that of a man who took two bags of seed from a farmer whose land was already tilled and prepared to receive four bags of seed. To impose more taxation than is required is to take away capital that should, be used in the production of wealth. Let us by all means take as much of the wealth of the country as our needs demand. Let us take it in a way that will be least injurious to the poor of Australia, for whom we on this side are just as solicitous as are honorable members opposite. Let us tax those who are best able to pay, and the great majority of whom are willing to go on paying in order that we may hold this glorious country of ours. But do not let us take by way of taxation a shilling more than is actually required, since to do so would be to interfere with that great machine which, guided by the skilled hands of capable men, is producing our wealth. Capital and labour must go hand in hand. That fact is being realized to-day by the  people of the Old Country, and Great Britain will never return to the conditions that prevailed before the war. Its people, as a result of the war, have been brought into closer touch than ever before. They have become as one, and big class distinctions are being completely swept away. The table of the King to-night is no better than that of the humblest man in the Empire. The people of Great Britain are working as one solid body with only one object in view. And so with the people of that great Democracy, the United States of America. Who would have thought after reading <inline font-style="italic">Canada As it Is,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">America at Work,</inline> a few years ago, that the great division between capital and labour, so clearly set out in those works, would so soon be bridged over? Who would have thought a year or two ago that that great leader of men; Samuel Gompers, would have spoken as he has within the last few months. He has said to the workers of the United States, &#34; We are in this war and must play our part. The capitalist will help to pay for the wax, and all classes must unite with the one object of keeping the United States as it was before the war broke out.&#34; The workers of the United States realized indeed that it will be better after the war than ever it was before, and hence we have the great labour leader, Samuel Gompers, backed up by every trade unionist in his demand that labour shall play its part in the great conflict. He is not condemned as old Labour men have been condemned here. And we, after all, have not been condemned by the rank and file of the trade unionists of Australia. I believe that the great majority of trade unionists here are as loyal as are their American brethren, and that they are simply longing for a leader to take them out of the wilderness. We have no alternative but to go on. We must find the men and the money necessary to prosecute this war, and we shall do that best, not by hampering the Government, but by the cooperation of all parties both inside and outside Parliament in the one great effort to consolidate this Empire of ours, and to keep Australia free. </para>

The fact that since the tabling of this amendment they have backed down, shows that they could not have given it every consideration.

Honorable members opposite think that the people outside will not judge them harshly if, in the circumstances, they vote against this amendment. I would remind them of the statement once made by one of Victoria&#39;s keenest politicians, the late Duncan Gillies, that &#34; it is very easy to explain away a speech, but difficult to explain away a division.&#34; The honorable member for Denison evidently thought I was laughing at him when he proceeded to attack me. As a matter of fact, I was laughing at the thought of something that occurred to him when he and I were in London together. Perhaps I should not have laughed, but now that he knows the circumstances I am sure he will forgive me. He stated that while he had a brother at the Front I had no one to represent me there. I am sure that, in cooler moments, he would not have made that statement. How does he know what relatives I have at the Front ? </para>

Do they realize that by voting against this amendment they will vote to send boys of nineteen <inline font-style="italic">to the Front</inline> in opposition to the wishes of their fathers and mothers ? Have we no regard for the Ten Commandments? It is said that Moses once asked Satan what his opinion was of the Ten Commandments, and that Satan replied that they would be all very well if  he were allowed to omit from them the one word &#34;not.&#34; The decision of the </para>
                <para class="block">Government in this instance means that the commandment &#34; Honour thy father and thy mother&#34; is to be thrown to the winds. It is an infamy to send boys of eighteen to the Front. One would think that Australia was fighting the whole battle of the Allies ! I am ashamed to hear men of the British race crying out for boys to go to the Front. The Allies re* present a population of 1,170,000,000, whereas our enemies, dominated, unfortunately, by brutal Prussia, have but a total&#39; population of 140,000,000. If we take white races only, the Allies represent 471,000,000, banded together in the same cause, but, unfortunately, not all enjoying the same liberties that we possess to-day. If you deduct the 191,000,000 of Russians, Roumanians, and Servians, you still have 280,000,000 of white people fighting against the 140,000,000 of white and other people in the Central European Empires. I am ashamed when I hear honorable members on the other side speak as though the British race were decadent. I am not afraid about that. During the Continental wars that silver streak, the English channel, saved England, but she then stood alone against tie world, and ultimately destroyed the armies that were led by the military genius of Napoleon. </para>
                <para>Sometimes one might think from &#34;his reading of the newspapers that it was the Australians alone who were fighting the battles of the Allies. When addressing recruiting meetings I have had, in justice to the Tommies, to show that their divisions have lost  more than our divisions at the Front. I know how bravely they are fighting, yet their conditions are not as good, as the conditions of our own men, though I hope that in future they will be so. If I thought for a moment that that brutal, blood-thirsty tyrant, the Ger7 man Emperor, and the equally brutal blood-thirsty system of Prussian militarism, were likely to win the Avar, I would make honorable members go with me to fight, even if I had to shanghai them. We would do our little bit. I say that in all sincerity. </para>
                <para>Genera&#93; Joffre, when he visited America with the Commission from Great Britain, and France, was received more warmly than any other member of the Commission. He advised the Americans not to train their soldiers in America, but to send them to France, where they could learn the new conditions of trench warfare in a few months, because things have changed since the war commenced. As 1 have already told the House, I was informed by the representative of the Chambers of Commerce of the United States of America, whom I met by accident and <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> whom I rendered a small service when travelling over the East-West railway, that in December there were 960,000 Americans training in France, and a gentleman connected with the Defence Department, when he heard the source of my information, admitted that there were 1,000,000 Americans there. Under these circumstances, it is ridiculous to say that our boys should be kept here until they reach the age of twenty-one years. </para>
                <para class="block">If transport facilities are few, why not send our men Home <inline font-style="italic">viti</inline> America. A steamer can make two and a half trips between Sydney and San Francisco for one trip between Australia and Europe. Allowing for delays in port, one ship -could carry as many men to America as &#34;two ships could carry to Europe. In -America our men would meet brothers of their race, men speaking the same tongue. It would be a fine thing to have our Australian soldiers crossing America by the 3,000 miles of railway that span that continent. By adopting that route for our transports we could concentrate our defences against the submarines in the 3,500 miles of ocean that stretch between America and France. I understand that only one transport has so far been torpedoed. We could also economize in transport if we sent Home foodstuffs in the shape of flour instead of as wheat, because 3 lbs. of wheat grind down into 2 lbs. of flour. If we sent flour Home, we should not only save in freight, but would have the bran, pollard, and other waste as fodder for stock. Therefore, I ask, why not send everything by way of America ? </para>
                <para>We are told of what has been done for our soldiers, but again I ask, why cannot we treat the women and children who are the dependants of soldiers as well as the dependants of New Zealand soldiers are treated? In proportion to population, the Dominion has as much loan indebtedness as we have to face, and has sent as many men to the Front. Yet for every child left in New Zealand by a soldier, the sum of 10s. 6d. per week is paid, whereas we originally allowed for the housing, feeding, and clothing of soldiers&#39; children 4id. per day, the amount being subsequently increased to 6d. Would any one of us like his child to be brought up on an expenditure of only 6d. per day? A child, as a future unit of the State, has the .right to be reared into a healthy individual. </para>

It is impossible to rear a .child properly on a paltry 6d! per day, and when the country is borrowing money in millions it is contemptible to give such an allowance for the rearing of children. No medical man would say that a child can be properly fed for that sum. Our calves and pigs are better fed than a child could be fed for 6d. a day. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member does not know what a fight I put up for a larger allowance. I wish to have the pensions of soldiers&#39; dependants made as large as that of officers&#39; dependants. I want to see the soldiers getting the same pay, the same food, and the same pensions, and wearing the same uniforms, as officers, and I would pay the dependants of officers and men alike. Perhaps the honorable member is not aware that there are 100 officers in the Defence Department and at the Front receiving more than the Commander-in-Chief of the Swiss Army in time of war, when he commands 300,000 men. Fifteen of our officers draw more in pay and allowances than Von Moltke received when he led the Prussians through France. Any one who looks at the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 3rd May will find that the figures that I am giving are correct. I regret that inaccurate answers were returned to me regarding New Zealand. I asked if we paid as much as New Zealand, and was told that we did. But I am sorry to say that the answer was wrong, though I do not accuse Ministers of untruthfulness in the matter. </para>

                <para>How many soldiers&#39; widows are there in Victoria who need not fear the landlord&#39;s knock at the door, having cottages rent free, or for a pepper-corn rental? I know of only one. Yet in New South Wales, on the 15th February last, there were 790 soldiers&#39; widows possessing four-roomed brick cottages with bathrooms, for which they were being charged ls. per year, and where the Government did not possess houses, rent was being paid up to 10s. per week. We should have a few hundred such houses in Victoria. This Government and, the Government of Victoria are not doing their duty in the matter. If a soldier is in receipt of a pension, and gets paid employment, he is fined. The man who wove the cloth that I am now wearing did not know how to weave three months before that cloth was made. The man who teaches soldiers to weave has shown that any man who can move his wrist can become a good weaver. But a single man drawing a pension of 15s. per week is allowed to earn, only 27s. a week at weaving, and a married man only 10s. 6d. more. What a paltry and contemptible arrangement that is! Why do not we do what they do in New South Wales - that is, pay the men 2s. per yard double width? At that rate, men could earn fair wages. Let them also keep their pensions. No one wants soldiers to be fined because they are drawing pensions. The rate I have mentioned would prevent the undercutting of union rates. At 2s. a yard for weaving, 3s. 6d. for -wool, 6d. for dressing, and ls. for overhead expenses, the cost of a yard would be 7s. This is saleable retail at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,</inline> or at 15s. in Flinders-lane. If the Government would supply the whole of the cloth to Flinders-lane there would be no trouble; but they want to supply it to the tailors and others. Why should not any citizen have the right to buy so many yards for a suit of clothes? A difference of 2s. 6d. per yard between the wholesale and retail prices of the cloth should be sufficient. </para>

                <para>It is amusing, although it is sometimes pathetic, to hear the causes for which many of our soldiers have been punished. One man has been punished for &#34; unlawfully firing at the King&#39;s enemies. &#39; &#39; I caz&#62; understand that punishments are necessary in order to maintain good discipline. I know that many men smuggled themselves on board for Gallipoli, some of them in their pyjamas, that they fought well, that some of them were killed, and that others were brought back and severely punished. However, it is tomfoolery to punish a man for unlawfully firing&#39; on the King&#39;s enemies. I have no patience with such things. </para>

The agricultural labourers working in the UnitedKingdom received in wages before the war from 14s. to 18s. per week; and the majority of the cottages in which they lived were damp and not fit to bring up children in, as is proved by the fact that England is now making arrangements to build 1,000,000 fresh cottages. Thepoint is that every cup of tea that waa- drunk in thos&#169; humble homes, and every teaspoonful of sugar that was used, paid a minute fraction of interest on the debts incurred during the Napoleonic wars. </para>

                        <para>- But it shows how the cursed cross of interest will be branded on future years. I have already said in this House that my brain could not conceive, nor my lips utter, any vote which would brand the cursed cross of interest on the untold millions of the future. Last year, the expenditure of Great Britain was &#163;2,198,000,000. The taxation was &#163;573,000,000. We cannot conceive of Great Britain coming out of this war with a smaller expenditure than &#163;9,000,000,000 or &#163;10,000,000,000. This amount, at 4 per cent., will mean the annual payment of &#163;400,000,000 by way of interest - more than &#163;1,000,000 a day. Surely it calls for an alteration in our system of finance. I think I can see a&#39; way out, so far as Australia is concerned. I believe that it was John Stuart Mill, or one of the other economists of his time, who suggested that a Doomsday Book should be taken of all property in Great Britain and Ireland, and that any increase of value from that -time onward should belong to the State. It will be necessary for us to have a similar book in Australia. Every owner should be permitted to 1 raise or lower his value if he thinks fit to do so, but as a .check against any attempt to fix upon, an unjust value for the purpose of escaping taxation, the shire council, the State or the Commonwealth should have the right to resume any person&#39;s property at his own valuation. Furthermore, the owner should be prepared to pay taxation upon that valuation. The adoption of that policy would wipe out a large proportion of the huge debt that will have -accrued at the end of this War. In ten or twenty &#34; years&#39; time the natural increase of wealth will tend to remove that debt, and save future generations from a great deal of taxation. </para>

In <inline font-style="italic">Bradshaw&#39; 8 Guide</inline> the State income tax rates are set out in thirteen simple lines. Any honorable member could tell an inquiring citizen the amount of income tax he would be required to pay to the State, but there is no honorable member here who could tell him what he would be called on to pay in the shape of Commonwealth income tax or land tax without a glance at a Ready Reckoner, which contains something like 6,000 lines as against the thirteen lines in <inline font-style="italic">Bradshaw&#39; s Guide.</inline> I do not know of any other country which has such an idiotic system as is that scientific curve of ours, which seems to have been conceived for the purpose of worrying the lives of honorable members, who have many constituents coming to them and asking them how much taxation they really ought to pay. The State system is a common-sense one, and it is the height of absurdity for the Commonwealth Government to continue our foolish system. </para>
                <para>In regard to the question of unemployment, I am sorry to say that in the city of Melbourne, the least taxed city of its size in the world, which is freed from the responsibility of paying for its police protection, though every city of America or Europe of the same size has to pay for its own police, has been mean and contemptible enough to dismiss up to fifty men who Were engaged in cleaning the streets. Instead of removing the garbage tins from Carlton and West Melbourne three or four times a week, they propose to do so twice a week. I resent this action, particularly at a time when diphtheria is spreading. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Hennessy was Lord Mayor, and was unwise enough to close the baths, I headed a deputation of Federal and State members of Parliament which waited upon him, and I said to him, &#34; Not only is Melbourne the dustiest city of its size in the world, but you are trying to make it the dirtiest.&#34; There is no city in Europe of the size of Melbourne where one cannot have a swim every day in the year. I am speaking of this matter because unemployment disturbs credit, and once credit is destroyed our loans will be a failure, which I do not want them to be. Whenever there is unemployment the first to suffer is the small landlord. The next to suffer are the small shopkeepers. Then the larger shopkeepers suffer, and so it goes on. Everything should be kept in full swing at the present time. When the Broken Hill mines were afraid that they would have to close down, they were able to keep them at full swing. When the Government of the day, which I supported, were foolish enough not to accept the splendid offer that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baillieu</inline> empowered me to make, namely, that the work should be carried on in full swing, no man being dismissed, and that the Commonwealth Government should purchase all the minerals at 30 per cent. below the London price before the war, silver was 2s. an ounce, and the Government could have bought every ounce in Australia for1s. 4 4-5d. Since then silver has gone as high as 5s. an ounce. </para>

                        <para>- That is the price at present, but it has been as high as 5s. One of the head men of the biggest shipping company trading with the East assures me that the Chinese dollar is at 6s., though when I was in Hong Kong it was only1s. l0d. The present price of the Chinese silver dollar shows the reason why silk can be purchased cheaper in Melbourne to-day than in China. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. We cannot go on raising loans, the interest on which is free from taxation. If I repeat myself in this matter, it is because I think it is necessary to emphasize the position. I will have nothing to do with repudiation, but by means of evolution we may reach the desired end in a slower and safer way. We might appeal to patriotic men, who have invested money in the loans to an amount of &#163;100,000 and over, to permit the country, in its hour of need, to have the use of it without interest. </para>

                        <para>- This is a serious matter, and I am deeply in earnest. If I remember rightly, the Minister in charge at the present moment <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> gave me a sympathetic answer when I asked whether it would not be possible to present a certificate to investors who acted in this patriotic way, just as a certificate were given to every man and woman who voted for Federation. If that idea were acceptable to the Government, it could be flung broadcast throughout Australia, and I think that there would be a generous response. </para>

                <para>Patriotism does not altogether lie with the young bloods when they feel the rich red blood coursing through them, and offer their lives to help their country. Old fogies like myself and others are just as patriotic, and I always recall the words of a Consul-General for America&#39; who, when we were speaking of a contingency, which at that time was feared in the East, said that if elderly persons like he and I could not go to fight, they could always give what they possessed to support the cause, and he emphasized his idea by pointing to a splendid gold watch which he then wore. What are we going to do when we have to face the crisis? At one time I thought that we could get through the war with an expenditure of &#163;300,000,000, and, as I indicate in a motion on the notice-paper, that we might get an indemnity, not permitting the German flag to fly upon the ocean until it had been paid, even if it were for 100 years; but I am afraid it is hopeless to think of that now. Be that as it may, what are we going to do ? Are we to allow the cursed Kaiser to put the load of interest on the untold millions of future generations? We are here the creatures of a moment, while the earth is here for ever; in other words, I submit that land, buildings, and. property generally should hear the burden. I do not mean that we should unjustly tax, but, at the same time, we are not taxing as we should - not as the people in England and the United States of America are being taxed. For four years the war has been in progress, and we are hot yet taxing rich incomes. I again thank <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baillieu,</inline> who is a millionaire reputed to be making a second million, for pointing out that the War-time Profits Tax Act does not touch men like him; and we ought to accept that signal from a quarter where we could hardly expect to see it. Then, again, as I said before, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Grice did not speak as  Chairman  of Directors of the National Bank merely to give Labour men a peg on which to hang an argument when he said that those with large amounts invested in the loans receive nearly 7 per cent, in interest, while small investors receive only 4-J per cent. </para>
                <para>Say there is &#163;300,000,000 invested in the loans, on &#163;200,000,000 of which interest is paid at 4^ per cent, free of taxation, it might be made known throughout the land that on the 1st January, 1919 - when we all hope the war will be over - those who had invested &#163;100,000 and upwards would have the opportunity to leave it with the Government free of interest, or  with  the interest subject to income tax, or be paid in full in Commonwealth Bank notes. Those who took the notes could pay them into the various banks, by which it could be advanced to help commercial and industrial enterprises. This would make the currency more fluid, increase our credit, and show us who are the real patriots in our midst. If there are scrolls of honour for those who have given their lives at the Front. so there should be scrolls of honour for those investors who are manly enough to lend their money free of interest, or willing that the interest shall be subject to taxation. I do not like the word &#34; scheme,&#34; but if some such plan could be adopted, the Government and the country would save its face, and honorably meet its responsibilities, so that no one could point a finger of scorn at it. </para>
                <para>I shall vote for the amendment. If it is desired to increase recruiting, there is a simple way. In all great wars, especially in the last American war, in which, up to that time, there was a larger army than in any war between modern nations, sums of money have been paid to men for serving their country; and I may say that in, the war I have just mentioned some men. were bold enough to risk the deserved fate of the traitor, and accepted payment from both sides. In Australia at the present moment it might be advisable to place &#163;50 &#39;in the bank to the credit of every man going to the Front. in order to enable him to pay little debts, and so forth, before his departure. We are thankful to the insurance companies for what they have done, though I do not think they are doing all they ought to do. In the case of the National Mutual Company, those who insured before the war do not have their premiums increased, but those who have insured since have to pay an additional &#163;10 for every &#163;100; and in the case of the Australian Mutual Provident Society the extra payment is &#163;7 10s. L read only yesterday that in America, something like 2,000,000 men have been insured by the Government for am average sum of &#163;1,000 each. A glance at the immense figures of the Australian Mutual Provident Society will reveal the huge profits made in the life insurance business. When I was a. member of the State Parliament I. had prepared a return of the premiums paid by the Railway Department for the insurance of employees. No expense was incurred by the insurance&#39; company, yet though nearly &#163;300,000- was collected in premiums, the companies paid out some &#163;30,000, leaving a profit of about &#163;250,000. </para>

                        <para>- Most of the &#163;250,000* was profit, because it is evident that all the time premiums were being received in. excess of the losses. I hope the Government will embark on a policy of life insurance for soldiers. Surely if- men are&#62; willing to risk their lives it is the duty of the Government to insure them for the benefit of their dependants. We know that some dependants have been left in miserable circumstances. As a member of the State Recruiting Committee, I know that some wealthy men have made most generous offers to insure the lives of soldiers going to the Front. But under that system a few give in that and every other way, and other rich men do not give at all. Again, only a few fortunate men benefit; whereas if the insurance were done by the Government all soldiers would be helped, and the burden would be distributed over the whole community. I urge the Minister to telegraph to the United States of America for information as to the insurance system which has been adopted &#39; by the Government there, and he may discover an example so good that Australia, democratic as it is, may be inclined to follow it. </para>

                    <para>.- A question which, before the amendment was moved, was quite simple, has .now become complicated. The object of the Bill before the House is to allow &#163;80,000,000 to be raised for war purposes. Every honorable member realizes the necessity for passing that measure, but when the Bill had been, advanced to the second -reading stage the Leader of the Opposition moved an amendment condemning the Government for enlisting for service abroad youths under eighteen years of age who had not obtained the consent of their parents. I believe in the object of the amendment; I also believe in the Bill introduced by the Government, but the two questions are so interwoven that the carrying of the amendment would mean the cancellation of the Bill. The view I take of the amendment is that no Government, no matter how strong they may be, have any right to give to boys under the age of twenty-one years, up till which age they are infants in law, the right to defy their parents in spite of the moral law embodied in the Ten Commandments. I do not pose as one appealing to Divine authority in this matter, but I say that it is against the general instinct of the race to give to infants at law power to defy their parents. I do not care what Great Britain does. This step may be necessary in the opinion of the men who are conducting the affairs of the Mother Country; I have no responsibility for what is done there. But I have some responsibility in connexion with the introduction of that principle in Australia. I am a representative of the people, and if this policy is carried into operation it must be either with or without my consent. I am glad that the Acting Prime Minister has announced a considerable modification of the original proposal. How the decision to allow boys of eighteen years of age to enlist without the consent of their parents was arrived at I cannot say, but I believe that if the responsible authorities had known the opinion of the country, they would never have assented to such a proposition. I am glad that the Government have realized in time the danger of pursuing the course on which they started. But the Acting Prime Minister would have done better if, instead of announcing a modification of the Government policy, he had stated the Government&#39;s intention of reverting to the original condition, under which no boy under the age of twenty-one years could enlist without the consent of his parents. We do not desire to recruit our Expeditionary Forces with men who are going to the Front in defiance of their parents. They are not the sort of men from whom we may expect the highest service, and I believe that it would be very much better to do without the few extra recruits we may get under the new regulation rather than continue a policy which is approved by hardly anybody in the community. If the proposition of the Leader of the Opposition had been brought forward, not as an amendment to a Bill of which I approve, but as a specific motion, I should certainly have supported it, hut as it has been moved as an amendment on a Bill which I regard as absolutely necessary, I intend to vote against it. At the same time, I wish to place on record my emphatic opinion that the Government were absolutely wrong in introducing the regulation to which exception has been taken, and I hope that even now they will see the wisdom of making it impossible for a boy under twenty-one years of age to enlist in spite of the opposition of his parents. If they will retrace their steps I am satisfied that the country will thoroughly approve- of their action, regardless of whether the number of recruits is increased or decreased. How to deal with boys who enlist by wrongly claiming to be twenty-one years of age is a difficult problem. I intend to bring before the House next week the case of a lad who enlisted before he was sixteen years of age. </para>

But when hoys who are living at home have been refused their parents&#39; consent, it is morally wrong for the Government to create conditions which will enable those lads to defy their parents.

                    <para>.- It is very amusing to hear honorable members on the Government benches asserting that they are opposed to the principle of baby-snatching, but apologetically stating that they cannot vote against the Bill. If those honorable gentlemen are so moral as to be opposed to the immoral principle propounded today by the Acting Prime Minister, they should at least be prepared to fight for their principles. I have not much faith in honorable members who tell us what they would do in different circumstances. One honorable member said to-day that if the amendment were moved at <inline font-style="italic">some other</inline> time, and the debate did not involve too many party considerations, he might support it. That is as far as his principles go. The honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> knows perfectly well that by voting for the amendment and defeating the Bill the immoral regulation will be wholly withdrawn. It is the members of the Ministerial party who are making the Government squirm. Not the speeches made in this House, but the attitude of the women of Victoria, made the Government modify their attitude. I raise my hat to the women of Victoria for the action they have taken against the immorality contemplated by the baby snatching Government. If honorable members are in earnest about preserving parental control and insuring that none shall go to the war who may become physical, mental, and moral wrecks through being placed in conditions where their youth is a factor against them, they will do something more than merely blither about principles, and then vote against those principles. I and my colleagues are opposed to the Government proposition, and our opposition is not due to party considerations. It will be found that a very large proportion of those who vote for the Government, and their supporters, object to it, and as the scheme becomes more generally known, there will be such a public outcry against it that I am sure it will be withdrawn. Having regard to the modification of it that has been made within the last twenty-four hours, it is not difficult to calculate how long it will be before the scheme as a whole is abolished. It will be a good thing for the youth of Australia - for the potential fathers of the Commonwealth - if it is dropped. </para>

                <para>I wish now to deal with a matter which I think should be ventilated, and should claim the attention of the Government. It relates to enemy trading - to the exploitation of the Australian people by an enemy firm, whose profits will go to Germany. I refer to the operations of what is known as the Standard Woollen Company. So far as I can learn, this firm was established some twenty-five years ago by a German named Johann  Wulfing,  under the name of the Wulfing Woollen Company. Some years later a man named G. Hardt came from Germany, and bought out the business which was thereafter carried on under the firm name of G. Hardt and Company Limited. That trading concern was among the first to be gazetted as an enemy firm. Thereupon, apparently, a transfer of the business took place, and it was carried on under the style of the Standard Woollen Company. Early in 1916, the Standard Woollen Company, the manager of which at that time was a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> Schroeder, was declared to be an enemy firm, and an official liquidator named Sherlock was put in by the Government. Acting in conjunction with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Schroeder,</inline> who is still the manager of the company, he has been doing a good business in the exploitation of Australians for the benefit of German shareholders in that company. I do not say that this has been done with the cognisance of the Government, but it has been carried on with the cognisance of a Government servant. It is a scandal that the stock of this company has been held until like stocks in Australia have become depleted, and that its prices have been increased to the extent of 300 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- One of the Government war measures is the fixation of prices, and the prevention of profiteering. This is clearly a case of profiteering, not by a British, but by a German firm. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; &#163;10,000 of war loan money baa been used for the purpose. It is shown that, in connexion with stocks recently disposed of by the firm in South Australia, the London invoice price of Mahony&#39;s Blarney tweed, in 1914, was 4s. lOd. per yard, and that the Government liquidator, acting in conjunction with E. Schroeder, had valued that same tweed at 25s. per yard. The whole of the London invoices are for 1914. Is this exploitation on the part of a declared enemy firm to go on for the benefit pf German shareholders? </para>

Lot No. 2 has an estimated value of 8s. 4d. per yard, but Messrs. Sherlock and Schroeder have valued that also at 25s. per yard. The estimated value of lot 5 is 8s. per yard, whereas Messrs. Sherlock and Schroeder have valued it at 24s. per yard, and the estimated value of lot. 10 is 10s. per yard, as against a valuation of 30s. per yard put upon it by Messrs.

                        <para>- I shall deal with some goods that have recently been sold, and which are on the list from which I have been quoting. Messrs. Sherlock and Schroeder value the South Australian portion of this company&#39;s holdings at &#163;4,305 17s. 4d., whereas, taking&#39; the invoice price in 1914, it is worth less than &#163;1,500. This inflation of prices would be bad enough if the exploitation of the people were being carried on by a British firm, but the position is much worse when we find that these profits are going into the pockets of Germans. </para>

There is something like &#163;40,000 worth of tweeds, woollens, and other goods still in the hands of the company. These four firms will pay cash for the lot, and will undertake to sell to the retailers of Australia, in not more than &#163;500 lots, at a maximum profit of 20 per cent. They are prepared to add to the 1914 invoice cost an amount sufficient to cover general charges and a fair margin of profit, but not to allow for a profit of 300 per cent. Experts are also ready to value these stocks for* the Government whenever asked to do so. I am sure that honorable members generally will&#39; join with me in objecting to the exploitation of the Australian people by a German firm under any circumstances. -Another war question is the&#39; supply of foodstuffs to the British Government for hospital and other purposes. The supply of rabbits comes within that category. A mysterious phase of the contract made  between the British Government and the Meat Board of New South Wales for the supply of rabbits has recently been discovered. When we tried to ascertain a few days ago who was responsible for the making of that contract, we elicited from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King,</inline> the  Chairman  of the New South Wales Meat Board, that the main reason why the contract was made with the Meat Board was that the previous contract was mishandled by the Commonwealth Government, with the result that a very large quantity of the rabbits shipped to England arrived in a faulty condition. Some eight months ago I said that when the 1917-1918 pack came to be opened in London 40 per cent, would be found unfit for human consumption. The reason given by the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> for the making of the contract with the Sydney Meat Board is entirely different from that supplied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King,</inline> and inquiry should be instituted in regard to the whole question. Coming to the supply of rabbits for the Australian Imperial Force, sinister rumours are still current in regard to 2,000 crates which were shipped for the use of our soldiers in Egypt. I am informed from a fairly reliable source that before they reached Suez these crates had to be dumped overboard because &#39; of faulty freezing preparation on the part of the rabbit combine, who supplied the rabbits to the Commonwealth Government. The allocation of the 600,000 crates, much of which will go to our hospitals in London, was carried out by the Rabbit Combine, through its representatives on the Advisory Board. There are three of those gentlemen - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtis,</inline> of Curtis and Curtis, Ltd.; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Paterson, of J. Paterson and Co. Ltd., a Victorian firm; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKinney,</inline> of a country freezing company of New South Wales; together with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butler,</inline> who is  chairman  of the Advisory Committee and one of the inspectors. Representations have been made to the Meat Board, which has in some instances permitted certain firms not in the Combine to have 1,000 crates of rabbits. What I contend, even at this late stage, is that, providing the rabbits are passed, by our Government graders, anybody who desires to pack should have the right to do so. The allocation of the present pack is based upon the pack of 1916-17. When one considers that the Rabbit Combine had a practical mono- poly of the pack of that year, it is quite clear that the allocation on the pack of 1917 would result in the combination again getting the whole? of the contract. To-day there are many freezing companies which have deliberately closed down their works in order, if possible, to act detrimentally to the best interests of Australia; that is, to prevent men from getting a fair share of the profits accruing from this contract. The Commonwealth Government, under the War Precautions Act, have power to say that any rabbits brought in, no matter who brings them, must be accepted by the New South Wales Meat Board. That power should be exercised. </para>

                <para>Another question very intimately connected with the Bill before the House is that of the wool acquisition scheme - an essentially war-time measure, and one on which loan money has been expended. I refer specially to the Czar-like action of the Central Wool Committee in issuing a regulation preventing small wool buyers in various country towns from pursuing their calling. There are several hundreds of them in New South Wales alone, and thousands of them throughout the Commonwealth. Many possess extensive plants, large buildings, and waggons and horses, or motors. They regularly make collections of wool and skins and country produce; and the total plant and outfit probably represent hundreds .of thousands of pounds. All. this is lying idle, and for no known purpose, unless it be to make the business more profitable for those inside the scheme, acting as. agents for the Central Wool Committee. </para>
                <para>Under the regulation issued by the Central Wool Committee, any man who deals in one shilling&#39;s worth of wool over &#163;10 worth - the statutory limit - is liable to a fine of &#163;100, or six months&#39; imprisonment, or both. That is a ridiculous penalty for carrying on businesses which have been established from the time when first the selectors and farmers began to keep a few sheep in their spare paddocks. These small producers have not an opportunity to grade and prepare their wool for market, and even if they could do so in. the best possible way, and could send it down to the average wool-selling  firm,  it would receive no consideration, for the reason that it is in small lots. </para>
                <para>Thus, the country wool-dealer fulfils a valuable mission in classing the wool ofAustralia. He goes to numerous farms collecting small quantities; then he classes them, sorts, and bales them, and thus small items from many sources are compiled into marketable parcels. That is a direct saving and benefit to the community. At present many hundreds of men are idle because of this infamous regulation passed by the Central Wool Committee. </para>
                <para>I desire to touch upon one other matter - one which has relation to a scheme recently inaugurated, and which concerns the Bill before us. That is as to the pooling of jute goods. It is necessary, in the interests of Australia, that the Government should take over the whole of the importation and distribution of jute goods. At present I understand this is confined to wheat sacks. Not only should the Government be very careful as to the distribution of wheat sacks, but they should immediately take steps not only to supply farmers with cornsacks, but pastoralists with woolpacks, and the community with bran bags. </para>

                        <para>- If during the coming year we have to use the secondhand bags and sacks left over from last year, it will be most unfortunate. This Government has stood idly by and looked on while the farmers have been robbed by firms that were well-informed enough, or cute enough, to know its intentions and actions. The Government fixed the price of new cornsacks, but not of secondhand lags. The price of secondhand bags was not fixed until certain firms had cornered them, and later were able to charge 10s. and l1s. a dozen for them. The Government has full evidence of exploitation last year, and should be careful of the distribution of wheat sacks. Many firms are prepared to take on the distribution of sacks, but the Government should control it absolutely. Last year the distribution was in the hands of private persons, and although there were plenty of sacks in Sydney, many farmers could not get them, and had to pour their wheat out on to a cleared space of ground, private enterprise holding the sacks for greater profit. </para>

If private enterprise is permitted to rob the community this year as it did last, many of the small pastoralists, and many of the farmers, will suffer. The Government should make an effort immediately to use the channels that are used by private enterprise. If they cannot get supplies through the Indian Government, they can do so through the manufacturers of jute, or through the agents of the manufacturers. What can be done by Messrs. Dalgety and Co. and other importing firms can be done by the Commonwealth Government. </para>

                        <para>- On Friday last I thought that I had said all that it was necessary for me to say in connexion with this Bill, and that I could defer until after the delivery of the Budget what I had to say about the finances of the Commonwealth. But the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> yesterday moved a peculiar amendment. He is anxious to gain political kudos for his party, by making it appear that they alone desire that boys of eighteen shall not enlist without their parents&#39; consent. The matter could have been raised more properly in connexion with the Defence Bill, or some other measure, but the honorable member was afraid that the Government would revoke the regulation to which he objects. I do not approve of that regulation, and I hope that Ministers may go further in amending it than the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has promised to go. I think youths under twenty-one years of age should not be allowed to enlist if their parents have solid and reasonable objections to them doing so. </para>

                        <para>- If the question is put straightforwardly before the House, I would, but I am not to be drawn into voting for an amendment which has been moved as a political dodge, and which, if carried, would defeat a Bill of which I approve. I know what games are played at election times, and how such votes are misrepresented. Damaging statements are circulated behind one&#39;s back which there is no chance to explain. Therefore I shall state my present position. I would have supported a straight out motion affirming the desirability of preventing boys of eighteen from enlisting without their parents&#39; consent, but I shall not vote for an amendment which would defeat a Bill which is necessary for the proper conduct of the war, because unless we raise the money asked for, our soldiers cannot be properly equipped and paid, nor can the necessary reinforcements be provided. Therefore I shall vote against the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I am not, There is not much principle about honorable members who accuse one of all sorts of things, without producing any evidence in support of their charges, and then leave the chamber before one has an opportunity to reply to them. I am not here to bolster up the Opposition by supplying them with political food. The Government are seeking authority in this Bill to raise a loan of &#163;80,000,000, to enable us to prosecute the war to a successful issue. We are in this struggle, and we must see it through. That being so, it behoves the members of all parties to pull together, and to make the best of the position as we find it. Reinforcements, we know, must be provided; and if the Government say it is necessary to provide them in this way, I am quite prepared to accept that position. But until they show that this necessity exists, I hope they will prevent the enlistment of youths without their parents&#39; consent. </para>

It is not for the Acting Prime Minister to come down here and offer us a compromise. Let us wipe the thing out in its entirety. Apart from the methods adopted by the various schools of thought in regard to the conduct of this war in Europe, the fact must impress itself upon honorable members upon both sides of the chamber that it is now proposed to take the undeveloped youths of Australia and to put them into the most damnable position in which humanity has ever been placed. </para>

                        <para>- They are fighting for me no more than for the honorable gentleman. Indeed, it is not my opinion that they are fighting for me at all. No doubt it is their opinion; but upon this matter I claim the right to express my opinion. It is proposed to take these youths in their undeveloped state, and to force them to go through all the hardships incidental to modern warfare hardships which break up the strongest men physically and mentally. In the absence of their parents&#39; consent, I say it is a crime to take the undeveloped youths of this country and to cripple them mentally and physically by subjecting them to the horrors of modern warfare. The honorable member for Grampians knows that when he was seventeen or eighteen years of age, he was a bit more romantic than he is at present. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly I have not. But whether I have advanced from the stage of romance or not does not now concern me. I am merely pointing out that youths are more filled with the love of adventure than are men of mature years. The Government have removed the necessity for these lads obtaining the consent of their parents or guardians prior to enlisting, and they have done so deliberately, in order that they may play upon their youthful ardour. The truth is that Ministers have been forced into that position in order that they may maintain themselves in office. Owing to the attitude taken up by the people of this country in regard to conscription, the recruits offering have not. been up to the standard required by the Government, and consequently Ministers have been forced to do something; but, to my mind, they have gone to the wrong end of the scale. Of course, it is quite open to honorable members opposite to say to me, &#34; If you are so concerned about these young men, why do you not enlist yourself?&#34; I have no desire to shirk that position. I say that I am not at the Front because I do not believe I ought to be there. I do not recognise that we are fighting for the conditions that prompted Australia to enter this war.

                        <para>- I am no advocate of returning the islands or the other possessions to Germany, but in harmony with the decision arrived at by the Australian Labour Conferences, and by the British Labour party, the question of the ownership of these territories can be very easily determined by placing all disputed lands under international control, unless honorable members opposite seek to carry out their policy, which has been disclosed by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> that very old policy which we used to see displayed on cards in our windows and decorating our walls, &#34; What we have we will hold, and what we have not we are after.&#34; The instructions given to the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy to insist upon Australia&#39;s retention of the Pacific territories which belonged to the enemy prior to August, 1914, are in keeping with other agreements that have been entered into by the Allies, about which we. were not allowed to know anything. The treaty of. 1915 with Italy provides, among other things, that Italy shall receive the district of Trentino and the Southern Tyrol. </para>

If the honorable member for the Barrier will alter his motion of dissent from my ruling he will meet my objection. When I called him to order he was discussing peace treaties or alliances with Italy, and I ruled that that was outside the scope both of the amendment and of the motion for the second reading of the Bill. In this form the honorable member&#39;s motion of dissent is not a correct interpretation of my ruling, and I therefore refuse to accept it. </para>

There is no peace treaty with Italy, and you misunderstood the treaty I wished to discuss, consequently my motion of dissent correctly states -my position.

I have ruled that the discussion of treaties or alliances in which we have no part, and for which no part of the money proposed to be borrowed is to be applied, is not in order. So long as the honorable member confines himself to any purpose for which the money raised for the war purposes, of Australia is to be applied he will be in order, and I shall allow him to proceed; but if he proceeds on the lines that he was about to follow, the responsibilities; of my office cast on me the duty of calling him to order, and of asking him to confine himself to the question. If the honorable member is willing to take that course I shall not intervene. It is, therefore,, for the honorable member to say now whether he will proceed with his motion; of dissent or not. </para>

                        <para>- One of the objects for which we are in the present war is the securing to Italy of the  Trentino  and the  Isonzo,  and also that province of Austria known as Dalmatia. By agreement between Italy, France, England, and Russia, that territory was to be secured to Italy at the conclusion of the war. The full rights secured to the Sultan of &#39; Turkey in what is known as  Lybia,  in North Africa, by the treaty of Lausanne, were to be taken over by Italy, and another strip of territory in Africa to the north-east of Abyssinia was to be granted to Italy, with the stipulation that if Britain and France increased their possessions in Africa at the expense of Germany, Italy was to be accorded equal rights, too. These agreements, which have been entered into by the methods of secret diplomacy, without the consent or the knowledge of the peoples who constitute the Allied nations, were not the objects which the Australian people believed their Forces would be utilized to attain, nor were they the objects for which men volunteered, and are still volunteering, to go from Australia. There was another agreement granting Constantinople and the Straits to Russia. At the time the Australian troops were scaling the heights of Gallipoli they were being utilized because it was necessary to secure to Russia the right to occupy Constantinople and the Straits. When the Russian revolution occurred, the documents which were in the possession of the Czar&#39;s Government were unearthed and made public. The <inline font-style="italic">Manchester Guardian</inline> published telegrams and correspondence forming part of the negotiations between Russia, France, and Great Britain. Amongst these telegrams was one from the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated 5th March, 1915, as follows: - </para>

                    <para>The French Ambassador, on behalf of his Government, announced to me that France was prepared to take up a most favorable attitude in the matter of the realization of our desires as set out in my telegram to you, No. 937, in respect of the Straits and Constantinople, for which I charged you to tender Delcasse my gratitude. </para>
                    <para>Inhis conversations with you, Delcasse had previously more than once given his assurance that we could rely upon the sympathy of France, and only referred to the need of elucidating the question of the attitude of England, from whom he feared some objections, before he could give us more definite assurance in the above sense. Now the British Government has given its complete consent in writing to the annexation, by Russia, of the Straits and Constantinople, within the limits indicated by us, and only demanded security for its economic interests, and a similar benevolent attitude on our part to the political aspirations of England in other parts. For me, personally filled as I am with most complete confidence in Delcasse, the assurance received from him is quite sufficient; but this Imperial Government would desire a more definite pronouncement of France&#39;s assent to the complete satisfaction of our desires similar to that made by the British Government.

                    <para>.- The fact that we are called upon to deal with a Loan Bill of this magnitude shows what vast responsibility is accumulating on the country. Last September we staggered the public of Australia by authorizing a loan of &#163;80,000,000, and today we are asked to authorize another similar loan. As a people who desire to retain our sovereignty, and to whom the very word &#34; repudiation &#39;&#39; is abhorrent, we must carefully take account of our responsibilities. We had yesterday a very clear statement of the financial position of the Commonwealth and the States, and the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> showed us that at present our interest liability is nearly &#163;11,000,000. I am sure that when we realize the fresh responsibility we are taking on, and the impossibility of determining just when this war will end, together with our indebtedness for pensions, the support of dependants, and repatriation, it is not an outside estimate to say that, if the war ends in another twelve months, the Commonwealth will be called on to provide at least &#163;25,000,000 more in taxation than in previous years. That is a tremendous obligation to come upon a people who as. taxpayers of the States have in the past failed to carry on their businesses for even one year without resort to loan money. The position is one which must cause us the gravest apprehension. </para>

                <para>Perhaps at this stage it is very difficult for us to say how we can reduce our war expenditure. No member of this House, and no man in this country, is more inclined to pacific methods than I am ; but I say straight out that it seems utterly impossible to bring about peace without a humiliating surrender and the laying down of all those precious liberties and privileges which have been our heritage. This war evidently cannot at present be accelerated to a great degree or stopped by any action of the Commonwealth of Australia. We are too insignificant in such a mighty struggle; but by a cowardly and unconditional surrender we would, I think, militate against the realization of our hopes as far as the maintenance of a free Australia is concerned. I believe that honestly, and I say that whilst I am prepared to vote for the Bill, it is simply because I can see no alternative for a man who loves his country but to take up all the responsibilities which the war has thrust upon us from the beginning. If we are not prepared to do that, we must consider the question of absolutely withdrawing our men from the Front, setting up on our own, and taking upon ourselves the national responsibilities at a moment when there is no security for people situated as we are. If we had not the foundation principles of true patriotism, if we had not love for the country from which our fathers have sprung, if we had not regard for those principles of liberty given to us by the  Constitution  which we possess; if we had not regard for all these things, we would be confronted with the necessity of taking a determined stand in regard to this war. Evidently there is nothing else 1 for it. I am confirmed in the belief that war can never bring true freedom or higher civilization to this world of ours. But what it can do is to preserve for us the liberty at least of retaining arid, improving our existing institutions, and perhaps enable the nations of the world engaged in this struggle to evolve a system of free institutions which at all events will make Avar impossible iu the future. To say that, simply by war itself, we can establish that principle of freedom which comes from the recognition of true justice in our every relationship with our fellows is, to my mind, an absolute impossibility. </para>
                <para>But there is no reason why we should not face the conditions as they appear to us, however cruel they may seem to the idealist. Therefore, since this money must be obtained, we should approach the question of how it is to be made avail- able. I think the Government are wise, even at this belated moment, in doing away with a principle which, in my judgment, should never have been introduced, namely, the exemption of bondholders from taxation. That principle never appealed to me, even when the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fisher)</inline> incorporated it in the first Loan Bill, and when the ex-Treasurer (Lord Forrest) was dealing with a similar measure last year I supported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton&#39;s</inline> amendment to substitute the payment of a higher rate of interest, with the object of making bond-holders subject to taxation. </para>

That is a policy I cannot subscribe to. I am pleased to know, however, that the Government are determined for the future to make subscribers to war loans subject to the ordinary laws of taxation. </para>

                <para>In my references to this matter I would like to make a suggestion to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> although I know it is one which will not find favour with a number of people. We are told that out of the &#163;241,000,000 of total income .derived by the people, about &#163;114,000,000 is returned  by people whose income exceeds &#163;156 but is under &#163;1,000; and that &#163;34,000,000 only is paid by people whose incomes are over &#163;1,000 a year. Seeing how necessary it is for every section of the community to put money, in large or small amounts, into our war loans, it appears to me that we can only expect to secure an* appreciable addition to the sums already provided by the people, by offering inducements so as to increase the number of bond-holders. I see no reason, therefore, why we should not have Commonwealth lotteries with war bonds as prizes. I see no reason why any people who in the past, have been in the habit of having gambling transactions with Tattersalls sweeps, should not be able to pay their 5s. and 10s. at any post-office throughout Australia and have a chance in a lottery in which the prizes would be war bonds. I suggest to the Treasurer that the experiment of at least a lottery of &#163;1,000,000, with &#163;800,000 of war bonds as prizes, should be launched and be continued according to the appetite of the people for such lotteries. There is nothing in such a principle that can offend the susceptibilities of people who now readily engage in all sorts of lotteries for charitable and patriotic purposes, and I am sure that the principle will commend itself to a large number of our people who do not pay taxes, but who believe in engaging in a game of chance, and endeavouring to make a short cut to fortune. If we had a lottery of that kind, the cost in connexion with it would be very small. The greater part of the 20 per cent. could be paid into a war debt liquidation fund, and the interest on the &#163;800,000 worth of bonds allotted as prizes should be fixed at 5 per cent., the Government having the first right to purchase if the stock were being sold. In this way we should disseminate war bonds throughout the length and breadth of the country, and any man who had 5s., 10s., or &#163;1 could invest it in the lottery. We hear a great deal about the evils of Tattersall&#39;s sweeps, whereby boys are tempted to rob the master&#39;s till. I am suggesting how we may institute a system that will be more profitable to the Government, and offer greater advantages to the investor than does Tattersall&#39;s sweep, having regard to the very heavy claims made by the people conducting it, and by the Government in the form of taxation, as well as other deductions, which are very serious to the winners of large prizes, for &#34; squaring &#34; owners, jockeys, and trainers. I know that a section of the community will say that my proposals represent the legalizing of gambling; but as I walked down the street to-day, I purchased a ticket for a raffle, in which the first prize is a &#163;100 war bond, and the second prize a &#163;50 war bond, and there are 988 other prizes varying in value from &#163;20 to 5s. Who would take exception to those ladies selling lottery tickets as they sell tickets for the Red Cross raffles ? People who would adopt such a pharisaical attitude are those who place their best goods in the shop window, use all sorts of attractions to deceive the unwary, and invest their money in speculative enterprises with which patriotic principle has nothing whatever to do, and yet hold themselves blameless. As a native-born Australian who has never been a gambler, except as a farmer gambling with the seasons, I see no harm in a system such as I am suggesting, and which would implant in the minds of the people who thoughtlessly rush for profit the fact that they can gratify their speculative taste by investing in a war-bond lottery ticket, and at the same time render substantial assistance to their country. </para>

Those gentlemen may be ultimately confronted with the claims of people who will advocate the repudiation of the public debt of Australia on account of the huge load of interest to which I have called attention, and who will say, &#34; It certainly will be hard on the bond-holders, but, in the interests of the vast majority of groaning taxpayers, it should be done.&#34; The principle is the same in both cases. If it is right that the property of certain people should be absolutely confiscated, I, as a man who is utterly opposed in principle to giving all sorts of licence and liberty to people to debase themselves through drink, as one who has never indulged in intoxicating drink, and has no interest at all in the liquor trade, say that those who may advocate the repudiation of the public debt for the sake of the common good, will have just as solid a justification behind them. There is no equity behind the claim of either, in my opinion. I am suggesting to the Treasurer a means by which he may wipe out purely gambling businesses, and at the same time help to foster the spirit of patriotism amongst the vast majority of the people of Australia. </para>

                <para>As. well as collecting money for the war, and doing all that is humanly possible to provide reinforcements for sending overseas, we have other duties to perform, the pressing necessity for which the war has brought home to our doors. Is it not a reflection upon the people and Governments of Australia that in this country, which produces the most and best wool of any country in the world, we should have to pay an almost fabulous price for any article of woollen manufacture? If we require a pair of boots, or any other leather goods, that ought to be made in this country more cheaply than in any other country, because of the raw material being so plentiful, we are asked to pay exorbitant rates. Yet, notwithstanding that nearly 300,000 of our men have left the country, a large number of the people are out of work, and we are seeking employment for returned soldiers. Cannot we do something to develop our industries, and give the people cheaper goods? It is true that machinery may be lacking, but are we using to the fullest extent the machinery that is available? We are not. We are endeavouring to meet our tremendous obligations in this war by simply juggling with the small amount of production that we carried on in normal times, and by mortgaging posterity. There is no reason why we should not make some real attempt to establish industries in Australia. We must do so or else we shall perish financially, our people will remain unemployed, and our position become untenable. </para>
                <para>As a farmer, and one whose living has chiefly been obtained from growing wheat, meat, and wool, I have not joined in a claim made by a large section of my class for impossible guarantees, such as 5s. per bushel net for wheat to the farmers. I realize that even if it were possible to get a Government to so embarrass itself as to accede to such a claim the effect would be to make the position of the consumers of Australia, in which farmers are deeply concerned, much worse than it is at the present time. It would mean that the Australian consumer would be compelled to pay 5s. 6d. or 5s.. 8d. per bushel for the wheat used in the manufacture of the bread he consumes - a much higher price than we can hope to get for the bulk of the crop when sold overseas. Every section of the community should be called upon to make some sacrifice in connexion with the establishment of our industries. Some attempt was made in this House in the case of the two wool-top manufacturing indus tries that have been so successful since the beginning of the war, and have earned profits in which the Commonwealth has equally participated, to make those carrying on the industry pay a better price to the wool-grower than is paid by the British Government. I believe that an advantage of 10 per cent. is given to other woollen mills in Australia. That is a good principle. and it ought to be extended. Now that we are making big profits on wool, meat, metals, and so forth sent overseas, we should be prepared to make concessions to these industries, upon which we must depend after the war. I hope that some sincerity will be exhibited in this House in standing up for Australian productions. </para>
                <para>In voting for this very necessary measure for supplies for our troops and the conduct of the war, I am placed in a difficult position by the suggestions which have been made through the amendment in connexion with the regulation relieving minors, desiring to enlist, of their obligations to their parents. I am certainly rot in favour of that regulation, but I do not feel disposed to permit the Opposition to take charge of Government business, and I am not prepared to fight even for this principle in which I believe in order to assist the Opposition to belittle the Government in dealing with a measure of this kind. The members of the party on this side whose votes are not controlled by the Government will surely find a means of giving expressions to their will when it is ascertained. It is clear from the important concessions already made in this connexion in the speech delivered by the Acting Prime Minister, that the desire of the majority on this side will prevail. I am not prepared to permit honorable members opposite to compel honorable members on this side to accept even principles in which they believe in a manner distasteful to us, and intended to humiliate the Government we support. From the statement made by the Acting Prime Minister, it now appears that only a few disobedient lads over nineteen years of age will be able to enlist against their parents&#39; will, and even in their case, if the parents have good reason to offer against their enlistment, they have only to go before the Recruiting Committee in  each State and present their case to them. </para>
                <para>If it be true that foreigners who have become naturalized in our country are being forcibly deported, that, in my opinion, is an injury to the freedom of the people of Australia and the policy of voluntarism, to which this country is wedded, and which I have always espoused, and would be an immeasurably greater offence than would be the enlistment of minors even against the will of their parents. It is stated that no naturalized subject has been deported, and I hope that statement is true. I trust that good and sufficient reasons can be given for the action taken by the Government to give effect to the desire of the Government of an Allied Power in regard to subjects of that Power who are not naturalized in Australia. </para>
                <para>I shall not take up time in referring to what other speakers have said, more particularly with respect to the farmers. But I wish to say, as a farmer who has grown wheat for the last twenty-seven years at an average of 2s. 9d. per bushel on the farm, that we are not so destitute of backbone or of true patriotism as to desire to exploit the Australian consumer or our Allies, who are looking forward longingly to the time when our wheat and other food supplies may reach them. We are willing to make large concessions in their favour, but we ask in return that we shall be protected from the robberies that are perpetrated under the system of profiteering that is in existence. We ask that we shall be protected in regard to the things that are necessary for our production, and in return we shall be prepared to make large concessions in regard not only to wheat, but also in regard to meat and wool. There seems to be a catch-as-catch-can business going on. As one who believes that the systems of production and distribution that have gradually been evolved in this very imperfect world of ours have been shown to be utterly rotten and false in the test of the present great war, I trust that after all our sacrifice of blood is over, and when the world comes to reason again, a better system will be evolved under which that selfishness which is such a factor in bringing about war between individuals, nations, and empires will be eradicated from the world . </para>

I need not have risen to speak to-night had I desired to evade this question, and I can only express the hope that, as the result of the deliberations of the New South Wales Cabinet, the State Parliament will soon meet and pass this necessary legislation, which will remove one of the obstacles to successful recruiting in the largest State of the Union. </para>

I submit that&#39; it is not the question of the petition itself that is involved. The honorable member desires to refer to action on the part of the military authorities in seizing the petition, and he would not be in order in doing so when members are asked, on the House meeting to-morrow, whether they have any petitions to present. </para>

The honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> indicated that he intended to bring under the notice of the House a petition which, he said, had been seized by the military authorities. He cannot do so in this irregular way. He will be in order -in making a general reference to the matter by way of complaint against any departmental officer, but he will not be in order at this stage in reading either the heading or any portion of the petition itself. </para>

                        <para>- This petition was seized by the military, and the heading to every copy of it cut off. The signatures were left in the possession of the petitioners without anything to indicate the subject-matter of the petition itself. What is the use of bringing in a petition which consists simply of a heading, and of presenting that to Parliament, only to find that the machinery of Parliament is utilized to suppress the facts? As for the heading itself, there is not one word in it, so far as I am able to judge, that is in any way calculated to hinder the winning of the war, or is detrimental to recruiting. The position is on a par with the action taken by honorable members opposite throughout. There is one place which is supposed to be available to the people when all other resources have failed, where they may be able to ventilate their grievances. That is in Parliament, through their parliamentary representatives. But now we find that, apparently, every point possible is utilized against the representatives of the people by those in power to prevent the expression within Parliament of what is going on outside. We find to-day that the press is well muzzled, that members of Parliament, too, are well muzzled. Their <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> speeches even are subject to censorship. </para>

This is the first time within my experience that any honorable member has been pulled up in such a way. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire briefly to draw attention again to the question of the issue of medals to women relatives of soldiers. The Minister, when I asked my question early in to-day&#39;s sitting, advised me to place it on the business-paper. I am sorry that I have not done so. For that reason I again ask if he will do something in the matter. The Minister knows the subject well; a deputation has expounded it to him.  I have been asked again to-day to move in the matter. Women have written me letters asking that I should press for something definite. The Jewellers Association are annoyed that the contract is to be given to persons outside the trade which is causing so much delay. </para>

                    <para>.- I join with the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> in lodging an emphatic protest against the action of the Military Department in interfering with the free right of citizens to protest to Parliament against what they consider a grievance of the administration. I would have been satisfied with the statement of the honorable member had it not been that he has found himself in some confusion as to how to meet the Standing Orders. Very often one finds that theStanding Orders and the forms of the House appear to be devised for the purpose of suppressing speech and the freedom and liberty of honorable members in the discussion of subjects which they should be permitted to ventilate. A petition which has been seized by the military, and is not allowed to be circulated for signature, cannot come before Parliament, and, consequently, one finds oneself under a difficulty in dealing with the matter. If the motion for the adjournment of the House does not afford an opportunity to speak on the subject, it is hard to imagine what item of business would provide the occasion for ventilating what is a real grievance. The petition is one of five clauses, setting forth the grievances under which certain Italians feel that they are suffering. </para>

It seems to me extraordinary that the Standing Orders should not permit of record being made of the tyranny which is being exercised by the Defence Department. </para>
