Yesterday the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archibald-)</inline> asked him a question respecting the exportation of leather. The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> and myself had previously asked similar questions. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> however, makes it appear that I am the only person who desires to obtain shipping space for the exportation of leather to the Old Country. </para>

                        <para>- There is really no occasion for the House to adjourn for any long period, unless Ministers wish to avoid very wholesome and necessary criticism. Let me illustrate the necessity  for  this criticism. The Government has no mind of its own, and often makes up what  it  calls its mind in a wrong way, proposing most extraordinary things. The other day it issued a regulation allowing the enlistment of boys of eighteen without their parents&#39; consent. Parliament was in session, and honorable members criticised the regulation, and the Government backed down. If we go into recess, the Government, which represents, may I say the stupid party- </para>

                        <para>- Then I withdraw the expression. If we go into recess, the Government is bound to make deplorable mistakes. This week it has made a deplorable mistake in refusing to give effect to the twice-repeated recommendation  of  the Inter-State Commission to fix the price of meat. If the supporters of the Government bring their influence to bear, as no doubt some of them will, Ministers will retreat from this position, as they have retreated from their position regarding the enlistment of boys of 18. Apparently the Government will back down from anything in order to keep office. If we can only keep Parliament sitting, the country will be well governed, but if the Government are allowed to go into recess they will make blunders every week. </para>

Ministers generally are a very amiable lot of men, and I am sure that nobody could be more anxious to carry out the duties of Acting Prime Minister in a manner honorable  to  himself and beneficial to the country than the honorable member for Balaclava. But for some reason or other  he  is unable to do so, and he is adopting a course which is calculated to make him a bigger failure as the Leader of the Government than his most bitter enemy hopes that he may be. </para>

I do not wish the honorable gentleman to forsake his present role for one which the honorable member for . Batman seems to regard as more natural to him - that of a fighter who does best in Opposition. The Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy never have been able to forget that they have been in Opposition, and they carry the tactics of Oppositionists on to the Treasury bench. </para>

                        <para>- I was about to urge as a reason why Parliament should not go into recess that there is a great deal of business to be done by Parliament. The Government cannot advance as an argument in support of the motion that they have not time in which to carry out the duties which devolve upon them, because the Boards to which I have referred do a considerable portion of the governmental and Ministerial work. It would be better in the interests of the country if Parliament were to continue sitting. Although it might be disconcerting to Ministers to bo subject to criticism, we should remain here and deal with the important matters which the Government stated in their Ministerial programme would be submit ted to Parliament. We are promised some very necessary amending industrial legislation. Apparently we are not to get that. We were led to believe that the Government are anxious to protect the industries of Australia and develop both the primary and the secondary industries. Could we not well employ our time in discussing the Tariff ? </para>

                        <para>- I am opposed to the motion. I do not think that the House should meet on Tuesday with the object of rising at the end of a week for several months. The House meeting in the ordinary course on Wednesday, and continuing to meet for a considerable time in future, has a great deal of very important business to attend to, and I record my opposition to the Government taking Parliament into recess so that they may, behind the backs of the people, pursue their mischievous activities free of parliamentary control. The only other observation I wish to make is that it is very unseemly for the Government to seek to hasten business? by meeting on Tuesday and rushing through our deliberations, in view of the fact that only the day before yesterday a Minister rose in his place to prevent, by the application of the &#34; gag,&#34; the discussion of very important matters in this chamber. I do not wish to lend my countenance to the proposed strike on the part of the Government. </para>

                    <para>.- I can well understand that the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> who is a resident of Melbourne, is anxious to keep the House sitting, but we who represent far distant electorates in other States are tied to Melbourne when Parliament is sitting continuously, and we are anxious to visit our electorates sometimes. We have very important work to do in the country in connexion with recruiting. The House has been fitting for six weeks, and, on the whole, our sittings during the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the present Government compare very favorably with the records of Parliament when led by a Labour Government, of which the honorable member was a supporter. </para>

                        <para>- Order! A moment ago I appealed to honorable members not to interject, but to allow speakers to be heard in silence. But the honorable member for Yarra had no sooner risen to address the House than he was immediately interrupted. Whilst the  Speaker  does not take notice of occasional interjections, the trouble is that one interjection often leads to a running fire of interruptions. I must, therefore, insist that honorable members who. are, addressing the Chair shall be heard in silence. </para>

The Acting Prime Minister informed me that it was his intention to move that the House should meet on Tuesday next with a view to a lengthly adjournment at the end of the week, and that the Government would introduce a Bill to grant Supply for three months. Of course, every honorable member on the Government side will swallow: that proposal. If the Government asked for Supply for six months honorable members would swallow it in the same way and without criticising it. </para>

                        <para>- I had no desire to misrepresent any one; I was merely pointing out that I objected to the House meeting on Monday next, since that is the King&#39;s Birthday. With that exception, I am willing that the House should meet every Monday. I do not think we should have long adjournments ; and if it will suit the convenience of honorable members from distant States to meet on Mondays there is no reason why we should not do so. I wish to make it absolutely clear to the House, and the people generally, that it is not the desire of the Labour party that Parliament should go into recess. We are here to do the business of the country. There is still plenty of business on the notice-paper, and I fail to see why we should not proceed with it. I think we ought to meet next Tuesday, but I object to the reasons which have been given for the Government proposal, and if it is to be assumed that in supporting the motion I am in favour of Parliament going almost immediately into recess I certainly shall not do so. </para>

                    <para>. - I have great pleasure in supporting the motion, since I have always been opposed to the abolition of Tuesday sittings. Honorable members who come from distant States and cannot return to their homes during the week-ends have to remain here from Friday afternoon until Wednesday afternoon for the resumption of the business of Parliament. Thus more than half their time is wasted in waiting for the House to meet. I hope that we shall sit at least four days a week instead of two and a half days, as at present. If the records of the two Houses be examined it will be found that our sittings are shorter than those of any other Parliament in the British Dominions. </para>

During the greater portion of our sittings, however, it is the invariable practice for Ministers to retire from the chamber and to attend to departmental business. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so, but even on the sitting days Ministers are free to devote every morning to Departmental business. The abolition of the Tuesday sittings took place only three years ago. The prime mover in the agitation for its abolition was the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McDonald),</inline> who advocated that we should meet only three days a week That agitation was successfully fought for many years, but finally it was deeded that, as a temporary expedient, we should do away with the Tuesday sitting, and that practice has continued ever since. I believe the great majority of honorable members would strongly favour our meeting four days a week, and I hope that the Government will move at once in that direction. </para>

                <para>I have asked honorable members of the Labour party why so many of them practically repeat what others have said in the same debates. The answer they gave  ire  is to this effect: &#34;We  represent  different constituencies, and in each of those constituencies there are representatives of Labour in the shearing sheds or mining camps, whose duty it is during &#34; smoko &#34; or dinner hour to read from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the reports of our speeches only.&#34; The consequence of this is that arguments are repeated in Parliament over and over again by honorable members opposite merely that their constituents may be able to read what they say. If <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> were abolished, such speeches would not be made, nor would we have such long sittings. We would settle down to solid business, just as the directors of a public or private company do. Such men do not attempt, at their meetings, to speak to the outside public. They have no desire to get some public kudos for having said a smart thing about a fellow director as the Labour party do about the Prime Minister or any men: ber of the Government; they devote their attention to the business put before them. They deal with that business in a businesslike way, and in the shortest possible time. Time is money, and, while honorable members are wasting it, the officers and every one connected with the Parliament have to be paid, and the lighting bill is increased. </para>

I appeal to them to endeavour to arrive at an arrangement by which we shall be able to have longer sittings weekly, and deal with our business promptly, so that, when we do adjourn, we may have an opportunity to visit our constituencies and to attend personally to their interests. As it is, we have to deal by correspondence with most matters relating to our constituents. If such an arrangement were made, it would also give Ministers a better opportunity to attend to the work of their Departments. If that work is to be properly done, it is absolutely essential that they should be able to spend some time in their Departments.

We are now told that we should meet on Tuesday next so as to expedite business. The Government are anxious to rush important measures through the House next week, so that Parliament may go into recess for two or three months. I am not opposed to sitting on an extra day. I would sit every day in the &#62;week except .Sundays in order that the business of the country might be done, for which we were elected. The great influence at work in reducing the days of sitting was exercised by those honorable members who return each week to their particular State.

                        <para>- One reason given for  having  a recess is that honorable members should have the opportunity of taking their places on recruiting platforms The great complaint that I have heard from the mothers, wives, and dependants of soldiers, and one that must militate against recruiting, is the present high cost of living. Why cannot the House devote attention to that matter? Reports have been presented which should be considered. It is work which should engage our attention in the near future. I shall vote against the motion as a protest against the closing of the people&#39;s Parliament when the representatives of the people should be here defending their rights, and seeing that the Ministry, which is hourly making mistakes, does not make greater blunders in the future. </para>

                    fowler  (Perth)  &#91;11.47&#93;.-  It appears to me that  under  existing circumstances it does not matter much whether the House sits on Tuesdays or not. If the Government were fully seized of their responsibilities in the present grave situation of the Empire they would ask us to sit, not only on Tuesdays, but also on Saturdays and Sundays, in order to evolve some scheme by which Australia could take its share in the awful war which is facing us in a way that ought to make us serious beyond all measure. Even as I speak the greatest battle that has ever happened upon this earth is raging. One of the fairest portions of Europe is being devastated and made a hell of by war, and along the whole of that dreadful and long-drawn battle line brave men, who have thrown themselves across the path of the enemy to save us and the world from the ravages of savagery, are falling maimed and bleeding. Our soldiers are dying there or are lying dead in tens of thousands, in order that Australia may be preserved from the ravages of Belgium and the massacres of Servia. Yet we are here day after day twiddling about immaterial matters as if these dreadful things were happening on another planet. In God&#39;s name, what are we here for? Have we no duty before us? Are we blind as bats that we should remain indifferent before such appalling circumstances? Do not the very stones of this building cry out to us, and demand that we should do something to restore the good name of Australia and reinforce that splendid remnant of our brave men at the Front, who, as things are going on, will only return a mere handful to Australia ? And then God help us, who shall  have to look them in the face, and acknowledge our betrayal of them. I pray to the Almighty that before the House rises this Government and this Parliament will awaken to their duties and responsibilities, and that we shall not be shamed in the eyes of the whole world, or in the eyes of the children of Australia, who, in future generations, must curse us, while they bear the brunt of our ineptitude and our cowardice.

                        <para>- The impression I gathered from the remarks of the Acting Prime Minister was that the purpose of sitting for an extra day was to complete the business and close Parliament at the conclusion of next week. If that is the purpose of the motion I am opposed to it. If the Acting Prime Minister will say that it is not the purpose of the motion, but that the object is to have an extra sitting day, and go right ahead with business, and not close Parliament at the end of next week, I am prepared to vote for it. It is most important that we should continue the sittings of the House. There are great problems confronting the country. Are we to close the House and allow those problems to solve themselves % Are we to allow the cost of living to solve itself - a matter which is agitating the public mind to-day and causing discontent from one end of the community to the other ? We should keep the House together, and seriously tackle these questions which are troubling the people. There are important notices of motion on the business-paper submitted by private members. If the Government have no policy of their own to submit to the House in order to deal with those all-absorbing problems which confront us today, let them afford private members an opportunity to discuss their motions, and attempt to solve those problems. I believe that every honorable member would be prepared to do his best towards solving them. We are handling great business deals; we are entering into commercial undertakings under powers that are given to us by the war legislation which we are exercising, but the moment the war is over those powers will go from us automatically. Has the Acting Prime Minister considered the chaotic position which will arise when we are suddenly deprived of those powers ? Have the Government no policy to put forward in order to deal with those post-war problems which will confront us? Their attempt to close Parliament is a clear admission on their part that they are not capable of administering the affairs of the country. They have no policy. </para>

                        <para>- Merely to say, &#34; Thank God, I am not as bad as the other cove, &#34; is not to say that one is sane. I do not know that the honorable member&#39;s assertion is very much to the credit of the Government. It came into office with a great flourish of trumpets about winning the war. It claimed that it was the only Government which could solve the problems arising out of the war, and yet we find that it is devoid of all practical suggestions, and rushes headlong to shut up Parliament so that no criticism may be levelled at it on account of its lack of policy. It is a scandalous state of affairs that in the midst of the great crisis through which we are passing to-day, when all these vast problems confront us, and when there are greater problems to be faced after the war, the Government has nothing but a policy of hush, a policy of shutting the mouths of the representatives of the people by closing Parliament, so that Ministers may sit down comfortably in their offices, and be free from criticism. It is about time that honorable members realized their duty, and put this Government out of office, replacing it by one which will have a policy and which will be capable of conducting the affairs of the country. </para>

                        <para>- I do so, but I consider that the Standing Orders Committee should be got together at an early date for the purpose of enabling more time to be given for carrying on the business of the country, and leaving matters of grievance out of question for the time being. If ever there was a time when not an hour should be lost in dealing with matters of a practical character, it is the present. In regard to the suggestion of the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser),</inline> I am quite in accord with him, and with those who reside in Queensland or Western Australia, that the present system is irksome to them, but those who have had experience of State Parliaments know that the more sitting days that are made available for honorable members to talk, the more they will talk. If we sat on every day in the week we would not make any further progress. I will give an illustration of the absurdity of some honorable members&#39; proposals. In 1910, when I had the good fortune to be returned to this House, the Labour party were very enthusiastic, and they conceived the idea that parliamentary proceedings should be conducted on the eight-hours&#39; principle. They, therefore, decided that the House should meet at 10.30 o&#39;clock in the morning and rise punctually at 10 o&#39;clock at night. But the Opposition did not agree with that view. Any one who knew anything about parliamentary proceedings would realize that the proposal was an utterly insane one. </para>

                        <para>- Of course I did. I have supported a good many things in my time, because there is only one way by which parliamentary parties, as well as individuals, can learn things, and that is by experience. The idea was abandoned that very session. Ministers found that they could not carry out their Ministerial duties, and our Liberal friends, who were in Opposition, took good care to see that Parliament continued to sit after the hour fixed for the adjournment. They said that we could sit eight hours if we liked to do so, but that they intended to sit as long as they chose, and they did. Extending the hours of Parliament is an absolute absurdity. It inflicts big hardship on honorable members from New South Wales, South Australia, and Tasmania; and I include the latter because it is just as easy to travel between the island and the mainland, as between either of the capital cities of the two other States. </para>

                        <para>- To an experienced navigator like the honorable gentleman a voyage like that does not mean much discomfort. The present arrangement gives an opportunity to honorable members to spend another day in their  own States with advantage to themselves. Regarding the matter from a non-party point of view we ought to sit here just as long as it is necessary, and the Standing Orders ought to be framed so as to give every facility for carrying on business, and not for wasting time. The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> made a very pathetic speech, with which we all must sympathize, and which I hope will be read by the people outside, who have something to say in the matter. While this dreadful war continues it is nothing short of a crime that we should be under party Government; but honorable members on the other side are embittered by the most bitter&#39; and malignant opposition that can be found in any other country in the world&#39;. </para>

                    <para>. - If I were in order I should be glad to* move that the apologies of the supporters of the Government for the motion be accepted. The honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser),</inline> and the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archibald),</inline> are quite proud to find excuses for the Government, and the former put the matter in a nutshell when he said that the Government must be expected to know what the business of the country is. When we are confronted with a business-paper containing six items, and are told that it is necessary to sit an extra day in order to deal with it, we have an admission by the Government that the business of the country is comprised within those items. But if that is the idea of the Government in regard to the country&#39;s needs, and the policy that should be before Parliament for consideration, I offer strong dissent, for there are most important items waiting to be dealt with. The most appealing speech made by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> cannot remain unheeded ; but the Acting Prime Minister did not suggest that the recess is necessary in order to enable the Government to find a policy, or for Ministers to carry on the business of the country; it is, we are told, to enable honorable members to carry out a policy that Ministers either fail to appreciate or to tackle. If Ministers were to face the position in that regard, probably more would be done than is being done at present. In my opinion it is not necessary to adjourn to allow honorable members to go recruiting, because at the present time they are devoting every available opportunity to that work. We are not here as a recruiting agency, but to perform higher and more important duties. The bill of fare put forward by the Government, as disclosing their policy at this great and momentous epoch, contains only two items of any great importance. One is the Australian Soldiers&#39; Repatriation Bill and the other the Appropriation Bill for repatriation ; and these, I am sure will secure the consideration of Parliament without any reference to party politics. When the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archibald)</inline> suggests that the House is divided by party feeling, I can assure him that, so far as these two measures are concerned, there is no party in the House beyond a united party to look after the interests of the returned soldiers. Therefore the Government need not be worried as to the reception and sympathetic consideration of these two measures. The Defence Bill is a formal matter, and, so far as I can see, will not occupy much time. It takes cognisance of no great principles, and will not seriously affect our different points of view. The Apple Bounty Bill is also a small matter which may be decided by members, not so much on its merits, as with one eye on their constituencies. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member does not know my attitude in regard to the Apple Bounty Bill, and he makes the unkind suggestion that if bananas were in question I should support the measure. What I have said as to the consideration of the Apple Bounty Bill applies, of course, equally to both sides of the House. The only remaining business is the formal matter of Supply. I again emphasize the fact that if the Government find themselves bankrupt of business, there are some twenty-seven notices of motion by private members, which, I am sure, are regarded by those members as worthy our attention. These motions embrace such questions as German trade names, German colonies, and the official representation of Australia in the United States, all of moment at this particular juncture. There is a feeling, I am sure, in the mind of every member that at present we ought to be doing big things; and I say feelingly and thoughtfully that it is fortunate for us that the public of Australia do not at the present time realize how impotent this Parliament is. how foolish our debates are in most cases, and how much time and money is wasted here. If the people did know,&#39; as we know, what is going on in Parliament today, our time would very properly be a very short one. This Parliament is not doing the work it was sent to do, and is not even making an attempt to do it. There are awaiting solution great questions that will call forth the best ability we can supply - will challenge the highest in us - and yet the Government refuse to even discuss them. </para>

I wonder if the Acting Prime Minister would disclose a Cabinet secret if he were honest enough to tell us that this motion is part of an arrangement made when the two Ministers left for London. There was a rumour to the effect that Parliament would soon adjourn after they had gone away, and that only formal business would be attended to, the larger matters being postponed until their return when probably fuller information would be at our disposal. If there is such an arrangement, we would be glad to know the fact. Then, if the Government desire a recess in order to consider those big questions I have referred to, let them say so. </para>

The Government, it seems to me, are taking a leaf out of the book of the Industrial Workers of the World, and adopting a &#34; go slow &#34; policy. </para>

I refer the House to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the debates of 15th December, 1916.

                    <para>.- Had the motion been to fix every Tuesday as a siting day, I should have supported it ; but its object is to speed up work next week so that a Supply Bill for three months may be passed, and Parliament may shut up shop. I object to the Government being allowed to get into recess. Even when Parliament is sitting, our criticism has but little influence on its actions, and honorable members find it difficult to ventilate the grievances of their constituents, but when Parliament is not sitting honorable members are muzzled, and there are the War Precautions Regulations to suppress all criticism of. the Government. This prevents the people from knowing what is taking place in various parts of Australia by the orders of the Ministry. We have men being seized now, and the facts are suppressed. All reference to the subject-matter of the telegrams, about the . removal of which I complained the other afternoon, was carefully kept out of the press by the censor. If any action is taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#34;-</inline></para>

                        <para>- The Government has under its hand the Prussian and every other method of suppressing criticism outside Parliament, and wishes, in addition, to evade parliamentary criticism. Probably when we have adjourned we shall not meet again until the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Joseph Cook)</inline> have returned from England. The Government will be able to carry on under the War Precautions Act, applying its regulations to prevent criticism of Ministerial action. If the proposal were that we should meet every Tuesday, or on every day of the week, except Saturday and Sunday, it would have my&#39; support; but I cannot see why we should alter our procedure merely to hurry through business and get into recess at the end of next week. What could be the Government&#39;s object for proposing this, except to close the mouths of its parliamentary critics, and the actions of the Ministry justify the maximum amount of suspicion ? </para>

                    <para>.- I should not intervene in the debate were it not for the direction in which it has developed. It is now being questioned whether the object for which, we are to adjourn next week is a legitimate one. When the debate opened, I understood that that was not in question, but as it apparently is, I feel bound to say a word or two. In my view, the main reason for the proposed adjournment - Ministers may have additional reasons - is that an opportunity may be afforded to honorable members to do something to bring home to the people the importance of the one vital &#39;question they are faced with to-day . I was in entire sympathy with the speech of the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler).</inline> I agree with him that, if necessary, we should sit day and night to fulfil our duty to Australia. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">But such sittings would not now help the country in the least. What has to he done now must be done, not by Parliament, but by the people, and the immediate duty of honorable members is to go to our constituents and try to help them to realize their obligations, to educate them, so that they may do what at this hour they must do if Australia is to be vindicated. There is one other matter which I wish to refer to. As a new member, coming, perhaps, from an atmosphere different from that in which one moves here, I say that the impression outside is that members of Parliament believe too much in legislation. We cannot do everything by legislation and the passing of rules and regulations, and it is for us now to let the people know what the position of the world is to-day, what their duty is, and what it will mean to them if they fail in that duty. </para>

                    <para>.- The reference of the last speaker to the duty of this House to the nation affords a text for every honorable member to meditate upon. The motion is for an adjournment until Tuesday next, but the ulterior reason is the closing of Parliament at the end of next week. I hold the opinion that Parliament is never more needed than when the people are in trouble. </para>

                        <para>-  I was going to refer to that. Since the war broke out we have passed many War Precautions regulations. Those regulations are prepared by the military authorities, and submitted to the Attorney-General&#39;s Department; but the civil authority should be supreme, and Parliament should have the opportunity to criticise all the regulations made under its Acts, and to prevent the military from doing what it ought not to do. Another matter that troubles my mind and makes me so restless that at times I cannot sleep is the state of our finances. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister has said that it is necessary to have some reprieve from parliamentary criticism, in order that the Government may deal with the finances. I am pointing out that the Estimates do not require much attention from any Minister except the Treasurer. They follow a regular routine, and it is not necessary for Parliament to go into recess in order that Ministers may deal with them., Recently a Board, composed of very able and much-respected men, was appointed to help the Government in dealing with the finances, and I cannot help remembering that those men are conducting large private concerns, for which they are paid high salaries. Can they serve two masters? </para>

                        <para>-  I hope to have another opportunity of dealing with that matter. As one coming from another State, I have no objection to the House sitting four days a week; in fact, I should prefer that course, because I should remain in Melbourne, and my health would not be jeopardized by constant travelling to and from Sydney. During the three years when we sat four days a week, I think we did more work in a week than we now do in two weeks sitting three days weekly, and I believe that Parliament did greater things than in the other fifteen years of its existence. Every measure passed was of a national character, and raised the Commonwealth in the esteem of the world. Experience shows that sitting four days a week is more beneficial to the nation than sitting three days per week, because members settle down better to the business. I do not object to meeting on Tuesday in order to push on with work, but when I know that the ulterior motive of this motion is to prevent honorable members from criticising the actions of the Government, particularly in regard to such matters as the regulation which deprives parents of the control of their boys, I feel that I am justified in voting against it in order to prevent Parliament being closed, and the people&#39;s representatives being deprived of the opportunity to do their work. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Acting Prime Minister, in arranging the dates for the re-assembling of this Parliament, will give more consideration to the circumstances of members who come from distant States. The manner in which we are treated is decidedly unfair; we are given no concession by those honorable members who reside in Melbourne. I make this claim on two grounds : Firstly, in the interests of honorable members who come from far-distant electorates; and, secondly, because I wish to have good administration. I know that when Parliament is sitting from day to day and week to week members of the Ministry have not the opportunity to give that consideration to public affairs which is essential to good administration. At this time we need good administration more than we have needed it at any time in our history. If I said that this House wasted time, and that its conduct is a discredit to the nation, I should be ruled out of order. If I were to congratulate honorable members on the glorious work they are doing, I should be in order, but I should not be telling the truth. I suggest to the Government that either we should limit the space given to each honorable member in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> or that honorable members should be charged out of their salaries so much per inch of space occupied by their speeches. </para>

                        <para>- There seemed to be reluctance last night in the attitude of the Assistant Minister for Defence. It seems to have arisen out of a misunderstanding as to a conversation that took place between us in the party room yesterday. It is true that the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> asked me whether I was going to move the adjournment of the House that afternoon, and that I replied that I did not intend to do so, since I had not completed my reading of the file of papers  His  reply was, &#34; Very well ; that will enable <inline font-style="italic">mp.</inline> to cancel something that I was having done&#34; : and he then went out of. the room. I did not pay much attention to the words actually used, but I understood that what the Minister, really wanted to know was whether I intended to move the adjournment of the House. In his statement last night he said that he asked me whether I was going to deal with the subject that day. I admit that he might have used such words; I am not prepared to say that he did not; but if he did, what I understood him to want to know was whether I intended to move the adjournment of the House. I had previously told him that I intended to do so, and my reply to his inquiry in the party room yesterday was designed to let him know that I did not propose to take that action. In that way, the misunderstanding seems to have originated. During the morning, I had spent three hours in examining the file at the Defence Department. In that time I got through only half of it. When I returned to the House, the remaining half was sent to me by the Minister, and I spent the afternoon in going through it and in preparing a consecutive statement to put before honorable members. The Minister asked me for the file as soon as I had finished with it. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; I have no reason to believe that they were not. On completing my investigation of the file, I handed it over to the Department. I am prepared to admit that the Honorary Minister probably had some justification for his annoyance last night, since he had not had the file long enough to permit of a complete examination of it; but I regret exceedingly the heat displayed by him when replying to my statement. I am sure that, if he had had time for reflection, he would not have used such, language, especially if he had had an opportunity to fully consider the whole of the facts. </para>

                <para>I desire now to say to him, in the best possible spirit, that I had not the slightest intention of misrepresenting the facts, nor do I believe that I did misrepresent them. I emphasized the treatment meted out to this man, not by Defence Ministers, but by two officers whom I specifically mentioned - <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hogan</inline> and Detective Jones. I practically charged those men  -not the Defence Ministers - with having pursued this man on a criminal charge instead of treating him as a returned soldier. I specially stated, at the outset of my remarks, that the man was returned to Australia as a mental case. </para>
                <para>The Honorary Minister now charges me with having failed to mention certain other facts. He read to the House a statutory declaration which was just as confusing and upsetting as the statutory declaration which I read. I would remind him that I did not vouch for the truth of the statements contained in the statutory declaration which I read, nor for the truth of the statement made by the man to me. I said clearly and emphatically that this man, being a mental case, was irresponsible for the statements he made, and had, in fact, made many statements that were obviously false. </para>

The Honorary Minister will remember that, in the course of my speech, I alluded to another Gordon McDonald, who was said to have enlisted in Sydney. I said that there were a lot of complications in connexion with that case, but that they did not seem to bear upon the case I was dealing with, and for that reason I would not go into them. </para>

The Honorary Minister then said that he was not in a position to deal with the matter fully, but honorable members could arrive at their own decision upon the fact&#39;s he had stated.

                        <para>-If so, it is the result of disorderly interjections. I am merely stating certain facts. I feel aggrieved, also, at the statement made by the Honorary Minister that I could not have been desirous of helping this soldier by bringing his case forward in the way I had done. My whole object, as a matter of fact, was to induce the Defence authorities to take some action, because from last September nothing had been done by them. I was not influenced, as. he suggested, by any antipathy to the Department; my sole desire was to help this man. I had no antipathy to the Department, nor have I any now. I ask him, when he has had time to study the file, to give consideration to my request in the spirit in which I made it. I assure him that I brought the matter forward, not in any hostile spirit to the Department,  but because of a keen desire to help our soldiers. </para>

I wish only to say, in conclusion, that I have devoted my time and attention  to  this case with a sincere desire to help a man who is mentally afflicted, and not because  of  any desire to criticise the Defence Department or the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> Now that we have had time to sleep on the statements made last night, I again ask the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> to give to this case the consideration I have asked. When he has studied the papers, will he try to establish this man&#39;s identity, and to see that justice is done? </para>

                    <para>. -  I do not intend to repeat what took place last night; but, dealing first of all with the honorable member&#39;s closing remark, I may say at once that it was not necessary for me to sleep on what had been said in order to give him the assurance for which he asked. As a matter of fact, I gave it to him last night. I told him then that the case would be fully investigated, after which the whole of the facts would be presented to the public. The honorable member has complained of my remark that he was actuated more by feelings of antipathy to the Department than by any desire to forward the interests of this soldier. What I said was - </para>

                <para>He spoke there, not of the two constables, but of the Department as a whole. My reply was - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>That interjection shows the feeling that actuated the honorable member in bringing this matter forward as he has done to-night.  His  statement was influenced by a feeling of antipathy towards the Department, and was not  made in the interests of the soldier himself. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>I would not have made that observation but for the bitterness which the honorable member, by his interjection, displayed against the Department for the treatment which he alleged had been meted  out to  this man. I complained early in the evening that he had read only one part of the story, and I said he had not been fair; that while he had put before the House one statement made by this man, he had not told honorable members that the man had made another statement in which he set himself up as being quite a different person. When I read the second statement made by the soldier, it created  in the minds of honorable members a totally different impression of the case. If an honorable member is actuated only by a desire to secure the redress of any grievance, he will not seek to make public capital out of it, but will go - and this has always been my practice - to the head of the Department concerned, and, should he fail to obtain satisfaction from him, will request the Minister to go into the whole case. If the Minister for Defence&#39; had been shown the facts in this case, and had declined to make a full investigation, the honorable member would have been quite justified in bringing the case before the House; but those who have held office know that it is ridiculous to suggest that a Minister is aware of every act of his officers. </para>
                <para>The file 6f papers in this case is a very bulky one, as shown by the time which it took the honorable member to go through it. As I said last night, I felt sore at the matter having been brought forward on such short notice to myself. I had taken the trouble to try to get the necessary information from the Department, but when the honorable member told me that he was not going on with the case that afternoon I said, &#34; I will cancel what I have clone,&#34; and I directed that the information for which I had asked need not be sent over to me. About 5 p.m. I asked the honorable member if he had done with the file, as the Department was asking for it. He replied that he was still using it. I then asked, &#34;Will you be finished with it by to-morrow ? &#34; I thought of taking it away with me to-day, and of devoting, the weekend to a complete examination of it. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member&#39;s answer to my inquiry was, &#34;Yes, I shall be done with the file by to-morrow.&#34; It was only by accident that I learnt of his intention to refer to the case last night. Having occasion to visit the legal recess in the Library, I found the honorable member working there, and jocularly asked, &#34; What ! are you going into the law?&#34; The honorable member answered, &#34; No ; but I may have an opportunity to go into the soldier&#39;s case on the Supply motion to-night.&#34; That was the first intimation I had of his intention of bringing the matter up in the House last night, and I did not have anything like a reasonable chance to go through the file so as to make myself conversant with the facts before I was called upon to reply. It was for these reasons that I complained of the way in which the honorable member had treated me, and I think I was justified in coming to the conclusion that he was actuated by some ill-feeling., against the Defence Department or the responsible Minister. </para>

I have now an answer which has been furnished by the Minister for Defence. It is as follows: - </para>

                        <para>The men referred to were shown on the ship&#39;s Nominal Roll as on duty. No documents showing in what way they were to be disposed of were received from the General Officer Commanding Australian Imperial Force until some time after, having been apparently delayed in transit. </para>
                        <para>The correspondence showed that General Birdwood had decided to utilize on transport duty, with the object of giving them two months&#39; leave in Australia; officers and men who left Australia in 1914 and had not re-  turned there since their original embarkation, preference being given to those married men whose family circumstances are in any way distressful. </para>
                        <para>Instructions were immediately issued to District Commandants explaining the circumstances of their return, and ordering that their leave should commence from the date of disembarkation and be on full pay. </para>
                        <para>It will thus be seen that embarrassment was caused by the men arriving before their papers. As all future batches of men will be under the same conditions as this one, District Commandants will be in a position to make suitable arrangements for dealing with them as soon as they arrive. </para>
                        <para>In connexion with this policy of returning men on transport duty for leave it should be clearly understood that in the selection of the men to be so treated no pressure can be exercised from Australia, as the matter is entirely  in the hands of the authorities abroad, who are fully seized with the desirability of giving preference to married men and cases of family hardship and long service. </para>

                    <para>Clause 16 deals with section 21 of the principal Act. The object of the amendment is to prevent the raising of repatriation or patriotic funds or any fund in relation to the war by any means whatsoever without the consent of the Commission or a State Board. </para>
                    <para>Those, briefly, are the general purposes of the amendments effected by the Bill. When. Ave were considering the original measure, it was stated that opportunity would arise which would enable honorable members to review the whole scheme of repatriation. This Bill furnishes that opportunity. The scheme was launched, and came into operation on the 8th April, 1918. Prior to that, the Minister, and those concerned with him, had spent a great deal of time in formulating the existing regulations and in, organizing the Repatriation Department. There is no need to apologize for any delay that may have occurred, because honorable members know that there was no beaten track to follow, and that the whole scheme had to be organized and set up without any precedent to guide the Minister except the general experience that had been obtained in Australia by the State War Councils, and the various voluntary organizations  in existence. Regulations were carefully thought out and discussed by the Minister and members of the Commission which was gazetted when the Act was proclaimed. They were closely examined, in the light of what experience has been gained, with a view to drawing up a scheme adapted to the requirements of Australia. Four Conferences were held in relation to the arrangements to be made for the administration of the Act, so as to give assistance to returned soldiers in the way Parliament desired. The four conferences were ; a conference of representatives of State institutions on the subject of the treatment of the blind; a conference in respect to the vocational training of those soldiers whose injuries are of such a nature that they cannot follow their usual avocations ; a conference of members of industrial organizations, representatives of the Trades Hall, and of representatives of the Chamber of Manufactures, with a view to making provision for the employment in industries of soldiers who are injured or maimed in any way; and a conference on the subject of forestry which the- Minister desires to have as a reserve employment. </para>
                    <para>The scheme as now formed is certainly not going to be the last word on repatriation; it could not possibly be. I venture to suggest that the Minister may be complimented on the efforts he has made, and on the liberal way he has attempted to meet the necessities of the case. He is quite right in inviting criticism - and may I suggest constructive criticism ? - in his endeavour to perfect an Act which obviously cannot savour of anything of a party political character. Let us take a brief glance at what Parliament originated last session, and the way in which the scheme is worked. Honorable members know that it was desired to introduce, and that Parliament did pass, on lines which the experience of other countries advised was the best course, an Act more in the natura of a machinery measure. It was felt that at that stage no complete scheme could be formed, and, therefore, it was deemed advisable, as I say, to pass something in the nature of a machinery measure, outlining the form of organization, and allowing regulations to be framed by the Governor in Council. The main feature of the Act was first, the appointment of a Minister responsible to Parliament for the administration of the Act. It was felt that the voluntary scheme, or the quasi-voluntary scheme, was not satisfactory. Then it was provided that there should be a Department, and that there should be combination of officials with the voluntary effort. That was secured in a Department with a central Commission, State Boards, and a series of Local Committees constituted of persons who were willing to voluntarily assist. A great deal of credit is due to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lockyer,</inline> of the Inter-State Commission, for undertaking the organization of the Department. Ho is a man of great and wide experience in departmental work, and he has well laid the foundations of the departmental organization. I have here the general orders under which the scheme of organization will be carried out. The scheme is only just coming into operation, and as honorable members may not be familiar with it, I shall give some idea of its objects and purposes. There is a comptroller over the Department, which, for administrative purposes, is divided into sections. There are, a general administrative section, an accounts section, an employment section, the functions of which are to find, assemble, and assign positions of employment, arrange for the transportation of men to places of employment, and to refer men, difficult to place without training, to the Disablement and Training section for consideration of their cases. </para>
                    <para>The next section is known as the Disablement and Vocational Training section, and the classes of soldiers with whom this section will deal, may be divided into the following: - </para>

Their organization ought to bring the members in close personal touch with the returned soldiers - supply that personal sympathy and feeling which can never be obtained by purely official administration. The Committees are just mentioned in the Act, but their functions are more clearly defined in the regulations. In Western Australia all the Local Committees have been formed, and in New South Wales and Queensland work is well advanced. In Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania matters are not so forward, but efforts are being made to expedite the work. </para>

The intention is that each State shall be divided into local areas, and the scheme will be made as elastic as possible. If a city is too large to form one area it may be subdivided, the idea being to make the scheme adaptable to local circumstances, for any attempt at rigidity would be unfortunate. The powers of a committee are defined in number 26 of the regulations, of which honorable members have copies, and they are as follow: - </para>

                    <para>Having outlined the scheme which has been brought into operation, I propose to deal briefly with the purposes and methods of the Department. The scheme as set out in the regulations is the outcome of the recommendations of the Commission, and embodies the experience so far gathered of the working of repatriation in Australia, together with the advice of the conferences to which I have just referred. The object of the Department is to deal with discharged soldiers, its obligations beginning at the moment of the soldier&#39;s discharge. The Department aims at securing, so far as possible, the re-establishment of the returned soldier in civil life. That carries with it also the obligation that where men return maimed or wounded, in order to secure their satisfactory re-establishment in civil life, everything possible should be done to secure their return to health and make good the physical defects which they have suffered. The minimum obligation of the Department towards the returned soldier is the responsibility of providing him with the opportunity to earn at least a living wage, and. the granting of sustenance until that opportunity is forthcoming. This is arranged for in Part V. of the regulations. To put -the position briefly, there is upon the Department, when men have returned to Australia and have been discharged, the obligation of finding an opportunity of employment for them at a living wage, and until such opportunity has been found, or, if they are unfit for work, until they have been restored to health, or trained or equipped for work, to provide them with sustenance. The Department, upon written application made within a certain time, will provide each soldier with the opportunity of earning at least a living wage, and until such opportunity is forthcoming will pay to him a sustenance allowance in accordance with a fixed scale. Soldiers without de- pendants are entitled, while waiting for employment, to sustenance at the rate of 42s. a week; soldiers with a wife only are entitled to sustenance, inclusive of the combined pensions of a man and his wife, to 52s. a week; the rate of sustenance increasing with the domestic liabilities of the soldier, so that a soldier with a wife and four or more children dependent on him may draw, inclusive of all pensions, 66s. a week. The sustenance varies according to the circumstances of the case. </para>

While a man is waiting for land on which to settle, sustenance may be granted to him until land is available. </para>

                            <para>- Queensland has not yet come into the arrangement. Sustenance is granted to men undergoing training in technical schools, blind persons receiving training in special institutions, and applicants entered as students for training in commercial or professional occupations. Sustenance is granted to apprentices whose training was interrupted by their war service. During the time that a man is serving his apprenticeship, sustenance may be granted at a rate which will, bring his income to the rate of a journeyman in the industry to which he is completing his apprenticeship. The Deputy Comptroller may grant sustenance in the case of applicants of not less than 40 per cent, efficiency entered for training in private workshops, so that trainees may receive at least a living wage. The Department may provide training facilities in useful occupations for soldiers&#39; widows, and may pay them sustenance while under training at such a rate as will bring their income, inclusive of pensions, to 35s. a week. Men totally and permanently incapacitated; with or without dependants, may remain in their own homes or with friends, with the approval of the Deputy Comptroller, and they or their dependants may be granted sustenance at rates which will bring their incomes up to the rate provided by regulation 34. Where soldiers with dependants are under treatment in special institutions after discharge, they or their dependants, as the Deputy Comptroller decides, may be granted sustenance at a rate which will bring their incomes up to the rate provided by regulation 34. </para>

The classes with which the Department has to deal are the healthy - we trust that a large proportion of the returning men will be in that category - who are ready to work, and the incapacitated. Incapacity varies from slight injury to absolute disablement, and all its grades and degrees have to be met and dealt with, and assistance given according to the peculiar circumstances of each case. As regards those who may return healthy and strong, our hope is that many of them will be able to resume the calling at which they were engaged before they left </para>

Nevertheless, there is thrown upon the Department the obligation of providing an opportunity of employment for them in such callings, and in order to meet that responsibility, the Department has what is known as the employment section. Officers are employed who will canvass and secure the registration of employment, ascertain what employers have vacancies, co-operate with the State employment agencies, where possible utilize the labour bureaux, and do everything possible to place these men in employment as soon as possible. Between the date of a man&#39;s application and the providing him with an opportunity for employment in a position, sustenance will be allowed. </para>

The Department proposes to try to find private employers who are ready to continue such indentures; and, failing that, there will be an obligation on the Commonwealth to place such men in technical schools, and pay them the wages earned by the journeymen in the trade to which they are apprenticed. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but we shall pursue that policy as far as possible. There may be difficulties sometimes in finding employment for men. Therefore, the Minister has in view the creation of what is known as reserve employments. He has already taken action to provide such employment in connexion with forestry. He has made agreements with the State of New South &#34;Wales, for example, whereby the Commonwealth will lend to the State money for the purpose of carrying on forestry operations. The State will expend that money in the employment of returned soldiers in organized forestry camps at standard wages. A portion of the money will not be returned to the Commonwealth, because it is realized that many men when first employed will not be fully efficient, and any deficiency caused thereby will be borne by the Commonwealth. In New South Wales, 200 men are already so employed; and it is estimated that in Victoria 300 men will be engaged. </para>

                            <para>- That will depend on the scheme of operations adopted by each State. The desire is that the employment should be continuous, even though the same men do not continue at it. Men who commence at forestry work may desire to get into employment of another kind. I merely mentioned forestry as one of the reserve employments which the Minister has in view. </para>

                    <para>Turning now to another class of men, those who are wholly incapacitated, I am sure that the soldiers who return in full health and strength will not misunderstand us when we say that our sympathies naturally go out to those who have been maimed and rendered physically unfit through having made sacrifices for their country. There is an obligation cast upon all of us to do all that is possible for such men, to restore as far as possible their faculties, to make life a little less burdensome, and to add every touch of kindness and sympathy which the human heart and mind can devise. It is hoped that those who are partially incapacitated will be restored, ultimately, to normal efficiency; but for the time being their usefulness will be impaired, and they may find a difficulty in working at the employment to which they were previously accustomed. They may find that their earning capacity has been reduced. This brings me to an explanation of the industrial committees, to which I made reference earlier. The Minister convened a conference- of representatives of the industrial organizations and the Chambers of Manufactures to deal with the question of employment in the ordinary industries of men whose fitness has been in any way impaired, and who are incapable of earning the full rates of pay. Part 4 of the regulations deals with the committees. Two kinds of committees are to be constituted in each State. There will be a Soldiers&#39; State Industrial Committee, and also a Soldiers&#39; District Industrial Committee. The latter will consist of a chairman, to be appointed by the Minister, two representatives of the employers in the trade of the trainee, and two representatives &#39;of the union covering that trade. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The functions of the committee will be to consider the opportunities for the employment of soldiers and their dependants; decide, after trial, as to the suitability of the applicants for particular callings; assess the efficiency of the trainee at the commencement of his training, and re-assess his efficiency every three months; periodically review the facilities for training in * workshops and technical schools; and to deal, with disputes between persons entered for training in private workshops under regulation 42 and employers as to the ruling rate of wage in any industry, and in that regard they will have power to take evidence when necessary. Any aggrieved party to these proceedings will have the right of appeal to the State industrial committee to be formed in the metropolis of each State, and to consist of a chairman to be appointed by the Minister, three nominees of the Chamber of Manufactures, and three nominees of the Trades and Labour Council. This committee will have power to assess the value of work, and the Commonwealth will be responsible for the difference in value between the actual earnings of the men and the living wage to which they would be entitled at their particular calling if they were in normal health and fitness. </para>

                    <para>In that way, the Commonwealth will fulfil its obligations. The scheme is now before the various organizations for consideration. T. think it has been adopted in Victoria, and almost adopted in New South Wales. So far, South Australia is the only State that has rejected the scheme, but I hope that decision is not final. We trust that in all States the proposal will receive hearty co-operation from all parties, and prove to be an effective means of dealing with a very important problem. Regulation 44 provides that the number of trainees engaged in any one shop shall not be more than in the ratio of one to every six fully-paid journeymen continuously employed in that workshop for a period of six months preceding the trainee&#39;s engagement. </para>

                            <para>- I should think it would. I shall read to the House later a list of some of the vocational training already being done, and perhaps that will help honorable members to understand what we have in view. The States have the staff, the machinery, and committees of management in connexion with their technical training institutions. They will create the classes, and they &#34;will give the Commonwealth the benefit of their advice as to the plant and buildings requisite for these classes, and will also provide instructors and generally carry out the educational processes. It is quite realized, that many of the injured men may not be able to undergo the complete normal- technical and scientific course provided in some of these institutions, but they may be trained in such a way as to become skilful enough to render useful service. To that end, special classes and courses will be designed. The honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> yesterday mentioned the Ballarat School of Mines, in connexion with which he said there were men who were anxious to go through a proper course of training. He complained that those men were only attending casual classes, and that this method was unsystematic, and not likely to be of benefit to the men. I agree with him that if the training is to be of any use, it must be systematic, and directed to the purpose which it is to serve, namely, the restoration of these men to civil life in as efficient a condition as possible. The matter raised by the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> is being brought before the Minister. It will be for the Minister to arrange with the States for the formation of such classes, and to take advantage of the State technical institutions for the training of the men. In order to illustrate the class of work which returned men are asking the Department to undertake for them with the object of securing their effective training, I would put before honorable members the following statistics as to training in Victoria up to 18th inst. - </para>

                            <para>- I think it is the desire of the Minister that in all such cases sustenance should be allowed. If, in consequence of an injury, the earning power of a returned soldier is reduced, or if he has to take up a new calling, during his apprenticeship to that new calling he ought to be, and I think will be, allowed sustenance. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the question pf national workshops, which is one of the utmost importance. Men may come back so maimed as to have no hope of ever becoming efficient workmen again. They may, however, have some earning capacity, and the problem we have to determine is whether we should pay them sustenance, and allow them to remain idle, or fit them to some extent for some calling and encourage them to earn some part of their own livelihood. My own view is that if a man is given something, to interest him - something to occupy his mind - he is much happier than when be is doing nothing. The Minister for Repatriation has yet to decide whether men so circumstanced should be provided for in workshops and allowed to return to their homes each night, or whether national workshops, with cottages for the housing of the men, should be established in suitable positions. A final decision has not. yet been arrived at, and the Minister will be glad to receive any suggestion* that honorable members may have to offer. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; I shall deal presently with that phase of our work. The question of the treatment of our blind soldiers is also involved. Those of our men who have lost their sight, and are in England, are to be trained as far as possible at St. Dunstan - an institution with a worldwide reputation for the splendid work it has done for the blind. Where that cannot be done, it is proposed that special training shall be given them in our Own State institutions for the blind, but in separate buildings. Then there are those who are totally incapacitated, who will have no earning capacity, who are paralyzed and helplessly injured, for whom it is desirable to make life as comfortable and as easy as possible.

                    <para class="block">Works and Railways has been working in conjunction with the Defence Department in this direction, inspecting different properties and picking out suitable places for such homes, also for convalescent homes. The Department of Defence has already made considerable progress in the matter of sanatoria for consumptives. They have consumptive sanatoria at Stanthorpe, in Queensland, Randwick, in New South Wales, and Macleod, in Victoria, while accommodation is being arranged at Bedford Park, in South Australia, and homes are being provided at Woorooloo. iu Western Australia, and at New Town, in Tasmania. After the war these sanatoria will pass to the Repatriation Department. Provision has also to be made in each State for treating mental cases in institutions. </para>
                    <para>I now pass to the matter mentioned by the honorable member for Wide Bay, in which I know he takes considerable interest,, the provision of artificial limbs. An agreement was made by the Defence Department with an American expert, who has been appointed manager of the Artificial Limb Factory which has been established at the Caulfield Hospital, and is already in operation. I hope that honorable members will take the opportunity of paying a visit to it. They will &#39; see men there making these artificial limbs who are using them. Exceedingly efficient and skilful work is being done. Limbs have already been supplied to those who require them, and they have been found to be very serviceable and of a splendid quality. They are produced to represent as nearly as possible the movements of the natural limb. A similar factory is to be opened next week in New South Wales, and branch establishments are to be established in South Australia, Western Australia, and Queensland. The South Australian factory is almost completed. Our obligation is to supply to the men limbs of the very best type we can give them. In connexion, with the hospitals, curative workshops generally have been established. For the time being, the Artificial Limb Factories will be under the management of the Defence Department, but at the termination of the war they will automatically pass over to the control of the Repatriation Department. </para>

Investigations are also being proceeded with in order to provide employment for permanently maimed men. &#39; Arrangements are also being made with country hospitals to supply free medical attention where injuries are of a recurring nature. </para>
                    <para>Part VII. of the regulations mentions a number of cases in which assistance is given of a wide nature. Regulation 57 extends assistance to a widow in necessitous circumstances with children, and to a totally incapacitated soldier by making a grant of &#163;25 for the purpose of purchasing furniture. A new regulation is being framed to extend the benefit of the grant of furniture by way of loan in cases where it is shown to be necessary for the satisfactory re-establishment of the man. Regulation 58 enables a grant to be made by way of gift of an amount not exceeding .&#163;10 for the purchase of tools of trade and professional instruments. Furniture, tools of trade, or other articles of property purchased for a soldier or dependant will remain the absolute property of the Department for twelve months. The State Board may make advances by way of loans for the purchase of approved businesses, plant, stock, and live stock, not exceeding &#163;150 in each case, to widows with one or more children, married soldiers incapacitated to the extent of being unable to engage in their usual employment, and soldiers who, prior to enlistment, were dependent for their living upon businesses they owned and conducted. </para>

                    <para>The position in regard to land settlement is very much what it was when I introduced the last Bill dealing with this matter. An arrangement has been made whereby the States provide the land and the Commonwealth advances money in order to enable the States to lend it in sums not exceeding &#163;500 for the purchase of plant, stock, &#38;c. The Minister has that matter under consideration now. He is also considering &#39;the advisability of providing homes. In the meantime, a rental allowance is granted in cases where it is considered necessary by a State Board. Regulation 51 says - </para>

I think they will admit that the Minister and the Government have approached the subject in a generous spirit. We have endeavoured as far as possible to deal with the general cases that have arisen, and although the scheme is by no means final or complete it undoubtedly shows on the part of the Minister and the Department anxiety and thought on behalf of our returned soldiers, and translates into action the desire of the Australian people to show their appreciation of, and gratitude towards, those who have made such sacrifices for them. </para>

                        <para>.- We have listened to a very important speech from the Minister. I think it would help the discussion of the Bill if it were possible for honorable members to have the opportunity of reading it in print and of studying the regulations which were issued about a month ago. Of course this is not a party matter, and honorable members will admit that I have done my best to keep all discussions on it free from party aspect. </para>
