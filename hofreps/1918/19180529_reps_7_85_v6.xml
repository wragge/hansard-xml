                            <para>-  I am not on the Committee. There is in the report the suggestion - perhaps I may flatter myself that it is due to an interjection made by me - that we shall embody in the opening prayer a petition for peace. I am glad to know that my suggestion, even though made in a disorderly way, has received favorable consideration by the Standing Orders Committee. But I should like more time for considering the report of the Committee before indorsing the prayer which they recommend. We are to be asked to pray that victory may be achieved by the Allied arms. </para>

                            <para>- I have already, in this Chamber, protested against any resolution declaring that the war shall not end in any other way than by a victory of the Allied arms. I am favorable to its being ended by the peaceful negotiations of sane and reasonable men; I am not favorable to the continuation of the war until such victory has been gained as seems to be contemplated in the proposed prayer. I am profoundly convinced that two great disasters menace the world - one being that Prussian militarism may end the war by force of arms, and the other that militarism other than Prussian may temporarily end the war by force of arms. So far from holding the view which some have expressed, that peace can be brought into the world by military victory, I think that had honorable members enlightened their minds by even a cursory study of history, they would be aware that a lasting peace has never been, and is never likely to be, achieved by force of arms. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; for a time. But that battle and preceding battles laid the foundation of Prussian militarism. They joined the limbs and wings of the great Prussian military system. At that time, we were sympathetic with, and lent our support to the Prussian arms. Whatever other results may have followed from those battles, it is abundantly clear that they stimulated the growth of Prussian militarism. Many years later came the Franco-Prussian War, out of which grew in France the party of <inline font-style="italic">la revanche.</inline> It is that party of revenge, working in the midst of a great Democracy, together with the Prussian militarism working on its own, which has been a very potent factor in bringing about the present war. I would welcome an amendment of the Standing Orders which would permit us to offer up a prayer for peace, but I would ask that that prayer be offered up in the Christian spirit, and not in any pagan spirit. We are developing a state of mind in regard to this war in which Christianity is going out of fashion. The Minister for Defence is permitted to say, and  does  say amidst the applause of his followers, that he brackets together pacifists and traitors; in other words, that he brackets traitors with those who are still proud to follow without regard for any religious sectionalism or denominationalism, the principles laid down by the founder of Christianity.. I protest against this pagan opinion that peace is to be brought into the world by the crude and cruel method of force of arms, and I oppose any amendment to the Standing Orders which will alter the prayer offered up in this House at the commencement of our deliberations in any direction which is not consistent with the faith of the great majority of honorable members of this Chamber, namely, the Christian faith. </para>

                            <para>- If the Acting Prime Minister had followed his usual practice, and placed this motion on the business-paper, I am sure the honorable member for Batman, who has felt it &#39;his duty to draw attention to the strange happenings with regard to Christianity, would possibly not have made his speech, or might have made it in a somewhat different way. What must appeal to all honorable members is the fact that the proposed prayer contains an appeal on behalf of  our  sol - diers and sailors who are at the Front - and I dare say that its wording will be found in almost any Church service during a time of war- that is, a prayer for victory over our enemies. </para>

                        <para>.- The proposed alteration of the prayer should be discussed. If, as most people believe, there is an Omnipotent Power who controls the destinies of mankind, it is ludicrous, absurd, and even insulting to address a prayer to Him asking Him to  give victory to one set of combatants as against the other in this war. </para>

                            <para>- To my mind it is not. If there is an Omnipotent Power who. controls the destinies of mankind, then the cataclysm in which all mankind is now engaged has come about with the cognisance, and even at the wish, of Providence. Some schools of thought in Australia and elsewhere tell us that it has. overwhelmed humanity as a punishment. I do not hazard an opinion as to whether it is a punishment of the people for their particular mode of life, or falling away from the Throne of Grace; but if honorable members believe that there is a Divine Power which guides the destinies of man, it is a piece of impertinence on the part of any portion of humanity to address a prayer or petition similar to that pro-: posed, suggesting to the Almighty how Hie should conduct  His  business. </para>

                            <para>- It is a matter of profound indifference to me where Cromwell is. Apart from the views held as to the rights or wrongs of the present conflict, it seems to savour of impertinence on the part of anybody, who believes in an Omnipotent Being as guiding the destinies of mankind, to pray to that Being to take part in the conflict - to throw  His  power and influence on the side of the Allies, as against the Central Powers, or <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> It reminds one of the controversy in Australia some time ago, when all the various religions were besieging the Throne of Grace in order that the Almighty might send rain on the drought-stricken areas of Australia. They all had a try at it, but, whether it was in answer to their prayers or not, when the Chinamen appealed to their joss, I believe the rain came. However, to my mind, such prayers as are addressed by the various sets of combatants, might just as well be addressed by various political parties to the Throne of Grace, in order to induce the Almighty to use  His  influence on the part of some particular section or clique in the political life of the country. If we are to have any particular prayer in connexion with the proceedings of this House or Parliament, the one that is in use at the present time is sufficient for all those who feel the need of prayer. </para>

                    <para class="block">In this very House, as a member of the State Parliament, I had an experience on which I sometimes look back with astonishment. At that time, a serious position had arisen in reference to the teaching of religion in State schools, and I thought it would bo a wise thing to bring all the clergymen together in order to evolve a simple prayer and hymn. I received the thanks of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner for my suggestion; but I may say that the meeting of the clergymen did not end in peace, and culminated in the issue of a large book, half-an-inch thick, published at about 18s. However, I should say that <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> similar suggestion made at the present time might have good results. How would it be, in this terrible time of war, if we were to induce every religious denomination, in all the States, to send a representative in turn to read the prayers in this House, when, perhaps, we members might find that there are good men in all faiths, even in those in which we do not believe? It would be an attempt to carry out what the Emperor Akbar centuries ago did in India; though on that occasion the professors of religion could not agree. We might, by this means, create a better feeling  in  divergent sections of the community, and end this cursed sectarianism, which at the present time holds too much sway. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not know whether the Standing Orders Committee consulted those who generally draw up prayers, but I am of opinion that portions of the proposed prayer cannot be properly regarded as being in the form of a prayer. I refer to the words &#34; that an honorable and lasting peace may result from their valour and sacrifices.&#34; I do not wish to detract from the valour or sacrifice of our soldiers, but, with all due respect to the laymen and clerics who may hare had a hand in the framing of this prayer, I submit that we detract from the virtue of it if we place reliance upon anybody but the One to whom we address our prayer. The inculcation of the spirit of the Saviour of the World is* the only means by which wo may expect an honorable and lasting peace. </para>

Of course, if those who framed this supplication are prepared to abide by the. opinions of those whom they consulted, we&#39;ll and good ; but, in my humble judgment, nothing should be said in a prayer which would detract from the Supreme Being to whom the prayer is addressed. </para>

                        <para>- The tin-plate problem is very difficult; we have been dealing with it for many months. The Director of Munitions is thoroughly seized of all the requirements of the canning trades, and the understanding now arrived at is that we shall not be able to get tin plates except for Imperial uses. We are selling a great quantity of tinned jams, fruits, and meats to the British Government, and we have an assurance that we shall have sufficient tin plates to enable us to supply the Imperial requirements. Beyond that, we shall have to submit to a little embarrassment. The Director of Munitions is  aw <inline font-style="italic">fait</inline> with the whole situation, and is doing everything possible to secure further supplies of tin plates. </para>

Cabling from Washington last week the Prime Minister intimated that he had had the advantage of consultation with the company and engineers who had launched the concrete ship <inline font-style="italic">Faith,</inline> of which honorable members have heard. He had been able to arrange for one of the chief engineers to be sent to Australia to consult with the Government regarding the construction of concrete ships in this country, and he asked for Cabinet&#39;s approval of his action.

                                Work has been proceeding for some weeks at the Williamstown shipbuilding yards, which were recently taken over from the Government of Victoria. Two Isherwood standardized steel ships, each of 5,500 tons, are being constructed at these yards, and six others are to be subsequently built there. Some delay has been caused by the late arrival of shipbuilding material from America, but a shipment which has come to hand during the past few days will enable more rapid progress to be made. A contract has been let with the New South Wales Government for the construction of six similar standardized vessels at Walsh Island, Newcastle.

Bomphrey, who was brought out by the Victorian Government to manage the Williamstown yards, has now been transferred to the New South Wales service, and placed in charge of the building of these six ships at Walsh Island. Operations have been commenced there, and the work is proceeding with all possible speed.

From this  sum  there will be advanced from 50 per cent, to 70 per cent, off cost for the delivery of ships from one to four years after peace, and from 20 per cent, to 25 per cent, for ships delivered in from five to nine years after peace. </para>

                        <para>Germany&#39;s plans to build concrete ships.Captain Persius, who writes in the <inline font-style="italic">Berliner Tageblatt,</inline> states that, owing to prospective shortage of wood, steel, and iron for shipbuilding after the war, leading German and Austrian dockyards are preparing to use ferro-concrete on a large scale. Yards are now being constructed to that end. </para>
                        <para>Captain Persius takes the view that all the great shipbuilding countries will be put to the same necessity as Germany to find substitutes for wood iron, and steel. </para>
                        <para>Germany, he says, will be in a better position than any of the rest for ferro concrete construction, because of the reason that they possess the most important cement industry in the world. They claim to have outstripped France, which country was formerly at the front. </para>
                        <para>They also claim to have given the English, the inventors of cement, the fiercest competition in the markets of the world. </para>

                        <para>American ambition. American ambition is to expand in three years a merchant marine equal to that created by Great Britain in the course of half-a-century, and, in addition, is building several hundred naval vessels of all types, from submarine chaser to battleship. </para>
                        <para>Royalties paid to Isherwood. Fees are payable to J. W. Isherwood, the patentee of the system of longitudinal framing that bears his name, for the use of his system and his services for the preparation of classification plans and information. By the adoption of this system the amount of steel required in the hull is reduced to the extent of from 8 per cent. to 12 per cent. </para>
                        <para>In the case of the ships at present under construction for the Commonwealth, the saving amounts to about 120tons, compared with a similar ship built with transverse framing. The dead-weight carrying capacity is also increased by this amount. In addition, there is a reduction in the amount of highly skilled labour required in the construction. The great advantages associated with a reduction in the amount of iron and steel, in addition to the increased dead-weight, will be apparent to all. Royalties have been paid by shipbuilders in Great Britain, United States of America, Canada, Germany, Holland, Belgium, France, Sweden, and Italy. The patent rights for Japan have been sold outright to the Osaka Ironworks, Osaka, Japan. </para>

                        </talk.start>
                    <para>Afforestation has been practically confined to nurseries at Acton and Westbourne Wood established since 1912, in which large stocks of trees, ornamental shrubs and plants are raised; and to planting, which has been in progress for about two years, chiefly at Mount Stromlo, where last year a fair area of commercial soft woods was planted out. </para>
                    <para class="block">The nurseries,  about 20 acres in area, are useful in connexion with fruit culture and the raising of cereals as well as plants for ornamental and for forest trees. In the opinion of an expert the great similarity of the hills of about the same altitude, though of different geological formation, makes the same system of planting applicable to all. Planting from the nurseries has been mostly of <inline font-style="italic">pinus</inline><inline font-style="italic">insigns</inline> and deodar (Indian cedar). The suitability, as to which experts are somewhat doubtful, of California redwood, possibly better known as <inline font-style="italic">sequoia sempervirens,</inline> is to be tested by the placing out of 60,000 plants from pots in the Acton Nursery, at an estimated cost for holes, planting, and clearing, of &#163;450. For these trees a high rainfall, considerable humidity during the dry period of the year, and good soil conditions are conducive, if not essential, to success. The commercial redwoods of the humid coast region of California, the country of the sequoia, grow in districts of high rainfall in winter and heavy fogs in the dry season. There the redwoods taken are trees of probably over 400 years of age, but much younger trees are of commercial value. &#34; North-westward of Queanbeyan,&#34; to quote from a report, &#34; a suitable area has been selected for a plantation of <inline font-style="italic">sequoia</inline><inline font-style="italic">semper-virens,</inline> the site being undulating,  with  a suitable sandy soil surface overlying a free sub-soil, but I would not recommend the planting of any extensive forest area of this tree, as the climate does not meet the requirements of California redwood.&#34; </para>
                    <para>There are specimens of this tree in the Territory - one at  Ginnendera  Homestead&#34;, 60 feet high, and about fifty years old, growing on a river flat, on good black soil; another at Duntroon College, smaller, not so favorably placed. At Acton Nursery are some of about six years&#39; growth . </para>
                    <para>Nothing has yet been done in the greater rainfall areas, where indigenous forests, according to the opinions of some experts., are worth consideration. </para>
                    <para>In the higher regions the bulk of the timber is, and will be, found; but there, without provision for extraction and transport, the existing timber would be practically inaccessible. The building of the Arsenal at Tuggeranong may help use and afforestation. The heads of a policy for a purpose of use and development of timber in these regions have been drawn up, and subject to financial arrangements permitting, may be initiated this season. The matter, so far as it relates to the employment of returned soldiers, has been considered by me with the Minister for Repatriation. &#34;Within the Territory there are places where the greatest care must be taken in forest work, which entails the establishment of exotic trees or forests; and places with obviously fine forest rainfalls, where forestry is bound to be more productive than within the lower rainfall areas. </para>
                    <para>For commercial tree planting the quality of the locality must be tested. Outside the species of <inline font-style="italic">pinus</inline><inline font-style="italic">insignis</inline> there are hardly sufficient data available to make an accurate assessment of the possibilities of certain localities within the Territory. From expert observation it seems possible to gather that well laid down insignis plantations might yield up to 6,000 cubic feet of merchantable timber in thirty years on the acre basis. For a definite statement as to other species more data are required. Without careful assessment there is a risk in introducing species which are not assessed from woods already existing in the neighbourhood. The course, therefore, is to establish, on areas of about 5 acres &#39;each, more or less experimental woods of numerous species, for the purpose of assessing the quality of the locality. </para>
                    <para>Working plans, a vital necessity, will be required for the whole Territory, and for different localities, and pan only bo finally settled after considerable investigations by a forester. </para>
                    <para>Within the Territory local-grown timbers have been used only for firewood, fence posts, and, in the case of the Mount Domain district, to a aci all extent for sawing purposes. It may be optimistic to say so, but, in the opinion of an expert, there appears to be no reason, if opportunity be afforded, why a large part of the timber required within the Capital territory, with the exception of certain soft woods, cannot be taken from the natural forests in the high ranges. Though local-grown soft wood may not be available <inline font-style="italic">for</inline> some years for Australian purposes, plantations of soft woods skilfully made would soon make the Territory in that respect self-supplying. Unless forests are used there will be great waste. </para>
                    <para>If future plantations of such pines as the <inline font-style="italic">insignis</inline> are put down and the trees spaced 6 feet by 6 feet, thinnings will be available in about eight or ten years, for round scantlings, panels, and many other purposes, in the Territory. I mention this as one of several lines likely to be productive of early commercial returns. </para>
                    <para>In parts of higher regions of the Territory, where timber is more or less satisfactory at present, there is, according to a report, subject to transport facilities, wealth immediately obtainable. </para>
                    <para>Areas to be controlled as permanent forests must be definitely marked out, set aside, and placed under proper forest administration. </para>

The&#34; report of a Reconstruction Committee recently presented to the Home Government, and which suggests Imperial activity in forestry, supports this view. </para>

                        <para>- The glory of the honorable member is that his party wins with the press against him. I may say that twelve men were invited to the Con- &#187;ference, and twelve men will be sent if we can get them in a satisfactory way. In order to provide for a proper basis of representation, I invited the whole of the editors, and, I think, the owners of the &#176; journals in Australia, either directly or through their organizations, to give me some suggestions as to how the Government could best respond to the wishes of those at Home. In reply, I have received quite a sheaf of letters and telegrams, and . it is safe to say that no more than two or three agree with one another. Therefore, the responsibility comes back on. the Government, and we shall have to assume it in the end, and select all the representatives, assigning them on some geographical basis, and keeping in view the various interests, political and otherwise. </para>

I desire to see a proper and  fair Labour representation in the delegation, though I do not know how far we shall be able to secure this with the concurrence of the various journals.

These amounts arc unknown, and can only be estimated. The agents arc contractors, who perform specified services for a certain remuneration. Their costs and their profits are known only to themselves. For the first year - 1915-16- representatives of farmers&#39; organizations agreed with wheat shippers as to the handling charges to be paid. These rates, however, were reduced at the instance of the Ministers constituting the Wheat Board. The rates for 1916-17 were still further reduced. Owing to the length of time it has become necessary to store wheat, a different arrangement for 1917-.18 was decided upon. The rates for that year arc so low that it is considered that some contractors will make little, if any, profit. There is a point below which it is unwise, in view of the magnitude of the interests at stake, to reduce profits. <inline font-style="italic">lit</inline> is considered that that point has now been reached in regard to the handling charges. </para>

                    <para>Early in 1917 the Army Council accepted the offer of the despatch of an Australian Ordnance Company for service abroad with the Australian Imperial Force. It was, however, found impracticable to form the complete Ordnance Company, but a tradesmen&#39;s section, called the I.O.M. Section, was raised and despatched. Arrangements have also been made whereby members of the Australian Ordnance Staffs enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force are allotted for Ordnance duties abroad. As regards the formation of a Local Ordnance Corps, that is for service in Australia, this matter is at present under the consideration of the Business Board. </para>

The information we have is that included in these fourteen unions are the railway unions, the wharf labourers&#39; unions, the coal lumpers&#39; unions, and others. Will the Acting Prime Minister represent to the Premier of New South Wales that all unions should be placed on an equality ? </para>

                        <para>- Since the receipt of the telegram from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> which I read in the House on Thursday night, I have not been advised by the Government of New South Wales of any further action on their part. I assume, however, that the Government have determined to summon Parliament, and to proceed with the re-registration of the unions, as in that telegram they announced their intention of doing. Many times during the last few weeks I have been requested to bring pressure upon, or make representations to, some State Governments, chiefly that of New South Wales, in regard to this matter, and I have declined. This is the State Governments&#39; &#39; job. They know that we are sympathetic towards the proposal for the re-registration of unions, and they know that we desire to keep to the spirit of the compact made at the Recruiting Conference. Beyond that I can say nothing at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- Where damage or loss to ship-owners&#39; stores has occurred, which is proved to be the result of wilful or gross carelessness on the part of troops, a charge is made to cover such deficiencies. The money is paid by the Officer Commanding troops direct to the master of the vessel concerned before disembarkation. However, in order to minimize the possibility of hardship in this connexion, the Minister recently approved that where such damage does not exceed an average of 6d. per head, the cost is to be borne by the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para>The message was received at the Melbourne General Telegraph Office at 6.50 p.m. on the same day. It was delivered to Parliament House, and, according to information I have since obtained, was received by an attendant, and placed on my box in the Labour room. While the House was sitting, the censor sent for that telegram. .It waa, delivered to his messenger, and held up until after the House adjourned on Friday evening, 24th inst. On the same date, the following telegram was despatched from Broken Hill at 7.40 p.m. :- </para>

                <para class="block">It was received in Melbourne at 9.37 p.m. Both, telegrams were delivered to me after Parliament had adjourned on Friday, 24th inst. There are certain peculiarities in connexion with the messages, inasmuch as the first bears the ordinary post-office stamp, and is printed in ordinary typewritten characters, whereas the second telegram bears no post mark, is differently typed, and has the words : &#34; Entered in E.T.O., and issued 4.15 p.m. on the 24th inst.&#34; Presumably that message came to me direct from the censor. The peculiarity I see in this action of the authorities is that whatever military reason existed on the 23rd May for interfering with the correspondence sent to me by my constituents should have held good on the 24th May. The obvious reason for the use of the censorship was to prevent me from bringing the matter referred to under the notice of members before the House adjourned on Friday. This is a scandalous abuse of the censorship. Honorable members, no matter on what side of the House they sit, cannot fail to resent such a gross interference on the part of the military authorities with correspondence addressed to members by their constituents. &#34;We are told that the German Reichstag is dominated by the military, and we are rapidly learning that the military authority in Australia is being used, apparently, for the purpose of political party advantage. I am expectantly waiting for an explanation of this incident. To me there can be no reason for holding up these telegrams over Thursday and Friday, until Parliament had adjourned,  other  than a desire to prevent me bringing before the House the information they contained. </para>

                    <para>Wie have had forcefully brought before us another case where the military authorities seized and removed from the precincts of this House a reprint from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The time has come when honorable members, irrespective of their political differences of opinion, must take a firm stand against this arrogation of power on the part of the military. Is Australia ruled to-day by its duly-elected parliamentary representatives or by a military junta, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> at its head? When we ask a question in thi3 House in regard to the military censorship, we are told quite blandly that it will be looked into; but still this abuse of power by the military authorities goes on continuously. If this country is not to be absolutely, under the control of the military, this sort of thing must be stopped. If honorable members are not to be free to exercise their rights and privileges without such military interference as has occurred lately, then there can be no civil government; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and his military satellites must be the real rulers, and it is but a bit of make-believe that we are here as representatives of the people. </para>
                    <para>The telegrams which were interfered with referred to the seizure of forty-three Italians at Broken Hill on the  21st  inst. ; but because of the interference of the military authorities with my correspondence I was unable to draw attention in this House to that scandalous abuse of the military power. The following is a translation of a letter from one of the forty-three Italians seized at Broken Hill: -  &#34; Italians have been arrested from their homes without warning. Some were seized as they came off shift from the mines. Some of the men seized are married, with large families. They desired to, communicate with their wives and families. This was refused. One  man  who made application to see his wife was granted five minutes to settle all his family affairs. He was not allowed to go to his home, but had to see his wife at the prison.&#34; </para>
                    <para>When the men arrived at Adelaide they were escorted from one train to another by Australian soldiers with fixed&#39; bayonets. At the present time the men are held under guard at Broadmeadows Military Camp as prisoners. Among the men are at least fifteen married. One is more than forty-six years of age. In two instances at least the wives of these men are Australians. These men, too, were torn from their families without ceremony. </para>
                    <para class="block">When these men attempted, through their political representative, to bring this scandalous misuse of military authority before Parliament - the highest tribunal in the land - the military again interfered and, abusing their powers, seized a telegram on the subject addressed to me. Honorable members opposite will not always be in power, and if they wink at this abuse of military authority, I hope to be in this House when the Labour party returns to office- </para>

                            <para>- I am not clear for the moment as to whether the two or only one of the telegrams to which I Lave referred were delivered here in the first instance. One, at all events, was sent here in the ordinary course, and delivered to one of our messengers, who, according to his own statement, as made to me in the presence of witnesses, pinned it on my box. Subsequently a messenger arrived, and asked for the return of the telegram. The telegram was handed to him, was sent back to the Telegraph Office, and held there until Parliament had adjourned on Friday afternoon. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to support the motion of the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine),</inline> whose statement, I am sure, will be accepted by the Minister in charge of the House. There can be no doubt that a telegram addressed to him from Broken Hill has been intercepted by the Censor ; that it was sent to the House, and pinned to the honorable member&#39;s box; and that subsequently a messenger of the House, when a telegraph officer asked for its return, handed it back to him, taking the request apparently as an instruction. What military necessity could demand a procedure of that kind? The Acting Prime Minister, when questioned recently in this House as to the right of individuals to petition Parliament, said that that right still existed, and I gathered from his remarks that he would resent any attempt to interfere with that right so long as the petition was couched in proper parliamentary language. It is the right of every elector to approach his parliamentary representative with a view to having a matter brought before Parliament. Certainly, it was irregular for an official of this House to return to a telegraph messenger a telegram which had been placed on a member&#39;s box. But the state of mind into which the officials of this House have got is due to the militarism of the administration. Will honorable members credit the statement that the reprints of a speech of the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts),</inline> which were seized by the military authorities, have never been returned to him, although a Court has decided that the honorable member was guilty of no offence in connexion with their publication ? The censorship which is being exercised amounts to tyranny. I believe, with the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey),</inline> that the censor, acting under instructions from the Minister for Defence, has listeners engaged, to intercept the telephone conversations which pass between members of the House. On one occasion, when I asked the telephone assistant for &#34; Brunswick 197,&#34; there was a delay of a minute or two, and then the official inquired, &#34;Did you want Brunswick?&#34; I replied, &#34;Yes, Brunswick.&#34; Then came another wait, when the official asked again, &#34;You wanted Brunswick 197?&#34; The only explanation of that occurrence is that time was being wasted while a listener was being got to hear what was about to be said by the honorable member and myself. The censorship is being abused, and the best way to put a. stop to this abuse is to appoint the Select Committee asked for. I cannot think that the Government would oppose the motion. The honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> does not wish to make this a party matter, and has proposed, so that there may be no party colour to the Committee, the appointment of three members from each side. I am prepared to go further, and, as one of those who have been nominated from this side of the House, to retire in favour of a member of the party opposite, &#39;0 that the Committee ma}&#39; consist of four Ministerialists and two Oppositionists. All that we desire to ascertain is under whose instructions the  Deputy  Chief Censor acted, so that we may impeach the Minister who is responsible for what has occurred. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> has failed to make out any case for his allegation of breach of privilege, and has given no reason why the House should take the action he proposes. What are the statements which he has1 put  before us ? He alleges that, for purely political purposes, telegrams addressed to him were delayed so that he might not be able to use them in debate here. For that statement there is no foundation of fact; no Minister, and no one connected with the Government, gave any instruction concerning, or knew anything about, what was done. That there was Ministerial interference is the imagination of the honorable member. </para>

The honorable member said that, in the ordinary course, certain telegrams were received by a messenger of the House and pinned on his box, and that, later, a messenger - probably a telegraph messenger - asked to have these telegrams given back, and the messenger gave them back. That is the whole case. What the reasons were for what was done I do not know They may have been purely departmental. There is nothing in the honorable member&#39;s statement to show that the censor had anything to do with the matter. I do not know if he had anything to do with it. </para>

That right, however, does not diminish the right of the censor to exercise his powers in proper cases. </para>

                            <para>- That I do not know.. He may, or he may not; certainly he has the right to do so. Do honorable members claim as a matter of privilege that any communication sent to them from any source is exempt from the censorship ? I am not now discussing whether the exercise of the censorship in any particular case is wise or not. When the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> and the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> were Ministers, the censor had the right to interfere with members&#39; correspondence. He has had that right since the beginning of the war, and has it now. </para>

There is no need for an inquiry by a Select Committee in circumstances such as these, and there has not been shown any breach of privilege concerning which a Select Committee could inquire. To prove a breach of privilege you must first establish the existence of the privilege that has been broken. Honorable members opposite seem to claim for their correspondence, as a matter of right, exemption from censorship; but from the beginning of the war the censor has had the right to examine, in the interests of the nation, any correspondence of which he may be suspicious, and in this particular the correspondence of a member of Parliament is no more privileged than that of private persons. Is it necessary for the discharge of his parliamentary duties that a member&#39;s correspondence should be treated differently from that of a private individual? </para>

                            <para>- So far as the Government are concerned, there was no political reason for the action taken. As a matter of fact the Government knew nothing about it. Whatever was done in this particular matter presumably was done by whoever did it in the ordinary course of carrying out his duties. It was not done by the instructions of the Government Olof any Minister of it. Therefore there is no necessity for the appointment of a Select Committee. The honorable member&#39;s claim is based purely on the question of privilege, but no breach of privilege has been shown justifying the request for the appointment of a Commit-, tee. We have had a lot of wild talk from the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> who spoke of the tyranny of the censorship, but it is a very easy matter to make wide, vague statements, and use all sorts of epithets. We have had no illustrations put forward in proof of such assertions. Surely honorable members realize that there must be a censorship. All parties in this House agreed to the continuance of the exercise of the powers of censorship. </para>

                            <para>- I am trying to represent nothing of the sort. I am pointing out that the power of exercising a censorship has existed from the beginning of the war, that it is an inherent power, and that no person in the community is exempt from it if, in the interests of the public safety, it is considered necessary to* exercise it. This exercise has been acquiesced in. The request for the appointment of a Committee seems to be based by some on a vague idea that this building has a sort of sanctity about it, immediately any person steps into it he is free from the operation of the law, and is a superior person, possessing greater rights and privileges than belong to persons outside. Parliament is certainly a body of very high standing, and it has very great privileges. It must have them, otherwise it could not carry out its. duties properly. An honorable member cannot in certain circumstances be threatened outside in order to compel him to take certain action here. He cannot -be attacked or assaulted in. order to compel him to any course of action. The absolute freedom of his conscience and judgment in this House is secured to him. People outside have no right to threaten or compel by force honorable members t&#187; exercise their votes in - this Chamber in. any particular direction. Some of my friends opposite ought to be asking whether interference by outside bodies with their duties here might not be a breach of privilege. However, I do not wish to take up the time of.&#39; the House unnecessarily. The honorable member has failed to make out any case for the appointment of a Select Committee. Furthermore, he has not proposed to constitute the Committee in the ordinary way, upon the representation of parties in the House. </para>

                        <para>. -  I regret exceedingly that the Ministry will not grant this inquiry. It is all very well for the Minister to say that no case has been made out. Any person can make out a case against the censorship as it is being administered at the present time. I regret the absence of the Postmaster-General. He might explain why one of his officers, at the dictation of the censor, has come to this House and received a telegram back. If there was anything wrong in the telegram, why was it not prevented from being delivered ? Honorable members know what happens when a telegram is delivered during a member&#39;s absence. If the House messenger has reason to believe that the member is likely to return soon, he does not telephone the message to his private house, but puts a pin through it and places it outside his correspondence box, so that it may not be covered up by any other documents, and so that it will be seen at once on the member&#39;s return to the House. That practice has been followed by messengers of the House for the last seventeen years, and, so far as I know, all the messengers in the employ of Parliament are absolutely impartial, and their dealings with honorable members have been absolutely free of party considerations. Had that telegram been delivered at the private home of the honorable member for Barrier- </para>

Sometimes the honorable member speaking is unable to get out a single sentence without a series of audible comments from one side or the. other being made.

                            <para>- Before leaving the House I have often asked messengers to open any telegrams that might come addressed to me, and repeat them over the telephone to me, so that I could be in a position to deal with them at once. Probably other honorable members have adopted the same practice. The telegram to the honorable member for Barrier could have been repeated over the telephone to his home. </para>

                            <para>- I am rather surprised that the telegram was not sent in to him in the chamber. Probably the messengers thought that the honorable member was out of the building, and they placed the message in his box, believing that he would soon return and get it. The Minister claims that the Committee, as proposed, does not represent the proportion of parties in the House. I think I can say, on behalf of the honorable member for Barrier, that the Government can appoint their own Committee. So long as they appoint the honorable member affected on the &#34;Committee they can appoint all the other members of it from their own side. </para>

The Minister for Works and Railways has said that it is purely a departmental matter - that if the postal authorities thought they had wrongly delivered the telegram, they should have power to recall it. But if the telegram had been wrongly delivered, why should it be re-delivered to the honorable  member  for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> next day ?  I  myself have a telegram which came from Sydney yesterday, mutilated in transmission, and bearing an ordinary  rubber  stamp of the words &#34; Correction to follow.&#34; However, there is no doubt that this telegram was withheld for some reason, and if it was a military reason,  why should not the honorable member for Barrier be informed what it is? </para>

                            <para>- It is badly wanted, for it is one of the worst-administered sections of the Defence Department; and that is saying a great deal. A conference of editors was called by the Government, and it was decided that the only pews prohibited should be military news which might prove advantageous to the enemy or hurtful to our Allies ; but immediately after that conference I showed in this House that the censorship was being used for personal military reasons - military-friendship 2&#39;easons, as they might be called. The statement I made was censored; but when I handed it to the Acting Prime Minister, he said there was absolutely nothing in it that was not innocuous. At the Conference at Government House, when the question of the censorship was under discussion, and several cases were cited, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> said he did not stand there as a protagonist for the censor, and that if he had been in my position he would have said much stronger things than I had done. On that occasion the Premier of New South Wale3 instanced a case where the censorship had been used for political reasons, and a further instance was provided later by the Prime Minister himself, who had caused a statement made in the Senate by. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to be censored because he, the Prime Minister, wished to deliver it himself subsequently in the House of Representatives. At the Conference <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> asked the Prime Minister whether it was true that he had used the censorship for such a purpose, and the Prime Minister admitted that he had. It is safe to say that there was not one man at that Conference who could defend the action of the censors. If there is a vote taken on this motion, I hope it will not &#39;be on party lines; but that honorable members will act iu accordance with what they consider to be right. As to the case cited particularly by the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine),</inline> the censor could easily have obtained a copy of the telegram from the postal authorities. </para>

                            <para>- And it was received on the Thursday night. For the benefit of honorable members, who were not present when the honorable member for Barrier made his statement, I may say that the telegram, consisting of thirty-seven words, was despatched from Broken Hill on the Thursday at 4.45 p.m., and was received here at &#38;.50 p.m. That was in the dinner-hour, when, I believe, the telegraph office in the building is open. At any rate, even if the telegram had to come from the General Post Office, it ought to have been here before 8 o&#39;clock  but, as we know, the honorable member did not receive it until the following day. The telegram was taken by a messenger here in the ordinary course of his work,  and pinned on to the door of the honorable member&#39;s locker. If the censor .did think it necessary to keep a copy of the telegram, surely the member for the district had the right to know what was going on, so that he might make inquiries from the Acting Prime Minister or the Minister for Defence? In these matters, we should do everything to avoid creating cases of hardship, and causing dissension in the community. Here, however, these miners, in their working clothes, were seized, and, without being given an opportunity to go to their homes, sent away by train on to Melbourne, and, I presume, on to Sydney. Surely all the circumstances show good  reason for inquiry. </para>

We all know that not a word that is said here or elsewhere in reference to the seizures of Italians is allowed to appear in any newspaper in Australia. The reporters upstairs, and in the Inter-State press galleries, will not report one line of this debate; and that is according to the instructions that have gone forth. All the same, the whole* of the debate will appear in the 7,500 copies of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that are circulated. It would appear really that all this is done by direction of the_ Minister for Defence, because it is a military matter; but in the case of a member&#39;s telegram, it is surely not for the Minister to act in the way he has. </para>

What has occurred in the case of the honorable member for Barrier to-day may occur to any honorable member to-morrow; and I ask the House to approve of a Select Committee, so that we may have an inquiry, and, perhaps, some commonsense instilled into the censor&#39;s department. </para>

                        <para>.- If the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> has made no mistake about the information he has placed before the House, I have no hesitation in saying that there has been a breach of the privileges of members. I cannot understand how a telegram delivered to a member&#39;s private box can be withdrawn by any authority outside Parliament. I understand that not even the Postmaster-General or any of his officials can demand back a letter or telegram that has been handed to the person to whom it was addressed. Therefore, if any House attendant gave out a telegram to anybody he committed an error of judgment. But the ugliest feature of the case is that the telegram could have no military significance whatever, and if the censor has prevented the telegram from being delivered to the honorable member it would appear that either he has been acting outside his definite instructions, or for some reason or other those instructions have, in this case at any rate, exceeded what are usually regarded as the directions to be followed by the censors throughout Australia. To my mind, it is a very serious matter indeed that a telegram sent by electors in any part of Australia should be withheld from their member in the manner in which this telegram is reported .to have been withheld. Therefore, I feel that some inquiry into this matter is highly necessary. I do not wish to discuss the censorship at large. Undoubtedly it has not been too well managed in the past, and blunders and excesses have been committed which in ordinary circumstances would not be tolerated for a moment. Many instances of the ineptitude of the censorship have been brought under my notice, but I have refrained from dealing with them, except to make a protest privately in regard to some incidents. But the matter before the House is one which we cannot afford to ignore altogether. I do not agree, however, that an inquiry such as has been suggested is the proper course to adopt. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> are the custodian of the rights and privileges of Parliament, and I feel sure that if the matter is left in your hands you will inquire into it and report upon the facts as you find them. If you report that an outrage such as the honorable member for Barrier has complained of has been committed, I shall&#39; be prepared to take such action as is necessary, and I presume that the majority of members will be prepared to assert the privileges of Parliament, even against the Government, if necessary, though I do not think that the Government has anything to do with this matter. The incident which was related to us to-day is but another illustration of the officiousness and ineptitude of this wretched branch of the Defence Department, which apparently is allowed an almost unlimited length of rope* I shall not vote for the motion for the reasons I have stated, but shall await with interest the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and if he advises to the effect I have indicated I shall be prepared to take any steps that may be necessary to vindicate Parliament against outrages of this kind. </para>

                        <para>.- I should have thought that if there is any matter at all that might be discussed apart from the limitation of party bias, it is the question of the privileges of honorable members, not because of the special claims which honorable members make for themselves, but because of their representative character, and because - and this is a reason which should appeal to the Government - the preservation of parliamentary privileges is one of the oldest and most highly respected traditions of British parliamentary government. If the facts stated by the honorable member for Barrier are correct, does the action of the censor Constitute a breach of parliamentary privilege ? I cannot but believe that the Minister addressed himself to this question as though he sat at the table with a brief handsomely marked to expound the views of the party which had retained him rather than as one in whom was reposed the trust of putting the question fairly before honorable members. It is alleged that a telegram addressed to an honorable member was conveyed by the ordinary and proper methods to this House, and placed on the private box of that honorable member by a House messenger. For all practical purposes the telegram was delivered to the honorable member in the House for parliamentary use. Subsequently that telegram was taken from off the honorable member&#39;s box, and we are told that that action was not a breach of privilege. I do not believe that the Minister would stake his legal reputation on the contention that the removal of that telegram does not constitute a breach of one of the recognised privileges of Parliament. One of the basic privileges of honorable members is that nothing must be done within the precincts of Parliament to interfere with the deliberations of honorable members. To-day we have an allegation that a document which might have been, and probably was, of the first importance to the deliberations of honorable members was impounded by &#187; some exterior body, purloined, and taken away. It is quite clear to me that if correspondence may be taken from the box of an honorable member, members themselves may 1 be intercepted on their way to the debating chamber, and documents which they hold for reproduction in the House may be impounded, their remarks made sterile and useless, and members themselves rendered in that way incapable of stating the views of themselves and their constituents. Nothing, can be clearer than that the action of the censor was a direct interference with the fundamental right .of honorable members to address themselves to any question in this House. It is said that we have not proved that the telegram was removed other than perhaps in the ordinary way by a representative of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. All that the honorable member for Barrier has to do is to make out a good <inline font-style="italic">prim&#226; facie</inline> case in order to establish his right &#39;to an inquiry of some sort. </para>

A telegram came to the House relating to a matter which the censor says may not be referred to outside of the House, namely, the forcible deportation of Italians. We have protested against the refusal of the authorities to allow the matter to be discussed outside of Parliament; we have said that it ought to be so discussed. But the censor, in the exercise of his autocratic powers, and utilizing a subservient Minister for his own purpose, has decided that the matter must neither be discussed outside nor referred to in&#39; any publication other than <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> That was the subject-matter of the telegram which was addressed to the honorable member for Barrier.

The second fact is that, with but one precedent in this House, a document belonging to an honorable member was seized and taken away, and this constitutes the third ground of the honorable member&#39;s case, and it is, that the only similar abuse that has been perpetrated was when officers of the censorship removed from this building the papers belonging to the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts).</inline></para>

                            <para>- We do not. And, as another honorable member interjects, &#34;Thank the Lord for that&#34; - for many reasons, and, amongst others, for the fact that this war has been made by members of the present Government the excuse for the exercise of party politics through the censorship in a peculiarly ignoble way. The three points I have mentioned are the basis of the honorable member&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case. The mere fact that a document belonging to an honorable member has been taken away is in itself ground for inquiry. The matter referred to in the telegram is one which the censorship had prevented from being mentioned outside of Parliament; that is another ground for inquiry. And the delivery of the telegram was delayed until after the House rose on Friday last, and until the work in connexion with tha arrest of Italians had been accomplished. I should like very much to have the history of those telegrams placed before the House. Might we not well know who came to the House and took away a document belonging to the honorable member for  Barrier ? Might we not well know where one of these telegrams was typewritten, and where the mysterious words, &#34;Entered E.T.O. and issued 4.15 p.m.&#34; were written upon it ? I think it is clear enough that one of these telegrams was issued from the censor&#39;s office. What we have to submit to at the hands of the censor in connexion with non-parliamentary publications is bad enough, but it is useless for us to blame the censorship staff. I do not blame them. I know that some honorable members have applied to the censor for permission to print certain things. I shall never demean myself bv approaching the censor for permission to print anything. I hold the Government entirely responsible for all that the censor has done, and for having for the first time in British history played the party game by the exercise of the military machine. And the most potent arm of that machine is that by which they have hidden away the opinions of men who differ from them. The Minister has said that the honorable member for Barrier has not technically made out a case of breach of privilege, and that he could quote page, section, and verse from <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> to show that the honorable member has not proceeded in the proper way to establish the charge which he has brought forward. Whether that be so or not, is it not worth while to get at the history of a matter that threatens the basis of parliamentary government and the rights of the people outside? After all, we are only the spokesmen of the people: We do not ask for privileges for ourselves, but we do ask for them as representatives of the people, and for that reason I hope that the Government will drop their severely technical attitude on this matter and endeavour to arrive at the truth of a scandal that threatens the. well-being cf our parliamentary institutions. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member who has just resumed his seat went far beyond the question which is directly involved in the case mentioned by the honorable member for Barrier; indeed, the motion itself exceeds the particular allegation of breach of privilege which the House has been asked to consider. The honorable member for Barrier has assumed two things: firstly, that the action complained of was taken by the censor; whether that is so or not I cannot say, and he cannot give us any information on the subject.  His  second assumption is that there was bad faith on the part of the Government. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member seemed to go further, and to directly charge the Government with bad faith in the&#39; matter. He seemed to charge them with having, for their own purposes, deliberately delayed the delivery of . this telegram. To that extent he has largely spoilt his case. In the discussion of this matter we are very much in the dark. It seems extraordinary that such an incident should have occurred; and I quite agree that it should form the subject of &#34; inquiry, so that we may ascertain what the facts are. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is prepared to make an inquiry, and after we have received his report on the facts, we &#39;should be able to decide whether a breach of privilege has been committed. </para>

If there has been a breach of privilege, then the honorable member has, of course, a right to complain.  His  motion, however, is in direct contravention of the decision of the House upon a motion submitted a little while ago, in which a similar inquiry was demanded. If my honorable friend desires an inquiry into his case, which seems extraordinary and anomalous, he has a right to have it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has undertaken to make an inquiry, since th&#39;e matter comes directly within his jurisdiction. </para>

                        <para>.- It cannot be denied that once a telegram has been delivered, and has so passed out of the custody of the telegraph office, it is the property of the individual to whom it is addressed. In this case the telegram was delivered to a messenger in this House. Subsequently a telegraph messenger, I understand, was sent along by some one to ask for the return of the telegram, and by this trick it was secured. If it had been delivered to the honorable member&#39;s private  residence, it  would, no doubt, have been opened. immediately, and action could have been taken upon it. When honorable members are away from home they usually arrange for some one to open any telegrams addressed to them. The return of this message was secured by a trick worthy of the vile system of censorship in operation here. I do not blame the officers. They have to carry out their instructions; it is the vile system of censorship of which I complain. We all know how strict is the control exercised by the Post and. Telegraph Department over a letter or any postal matter intrusted to it for delivery. On two occasions I have had to take action to secure the return of a letter after it had been posted. In one case it was most important that the letter should not be delivered. I secured its return to the person who had posted it, but only with the greatest difficulty. The sender had to make a sworn declaration before he could have it handed over to him, and, having made the desired alterations in it, he once more posted it. If the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department exercises such strict control over a letter once it is placed in a pillar box, is it not reasonable to expect equal care in the delivery of a telegram ? In this case the telegram had been delivered. The Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> indulged in a legal quibble- </para>

When two Italians lost their lives owing to interference with letters in the British Post Office, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone,</inline> in a most eloquent speech, declared that he would take steps to see that the proper care of a letter, once it was posted, should be regarded as a sacred duty of the Department. I do not know of what the Government .are afraid in this &#169;ase. Are they seeking to hide something of which they are ashamed? Honorable members will admit that the censorship is at times not only cruel but absolutely idiotic. The censor in Sydney will allow newspapers to publish matter which the censor in Melbourne will not permit to be published here, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> Sometimes the great daily newspapers publish a paragraph in  defiance  of the censor, and not much notice is taken of their action; but if some little newspaper, struggling for existence, dares to do anything of the kind, its publisher is fined. The managers of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> recently said to the censor, &#34; If you will not allow thi3 matter to be published, our paper will not go out.&#34; The result was that the censor did not dare to carry out his threat. I recognise that in time of war a censorship may be of great use; but it ought to be administered in a sensible way. The Minister for Works and Railways cannot, - by mere sophistry or legal quibbles, get away from the facts. There can be no doubt that two mistakes have been made in thi3 case. Every honorable member will agree that censorship of any postal matter should take place before delivery of that matter. If the censor found he had made a mistake, and did not want the honorable  member  for Barrier to have this information, there was a certain course open to him. These Italians have been treated in an infamous way. It is an infamy that they should have been removed from Broken Hill without preparation, herded in second class carriages without any attention being paid to their food requirements, and not allowing their wives, possibly Australianborn girls, to have five minutes in which to say good-bye to them. This is what has happened in a country which on two occasions has declared against conscription, and will, when it has the opportunity, replace members opposite by others of a different opinion. The Government has allowed itself to be made the tool of the Italian Government. </para>

                            <para>- The importance of the telegram is known to every member who heard it read. Could any more generous offer be made than that of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> who said, &#34; Let the Government appoint a Committee of six members, choosing if it likes five of its own supporters, the sixth to be the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine).&#34;</inline> Sooner or later the party of the minority becomes the party of the majority, and what members opposite do now may recoil on them in the future. A Government supported by a large majority does not always hold the balance level, and of late this Government has not been doing so. I remember the days when Liberalism was honoured in the Parliament of Victoria, and every member of that body would have supported the  Speaker  in such noble and splendid action as yours, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> in connexion with the recent case of privilege; but the majority differed from me on the occasion to which I refer. I do not know what will happen in this instance ; but members will regret any whittling away of the privileges of Parliament. I do not look at this matter from a party point of view. At a time like this, much should be excused, but that should make the Government the more careful to do justice to all. If it were widely known that telegrams and letters are not safe from interference after delivery to the addressee, the public would complain bitterly. Even, the press has spoken definitely, though guardedly, of the infamy, of the censorship, although the large newspapers have been given privileges which have been denied to the small newspapers. Members generally will admit that all newspapers should be treated alike ; but the small newspapers have been rigorously kept down. I know from actual knowledge that the officers of the Censor&#39;s Department in Victoria and in New South Wales regret some of the orders which&#39; they have to obey, and would not act as they do except under compulsion. But they have to carry out their duties. I have never received anything but the utmost courtesy from these officers, who have not personally resented criticism in most severe terms. They have told me that the orders which they receive are sometimes such as they think should not be given. I was* glad to hear you say, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that you will have an inquiry made. I corrected the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best),</inline> because I knew that he was speaking in error. I shall vote for the inquiry, as I shall always vote for an inquiry where a wrong is alleged to have been committed. Every member, without regard to political opinions, should support the proposal of the honorable member for Barrier. To-morrow it may be a member opposite who may have cause for complaint. Should the motion not be&#39; carried, a majority of the House may, after your inquiry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> feel that a further inquiry should be made to ascertain who used a telegraph messenger to regain by a trick a telegram which had been delivered at this building. </para>

The suggested <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Committee indicates that there is no intention of making this matter a party question; and as the expressions of honorable members con&#39;cerning the censorship show that there is general dissatisfaction in regard to it, it would be a wise step on the part of the House to have an inquiry into it based upon the grievance set out by the honorable member for Barrier. &#39; The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> seemed to be under the impression that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> had adopted a certain attitude which really was not the attitude assumed by him. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has intimated that he merely intends to make inquiries regarding the fact that an officer of the House may have had something to do with the removal of a telegram from the box of the honorable member for Barrier, and find out who is to blame in that regard. But there, so far as he is concerned, the matter must stop. We want it to go further. Our complaint is not against a messenger of the House, who may have done something on the spur of the moment. </para>

                            <para>- I have not much doubt about it. At any rate, the truth could very easily be elicited by the proposed committee, and whatever may be done will be done not only in the interests of honorable members of this House, but also in the interests of the public generally. Every reputable journal in Australia has complained from time to time of the peculiar methods adopted by the censor, and yet the Government allow him to continue in his course of action, not only robbing honorable members of privileges, but also robbing the public and the press of privileges which they have enjoyed from time immemorial. Of course, every one admits that there are things which should not be published from the house-tops, and that the publication of things &#34;which would help the enemy or injure us in the conduct of the &#34;war should not be allowed, but it seems to many of us that the censor is employing certain methods as if he were using a political arm. It is strange that all the complaints come from this side of the House; it is strange that if any documents are scrutinized or detained the sufferers are always members on this side of the House. Outside it is just the same.  All the prosecutions are against men on our side of politics. Everything is done to deprive us of privileges which we have enjoyed. If honorable members opposite were on this side of the chamber they would be much more vociferous in raising complaints than we are against the treatment which is being meted out to us. The honorable member for Barrier has brought forward a substantial grievance. More than that, it is a substantial wrong against an honorable member on this side of the House, and it is the duty of every honorable member to come to his assistance and release him from the position in which he has been placed by the censor. We never know when the censor may make a slip. I could understand the honorable member for Kooyong making things very lively if a letter of his were detained. Things are done in Australia which are not tolerated or done in Great Britain. The freest discussion is permitted in New Zealand, not only inside the Dominion Parliament, but also among the public outside. Advice was recently given and published at Christchurch to men who had been called up in batches which, if it had been given in Australia, would have been called&#39; sedition, and would have led to arrests all round. The freest discussion is permitted in New Zealand. It is the safety valve of every community. </para>

                    <para>It is time we inquired into the peculiar fashion in which the censor has dealt with many of the matters that have come before him. I complain of the light and airy way in which the Minister for Works and Railways received the motion. He tried to side-track it. He tried a form of special pleading. He tried everything except arguments dealing with the special point at issue. When such an important motion was submitted to the House, if the Minister in charge for the time being was not prepared on behalf of the Government to consent to the request put forward in that motion, surely he could have suggested some other method of inquiry but that of referring the matter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> whose powers in that direction are so limited. We believe that the  Speaker  will zealously guard the privileges of the House so far as he is able to do so, but his arm is not long enough nor is it strong enough to go outside the House and bring the censor to book. </para>

                            <para>- There should be no indefiniteness about the nature of the action to be taken. We are in possession of certain knowledge which shows that there is need for further inquiry than that which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> jean make, and that the House should consent to the proposal put forward by the honorable member for Barrier, or amend it so that the information we desire to obtain may be elicited. A very magnanimous and generous offer has been made by the Leader of the Opposition. We are so far removed from making this a party question, and so desirous of having a proper inquiry made in regard to this very unjustifiable interference with a member&#39;s correspondence, that he has told the Government that if they make the committee a committee of six they can have five members on it, or that they can have six members if there are seven members on the committee. If honorable members are desirous of putting a stop to interference with members&#39; correspondence, -they should certainly assent to this proposal. Nobody  i  can make a party question out of it. </para>

                            <para>- There is no telling. An honorable member who may be coming into the chamber with- a letter or a piece of information in his hand, which has just reached him in the previous postal delivery from his constituency, may be accosted in the &#34;corridor, and told that he has a letter in his hand from such-and-such a person, and must deliver it up. He may be compelled to do so by moral suasion, or by force, or perhaps a military contingent may demand its surrender. We are\ frittering away our privileges, and we are very foolish if we permit it. From every section of the community there is a cry for delivery from tile iron heel of the censor. The censorship was one of the matters dealt with at the recent Conference at Government House, and a promise was made that the community would be delivered from its undue rigour ; but, so far from there being any relief, it is found that members&#39; telegrams and letters are not safe, although these may be necessary in the performance of their parliamentary duties. We are com&#62;ing to a sorry pass when this kind of thing is tolerated. The Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn),</inline> who is at present in charge of the House, is admittedly prepared to deal out even-handed justice; and I appeal to him, as a member of the &#34; Cabinet of all the talents,&#34; to see that the promise made at that Conference is kept. It is about time that the Ministry set out to honour some of their promises, and this promise in particular. We on this side seem to be the chief sufferers, since the great volume of criticism and complaint comes from the Labour side. I do not know whether we are made the special subjects of the censor&#39;s efforts, but it would appear that the honorable member for Barrier, who has often complained, is being made to &#34; sit up.&#34; Personally, I cannot account for the way in which that honorable member has been treated. </para>

                        <para>. - I am glad to hear the announcement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> that, now the matter has been brought under his notice, he will have it sifted, so far as his powers go, and make a report to the House. Undoubtedly, the facts as disclosed by the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> involve a breach of privilege; and as to the justification or otherwise of that breach, it  i3  for the Government to explain. The Ministry, or some one on their behalf, should have immediately shown a disposition to guard the interests of members, and show how far we are protected by our privileges. A telegram attached to the private locker of a member must be said to be in lids possession, and, if it is removed, it is taken from his possession. Two courses were open to the honorable member for Barrier : one to get in touch with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the Leader  of  the Government, or with the  Deputy  Postmaster-General, whose contract it was to deliver the telegram, and ascertain why the delivery had been cancelled. I do not say what course the honorable member should have taken, but these were the two open to him. </para>

If the subject-matter of the telegram was in any way suspect, it is for the censor, through the Government, to say so here. There is no honorable member worth his &#39; 1 salt &#39; &#39; who would allow a telegram to be taken from his private box without &#34;raising Cain,&#34; for if such action is not a breach of privilege, I do not know what is.  However, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I accept your assurance that you will have the matter fully investigated, and report to the House. I shall anxiously await the result, expecting that if those investigations are not satisfactory from the point of view of this Chamber,  the Governmentwill take some action to maintain our privileges. </para>

                        <para>- No ; but the honorable member and others have voted for a fixed rate of interest from time to time. For all loans but the last, the rate of interest was fixed at 4&#189; per cent. free of income tax, and the last was floated on the alternative conditions of 4&#189; per cent. free of income tax, or 5 per cent. subject to taxation. Honorable members know if we had had to go upon the London market at any time during the last twelve months we should have been obliged to pay more than 4&#189; per cent., and I contend that the Government should intimate to the House what rate of interest they propose to allow, and not wait for the interest to be fixed by the fluctuations of the market. If honorable members will peruse some of the recent legislation in New Zealand, they will see that the Dominion Government propose much more rigorous conditions in connexion with finance than have been attempted in Australia. In the course of his 1917 Budget, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward, the Treasurer of the Dominion, said that if rich people did not contribute according to their means compulsory conditions would be introduced. Evidently he has not been satisfied that many rich people have contributed as generously as they should have done, for in his latest Finance Bill he has included a provision which will make it compulsory for persons receiving more than a stated income to contribute, and such compulsory contributors, instead of receiving 4&#189; per cent. interest, will be allowed only 3 per cent., and will be charged double income tax and land tax as a penalty. We do not hear of any such legislation being proposed in this Parliament, but a fear has been expressed that the withdrawal of immunity from taxation will make this loan less attractive, and that it may not be fully subscribed. We can relieve ourselves of all trouble and anxiety on that score by adopting the method proposed in New Zealand, and if rich people will not come forward with their money we can compel them to do so. </para>

                        <para>- My amendment will give the rich people of the country an opportunity to show their patriotism by lending money to the Commonwealth free of interest. To-day Australia is in serious financial straits, but much blacker times are ahead of us, and we have a right to ask some of those who can best afford to do so to come to the assistance of the Government, in this time of storm and stress, by subscribing generously out of the abundance of their riches, without asking for an interest return. If they will not do that, their professions of patriotism must be regarded as only so much froth. I know that I shall be reminded of the total sum contributed voluntarily to the patriotic funds. But the time has come for us to put a straight-out proposition to the people: &#34;Others are going to the Front, and endangering their lives. Some have already made the extreme sacrifice. What are you prepared to do?&#34; The amendment will afford an opportunity for the Treasurer to say that he will endeavour to raise the next loan free of interest. </para>

                <para>New Zealand, no man receiving less than &#163;300 a year is called upon to pay income tax, and no man with land of an unimproved value of less than &#163;500 is required to pay land tax. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward said, when speaking on &#39;his Finance Bill, that no man receiving less than &#163;700 per annum would be brought under the compulsory clause, but all in receipt of incomes  above that amount, if they did not contribute a fair quota to the loans, would be called upon to do so compulsorily. And, as far as I am able to judge, the financial position of New Zealand is much better than that of Australia. Dark times are ahead of us, and now is the time for us to commence to make sacrifices. I submit my amendment to the Committee with confidence. I hope it will be carried unanimously, and that we shall all go out recruiting for money, as well as for men to go to the Front. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree with the mover of the amendment that we ought to have a statement from the Treasurer as to what rate of interest the Government propose to allow in connexion with this loan. When considering previous Loan Bills, honorable members had the advantage of having the prospectus before them. During the discussion on the last Loan Bill, the advisability of making the income from interest free of taxation was questioned, and probably as a result of the views then expressed the Treasurer announced that the most recent flotation was the last to which that inducement would attach. Later, he repeated in this House that the Government did not propose to float further loans the interest upon which should be free of income tax. I think that something might be done in the direction suggested by the amendment. </para>

                <para>During the debate on the second reading, the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> referred to the dividends  paid by certain companies, and the number of shareholders who participated. It is well known that one of the companies to which he referred, namely, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, has a provident fund to which every permanent employee has to contribute on a percentage basis, and the bulk of the fund is invested in shares in the company. The chances are that few, if any, of the employees would hold one full share, yet every employee who is a registered member of the provident fund would probably be accounted a shareholder. The honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> and others interested in the sugar industry know that what I say is correct. </para>

                <para>There has never been such a complete return of the income and assets of the community as that made in connexion with the war census in 1915, when it was said that something might be done in the direction of a levy on the wealth of the community. At page 107 of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs&#39;</inline><inline font-style="italic">Pocket Compendium of Australian Statistics</inline> for 1918 it is stated that 2,191,945 residents of Australia made returns of wealth and income under the War Census Act. If I &#39;remember rightly every person over eighteen years of age was required to furnish a return, and only those under eighteen who were in possession of either income or of a certain amount of assets were compelled to do so. Of this total of 2,191,945 persons only 381,558, or a little less than, one-fifth, were in receipt of &#163;156 , per year and upwards; more than four-fifths were receiving less than &#163;3 per week. I find, on analyzing the figures given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> that of this total 840,400 males malting returns were receiving over &#163;100 a year, and 539,808 were receiving under &#163;100 per annum, and only 92,563 females&#39; were receiving over &#163;100 a year, while 719,174 were receiving less than &#163;100 a year. At page 108 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> gives the aggregate income of these &#39;2,191,945 persons at &#163;240,163,204. Of that amount &#163;124,567,113 was enjoyed by persons who were in receipt of over &#163;156 per year, or, in other words, twoelevenths of the persons making returns got more than one-half of the income of this country, and nine-elevenths - the great bulk of the people - had less than one-half of it. At page 113 of the <inline font-style="italic">Compendium</inline> the total assets of the community, as shown by the war census returns, are given. The return sets out the aggregate net assets of persons resident in Australia, exclusive of the value of interests in trust estates, insurance and annuity policies, and prospective benefits from friendly societies and trade unions, which are included under another heading. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> shows that the aggregate net assets of the community at the time the census was taken were of the value of &#163;1,216,231,662. Of that amount &#163;1,062,648,708, or more than five-sixths of the total, was held by persons possessing assets of the value of &#163;500 and upwards. In short, less than one-sixth of the total number of persons making returns held more than&#39; five-sixths of the assets. The bulk of the people of Australia, however, did not make returns. When you want to find large families you do not go to Toorak or Malvern, Hawthorn or Kew, but to the- industrial suburbs, of Footscray, Collingwood, Fitzroy, and Brunswick. </para>
                <para>These figures constitute one reason why I urge the Treasurer to do something more than is being done by this Bill to finance our vast undertakings. When the right honorable member for Swan (Lord Forrest) was Treasurer last year I asked him in this House, &#34; Why do you not increase the income tax?&#34; His reply was, &#34; We have plenty of money,&#34; but at the same time he introduced a Loan Bill for &#163;40,000,000.&#39; If there is plenty of money in the community, let us take a reasonable proportion of it by way of taxation from the people who have it. Do not let us go on piling up a vast indebtedness for posterity to pay. The Treasurer has told us that we shall be owing presently &#163;309,000,000, and no provision is being made for its repayment. </para>
                <para>Tlie income tax has not been increased for two years. Some two years ago it was increased bv 25 per cent. ; but if our income tax rates be compared with those of other countries, it will be seen that the wealthy people of Australia are escaping practically scot-free from direct taxation. We have had bountiful harvests, and the prices of wool, wheat, and other primary products are phenomenally high. </para>

                        <para>- I do not object to the producers receiving high prices, but I blame the Government for not increasing its taxation in proportion to the increase in the wealth of the community. I am satisfied that if another War Census were taken to-morrow, the margin as between the rich and the poor would be found to be wider than ever. It would probably be found that less than one-eighth of the community owned seven-eighths of its assets. It might also be found that a slightly larger proportion of wage-earners than was the case in 1915 were in receipt of &#163;156 per annum and upwards; but every one knows that the purchasing power of the sovereign has substantially decreased since the war began. Therefore, while it might appear that more people had come within the scope of our income tax laws, they have been wrongfully brought within it. They may be, nominally receiving slightly better wages : but in reality, having regard to the reduced purchasing power of the sovereign, they are not. </para>

                        <para>- The production of the last few years has been absolutely phenomenal. The wool clip for the calendar year 1912 was worth about &#163;22,500,000, whereas last year&#39;s clip was worth about &#163;50,000,000, and this notwithstanding that the number of our sheep had been reduced by 20,000,000. The pastoralists had fewer sheep to shear, yet they received &#163;50,000,000 for their clip, as against &#163;22,500,000 in 1912. </para>

                        <para>- Including the returns for sheepskins, it was probably more than &#163;50,000,000. Taking the honorable member&#39;s own figures, the value of the wool clip last year was double that of 1912, yet the Government have done practically nothing to secure, by way of taxation, any proportion of these increased profits. The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Livingston)</inline> has asked why I speak of increased taxation. I have no hesitation in doing so when we have men risking their lives while others are not asked to contribute anything like their fair proportion to the cost of government. Before introducing this Bill, the Government should have told us definitely what they propose to do in the way of increased taxation. Having regard to the phenomenally bountiful seasons we have enjoyed, we have a right to pay a little more of our current expenditure out of revenue, and not to go on piling up a huge debt for posterity to bear. I was led to analyze the War Census figures as the result of an interjection wrongly credited to me by the newspapers last week, and I was surprised to find that one-sixth of the community in 1915 held more than one-half of the country&#39;s assets, while the remaining five-sixths were simply struggling along. The five-sixths really represent a larger proportion of the community, because there are very many people who do not send in income tax returns. I hope that the Government will make a definite statement of their proposals in regard to interest, and in regard to future taxation. </para>

Long before the banks determined to encourage investment in war loans by offering overdrafts to those who would invest, private persons were borrowing from the banks by way of overdraft to lend to the Government. </para>

                    <para>.- I shall not add much to what I have already said on the subject of finance. Members now, as on former occasions, seem to re gard the proposed loan as a matter of little interest, although &#163;80,000,000 is to be borrowed. Many persons think that there is money stored up in large tanks, which can be drawn on by way of loan just as goods might be taken out of a store; but this is not so. The workers, however, naturally ask, when they find a Government loan over-subscribed, why are not those who possess so much wealth subjected to proper taxation. The wealthy have proclaimed their anxiety to assist in winning the war, and why are they not taxed to that end? Within the last few days the Broken Hill Proprietary Company has proposed to increase its capital of 1,500,000 shares paid up to 8s., to the same number of shares paid up to &#163;1, taking the necessary 12s. per share from their reserve. They propose, also, to give every holder of ten 8s. shares fourteen &#163;1 shares. That is the position of one of our companies. When the sons of the industrialist section of the community are away at the Front, why should not the wealthy, if they cannot send their sons, make some monetary sacrifice? There should be equality of sacrifice. This is the only portion of the Empire which is not imposing taxation to meet the expenses of the war. That is what New Zealand and Great Britain have done. According to a balance-sheet issued on the 16th March, the British Government paid &#163;1,714,233,808 from revenue to meet the expenses of the war, and raised by taxation during the week between the 9th and 16th March &#163;22,438,895. We are not imposing taxation in the same way, although the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and every bank in Australia have increased their reserves. Why should not those who are benefiting by the expenditure caused by the war contribute towards its cost? Their position would be different if the Government were not borrowing and spending so much. Those who benefit by the war are the people who should pay taxes. If peace were declared at the end of this year, many thousands of men in Australia who are now employed on war industries would be thrown out of work, and would be unable to contribute to the revenue. When there is general unemployment, it is impossible to increase taxation. New South Wales  was saved on <inline font-style="italic">one</inline> occasion when there was much unemployment by the action of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> W. O&#39;sullivan, in spending about &#163;8,000,000 of borrowed money on public works. If we neglect to raise revenue by taxation while we are able to do so, we shall be unable to do&#39; it later. Had the Labour party come into power after the last election, one of its first duties would have been to see that as much revenue as possible was raised during the Avar, when there was so much money in circulation. That would have been the common-sense arrangement. The financial editors of our journals know that what I am saying is gospel truth, but as their newspapers support the Government, they are cloaking the real issue. Those who know what is sound and just and right know that the way to finance this Avar is to do what I suggest; but my words  are so much wind to honorable members opposite, who will not face the inevitable position, although the Treasurer has told us plainly how much money has been  borrowed  for Avar purposes by Commonwealth and State Governments. The position is a very serious one in the eyes of all who desire the prosperity of this country. Honorable members opposite must either admit their inability to grasp the situation, or their fear of taxing those who have the money to pay taxation. There might be reason for ridiculing what I say if the history of the past did not furnish facts which bear out my statements. But honorable members cannot ridicule the position, and the longer the matter is delayed the worse the damage that will result. There is no attempt to rise to the occasion. I have not that implicit faith in the Government that will lead me to believe that they will not be driven into giving a higher rate of interest than that which it is the opinion of this House should be paid. Are Ave dumb dogs? Are Ave afraid to approach those Who are in power, and ask them to give us such information as that when we leave this Chamber after they have got three months&#39; Supply, and can tell us to go to a warm place, we Wil know  what  rate of interest is to be paid? We  know  that as long as Ministers get sufficient Supply to enable them to carry on they Will not worry about the VieWS of honorable members. I am not one of those who believe that almost everything in the form of war liability should be handed down to posterity. I am of opinion that we should so act as to prevent those who come after us from condemning us. As a young nation we should be laying down those high and noble principles  which  are the essentials of good government, and nothing is more essential in that respect than good finance. But Ave are making no attempt at good finance. Unfortunately the pres3 of Australia is behind the Government. There has been a Conference of editors, and now twelve representatives of the press of Australia are to go Home and interview the representatives of the press in England. Heaven only knows  what  will happen when they come back! </para>

If that end be achieved, it Will have been a cheap trip, whatever the expenditure. - This continual raising of loans is doing no good to the industrial section of the community. The class Avith whom I have been identified all my life know the position. The belief that there are people in Australia who are increasing their wealth beyond all reason cannot be  removed  from their minds. And why should it be when some sections of the community are reaping such large benefits in the war ? Try to realize the position when one is addressing a meeting of thousands of people, and the interjection comes, &#34;Where are they going to get this loan money from? &#34; What can one say, except that the wealthy people are shelling out their wealth at 4-J per cent, and 5 per cent.? Now avc have nothing authentic to show that the Government Will not give more than 5 per cent. It is the people who have to pay the interest, and the representatives of the people ought to be in a position to know  what  rate of interest is to be paid. A dumb Parliament, in a democratic community, is a matter for ridicule. </para>

                        <para>- No one has ever heard me say such a thing. I have endeavoured to be practical. I base my statements on my long knowledge of Australian affairs, commercial, industrial, and otherwise; and I am endeavouring to get honorable members into a sane frame of mind. Every one knows that when the Fisher Government issued a loan at 4&#163; per cent., free of taxation, an endeavour was made to instill into the minds of the people the idea that Australia was a nation which should be self-contained, and that nothing would be more pertinent towards achieving that end than that those of her citizens who held wealth should contribute to the loans raised by the National Government, on which the National Government should pay interest. But I am sure that no one thought then that we would ask for &#163;43,000,000 within three months. I do not know what the press would have said if I had made a statement to that effect. I see that there are no pressmen in the gallery now. It shows what interest they take in these matters. There are two -sides to every question, and whether my side is right or wrong the people who support me are entitled to know what my views are. However, the Government have taken a certain course, and the people who have put them in power must accept the responsibility. I hold that Australia made a mistake on 5 th May, 1917, but the supporters of the Government include many gentlemen who have large vested interests, and, when they ousted the Labour Government,&#39; they naturally expected that their interests would be better protected. I have always maintained that when the industrial section of the community is prosperous, when the landlords can collect their rents, and when the workers have , sufficient to pay their butchers&#39; and grocers&#39; bills, and to clothe themselves and their families decently, those gentlemen who have vested interests are more likely to be more prosperous than when the opposite conditions prevail. I have already said that this Parliament has not risen to the occasion, or to the expectations of the people, irrespective of those whom we may offend or please, in the matter of raising money for the purpose of carrying on the war in a practical and statesman-like manner. </para>

                    <para>.- The note struck by the honorable member is the necessity for taxation, and particularly the necessity for increasing taxation on those who are making huge profits, and who, being fortunately placed in Australia, so many miles away from the terrible turmoil of war and bloodshed existing in Europe to-day, are able to make such large profits that one is staggered to think that members of Parliament will not continue to sit till they place on the statute-book an effective war-time profits tax. In this very year, with very few exceptions, numbering about four, I think, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> huge profits have been made. The history of the Broken Hill Proprietary is almost like the story of - the wonderful cave of Aladdin in the <inline font-style="italic">Arabian Nights.</inline> Up to the present time the Proprietary has paid &#163;10,400,000 in dividends. The contributing shares are paid up to 8s., and the price quoted has been &#163;3 10s. 3d., though later it was 74s. If we divide the 74s. by 8, it shows over 900 per cent, as the selling value of the shares. The wealth of the Proprietary has increased in a way that the mind fails to grasp. I always thank <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> L. Baillieu, who is reputed to be a millionaire making a second million, for being man enough to declare that the war-time profits tax does not touch men like himself. When men of wealth speak in that way to the people of Australia, the Government would do well to continue this Parliament in session until reasonable measures of taxation have been passed. We here are paid a very good minimum wage for our attendance, and members must be getting tired of being ruled by War Precautions Act Regulations. While, however, the newspapers may be muzzled, we are free to speak what we think within these walls. </para>

                <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> told us that the wealth census returns, so far as incomes are concerned, showed that two-elevenths, or two out of every eleven, who send in returns, receive more than half of the income of all Australia, leaving nine out of every eleven with less than half the income. This leaves out of account all those unfortunate enough not to have sufficient  income to require the sending in of returns. </para>

                        <para>- In the same wealth census returns, dealing with assets, it was shown that one out of every six persons who sent in returns owned five-sixths of the assets of Australia, while five-sixths of those who sent in returns only owned one-sixth of the assets. Let us see what was done in the matter of taxation in England in the time of the continental wars,&#39; at the close of the eighteenth century. The facts may stagger honorable members, but my authority is one that will bear reference to, namely, <inline font-style="italic">The Dictionary of Political, Economy,</inline> edited by Palgrave. On page 582 of that work dealing with the year 1798, we find the following: - </para>

                <para class="block">That was 500. per cent., and it will be seen that if, under the taxation law of the period, a man paid &#163;1,000 in the taxes, he was immediately taxed &#163;5,000 in addition. A very large proportion of our loans could be obtained in Australia to-day if we went as far as they did in England during the war times of the century before last. However, let us get down to the present day; and, in this connexion, I have again to thank that wonderful paper, the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> for its publication of the balance-sheets of the various companies. The name of the National Bank of Australia brings to mind <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Grice, the  chairman  of directors of that institution, who, at the last half-yearly meeting, was frank enough to say that a man of wealth who invests in our war loan receives equal to 7 per cent., while the man who invests his small savings receives only 4&#189; per cent. I have said&#34; before, but <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> will bear repeating, that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Grice did not make that statement to give Labour members a peg on which to hang arguments, but because he fears the <inline font-style="italic">debacle</inline> that will follow the end of the war. While the war continues we must go ahead full belt until we break the Prussian military autocracy, an end we all hope may be accomplished so that peace may quickly come. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Grice, I fear the <inline font-style="italic">debacle</inline> that will follow, for I was seared in the crash of the boom, and do not wish to <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> through the same experience again. I have no desire to see it necessary, as then, to have organized effort at the Trades Hall to provide over 300,000 meals and from 30,000 to 40,000 beds for those who were rendered destitute, and when it was necessary to prevent auctioneers selling  furniture under distress for rent. That is why I have such a dread of unemployment; and this calls to mind the fact that the Melbourne Municipal Council,  although there are epidemic fevers about, has sacked fifty men, who, with their families, represent some 250 human beings, now within a week or two of dire want. In the meantime, this, my native city, is left to become, not only one of the dustiest, but one of the dirtiest of cities, although the salaries of the higher-paid officials of the municipality have been 1 increased during the last twelve months. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, and it is a sin and a shame. Nothing destroys credit so quickly as unemployment. The small landlords and shopkeepers first feel the effects, and as soon as there is any disturbance of credit, the banks, as now, held aloof from making advances. They fear the withdrawal of so much money into loans, the interest of which is free from taxation, and which, therefore, offer a better investment for the money-spinners of the community, &#34;for which I. for one, do not blame them. In 1913, the National Bank paid a dividend of 7 per cent, on both ordinary and preference shares, and its reserves were &#163;451,208. In 1918, while still paying the same dividend, the reserves were &#163;718,303. That represents a profit of over a quarter of a million pounds made in war-time. Students of finance know that the financial condition of a country may be judged by the bank balances. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company is another institution the riches of which can be accounted for only by the use of Aladdin&#39;s lamp. In September, 1913, when the company had capitalized &#163;250,000 of its reserves, the remaining reserve was &#163;52,019, and the dividend was 12i per cent. In 1915 the company wrote up its assets to &#163;3,250,000, and that meant that it required almost the same amount to pay a <inline font-style="italic">6i</inline> per cent, dividend as it required previously to pay 12&#163; per cent. In other words, &#163;203,000 was required to pay the dividend of 12i per cent., and in 1916, after the assets had been written up to &#163;3,250,000, a dividend of <inline font-style="italic">Gi</inline> per cent, absorbed &#163;211,250. In March, 191S, when the company was still paying the same dividend - nominally less but actually the same as in 1913- the reserves had increased to &#163;430,879. The Fiji branch of the company reveals similar profits. In three years the disclosed profit of the two companies has been: Colonial Sugar Refining Company, &#163;829,155; do. (Fiji and New Zealand), &#163;1,007,178; total, &#163;1,836,333. </para>

                <para>The Bank of Australasia in April, 1913, paid a dividend of 17 per cent., and had a reserve of &#163;2,089,000. In April, 1917, the reserve totalled &#163;2,997,000, and in October of the same year &#163;3,028,000, and the bank was still paying a dividend of 17 per cent. There we have an increase of nearly a million pounds during wartime. The &#34;Western Australian Bank, which is perhaps unique inasmuch as its reserve fund is nearly four times as much as its paid-up capital, has been paying a dividend of 20 per cent, for many years; in other words, for every &#163;5 invested the shareholder receives &#163;1 per annum. </para>

                <para>In regard to the fixation of prices, we have been told that the Emperor Justinian tried the system, and it proved a failure. Times have changed since the days of Justinian. The printing press has done more to educate the people than has any other movement; it was unknown in those days. If one is to be guided by the experience of Justinian in the matter of price&#39; fixing, we might just as well follow him in the use of chariots instead of trains for travelling. I thank the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> for dealing with that argument in its issue of the 13th May - </para>

Clemenceau and the other law givers had not quite forgotten their schoolboy history, they would not have attempted to limit the profit, even if the consumer, like Job&#39;s behemoth, ate grass &#34;as an ox.&#34; . . . . It is as absurd to quote the individualistic fallacies of other days as it is to seek examples in the age of Justinian for a world whose modes of life, thought, and action have since undergone a series of revolutions. Prices are being fixed successfully, and, therefore, they can be fixed. In Australia the fixing thus far has been, for the benefit of the wholesale traders. In justice  to the retailer and the consumer the Government must see that it is just. </para>

                <para class="block">Is it just? Prices have been rising continuously. I ask the Government if any merchant or property bolder in those districts which the German brutes have torn from France, Belgium, Serbia, Albania, and Russia, would not thank his Creator morning, noon, and night if he could return to the position he was in before the war, having lost nothing but the profits that he might have made in time of peace. I have previously urged that we should not allow any profits to be made * in excess of those that were made before the outbreak of war. Any man who raises rents during war time - and there have been instances of terrible usury - are enemies in our midst. I have appealed to the Prime Minister from time to time to issue a War Precautions Regulation to prevent such exploitation. He would not do that, but he was mean enough to pass a moratorium regulation for his own personal benefit. </para>

                    <para>. - I have not yet heard where the money to pay the interest on this loan is to be obtained. I suppose I ought to accept the statement that it will be met, as all past loan obligations have been, from taxation. But I believe that we shall nob be able to do that, because the sum required will be too great. I shall be told, of course, that the usual methods will be resorted to, but, knowing that the working section of the community have always paid it while the wealthy section have taken the profits, I had hoped for a change. I can see, however, that no attempt is to be made by this Government to force the wealthy to pay their fair share of taxation. Let us see where we stand with regard to our war loans. The Treasurer has told us that already about &#163;145,000,000 has been raised by way of loan in Australia, and over &#163;4,000,000 by means of war savings certificates, while in Great Britain we have ..raised &#163;47,000,000, making a total of &#163;196,000,000. In addition to that we owe the British Government &#163;30,000,000 for the maintenance of our troops at the Front. The people are not aware that, so far as Australian troops are concerned, the war is being conducted on a different basis from that adopted with regard to the troops from other Dominions. We pay for every shot fired by our men, every tent used by them, and every particle&#39; of food they consume. Canada, on the other hand, is not doing so. Having enlisted and trained her men, she sends them to the Old Country, and thereafter they are maintained by the British Government. </para>

                        <para>- My constituents will not appreciate the honorable member&#39;s effort. In addition to the obligations to which I have already referred, we must not lose sight of the fact that the deferred pay due to our soldiers will exceed &#163;10,000,000. Who is to pay the interest on these huge war raisings ? Are the workers expected to do so? The Government and their satellites outside are taking good care that the workers of Australia shall be unable to pay. </para>

                        <para>- It was certainly a long time ago, and the people then gave him a bath. They admired his appearance, but not his politics. The Government and their supporters outside are taking good care, as I have said, that the workers shall not be able to pay any portion of the interest on these war loans and at the same time live in reasonable comfort. There is apparently a desire to lower wages as a means of paying interest on these loans. In proof of that statement I point out that the &#34;scab&#34; unions outside are trying to beat the legitimate unions. </para>

We have in our midst what are known as &#34; scab &#34; unions, which are fostered by the present Commonwealth Government and the State Government of Victoria, notwithstanding the recent promise that there should be no more victimization. The present conditions of labour in Australia were built up- by unionism. Trade organizations, built up by the Workers themselves, succeeded  in wresting from the employers better conditions. Last year, however, we had a strike, fostered and engineered by the Employers Federation, and our legitimate unions &#34; fell in.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The Employers Federation. As the result of the strike we have the unfortunate spectacle of one section of the workers, &#34;scabbing&#39;&#39; against the other. We have to-day two &#34; scab &#34; unions, one known as the Wheat and Flour Union and the other as the Australian Ship and Wharf Lumpers Association, which have been created to break up the genuine unions. We are. told by the Government that there will be no more victimization, yet no genuine trade unionist can obtain work on the wharfs or at any of the wheat stacks unless he joins a &#34;scab&#34; union. In the end, no doubt, when the. &#34; scab &#34; unions have wiped the genuine trade unions out of existence, wages will come down. The Government will expect the workers to pay their share of interest on our war loans, and yet they are engineering and encouraging a system which will reduce wages and make it impossible for the workers to do anything of the sort. I ask the Government to honour their promise to the unions of Australia that victimization would be abolished, and that every man would get his share of work. It is not palatable to have to state these facts, but it is necessary that they should be given. Having regard to the high cost of living, is it possible for the workers to pay anything like the taxation which will be necessary to meet interest and sinking fund charges in connexion with these loans and at the same time to live under anything like reasonable conditions? What will happen when wages come down as the result of the &#34;scab&#34; unions, fostered by the Government side of the House? If the Government will show any genuine desire to make the wealthy pay a reasonable share of taxation I shall be satisfied, but the position&#39; is that they have not attempted to extract from those who have made huge war-time profits anything like a fair share of those profits. It is estimated that a paltry &#163;500,000 will be collected annually by way of war-time  profits taxation, and the war profiteers do not even want to pay that amount. They are engineering to induce the Government to reduce the amount by one-half. How can we go on borrowing money with these facts staring us in the face? Taxation will be necessary to provide money to pay interest on the loans, and if the workers are to contribute their fair share, they must have employment. That being so, why does not this Government endeavour to force the Government of Victoria to keep the promises that were made on its behalf at the recent Conference summoned by the Governor-General? The Conference was called because of the difficulties of the present position, and because of the industrial turmoil that has taken place of late. It was an attempt to ease .the position created by the war and to help the finances of the country, the two things being so wrapped up together that they cannot be separated. &#34;We were given to understand that certain things were to be done. 2sTow, however, we find that unionists are not being allowed to work on the wharfs and on the wheat stacks in &#34;Victoria unless they, join the &#34; scab &#34; unions. Does not the Government intend to make the Victorian Government, which is responsible for this, keep its promise that this would not be allowed to continue? I understand that the Premiers of the other States are keeping their promises. About a fortnight ago the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> said that the Premier of Victoria was going to confer with the Minister of Agriculture regarding my complaint that men seeking employment on the wheat stacks were being compelled to join the &#34; non-union union,&#34; and that he had stated that his Government was anxious in all matters to work in accordance with the promises given at the recent Conference. Yet nothing has been done. On the Yarra bank those who select the men employed by the Yarra Stevedoring Company are penalizing the real unionists. If that is to continue, how will these men be able to contribute their share to the revenue? If Ministers are wise, they will see that the &#34; scab &#34; unions are not allowed to carry on in this way. The unionists were asked to drop their attacks on the employers, and they wish for the present to abide in peace and get on with their work. &#34;We have been told that it is always the fault of the unionists when trouble occurs, and now we have the spectacle of unionists being willing to work and being denied employment. The unionists can still put up a fight if they wish to do so, and can make it unpleasant for the Government.  Threats of what may be done under the War Precautions Act would not have much effect on them. It is for the Government, therefore, to see that the Government of Victoria endeavours to keep its promise. I wish to know if anything can be done to make the Government of Victoria insist that the unionists of Australia shall get their fair share of work. If that is not done, the sooner those who are recruiting come off, and we get back to the position in which we were before, the better. The Government will then see that they cannot do without those on this side as easily as they think they can. I am not making a threat; I am merely warning the Government that there are difficulties ahead. If they want to present a united front to the enemy, they must give consideration to this matter. If they do not, they are foolish, and later will suffer for their folly. I am not much concerned about their sufferings, but I am concerned about the sufferings of the wives  and  families of those who were asked to sink their difficulties on the promise that there should be no victimization, and yet are now penalized by the action of the &#34; scab &#34; unions,&#34; which are supported by the Government of Victoria. I ask the Commonwealth Government to see that the State Government puts an end to victimization. If it does not, I shall expect the Leader of the Labour party in this House, and other Labour men who are now assisting recruiting, to come off, and to tell them again what  Ave  have told them before  when  the Government  were  supporting the &#34; scab &#34; unions and  downing  the real unions. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> is to be complimented upon an amendment which is really a challenge to the Government and their supporters. One must be struck with the startling difference between the attitude of members opposite  towards  the question under discussion, the conscription of wealth, and their attitude towards the  conscription of men for active service at the Front. Had I been more sanguine concerning their patriotism, I should have expected  from them a glowing enthusiasm for the proposal to obtain money free of interest for war purposes. We have our recruiting committees, some of which are active, and some less active. I have received a letter from a committee in my electorate, insisting, for the second time, that I shall take my place on the platform, in order that my enthusiasm may inspire others with a desire to lay down their lives on the other side of the world. For one quite sufficient reason I have not taken any part in recruiting for men&#39;s lives, that reason being that I could not conceive any ground for others going to fight which would not apply to my own case, and as I was not prepared to go, I was not justified in urging others to do so. The reasons why I would not go are personal and private, but I should be willing, if it were relevant to the motion, and any one desired to hear them, to state them at length. But while I have not taken an active part in the recruiting of men, I suggest to those who have entered into that work with unbounded enthusiasm that it would not be unbecoming for them to join a movement for the recruiting of the means necessary to carry on this war, as those zealous patriots conceive that it should be carried on. </para>

                <para>It has been said that it is practically and economically impossible to raise money without interest. I do not know that an amount sufficient for the carrying on of the war could be raised in that way, but it is for us to ascertain, by proclamation, or other effective means, what is the measure of sacrifice of mere material things that men of substance are prepared to make to back up their enthusiastic interest in the war. It is useless to say that money cannot be obtained without interest. In this Commonwealth there are some rich men, and many of moderate means, and there is hardly one who could not lay something aside, and say, &#34; That money may be used in this war for a period of two or three years, and then be returned to me.&#34; The war loan advertisements tell the people that they are not asked to give their money; that they are asked merely to invest in a gilt-edged security. As one advertisement says, &#34;&#39;You are asked to exchange one kind of Government money for another kind of Government money.&#34; You are invited by these advertisements to take the view that, while some men are doing their duty by surrendering their lives on the other side of the world, you may do your duty by investing your money at attractive rates of interest. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> has pointed out that for the first six months the interest is at the rate of a little less than 11 per cent, per annum, and as the interest is exempt from income taxation, very rich men get the equivalent of a perpetual return of 6, and even 7, per cent, from their investments in the war loan. There are many men in the community who have money lying idle. I know prosperous business men who have considerable sums to their credit in current accounts. Then there are banking, institutions, insurance companies, including the mutual &#34;companies, financial institutions of various kinds, and many private individuals, who could lay 0 their hands on a substantial sum of money, and put it aside for two or three years, without reducing one of their activities, without dismissing one of their employees, or without reducing in any particular the production of the community as a whole. To do this would be a genuine sacrifice. It would not be a sacrifice comparable with that made by those who are asked to go across the seas and fight and die in this great war, but at least it would be some sacrifice, and we would not have this ghastly mockery of men declaring that duty may be done by an investment in the war loan. </para>
                <para>It is said that Australia has not found her soul in this great war. I do not quite know what that expression means, but I venture, to suggest that Australia will have found her soul to some extent when in the time of struggle, stress, and sacrifice, such as this is, she is prepared to cease the worship of Mammon, and embrace the duty of sacrifice, not a vicarious sacrifice, a sacrifice on the part of others, but a sacrifice on the pant of those who have material things to give. </para>
                <para>I commend the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton).</inline> I am glad that he has proposed this amendment, and I . am surprised beyond expression to find that, though member after member on this side of the chamber rises to speak to this amendment, it does not evoke a single word of serious comment, or comment of any kind, from members on the other side of the House. What can they expect when the next war loan is floated? They will be told, and rightly told, that they were not prepared even to make an inquiry - because that is what this amendment asks for - as to what funds are available, as to the extent of idle wealth, as to the extent to which we may relieve the burden posterity will have to bear in connexion with this huge war debt. They will not even take an amendment of this kind seriously. They sit apathetic, uninterested, and forgetful of the fact that the proposal now before them is&#39; an integral part of our whole war policy. It is a question of how to pay, how to keep the fight going, if they want to keep it going, or how to keep this country solvent in the future, if it is to be kept solvent. But they have not a word to say upon it. They can parade up and down the country almost frothing at the mouth when it is a question of seizing the bodies of their fellow men, and say, You must go; you must fight; you must die; the whole country is in danger. The&#39; honour of our womenkind is in danger. The land is threatened with devastation.&#34; Yet we find 4&#163; per cent, the minimum, and that 11 per cent, is to be paid for the first half-year, and 6 per cent, for the balance to the very wealth secured by means of these investments, lt is a hollow mockery, and I can assure honorable members that they may prate about enlistments and recruiting as much as they like, but if they ask me the real reason why there is less enthusiasm to-day about recruiting than there was when the war broke out, my answer is that it arises mainly, though not solely,, from the fact that those who are, as they say, ineligible for enlistment have failed to respond to a request for sacrifice any thing like parallel to the sacrifice made by those whom they are seeking to force to fight in this war. </para>

                    <para>. - When my time expired previously, I had not concluded the remarks I intended to make. I was speaking about the price of wheat, and showing how unjust the Government were in not treating the farmers fairly. In Canada, America, and Argentine the price of wheat is much higher than the price paid here, and the farmers believe that they are not being treated fairly. I have ascertained from an honorable member sitting on the other side of the House whose opinion on this question I prefer to that of any other honorable member, that a price of 4s. per bushel delivered at the railway station would pay the farmer well, but that the State railway systems charge freight according to the mileage. My suggestion is that the Acting Prime Minister should recommend the States to adopt the zone system, so that the freight charged on wheat should be the same, no matter how far removed from the seaport the farmer may be situated. The zone system is in use in other parts of the world. In Holland, one can buy a railway ticket from frontier to frontier. </para>

                <para>I thank the honorable member for Maribyrnong for moving his amendment. I shall vote for it because I am certain that if the Treasurer would make it widely known throughout Australia that the nation is asking her children, in her hour of need, to give their money free of interest, the wealthy men and women would gladly respond to the call. But they have to be asked. When that great general, Belisarius, was begging at the gates of Constantinople for daily food, one of his former officers stopped, and said to him, &#34;Why do you not ask.&#34; Throwing aside his rags, he said, &#34; Am I not asking with a thousand tongues from every rag that is hanging from me.&#34; People have to be asked. All the Red Cross and other button days recognise this fact. If our Government would only ask the patriotic people of Australia to lend their money free of interest, I feel sure that a large sum would be received. Certainly only &#163;1,120 has been lent on those terms. Two unions have lent &#163;100 each, six or seven citizens have lent &#163;10 each, and the largest sum lent in this way has been &#163;400; but something like &#163;60,000 has been handed to the nation as a gift. Every honour should be paid to those who have made this gift, if we could only know who they are. The amendment will allow those who love their country, who have the wherewithal and cannot possibly go away to fight on account of age, or for religious reasons, to give their money to  help the Government. I have always advocated that principle, in season and out of season, and, therefore, I shall have pleasure in voting for the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- My contribution is so small that I am ashamed of it. However, I hope that it will be more at the end of the year. We are not asking the Government to make any new departure or inaugurate a new Department. We are simply asking them to send out a request. We have had the example of the splendid gift of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox,</inline> by which the name of every person who voted for the Federation of Australia was inscribed, and every person who so voted could apply to the Government and be furnished with a splendid certificate bearing  on it the portraits of the Premiers of the various States at the time of the inauguration of Federation. In the same way, a certificate could be furnished to those people who lend their money to the nation free of interest. The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> has said that men have offered their lives. Upwards of 800,000 Australians have offered their services for fighting, and over 400,000 have been accepted. Over 50 per cent, of the men in Australia of the fighting age have offered their services. Will any one say that 50 per cent, of the rich men of Australia have offered all their money ? The suggestion made by the honorable member for Maribyrnong should receive attention. If the Government cannot accept the amendment, they can at least consider the suggestion, and, possibly, the Treasurer may be induced to issue an invitation to the patriotic people of Australia to lend their money free of interest. </para>

The Government had just decided to pay &#163;4,750,000in instalments, and we were informed that this was by arrangement with the banks. I asked what banks had agreed to provide the money, what was the nature of the correspondence and negotiations, and what was the agreement. How did the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer answer, or, I should say, side-step the questions I asked? He said on the 23rd May this year- </para>
                <para>Much of the information sought would take a considerable time to compile, and would have little bearing on the problem of wheat finance.

To show how much Treasurers usually bother themselves about understanding what is in the prepared statements, I may point to the present Treasurer, who read to us a typewritten document, which, on being examined by the newspapers outside, was found to show a discrepancy of &#163;19,000,000. We were told by the Treasurer that this was due to a mistake on the part of the typist; but if the Treasurer had known what he was reading he would have corrected that mistake before presenting the document to the House. I sometimes think that the officials put in these little errors merely to find out whether there is really anything in the Minister, who merely acts as a rubber stamp when he reads the prepared document. </para>

                <para class="block">Change one form of money for another form of money! The public are told, &#34; You have Government bank notes in your pocket, and we will give you in exchange for them other bank notes, called war bonds, and because you change one piece of Government money for another piece of Government money we shall pay you interest to the extent of nearly &#163;9,000,000 per annum. That interest shall be raised from or passed on to the great masses of the working people and shall be given to or received by the financiers of the country for exchanging one piece of Government paper for another piece of Government paper.&#34; </para>
                <para>That argument shows, as a matter of fact, that if these war loans were handled in a proper and intelligent way by the authorities who operate the public credit, the Commonwealth Bank could be placed in a position to provide the whole of the loans or credits on behalf of the Government without paying any interest to private individuals. A little over &#163;80,000,000 a year is required to be exchanged for war purposes. This could then be provided by the Commonwealth Bank by merely an extension of credit to the Commonwealth Government, and, instead of paying interest on this money, an income tax should be paid by the wealthy people, equal to, say, 2&#189; per cent. of the loan money, which would wipe out the debt in forty years. </para>
                <para>If &#163;80,000,000 is required each year, &#163;2,000,000 raised by a tax on incomes and paid into a sinking fund will liquidate the &#163;80,000,000 is raised, the wealth of the years. Every time a war loan for &#163;80,000,000 is raised, the wealth of the country ought to be taxed to provide a sinking fund that will liquidate the debt over a period of years or other number of years. We should be taking nothing from anybody; we should be simply operating the credit of the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>What is done to-day is that the Go- &#39; government go to the private banks and private financiers, and say, &#34; Each of you advance us this credit.&#34; The banks and financiers do not advance a single penny of money. They advance credits only. </para>
                <para>We are now told that these credits cannot be advanced except by persons who have tangible securities behind them. As a matter of fact, every form of security in this country is really owned by the Commonwealth itself. No man owns an acre of land, a bushel of wheat, or a bag of flour that does not belong in the last resort to the Commonwealth as a whole. Every bit of wealth is subject to any form of taxation. If the Commonwealth wished to go to that extent - I. do not say it ever would - it could confiscate every form of wealth from one end of the country to the other. </para>

                    <para>.- In this clause there is a fruitful source of discussion which might well engage our attention for some little time, although the hour is late. It opens up the question. &#34; What are the purposes for which this war is being waged, and for which it is proposed that we should raise the large sum mentioned in the previous clause?&#34; I propose, by way of dealing with one of the purposes of this war, to move an amendment and call attention to one of the war purposes which has been indicated by those gentlemen tourists, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the Minister for the Navy&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cook),</inline> who, affecting to represent, but really misrepresenting, Australia, recently set out on their way to London for the purpose, amongst other things, of declaring that Australia had made up her mind that she would hold until the last gasp the German colonies in the Pacific, which have been acquired by Australian endeavour. As this represents a very striking departure from what was originally stated to be the war aims of the Allies - as it represents a departure entirely inconsistent with the aims for which, I think, a just war may be waged, and is inconsistent also with the best interests of the Commonwealth - I am whole-heartedly opposed to what is stated to be one of Australia&#39;s war purposes, and I think the present a convenient time for registering my opposition. I therefore move - </para>

                <para class="block">The principal of the islands in the Pacific which it is now declared we must retain, and the retention of which, apparently, is to be a condition of peace, is a very extensive territory, and almost only a few degrees sub-tropical. That portion of New Guinea which, until recently, was possessed by the Germans, is merely equivalent in area to Victoria, the garden State of the Commonwealth, in which our Parliament meets. It was acquired by Germany in 1884, so that Germany has been in possession of it for thirty-four years. With German New Guinea, of course, we have the Caroline Islands, Samoa, and some less important territories taken from the enemy, and it is said that we must retain these territories until &#34; the last gasp.&#34; How curious it is that the Government should - and apparently those two tourists, the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy, speak for the Government - have come to the conclusion that Australia should be the only one of the independent self-governing Dominions, and the only country amongst the Allies, to make a declaration that annexation of territory must be a condition of peace. President Wilson has declared for &#34;No annexations; no indemnities.&#34; Russia has declared against indemnities. Lloyd George has declared that the question of the retention of the late German islands in the Pacific is a matter for the Peace Conference. </para>

                        <para>- This question is far more important than any consideration of time. In any event the Government might well have seen fit to adjourn, and to devote to-morrow to this important matter of land-grabbing as a condition of peace. I am totally opposed to these territories being saddled on Australia. Quite apart from the possibility that the claim for their retention might prolong this war, they would mean additional expense and danger for the Commonwealth, which is already unable to cope with the vast spaces which it is supposed to govern. If the safety of the Commonwealth depended upon the defence of its shore line by arms or by a fleet it is quite obvious that we should be unable to defend the tremendous coast line which Australia. already has. It has been said by an honorable member of another place that, in order to preserve the principle of a White Australia, we must not renounce our right to these islands in the Pacific. When we come to examine the population of German <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> Guinea we find that it consists of 500,000 blacks and? some inconsiderable number of hundreds of white men. It is by saddling ourselves with this vast new territory, so a  speaker  in another place has said, that we are to safeguard our White Australia policy. This is what I have described on a previous occasion as the new Imperialism. We are to be the first protagonists of new and extended territories. We are the first, and, indeed, the only, country amongst the Allies to claim our pound of flesh as the result of this war. I do not declare by any means that it would be necessarily desirable that the German people should retain possession of these islands in the Pacific. That is not necessary to my case. What I do protest against is that while this war is being waged at its very height, while the issue is still unhappily only too uncertain, while thousands of lives are being lost in the fearful contest, and while the genius of wise men is likely to be strained in determining the conditions under which the war may be brought to an end&#39;. Australia alone, and in advance, stipulates that she must have additional territory to that which she is unable to adequately occupy, use, or securely defend. An honorable senator has remarked that a resolution of the kind that he proposed in another place would have the effect of &#34;putting starch into the collar&#34; of the Imperial Government, since it would be a, declaration that we must not, under any conditions, surrender these islands. And it is because a declaration on the part of the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cook)</inline> and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> at the heart of the Empire is likely to have some effect, is likely to be listened to, and to be believed in, and that it will be believed that they do represent the people of Australia - while in truth and in fact there is no warranty for that assumption - it is because they may be believed, that their wanton declaration in that regard is peculiarly mischievous and should be heartily condemned. </para>

                <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> speaking at a suburban gathering somewhere or other recently, said that Germany - Germany alone - had been preparing for this war for forty years. Germany, as a great military Power, had been preparing, no doubt, for war. Prussian militarism had been developing both in and out of Prussia during that time. But it is a very curious thing that if Germany has been preparing for this war for forty years she should have &#39; safeguarded her interests in the Pacific in such a manner that although she has been in possession of certain of the Pacific Islands for thirty-four years she had only entrenched herself there to such an extent that when the war broke out we were able to send a single battleship and take possession almost without striking a blow. There was some little skirmishing, but it was hardly worth mentioning. Practically, there was no resistance at all, notwithstanding that it is alleged that Germany had been preparing for the war for forty years, and has even been accused of &#34; nesting &#34; her whole fleet in one of the rivers of German New Guinea. </para>

If you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> state that the Committee voted on the closure, and that then you put the amendment, and it was voted on, we must take your word. </para>

                        <para>- There was no vote on the amendment, so far as I know. The division was on the closure motion, after which the amendment had to be put. Of course, the Government has a sufficient majority to win every time, but the question is, Had the Committee an opportunity to vote on the. amendment of the honorable member for Batman ? I did not hear the amendment put from the Chair. It was on the &#34;gag&#34; question that I voted. </para>

I direct the attention of honorable members to the standing order I have quoted, and to the fact that they are bound by that standing order. A refusal to abide by their own Standing Orders is a reflection on themselves, and an affront to the House. I ask honorable members not to take up that attitude. Of course, honorable members will understand that if they decline to act as tellers for the &#34; Noes,&#34; there will be no division, and the question will be declared resolved in the affirmative.

                        <para>- My point of order is that there is no precedent for declaring that the mere fact of no tellers being appointed from this side entitles the  Speaker  to say that the question is carried in the affirmative. Nor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have you attempted to justify your position. The reason for that is probably that the proceedings were interrupted by the unseemly conduct of the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> who has been disorderly throughout the evening. I submit - and if you disagree with me, I shall move that your ruling be disagreed with - that you are not justified in contending that the absence of tellers from this side justifies you in declaring the question resolved in the affirmative. </para>

If there are no tellers willing to act on one side, there can be no division. I quote from <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> 11th Edition, page 361, or page 341 of the 10th Edition - </para>
