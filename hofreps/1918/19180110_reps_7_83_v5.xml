                <para>Governor-General, 9th January, 1918</para>
                <para>On the 8th of January the Prime Minister waited on the  Governor-General  and tendered to him his resignation.. In doing so <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> offered no ad.vice as to who should be asked to form  an Administration. </para>
                <para>The Governor-General considered that . it was his paramount duty (a) to make provision for carrying &#62;oh the business* of the country in accordance with&#62; the principles of parliamentary government, (&#38;) -to avoid a &#39;situation arising which must lead to a further appeal to the country within twelve months of an. election resulting in the return of tv.0Houses of .similar political complexion, &#39; which are still working in  unison.  The Governor-General was also of the opinion that ki .granting a &#39;Commission for the formation of a new Administration; his .choice must be determined solely by the parliamentary situation. Any other course would be a departure from constitutional practice, and an infringement of the rights of Parliament. In the absence of such parliamentary indications as are given by a defeat of the Govern.ment in Parliament,&#39; the Governor-General endeavoured to ascertain what the situation was by seeking information from representatives of all sections of the House with a view to determining  where the majority lay, and what prospects there were of forming an alternative Government. </para>
                <para>As a result of these interviews, in which the knowledge and views of all those he consulted were most freely and generously placed at his service, the Governor-General was of opinion that the majority of the National party was likely to retain its cohesion, and that therefore a Government having the promise of stability could only be formed from that section of the House. Investigations &#34;failed to elicit proof of sufficient strength in any other quarter. It also became clear to him that the leader in the National party, who had the best prospect of securing unity among his followers and of therefore being able to form a Government having, those elements of permanence so essential to the conduct of affairs during war, was the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes, whom the Governor-General therefore commissioned to form an Administration. </para>

This failure has necessitated, in many cases, the complete cessation of harvesting operations; in other cases, the duplication of orders necessitating the purchase of second-hand sacks, and the dumping of wheat on the earth. If the Prime Minister is aware of the fact, will he take steps to investigate the matter by an inquiry, and arrange for farmers&#39; representatives to be on the committee of investigation? </para>

                            <para>- I do not exactly grasp the question. The honorable member will understand that the principle of the Wheat Pool is that all the farmers pool their wheat, and share the profits and losses. For instance, if a farmer has 10,000 bags, and 1,000 of these are eaten by mice, it is the Pool, and not the farmer, that bears the loss. There is no other way of meeting the circumstances that I know of, because the Pool has the whole of the responsibility. </para>

                        <para>- I have already stated to the House that the intention of the Government is to ask for Supply. It is the chief prerogative of the Commons and the basic principle of government by the people that the popular Chamber has control over public expenditure. When Supply is asked for there is no limitation to the scope of debate; honorable members have ample opportunity to say all that they have to say. If they wish to challenge the position of the Government it is a very simple thing for them to challenge if on Supply. In a few moments honorable members will have ample opportunity to challenge the position of Ministers in a constitutional way by refusing Supply. </para>

                        <para>- I have not the papers before me, and I can only speak from memory. There was such an urgent demand for shipping by the Imperial authorities, that the late Government&#39;s matured opinion was that all other things must stand aside in order that that need might be satisfied as far as was humanly possible.. Accordingly, instructions were given to the Shipping Board to endeavour to comply with the request of the Imperial Government ; but I was not aware - as I thinkItold <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lefroy,</inline> the Premier of Western Australia - that steps had been taken to attach or commandeer thes.s. <inline font-style="italic">Kangaroo;</inline> nor was I aware, until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lefroy</inline> complained, that the Government of Western Australia had control or. ownership of that vessel. I informed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lefroy</inline> of my regret that anything had been done in respect of a Stateowned vessel without consulting the State Government, or without its approval; and to that position I still adhere. However, I shall make further inquiries, and if my statement to-day requires supplementing in any way, I shall supplement it. In the meantime I will see how far it is possible to meet the requirement of the State Government. </para>

                </para>
                <para>The decrease on the total receipts for the six months is &#163;427,479. &#39; This is made up of a decrease in Customs revenue of &#163;1,468,631, and increases in Post .Office revenue of &#163;109,152, and in other receipts of &#163;932,000. </para>
                <para>A very doubtful element in the finance of the Commonwealth at present is the Customs and Excise revenue, it being subject to so many influences of an abnormal kind. The receipts from that source in the first half of the current financial year </para>
                <para class="block">It will be noticed that whereas there was an increase of &#163;262,783 in the month of July - due, no doubt, to the loading up in anticipation of Tariff changes - the decreases in August and September were &#163;688,008 and &#163;710,811, respectively. In the month of October the decrease was &#163;225,893, while in November the falling off was only &#163;2,082; in December the decrease was &#163;104,620. Though the position of the Customs and Excise revenue thus appears to be unsatisfactory, an improvement is indicated in that the falling off latterly has been much less than before. </para>
                <para>In the Budget submitted on the 8th August, 1917, it was estimated that the Customs receipts for the current financial year would be &#163;1,976,441 less than those of the preceding financial year. Already the decrease amounts to &#163;1,468,631&#39;. The total estimated Customs and Excise revenue is &#163;13,630,000, so that the amount received for the half year is a little less than half of the estimate. In view of the unsettled state of shipping, it is difficult to foresee exactly what our Customs and Excise revenue in the future will be. but it seems possible that the estimate for the year will not be quite realized. </para>
                <para>The total revenue estimated to be received in 1917-18 was &#163;35,181,655; the revenue received for the half year ended 31st December is &#163;5,344,000 less than one half of the estimate. This disparity is explained by the fact that almost the whole of the revenue from direct taxation is received in the latter half of the year. </para>
                <para>The expenditure payable but of revenue for the current financial year was estimated on the 8th August last as &#163;37,283,832. One half of this estimate is &#163;18,641,916. The expenditure for the first six months of the year was &#163;15,788,600, which is &#163;2,853,316 less than one half of the estimate. It must be remembered, however, that the expenditure in the latter half of the year is much &#39; heavier than that in the earlier months, and the interest and sinking fund on war loans yet to be paid during the year will be much heavier than that paid in the previous half year. From present indications, it would appear that the expenditure for the full year will be within the estimate. </para>
                <para>The most notable increases in the expenditure are in connexion with pensions and interest and sinking fund on war loans. The increases in invalid and old-age pensions total &#163;317,118. Apart from  the additions to the number of pensioners, the increased expenditure is caused by the increase of the pension by 2s. 6d. per week, and the payment of 2s. to inmates of asylums, which operated only for three months in the half year ended 31st December, 1916. In addition, the provisions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act in regard to the calculation of income were liberalized by providing that allotments of naval and military pay, war pensions, and separation allowances were not to be calculated as part of the income of the applicant. </para>
                <para>The increase in war pensions is &#163;662,023. The reasons for this increase are, unfortunately, obvious. </para>
                <para>The interest falling due on war loans in Australia on 15th December, 1916, was not brought into the accounts in the Treasury until January of the following year. This amount was, approximately, &#163;1,200,000, so that the expenditure for . interest and sinking fund on war loans for the half year ended 31st December, 1916, was &#163;2,368,937, and the expenditure for the half year ended 31st December, 1917, was &#163;3,482,200, or an increase of &#163;1,113,263. </para>
                <para>The expenditure for additions, new works and buildings for the half year ended 31st December, 1917, was &#163;299,900; but, in addition, expenditure out of Loan Fund was made, totalling &#163;948,000, thus giving a total expenditure for the half year on these new works of &#163;1,247,900. These figures show a decrease of &#163;1,040,850 on the expenditure for the corresponding period of the previous year. </para>
                <para>The war loan expenditure for the half year ended 31st December, 1917, is &#163;27,326,000, as compared , with &#163;20,939,331 for the corresponding period of the previous year. The increase of &#163;6,387,669 in the current year is partly accounted for by a payment of &#163;3,500,000 to the Imperial Government for the upkeep of troops. No corresponding payment was made during the first half of the last financial year. In addition, &#163;1,940,686 has been advanced for the purchase of foodstuffs for the Imperial Government and the Government of India. The amount of these advances will, of course, be recovered. </para>

                <para class="block">The Commonwealth has still to raise &#163;2,340,000 to meet the requirements for 1917, and has agreed to advance this amount to the States in anticipation of the issue of a further loan. Some of the States have already been paid their proportions of this &#163;2,340,000, and the money is available for the other States on application. </para>
                <para>A portion of the amount of &#163;18,000,000 loaned to the States (except Queensland) out of the Notes Fund in 1914-15 has already matured, and the balance will mature during 1918. The States desire that the loans, totalling &#163;18,000,000, be renewed. The Commonwealth has proposed that the agreement of the 5th November, 1915, be further amended by reducing the &#163;2,700,000, the amount to be raised by the Commonwealth for the States in 1918. In the event of this proposal being agreed to, the Commonwealth will be in a position to give renewals to the States of their several portions of the &#163;18,000,000 until one year after the termination of the war. </para>
                <para>War Loans. On the 15th September last, subscriptions were invited to the fifth Commonwealth war loan - styled the &#34;Liberty Loan.&#34; The conditions of the issue were similar to those of the earlier war loans, except that the date of maturity was fixed as the 15th December, 1927, in lieu of the 15th December, 1925. The amount subscribed up to the closing date- 2nd November- was &#163;20,432,590. In addition, &#163;609,129 was invested in war savings certificates during the period for which the loan was open for subscription. The total amount subscribed for war purposes while the loan was open was thus &#163;21,041,719. </para>
                <para>To meet the wishes of many people who will be receiving payment for their wool and desire to invest in the war loan, it has been decided to accept further sub- . scriptions to the Liberty Loan during the continuance of the wool appraisements. </para>

                <para>As I stated previously, the Supply now asked for is for three- months, and covers the ordinary services of the Government and war services payable out of revenue. The total amount . of the schedule is &#163;3,449,972. Omitting refunds of revenue -&#163;100,000- the total is &#163;3,349,972. The amount thus asked for is considerably less than one-fourth of the total estimated expenditure under annual votes, viz., &#163;3,926,880. </para>

                <para>Three-fourths 1 of this amount is &#163;10,597,389, and as the total provision in Supply to 31st March, 1918, is &#163;10,263,358, it will he seen that the proposed expenditure for the nine months is less than three-fourths of the estimated expenditure. </para>

In connexion with increases to salaries, provision has only been made for such increases as fall due under Arbitration Court awards or are. automatic under the Public Service Act.

                    <para>.- The Government are taking up a most extraordinary attitude. Three months ago they brought forward a Bill providing for three months&#39; Supply, and three months prior to that they introduced a Bill covering a like period. I then said that some of their supporters would vote, without comment, any amount for which they asked,- being prepared to swallow anything that the Government chose to throw to them. </para>

The Prime Minister has told us that the Government intend to obtain three months&#39; Supply, and that we shall then adjourn over&#39; practically the whole of that period.

                <para>The Government are fooling the people, and, what is worse, they are fooling themselves. They seem to think that by. shelving the notice of motion of want of confidence which I gave this afternoon they will be able to stifle criticism. I deliberately said that I was prepared to move that motion &#39; at the earliest opportunity; and while I do not desire to delay the granting of Supply, I am prepared to proceed at -once with the notice of motion I have given. The Prime Minister, in his wisdom, however, has decided that that shall be placed at the  bottom,  I presume, of the notice-paper, so that we shall have no opportunity to discuss it. The right honorable member will recollect a similar action taken in this House. I refer to the occasion when the Cook Government were hanging on to office by one vote. They were clinging to office just as the present limpet-like  Adminis&#62;tration  are holding on. They would rather anything happen than that they should be compelled to leave the Treasury bench. The Cook Government, on the occasion to which I refer, ignored, just as the present Government are doing, a notice of motion of want of confidence . They also set at the bottom of the business paper a notice of motion disagreeing with a ruling of the then Speaker. In the same way, the Prime Minister will not give this House an opportunity to discuss the policy of the Government, nor the country a chance to learn the views of honorable members concerning his Cabinet.  Might  I &#39;remind him of the fate of the Cook Government? Need I remind him that when they went to the polls &#39; they were swept out of office? Although the Government are fooling themselves by thinking they are cunning and clever in thwarting discussion in this way, they will probably meet with a similar fate. </para>

                        <para>- That is not correct, but, even if it is, that is. no reason why a bad example should be followed. I repeat, however, that, the honorable member&#39;s statement is not correct. In ten or eleven of the fourteen pre-war years of this Parliament we prorogued always in or before December. That being so, the Budget proposals and the Estimates must have been dealt with in the first half of each financial year. The only exceptions to that practice occurred during the first session of the first Parliament, when owing to the Tariff debates we sat for twenty months, and, again, in one of the sessions of the second Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                <para>The extraordinary attitude assumed by the Government in regard to the want-of-confidence motion is really in accordance with a line of conduct suggested by the Minister for Trade and Customs. The honorable gentleman, speaking at Burnie during the recent referendum campaign, is reported to have said, when referring to the numerous &#34; comparatively unknown persons &#34; who addressed meetings, that &#34;If he had his way he would prevent them from speaking against the referendum proposals.&#34; &#34;He would not allow &#39;adverse criticism of the Government.&#34; Apparently he has succeeded in bringing round to his way of thinking the whole of his colleagues, for the Government seem to be prepared to use the Standing Orders to prevent criticism of their actions in Parliament, and to avail themselves of the War Precautions Act to prevent criticism of them outside. The Postmaster-General, who says he has been sitting up writing letters morning after morning until 3 o&#39;clock, is reported to have said of the conscription proposals, &#34; If these proposals are turned down this Government will not remain in office twenty-four hours.&#34; I would remind him that three weeks ago or more the people of Australia turned down the proposals, and that they were turned down also by his own constituents. </para>

As a matter of fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made the statements in question before the- conscription referendum was thought of - before the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine)</inline> compelled  the Government to take the  referendum.  1 do not intend to&#39; place myself in the position of thanking honorable members opposite for any courtesy. . Compelled as I am to have this discussion on Supply, I am confined to half an hour, but I shall avail myself of all the forms of the House in order to place my views before the country. Had it been possible, I should have notified the Prime Minister that it was my intention to submit a motion of want of confidence. As honorable members know, I have never contemplated .moving the adjournment of the House, or taking any similar step, without notifying the -Government of my intention, and certainly on an occasion such as this I should have let the Leader of the Government know what I intended, to do. Had I been permitted to discuss these matters on the motion of which I have given notice, I should have been allowed either one hour and five minutes or one hour and thirty -five minutes; but as things are I find it utterly impossible to deal with my material in the time at my disposal. We find supporters of the Government quite prepared to quietly see their leader ignore the notice of motion I have given. As I said before, I do not look for, nor intend to accept, any courtesy from the Government; I desire nothing but fair play, and I shall take all the advantage to which I am entitled under the Standing Orders. I am, as I say, allowed only one half-hour, and that is most unfair- </para>

The Government, after having used the censorship and the War Precautions Act regulations in this way outside the House, are now prepared, &#39; inside the House, to use the Standing Orders and their majority to prevent discussion on any motion that may be moved against them. When I gave notice of motion to-day, the Prime Minister said, in effect, No, I shall not accept it; you can debate the matter on Supply.&#34; Does the Prime Minister think that such a move as that will help him to get supply? </para>

Practically the whole of the leading newspapers in Australia were howling at the opponents of conscription, and preventing their appeals from reaching the, country. The Government and the supporters of conscription had everything in their favour, and yet they were beaten.

Had any such publication been issued by the other side, there would, undoubtedly, have been a prosecution; indeed, on the anti-conscriptionist side no man dare open his mouth, whereas those in favour of the affirmative vote could say what they liked. There was no regard for the truth at all in what the newspapers published throughout the Commonwealth in favour of conscription; and still the other side won. It is a great tribute to the Democracy of Australia that it should win this fight in spite of press, purse, and pulpit, or, at any rate, a great part of the pulpit.

                <para>In spite of the defeat of the referendum, the Government hang on to office, and we find honorable members like the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> supporting them like lambs. Amongst those honorable members we have the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fowler),</inline> who professed to be opposed to the Government, and used harsh and hard words concerning them. Yet that honorable member and others are prepared to keep the present Government in office, although the Prime Minister ignores my notice of motion and will not allow a discussion on that motion itself. Former members of the Labour party, who are now behind the Government, will remember the treatment meted out to the Opposition by the present. Minister for the Navy, when he was Prime Minister, and also by the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir John Forrest),</inline> and the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Groom).</inline> Amongst those who raised much howling about that treatment was the present Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Webster),</inline> who protested against the iniquity of the present  Speaker  in placing a motion of want of confidence at the bottom of the business paper. Yet that gentleman is a member of the present Government, although he talked of resigning in twenty-four hours if there should be a majority against conscription. Of course, the Prime Minister will tell him that the Government have resigned. Does the right honorable gentleman think that such a contention will fool anybody outside? The Government may fool themselves, but they will not fool the people. We can all remember how <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Deakin, when member for Ballarat, and one of the Opposition, described the present Prime Minister, in 1904, as being pulled howling out of the &#34;tart shop&#34;; and it would appear that the right honorable gentleman retains his fondness for the pastrycook establishment. I am anxious that there should be a full and free discussion of the motion of which I have given notice. </para>

                        <para>- Of course; and I shall have as fair a &#34; go &#34; as the Standing Orders will permit. I know that it is quite within the power of the Government to move and carry the motion that I be no longer heard. Well, why does the Government not move such a motion? The Prime Minister desires to have Supply, &#39; and to shut up Parliament. Honorable members opposite are afraid of criticism; but I am anxious to hear, on a question like this, the opinions of honorable members who have been so loud on the platform outside. The honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine),</inline> we know, made certain statements at Wagga; and we should have an opportunity of seeing how honorable members opposite, who profess to represent the people, stand in regard to the pledges they made in the country. They declared that if the referendum went against them, they would not hang on for twenty-four hours. Well, let them resign - but do not let us have a counterfeit resignation. They must not try to fool the people outside. Let them resign, and submit themselves to the people. Let the eight Ministers resign their seats, and we  on this side will see whether we cannot find amongst us eight who are also willing to resign and submit themselves to the people on the question that was decided on the 20th December. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member should not ask us to get rid of the Postmaster-General, when it was found impossible to do so upstairs. I have had considerable experience of newspaper reports of private meetings, and I know that these reports are more or less accurate. From my knowledge of the honorable member for Henty, I believe that he would be as free and outspoken at &#39;that meeting, indeed, more outspoken, in his criticism than in this chamber.  His  vote might be right at the party meeting, but I have my doubts about it down here. </para>

                        <para>- He will not do so. We are blocked by the action of the Prime Minister in ignoring my notice of motion. It has been done before. It was done while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> was leading the party on this side of the House, when the present Prime Minister was his lieutenant; but the action of the Government on that occasion in blocking a motion of no confidence did them no good outside, as I am sure the present action of the Prime Minister will do him no good. He cannot raise the excuse that he is taking this step in order to get Supply. Had he said to honorable members on this side, &#34;You know that we have to get Supply by tomorrow in order to pay the civil servants and soldiers&#39; pensions, and the various public services &#34; ; and if he had asked for Supply for a month, so that we could come down next week and be given a fair opportunity to debate the motion of no confidence, no one on this side would have objected. The majority of honorable members on the Government side must realize that it would have been at least a fair attitude on the part of the Government. </para>

We can agree to any reasonable compromise that will enable the honorable member and every one else to state his views at the fullest length permitted by the Standing Orders on a discussion of a motion of censure. It can be done in ten minutes from now, and I will not stop it. All I ask is that honorable members should realize the position. Ministers, however, are prepared to consider any possible settlement of the position; and, in order that both parties may give the situation consideration, I suggest that the  Chairman  should leave the chair, and resume it at the usual time after the. tea adjournment. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not agree with the contention of the Leader of the Opposition that he and his party would not have ample opportunity of discussing on Supply the matters set forth in the motion of which he gave notice to-day.&#39; The only limitation on such discussion would be that imposed by the Standing Orders upon the duration of speeches, and that limitation I am. willing to remove by a vote of the House, so that honorable members opposite may have ample time to state their case. I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he agree to one of two alternative courses: either that the Standing Orders be suspended so that the matters mentioned in his motion may be discussed at full length - subject only to the understanding that every honorable member will restrict his remarks to the time he would be entitled to occupy upon a motion of no confidence - or, alternatively, that we should immediately dispose of Supply, and then proceed with the direct motion of no confidence. The Government have carefully reconsidered the matter, and have again arrived at the opinion that we must have three months&#39; Supply; but if the honorable member prefers another course to the first alternative I have mentioned, we are willing, when Supply is granted, to give the Opposition every opportunity immediately for a fair debate on the motion of no confidence, and that debate can be carried on into next week. </para>

                <para class="block">Either of those two courses is open to the honorable gentleman, and perhaps he will be good enough to indicate to the Committee which one he proposes to adopt. Either course will afford the honorable member and his supporters an opportunity to say whatever they please. I concede that the honorable member has a perfect right to put his case freely and fully before the public, and I am bound to say that when I rose in Committee this afternoon I was not aware that in introducing a censure amendment on a motion for Supply the honorable member would be limited to a speech of half-an-hour. I have no desire to restrict him in any way, and I offer him the option of either of the alternative courses I have mentioned. </para>

                    <para>.I have had a consultation with the Prime Minister and other Ministers, and I have since consulted my own party, and it is our opinion that it would be farcical for an Opposition to grant three months&#39;. Supply and at the same time be launching a motion of no confidence against the Government. Whilst I agree that the removal of the time limit on. speeches in Supply would afford us opportunity enough to discuss a censure motion, I would remind the Committee that if we are to pass Supply in order to pay the Public Service to-morrow the Supply Bill must necessarily be disposed of to-night, and honorable members will not have an opportunity in Supply of recording a direct vote upon the motion of no confidence. The Government are not acting fairly in asking us to grant three months&#39; Supply before launching our motion of censure. Of course, it is entirely for the Government and the party supporting them to decide what treatment shall be meted out to the minority in the House; but it is well within the constitutional rights of Parliament for an Opposition to move a no-confidence motion, and that motion can be placed in whatever position on the notice-paper the Government choose. Usually it is taken as the first business. If the Opposition agree to grant Supply for one month in order that the services may be carried on they will be acting very fairly. If the Government will not accept that offer we as an Opposition cannot make any further concession. I offer the Government Supply for one month, and then the no-confidence motion can be dealt with. To ask for three months&#39; Supply whilst the no-confidence motion is hanging over the Government&#39;s head is a proposition which is not fair to honorable members on this side. </para>

                    <para>.- We desire to give members of the Opposition every opportunity of discussing the motion of censure; but as a Government and a party with a preponderance of members in this House, we cannot admit the right of the minority to dictate as to how much Supply we shall have. Such a decision is the right of the majority. Supply for two months would carry us only as far as Easter. Honorable members must&#39; recollect that Supply is already a fortnight in arrears, therefore a grant of supply for one month would only make provision for a fortnight ahead. The honorable member for Yarra offers to grant a month&#39;s Supply, to then deal with  the no-confidence motion, and when that is disposed of, to grant a further two months&#39; Supply. I ask him what is the difference in essence between that offer and the proposition I have put forward? </para>

                        <para>- I offer more than that; I am willing to allow the debate on the no-confidence motion to continue day and night. But members of the Opposition desire, not to state a case against the Government, but to pose as persons suffering a grievance. I offer a greater opportunity for debate than has ever before been offered to members in the position of the present Opposition. When I sat in opposition alongside the honorable  member for Yarra, we never got the show that I am now offering, and when he and I sat together as Ministers, the Government of which we were members never gave its opponents such a show. I am willing to allow the whole of next week for the. debate on the no-confidence motion; from Monday morning until midnight on Saturday. Honorable members may sit all day and every day next week. </para>

                    <para>.- I am willing that the Government shall have Supply for one month without debate, provided that to-morrow the no-confidence motion be permitted to come on. How long the discussion of that motion shall last is a matter within the determination of the Government, which has a majority* and can closure the debate at any time. The no-confidence motion having been disposed of, Ministers can say what business shall be taken. Apart from the referendum and the things that were done in connexion with it, honorable members may desire to criticise the conduct of various Departments. I have heard dissatisfaction expressed regarding the administration of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, the Defence Department, and other Departments. We have a right to criticise the administration of Departments generally. </para>

                        <para>.- When the Prime Minister was addressing himself to the House a few minutes ago he was proceeding to tell us with great fixity of expression and determination, and a kind of vindictive&#39; delight, what would happen when Parliament met again about Easter time. . He was interrupted, and evidently changed his mind as to the statement he was about to make. </para>

                    <para>Is it the intention of the Government when we re-assemble at that time to submit a Bill providing for conscription? The Prime Minister may laugh, but a mere guffaw does not dispose of the question. I desire an answer.  I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether it is the intention of the Government then to bring in such a Bill; and, if so, whether on its introduction they intend to dissolve Parliament and have a general election on it? Will the Prime Minister answer? </para>

After that strike the Federal Government created a Coal Board, which allocated the work on the water frontage in this area. Old members of the Coal Lumpers Union, which is now nonexistent, have been debarred, under that arrangement, from obtaining employment. I understand that the Coal Board has issued instructions to the Contractors that they are not to employ any ex-members of the Coal Lumpers Union. In consequence of this instruction 800 men, women, and children at Miller&#39;s Point are practically starving. They have been obliged to seek for bread at the benevolent asylums. While that is so, the Government are employing over 400 volunteer workers - young men without families. </para>

                            <para>- This sort of thing is a standing disgrace to the Commonwealth. Many of the men who have received notice to quit have been living in the same area for thirty and forty years. They have worked all their lives on the water front, and are not in a position to leave it to seek employment in the country. During the late strike, volunteers were brought down from country districts to work on the wharfs. They have no fixed place of abode ; they are young men, and many of them are without dependants; but they are being kept in employment. In this way an effort is being made to starve out old residents on the water front - the coal-lumpers and others who have been forced to. seek relief. Now we have the threat that they are to be turned into the streets in order that the houses occupied by&#34; them may be handed over to the volunteer labourers. This action is being taken by the Government of New South Wales. Surely the Commonwealth Government should step in at this juncture and instruct the Coal Board to. give employment to those to whom the employment on the wharfs legitimately belongs, and to send the so-called volunteers either upcountry again, or where an attempt is being made to force the coal-lumpers to go? Over 300 sons of these very coal-lumpers have enlisted, and are at the Front. Over 600 sons of water-frontage workers living at Miller&#39;s Point alone are at the Front. Is not this action of which I complain likely to prove of service to the Germans ? Would not this notice to quit prove excellent propaganda for the Germans to use in the trenches? &#34; Evictions in Australia! &#34; Imagine such a notice as this being thrown by the Germans into our trenches&#39;. If it were, it would soon end the war, so far as our boys were concerned. It is a disgrace to the administration of the Federal Government that such a thing should take place. </para>

                            <para>- The Harbor Trust resumed this particular area some fifteen years ago, and has held it since then. Another area affected is under the control of the Rocks Resumption Board, which&#39; is under the direction of the State Treasurer. At one time, it was supposed to be a slum area, but it has been rebuilt. It was the intention of the Harbor Trust that only those who worked on the water front should be allowed to occupy these houses, and that is the excuse offered for these threatened evictions. It is said that there is no work on the water front for the men now living in these houses. They cannot obtain work owing to the action of certain people, and they are to be turned out of their houses, so that the volunteer workers may occupy them. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, they have lived there for many years I myself lived in the district for practically thirty-seven years, and there are some who have resided &#39; there for forty and fifty years. These are the people who are to be turned out. In one case, a woman with eight children, whose husband has gone upcountry to seek employment, has received notice to quit. A few days ago I saw a soldier assisting his married sister to shift her furniture from a house in the area. He told me he was going to the Front; that his sister&#39;s husband was up-country, and that he did not want to see her turned out of her home. He was, therefore, placing her in another house, and intended, while away at the Front, to pay for her keep. He will be going to the Front with a very sad heart, in view of the treatment meted out to his sister. This sort of thing should not be tolerated in Australia. Evictions on such a wholesale scale are a reflection on the Commonwealth. If they were attempted . by a private landlord, action would, no doubt, be taken ; and since a State Government is responsible for them, the Commonwealth should intervene. The War Precautions Act seems to be sufficiently elastic to enable the Commonwealth Government to do anything they please, and it is nearly time that they got into communication with the New South Wales Government and prevented these evictions. If work were found for these men, they would soon be able to pay off the arrears of rent which have been accumulating owing to their want of employment. I hope that the &#34;new&#34; Commonwealth Government will at once take up this matter, and deal with it as it should be dealt with. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to say a word or two on this matter, seeing that my name has been brought directly into it, and I have been pointed to by honorable members as in some way responsible. I have in my hand here the notice which the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wallace)</inline> has read, or, rather, indicated without reading. What the honorable member did not tell us was that the notice relates to some action of the State Government, and has nothing whatever to do with any action of the Federal Government. </para>

It is true that, owing to the late unfortunate strike, there are many hundreds of men out of employment - the employment is not there for them at the present time. I am -speaking now only of my own operations ; I have nothing to do with what the State Government is doing. I have done something already in the direction of f aci- 1J tating the employment of these men, who are so unfortunately placed owing to their recent unwise action. There is no intention or desire on the part of the Commonwealth Government to victimize anybody. I have but one feeling in the matter, and that is to heal up the Old breaches. </para>

Why should a man be subject to such imputations from honorable members opposite in relation to a matter which has no party or political bearing ? These unfortunate men are out of work, and I will do anything I can to help them. I again promise that I shall have the fullest possible inquiry made, in order to ascertain exactly what is the relation of the Commonwealth Government to the coal-lumping industry. My own impression is that we have nothing whatever to do with it. </para>

                            <para>- If that be so, the inquiry will be a sham and a farce; it will not be an inquiry into the grievances of the men, but a side-stepping of the issue. The Coal Board controls the whole of the coal output, and nobody can get one ounce of coal without its permission. I have it on the authority of the union officials that when some of the men were successful in obtaining work from stevedores, the Coal Board .intimated that if their employment was persisted in the stevedores would get no more coal. The result was that the stevedores had to discharge the members of the union, though many of them expressed regret at having to take this step. However, they had no choice in the matter, inasmuch as otherwise they  would not get any further coal. </para>

                            <para>- All I have to say to the Minister is that the least said about that episode the1 better it will be for the reputation of Captain Glossop; but I do not wish to be dragged away from the actual question about which I rose to say a word or two. I urge the .Minister to give the matter consideration, and when he is inquiring into it, to remember that&#39; it is the Coal Board that controls the whole of the output of coal, and in the final analysis is responsible for this thing occurring.- I want Ministers, who pride themselves upon being a win-the&#39;-war Government - it seems to me that they are better at  winning Ministerial office - to remember that there are hundreds of the sons of these fathers and mothers who are fighting in the trenches to-day. As the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wallace)</inline> has said, it would be a very poor advertisement for Australia if the Germans could shove up a placard in their trench bearing the words, &#34; Australians, while you are fighting here your fathers and mothers in Australia are being evicted.&#34; </para>

                        <para>. - I would like to ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence if his attention has been called to various reports in the press that agents representing landlords have given evidence in the Courts on oath that many women will not pay their rent because they are soldiers&#39; wives. I wish him to see whether steps cannot be taken by his Department, or, if necessary, whether they cannot be taken under the War Precautions Act, to compel every agent who makes such a statement to give the names and addresses of the. women who, he says, will not pay rent because they are soldiers&#39; wives. I do not believe those statements. There are good and bad among all classes, but it is an infamy that our law Courts should be used for the purpose of slandering the wives and relatives of men who are fighting at the Front, not only for us, but for the very landlords whose houses are occupied. It is only justice to our soldiers that these agents should be compelled to give names and addresses so that inquiries may be made by the Department into the truth or falsity of their statements. In one Court I instructed a gentleman to ask the question, but the agent would not give any names. Many returned soldiers have spoken to me on this matter, saying that the statements of these agents are a slur on their brothers at the Front. </para>

                    <para>I wish to, put a question to the Prime Minister in all good temper. With the exception of the Canadian election, Australian soldiers have been the only soldiers empowered to vote in any election for their country. The soldiers of no other participant in the war have had that honour or that power. Now, as an Australian, I ask the Prime Minister whether he will have the ballot-papers that are Australian property, having been voted on by Australian soldiers, returned to Australia ? If they are sent out here and recounted, and the numbers tally with what were given out last year and this year, I will be content to accept them;  but if the papers are destroyed in England, or wherever they are placed, the Prime Minister will agree with me that the outside public will have very serious differences of opinion on the matter. I merely ask, as an Australian, that the resting place for Australian ballot-papers should be in Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to speak on a matter which was referred to &#39;this afternoon in a question submitted by the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers),</inline> namely, the supply of cornsacks. If the Government  have shown incapacity, it is in regard to the question of arranging for the supply of cornsacks to the farmers of Australia. Long months have passed, and the Win-the-war Government have endeavoured vainly to get sufficient bags in order to supply Australian farmers, but evidently through the manipulation of those who deal in these articles the Government, wittingly or unwittingly, has become merely the creature of circumstances. As a result, serious loss has been occasioned, not only to our farmers, but also to the people of Australia, because every bushel of wheat which is wasted through incompetency  or incapacity  to deal with the wheat is a national loss. In answer to a question submitted on the 26th July of last year by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Livingston),</inline> the Prime Minister said that he was making all arrangements for the supply of cornsacks for the Australian farmers. The matter was not allowed to drop, because questions were submitted subsequently by the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers),</inline> by the honorable member for Barker, by myself, and by other honorable members; but, notwithstanding that the matter was continually kept under the notice of. the Prime Minister and the Win-the-war Government, to-day wheat is spread out on dunnage all through the Darling electorate and the wheat-growing areas of Australia, and a great deal of it will be wasted. It is a costly process to tip wheat out on to dunnage and the different receptacles where it is stored and rebag it. I have always approved of a Government dealing with these matters, but had the Win-the-war Government not decided to take action to supply cornsacks to the farmers, our wheat-growers would have got sufficient cornsacks themselves. However, the Government decided that in the interests of the primary producers of Australia they would get the cornsacks, and not less than six months ago they started to get them. They have not procured them. </para>
