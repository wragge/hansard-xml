I was at Beaufort- on the previous evening, and on my return next morning did not enter the room in which this thing was said to have been done. The Minister for Recruiting met me, and was with me until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline> came in, when I spoke to him about some matter having nothing to do with the locker. Subsequently he went into the adjoining room, where the locker was. . I had not gone into that room in the meantime, and therefore could not have done what was alleged. I did not know then of the finalization of the matter. </para>

The <inline font-style="italic">Boonah</inline> on her arrival in Australia had nearly 400 cases of influenza on board. The quarantine authorities at once took the matter in hand, and the infected patients were landed at the quarantine station at Fremantle, and effective measures were taken to clean the ship. Next day there were eight cases; the following day five cases; then two ; and then one ; and we anticipate that there will not be any patients today, that having been our experience with every other ship with which we have dealt. The returning Western Australian soldiers- will be landed at the quarantine station to-morrow morning, to complete their period of detention there. The </para>

                        will probably leave Fremantle on Saturday, which is the earliest day on  which  we can return to her the members of the crew who have been  sick,  and who by that tune  will  be  well - all  but one or two  who  must be left behind  at  Fremantle. She  will then  proceed to the Eastern States, and the troops on board will complete their period of detention during this voyage. Presumably &#39;the vessel  will  be a clean ship  when she  arrives here, and the  men will  then be released. I do not know what more the quarantine . authorities could do for  the  benefit of those on board.

                        <para>- The reason is that if -we allow the price of bran to rise it will affect the price of flour, and, consequently, the price of bread; the prices of all these commodities are contingent on one another. &#34;We must either altogether abandon the policy of price-fixing or adhere to it. The Government do not feel that it can remove the price-fixing of bread at the present time; and, consequently, the price of bran will remain fixed. If the Government were to allow the policy of price-fixing to be lifted so far as bran is concerned, bran, of course, would become very dear, and it is doubtful whether the farmers would be able to get any more than at present. They are obtaining all that is produced, and <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> more would be forthcoming as a result of the removal of price-fixing. The only result would be a probable doubling of the price. </para>

                            <para>- There was a somewhat serious disturbance at Port Darwin on Wednesday last. A crowd of 400 ot 500 assembled opposite Government House, chiefly men from Vestey Brothers&#39; works, and passed a resolution requesting the Administrator to address them, and give an account of his administration for the last five years. The resolution also asked the Administrator whether he would be able to go south by a boat leaving that day, pending an inquiry by a Commission into his acts of administration? The resolution was presented to the Administrator, who declined to do what he was asked. The crowd continued outside, and after about an hour, the Administrator, from within the fence, explained his position under the Government, and said that he was acting in accordance with the ordinances passed for the Territory, and pointed out, perfectly correctly, that every request or representation made, and intended to reach the Minister, had been sent south. The Administrator declined to accede to the suggestion made to him - made under impulse, of course. He had been assured by the leaders of the crowd that, if he addressed the meeting, no violence would be used. They gave him an absolute guarantee of safety; but, after about twenty minutes, as he was proceeding to his house, there was a cry of &#34; over the fence.&#34; There was an alien element right in front of the crowd, and it was at the instance of some of the leaders that the cry was raised1. Some of the crowd jumped, over, knocked the Administrator down, and proceeded to attack him, and some of his staff. </para>

                            <para>- No; there is a turbulent element in Darwin, intensified by the presence of a great number of aliens, but all I can tell honorable members about the aliens is that they are men from out side the British Empire. Every step  should be taken by the Government for the purpose of preventing a repetition of such a disturbance, and maintaining order, by applying the ordinary rules of the administration. As regards the censorship, I cannot speak with any specific knowledge, but it is possible some telegrams may have been censored. </para>

                            <para>- I have been anxious to make a statement for the information of wheat-growers and of honorable members who are representatives of wheat-growers, on two phases of the wheat question - the payment of guarantee for the new crop, and the problem of sale, with which I dealt before. I am not yet- in a position to deal further with the latter phase, but I hope to be able to do so before we rise. 1 am able to make this statement concerning the payment of wheat guarantees for the 1918-19 crop. Recently I discussed this question with the representatives&#39; of the Australian Wheat Board who waited upon me. It was suggested, on behalf of the Board, that it would be desirable, in view of the short wheat crop in many parts of Australia, if the Government could arrange. the finances to pay the whole of the guarantee in one payment as early as practicable in the new year. On behalf of the Government I promised to consider the suggestion and confer with the banks, who assist in the conduct of such operations. There has been- difficulty, involving some delay, in the arrangement of this matter, and I have not yet received final answers from the principal banks. After carefully reviewing the present circumstances and the outlook for the new year, I have decided to pay the whole of the guarantee and will take all necessary steps in that direction in the new year. </para>

                        <para>- The Crown Law Department co-operates with the Defence Department in matters of this kind. I do not know how far this matter has proceeded, but the wish of the Government with respect to the interned men whose case was the subject of a recent inquiry, is that, with one exception which I have referred to, their early or immediate release should be given. The Minister for Defence has also, with the concurrence of the Cabinet, arranged for the release of several other internees, mostly men who are Australian born. That procedure is going on, and I expect that to-day, or some time this week, a list of another dozen or so of cases that have been carefully reviewed will be published by the Minister for, immediate release. It is the desire of the Government, as soon as it is safe and wise, after careful examination of these special cases, that the release of these men should take place. </para>

                        <para>- It is almost impossible to answer the question very definitely. I have endeavoured to ascertain from the Prime Minister when he considers - it is only a matter for conjecture - that &#34; his work will finish in connexion with the peace deliberations, but so far I have not been able to get any definite reply. I. cabled again this week. The last calculation the right honorable gentleman gave <inline font-style="italic">me,</inline> about the middle of November, was that he expected the work would be  finished in from two to two and a half months. I can assure the honorable member that his colleagues are anxious for him to come back, for we have had a pretty hard time of late. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable colleague <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> who has been good enough to assist in the office of the Prime Minister, and also to take charge of the Department of the Navy has absolute freedom in his control of the Department of the Navy within the terms of the Act. As to the Shipping Board, his operations are not limited by any relationship which he has to the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. As <inline font-style="italic">locum tenens</inline> for the Minister for the Navy he exercises the full functions of that Minister. There is a wider suggestion opened up by the honorable member&#39;s question - as to how far the Naval Board should have control as compared with the paramount Minister. Those who have been studying politics for some little time recognise that public feeling and parliamentary feeling are oscillating at the present time with regard&#39; to the question of direct parliamentary responsibility. There is just now a very shrewd and subtle endeavour to remove repatriation from parliamentary and Ministerial control. I do not say that it is widespread in Parliament, or among the general community outside, but an endeavour is being made to erect a . belief which the &#39;promotors hope to make fashionable that the work of repatriation would be better carried out if entirely free from parliamentary control. I am old enough to disagree with that view. No matter how Parliament criticises its Ministers, its activities, or its organisms, I believe that it is with the Parliament itself that responsibility should rest. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member may desire a different form of statute, but I am discussing the principle involved rather than the particular ordinance under which the Department should be controlled. I hold hard to the doctrine of responsible Government with respect to all our great activities, since, under it, the people&#39;s representatives may exercise  a direct influence, and award punishment, if necessary, upon Ministers or Ministries who do not carry out the work of the community as it should be dealt with. Such a system is far better than that of indirect control. </para>

                        <para>- In view of the limited time that we have had during the consideration of the Estimates to place our grievances before Ministers, I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he will take upon himself the unpalatable task of reading the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the debate, and see that consideration is given to the criticisms in which tha Opposition indulged during the recent all-night sitting ? During that sitting, many grievances were ventilated which Ministers, who were not always able to be present, ought to consider, and, as far as possible, remove. </para>

                        <para>-The honorable member&#39;s question covers every offence committed by a member of the Australian Imperial Force at any period of his service, and whether punished by court martial or by his Commanding Officer. The work involved in compiling this return would, therefore, be enormous, and it is not considered that the cost of compiling it, and the employment of the necessary clerical labour are warranted in order to make the information available. Furthermore, the Minister is of the opinion that it would be manifestly unjust to place on record the name of every man who has committed an offence, together with the statement of the offence and the punishment awarded, and to make this information public. The men who have committed offences have been punished, and have, therefore, expiated them, and it is thought no further publicity should be given to their cases. </para>

                            <para>The Government did not make such a promise. It intimated early in October that advice had been received from the Prime Minister that the War Office had agreed to divide space equally between leather and hides. This was not officially confirmed until the end of October. 3 and 4. I am not aware of the actual position in Geelong or of other tanneries, but I do know this, that the correspondence in connexion with this matter will show that this Government has done everything possible to assist the industry. The representations to the Imperial Government direct, and through the Prime Minister were of a most persistent character, and it was only as a result of those efforts that the promise was made to allot space for leather. The Government will continue to do everything in its power to assist all the industries of Australia. I may add, however, that space on vessels leaving Australia at present is allotted strictly in accordance with the instructions received from the Imperial Government under whose control vessels are still running. </para>

The following is the. reply:- 1. (a) Up to 31st October, 1918, the Commonwealth Government, through the Repatriation authorities, made advances - each not exceeding &#163;75 (as authorized by the Australian Soldiers&#39; Repatriation Fund Act 1916)- totalling &#163;43,856, to assist 517 grantees in the. purchase of homes through the instrumentality of the various State Banks. </para>

The Board is of opinion that its first consideration should be for the wheat-grower, and not for the ship-owner or merchant; and it has . been, and is  &#39;Still,  endeavouring to arrange freight direct, and deal direct with Egypt,  so  that after payment of a reasonable freight&#39; the wheat-grower may get the full &#39;proceeds. This policy does mot appeal to  ship-owners  or merchants. The position was laid fully before the Australian Wheat Board at its conference this week, and it was agreed, with the concurrence of the wheat-grower&#39;s representative, . that the proper course had been followed in declining to . give . a quotation. </para>
                        <para>The first inquiry made of the -Board . indicated a rate of freight . of &#163;25 ; per ton from Fremantle to Egypt.

In -this . case, the tribute . proposed to be levied on the -wheat-grower -was &#163;21 -per  ton, equivalent to 7s. 9d. per bushel of wheat. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that we take up this matter at. the stage that was reached yesterday, when the Acting Prime Minister desired to withdraw the motion. We are to be allowed three-and-a-half hours from this moment, on the Estimates. There are two or three Departments that would certainly require more time than that for anything like a discussion on them. &#39; I consider the most important to be the Defence Department, where many matters require, discussion; the Repatriation Department; and the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, There is also the question of the administration of the Northern Territory in the Department of Home and Territories. The statement made by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> this morning, in . reply to the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> is most alarming. I had not the remotest idea that anything of that sort was going on. It is news to us that the Administrator up there practically stands within his own fence, and the men, so to speak, go &#34; over the top &#34; and, according to the Minister&#39;s statement, deal with him and some of hi? staff with physical force. I am opposed to the guillotine, but if it is to be applied, while I would like to have something to say in regard to old-age pensions and other matters, I shall . be obliged to let them pass on this occasion in order to devote the time at my disposal to matters which I deem of more importance. They are insignificant matters in comparison with certain aspects of our defence and postal- administration, and also in comparison with the position of affairs in the Northern Territory, and with that other matter, &#39;the Commonwealth Police, referred to by the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd).</inline> Honorable members should certainly be given the opportunity to come to a decision upon the question of the necessity for the continuance of the Commonwealth Police. </para>

                    <para>.- I am anxious to get an opportunity to move that the Commonwealth Police be disbanded, but I can see that there will be little chance of doing so, because the few hours that the Treasurer proposes, to allow for the discussion of the Estimates will be occupied in debating the votes proposed for the first two or three departments which appear in the Estimates. </para>

                    <para>. - I contradict most flatly the statement that the time taken up yesterday morning was wasted. Never before, since I have been in Parliament, has so much information . been given to honorable members as was given by Ministers at that particular time. During the whole of the session I have been submitting questions with reference to shipping and sniping arrangements, and I have failed to elicit from Ministers the information that I desired to obtain, but that which Ministers furnished yesterday morning quite freely and openly will remove many of the doubts expressed in my electorate. I resent very strongly&#39; the idea that yesterday morning was wasted. </para>

                        <para>- One of the Ministers said that the guillotine was about to be applied because time had been wasted. It is only when dealing with the Estimates that we can obtain from Ministers the information we are desirous of eliciting from them. I have made some notes in regard to the sugar question which it has taken me three weeks to prepare. This question means success or failure to thousands of small fruit-growers in Victoria and Tasmania who have been encouraged by their State Governments to take up the industry of fruit growing, and have put everything they have in the world into their orchards. Owing to the arrangement made in connexion with sugar, they can see nothing ahead of them but financial loss and the wiping out&#39; of years of industry. It will be impossible for me to put before the House the history of this matter, which I have compiled from the very inception of the arrangement. One of my reasons for protesting against dealing with the Estimates in the&#39; manner proposed is the fact that honorable members are prevented from bringing before the House and the Government matters which vitally affect thousands of people in the, community who are deserving of every consideration, and have had a very bad time during the last two years. This is one reason why I shall vote against the limitation of debate upon the -Estimates. It would be better for the Government to take Supply now, and call the House together early in the new year so that the Estimates may be thoroughly considered. No honorable member surrenders more time to his parliamentary duties than do those representatives of Tasmania and Queensland, and Western Australian constituencies, who live in Victoria during the whole of a parliamentary session, yet I would rather come back early in the yea-, to deal with these matters than allow them to be passed without the consideration they deserve. </para>

                        <electorate>Melbourne Ports} [12.7]. - I believe in the principle that the majority must rule, and I voted for the adoption of the motion for the limitation of speeches. I would do so again if I thought&#39; that debates in this chamber were unnecessarily prolonged; nevertheless the  Government must admit that, during the discussion of the Estimates, honorable members place before them many matters of considerable importance. Private members as well as Ministers have their troubles. Whether an honorable member is sitting on the Government side, or on the Opposition side, he is often condemned for something the Government have done on the ground that he has taken no step to prevent it. The public outside seem to think that we can make the Yarra flow up hill. Ministers know from past experience that private members do not bring matters forward for the sake of fun. They frequently do, it because they are . exhorted from outside to do so.  The people demand it. The only opportunity for dealing with any matter exhaustively is when the Estimates are being discussed. Rightly or wrongly, I have interested myself in the question of the administration&#34; of the Northern Territory. To-day there is a crisis at Darwin, which I warned the Minister some time ago would take place, and which I would like to deal with to-day, because men in the Northern Territory have</electorate>

Nobody will pretend that a debate during an all-night sitting can do anything like justice to the Estimates. Yet we are now told that they must be passed, practically without consideration, notwithstanding that they involve questions of the highest importance. There is, for example, the maternity bonus, which involves a very large annual expenditure, which most certainly ought to be revised. In many other directions -there are important items upon these Estimates which require to he made the subject of revision and reduction. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not like the operation of the guillotine as proposed by the Government.Nobody can accuse me of having occupied much time in the consideration of the Estimates, but I did intend to make some observations upon particular Departments. I, therefore, deliberately refrained from debating the general question, in order that I might be able to devote my attention to specific items. But apparently the whole of the time which is to be allocated to the consideration of the Estimates is now to be absorbed in a discussion of the first division of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. If this sort of conduct is to be pursued, I shall, in future, avail myself of my full rights in connexion with the general debate of the Budget statement. Of course, I realize the difficult position in which the Acting Prime Minister has been placed. I recognise that the interposition of extraneous matter has prevented him setting apart for the consideration of the Estimates the time that would otherwise have been devoted to them. I should like to know whether he will consent to guillotine the Estimates in sections. The adoption of that course, objectionable though it is, would at least afford us an opportunity of discussing some matters of urgent public importance. </para>

                    <para>.- There is one question which I regard as urgent from . the stand-point of the consumers, namely, the unjustifiable increases that&#39; have been sanctioned by the Government in respect of butler - increases which represent practically &#163;2,000,000 a year.  I  specially came over from Sydney to deal with this matter, but owing to the action of the Government, the entire discussion of the Estimates will take place upon the first one or two items. The remaining items will be &#34;gagged&#34; through the House. Earlier in the session the Acting Prime Minister assured us that we should be given full opportunity to exhaustively discuss these Estimates. . That pledge, however, is not to be fulfilled: The Estimates contain approximately 2,000 items, and their exhaustive consideration within a total period of two days is an utter impossibility. Of course, I recognise the great advantages which will be derived by the Government from &#34; bullocking &#34; these Estimates through the House. The adoption of that course will obviate the necessity for Ministers obtaining Supply for six months. It will mean that they will be able to go into recess, and to administer the affairs of this country under the War Precautions Act. </para>

                        <para>- I do not remember the honorable member&#39;s statement, but apparently, although he realizes the evils of the situation, he is unwilling to take steps to prevent them. He is like a good many more on the opposite side of the chamber. He is prepared tb do all. sorts of things until it&#39; comes to a question of voting,  and then he desires to back-pedal out of his difficulty. I do not believe that the Government will meet the House early next year. Certainly,. I do not expect Parliament to be . called together before May, and probably not before June, of that year. </para>

                    <para>. - The fact seems to have just occurred to the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts)</inline> that when the Estimates are passed parliamentary control over the Government practically ceases. Yet honorable members opposite have professed a desire that the Estimates should be passed early in the financial year. To me, the discussion of the Estimates is the most interesting in Parliament. A month ago I thought that the whole future of the country depended on our being able to discuss the Estimates, but when we get the chance to de that, half of the honorable members of this Chamber go home, and some only attend because the price of butter has been raised. The rest of the Estimates do not trouble them very much. </para>

                        <para>- And they would be thoroughly discussed if we were permitted to proceed with the Bills relating to those questions, instead of having a long discussion on the Bolsheviks in Russia, and upon the important question of whether &#163;6,000 could be saved by sacking a number of policemen and throwing them upon the employment market. If there are big questions to be discussed on the Estimates, I should like to hear something of them, but, after having sat for about twenty hours listening  to the discussion, I heard only one subject that seemed of importance. That was the issue raised by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> and even that was found, on inquiry, to have no justification. All this talk to the effect that the country will get great value if we are allowed to discuss the Estimates for a fortnight is only pretence. I should be glad if the Acting Prime Minister would adopt the House of Commons&#39; system, by which a certain amount of time is allotted for each section of the Estimates. In my judgment, Supply Bills are a much better system of controlling the finances than the passing of the Estimates <inline font-style="italic">in globo.</inline> I am further of opinion that the whole machinery of Parliament needs overhauling in order to reduce the enormous weight that is being placed on parliamentary and governmental institutions at the present time. </para>

When we reflect that this Parliament, which was expected to be conducted on a contribution of 2s. 6d. per head of the population, is now doing work that was never contemplated by the founders of the Constitution, and that every day sees increased duties placed upon us, we have to realize that the machinery of Parliament need&#39;s a careful overhaul in order that the enormous amount of our business may be conducted with greater efficiency. That we should . spend two or three months in discussing Estimates, not one item of which will be altered, does not appeal to me as a commonsense proposition. </para>

Every honorable member desires to say something about a number of items in the Estimates, in which we are individually and collectively interested. In addition to the matters already mentioned there is the Northern Territory Administration. The condition of affairs disclosed by the Minister this morning, and by our own knowledge and experience of events in the Territory in recent times, indicates that a decidedly searching debate on that Department alone is necessary. We are inundated with complaints in regard to the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, but the result of the guillotine motion may be that the whole of the remaining time will be devoted to the Treasurer&#39;s Estimates, while, the other Departments will be railroaded through in a few moments. Even the Government must admit that that will not be fair to members or to the country. The Defence Department, and to some extent the Department of the Navy, are subjects, not so much for captious criticism, as for honest investigation and inquiry, </para>

                        <para>- I do not think the Minister is fair in saying that a promise of the Leader of the Opposition cannot be relied on. I believe the Opposition would unanimously acquiesce in a Supply Bill for two months, if necessary. Then honorable members could return and do their work honestly and well, early in the new year. It will be an admission of incompetence, and almost a dereliction of duty, if we allow the Estimates to go through to-day in the method suggested by the Acting Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>- The worst I have known in regard to the passage of the Estimates is where there have been long debates on the first item, and then, as the discussion has worn out, remaining items have been simply pushed through in a lump. There was never any limitation of the time of debate, however. The Government should consider honorable members from the different States. Let us carry out the arrangements agreed upon. Already, quite a number of members have departed for their distant homes on the distinct understanding that the sittings were to close this afternoon. It is still possible for the Government to keep faith with honorable members who have gone away, as well as with those who must leave to-day or to-morrow- </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to make my position clear. I will use every opportunity which may fairly present itself to prevent the Government from going into recess until May or June next. I would be quite prepared to assist the Government in securing two or three months&#39; Supply, without debate. It is idle for the Government to suggest that Parliament should work right through the holidays. Honorable members would not consent to maintain a House. But. there are many things which urgently require consideration, owing to these extraordinary times. The honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond)</inline> reflected upon members by saying that there needs to be an overhaul in regard to our parliamentary methods; but I agree wilh him. If. the Government, in presenting important Bills, would consent to their being referred to Committees, so that evidence might be taken upon the subjects involved, those measures would pass in a manner . much more satisfactory to the people and the industries concerned than under the system which has ruled during the past three or four years. The present position is unique. We have been working under war conditions for the past four years. Now, the war is over, and  out  warriors are returning, we must urgently and fully consider repatriation proposals. I have great faith in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and his work ; but is any honorable member satisfied with the present situation concerning repatriation, and with the proposals for dealing with our men upon their homecoming? I do not know the nature of the new suggestions of the Government, other than in regard to the housing proposition. But it would be far wiser, in the interests of the country and of our soldiers, if Parliament were to adjourn until about the middle of March. The Leader of the Opposition might be asked to acquiesce in granting three months&#39; Supply. Then, in March next, Parliament could deal with the serious problems of repatriation. </para>

                    <para>.- Unlike the honorable member for Corio (Mr:. Lister), who does not desire to detain the House, I do intend, if I may, to take up a little time. When a motion -that the Estimates be considered urgent business is  carried1, it is competent for any member of the Ministry,, during any sitting^, to specify the&#39; time that may be allotted&#39; to&#39; each Department, or to the whole of: the. Estimates.. The- Acting. Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has moved&#39; that, the time allowed- shall be until 4i3.0p.m.  . to-day,, and it, is now nearly 1 o&#39;clock. Is there- any special reason why only to-day is to be allowed for the consideration of the Estimates-?&#39; There is nothing- in the Standing Orders to say that, we&#39; may not deal with the Estimates to-morrow. In&#34; my opinion,, if it were decided that the discussion of. the Estimates should cease at 4.30 p.m.. on the 14th January next, it would be too short a time, in which to discuss our vast expenditures&#39;. </para>

                <para>The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has acquired the habit lately- of handing himself large bouquets3 carna tons at one- time, and roses at another. He has told us that he is the only Treasurer who ever seriously considered economy, that -he has&#39; reduced the Estimates- by so many millions, and that he has; this year introduced&#39; the Estimates many months earlier than has any former* Treasurer. The Estimates may have been introd-nced1 earlier than usual, but we had no opportunity top discuss them until two.- days ago. The honorable- gentleman, with all the wickedness- isa. temperament and constitution indicated&#39; by that strong jaw o&#60;&#163; his, speaks of &#34;breaking the back&#34;&#34; of the discussion on the Estimates by keeping honorable members up all night&#34;. Why &#34; break&#34; the back &#34; of the discussion ? Are we, sent here for that purpose? Some inept chatterers in a certain place talk of discussing repatriation and- demobilization during the small hours of the morning. Is that a time to discuss public business, when burglars are setting about their work and. all respectable people ought to be in bed? With one accord, the supporters of , the Government have complained that we on- this- side did not avail ourselves- of &#39;the opportunity of the Budget debate to discuss repatriation and demobilization. But there are many other subjects we might discuss; and now all the time afforded us is two hours and a half this afternoon. We desire to put the microscope - or, perhaps it would be more correct to say, the acid - on the Estimates of the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise).</inline> Personally, I wish to discuss the meanness of the Department in taking away the overcoats of the soldiers. </para>

                        <para>.- There are three items in the Estimates relating to the Treasury on which I desire some information from the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt).</inline> On page 39 there is an item of ?535 in respect of an Assistant Commissioner for Invalid and Old Age Pensions. That appears to be a new office. I notice also that on page 41 provision is made for 172 officers in the Old Age Pensions Branch, as against 133 employed in 1917-18. I presume that increase of staff is due chiefly to the increase in the number of war pensions now payable; but I should like to have the matter cleared up. On page 52 there is an item relating to the entertainments tax tickets. The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> has raised a question as to whether or no the Department supplies, free of charge - apart from the payment of the tax itself - rolls of tickets to conductors of entertainments. If it does, such a practice must make considerable inroads into the revenue obtained from the tax. Honorable members know that I am opposed to the tax; but I do not think we should reduce in this way the revenue obtainable from it. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Coming to the provision made for the Government Printer, we find that ?4,500 is set apart for wages and overtime of compositors, and the same amount in respect of proportion of salaries of the State classified staff of the Government Printing Office, Melbourne&#39; The total amount appropriated in respect of the Government Printer in 1917-18 was &#163;12,822, and the actual expenditure was &#163;12,839. A Department that can . keep  its expenditure within &#163;17 of the amount actually appropriated is a marvellously accurate one. Having regard to the uncertainty that must prevail as to the overtime which the Government Printing Office will be required to work in connexion with the sittings of Parliament, remarkable skill must have been displayed in framing the Estimate of Expediture for 1917-18. It is quite possible, as has been alleged at different times, that since our work is carried out in the State Printing Office we have to pay for what the State does not. We could, not have a better man for the position of Government Printer than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Albert</inline> Mullett, who was a personal friend of mine long before he thought of holding that office, or I thought of being returned to this Parliament. I urged the Government some years ago to establish a Federal Government Printing Office, and to place him in charge of it. I am convinced that if my suggestion had been adopted large savings in our printing bill would have been effected. I hope the Treasurer will be able to give me some information on these points. </para>

                        <para>.- It will be- remembered that yesterday the Acting Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> when replying to my contention that we did not require an intelligence officer it a salary of &#163;504 per annum, said that such an officer was employed while I was Treasurer. I denied that statement at the time in a rather blunt way, and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> called me to order. I have since examined the Estimates, and if honorable members do so they will find that no money&#39; was appropriated for such a purpose when I was at the Treasury. The item appears for the first time in the Estimates for 1917-18. </para>

                        <para>.- In connexion with the Treasury Estimates I have been considering how far we might properly go in bringing about an amalgamation of various Commonwealth and </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">State Departments and activities. I find that there are quite a number of State and Federal Departments which could be amalgamated and carried on either by the State or the Commonwealth, and, personally, I think they should be conducted by the Commonwealth Government. In the first place, the Commonwealth Electoral Department costs &#163;53,700 per annum, while the Electoral Departments of the States cost &#163;86,275. It will be generally conceded that these Departments could be amalgamated and controlled by the Commonwealth Government with advantage to the States and the Union as a whole. Such an amalgamation has already been carried out. so far as the Commonwealth and Tasmanian Governments are concerned, and a&#34; considerable amount has been refunded by the State Government for work done by the Commonwealth. . A general amalgamation of the kind would lead to great saving. In passing, I may say that I am not here to indulge in destructive criticism; my desire is to put forward some constructive criticism that will tend to the  benefit of the country. The Commonwealth Statistician&#39;s Department costs &#163;15,013, while the State Statisticians&#39; Departments cost &#163;32,117. Much of the information given in the State <inline font-style="italic">YearBooks</inline> is supplied in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Year-booh.</inline></para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly a big saving could be effected in that direction. Another item in respect of which amalgamation would be attended with satisfactory results is that of immigration. There is nothing on -the Estimates in respect of that item, although in former years we have incurred expenditure in connexion with it; but the expenditure of the States amounts to &#163;38,602. There is no reason why we should not have a Commonwealth Immigration Department in London, where information might be obtained on application as to the opportunities offering for settlement in all the States. If an intending immigrant desired to settle in New South Wales, he could go to such an office and secure the fullest information. The one central office would be far better than the present system, under which each State has its own agency, the one competing with the other, and all largely covering the same ground. The State Agents-General cost &#163;40,307, while the High Commissioner&#39;s Office costs&#34; &#163;48,841. There is no reason why the High Commissioner should not act on behalf of all the States. The cost of our State Governors and the up-keep of their Departments is &#163;42,489 per annum, and the. maintenance of the Governor-General&#39;s Department costs &#163;26,875. The Chief Justices of the several States, as Lieutenant-Governors, could do all that is now required of the State Governors, and we could continue to have a Governor-General for the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>Coming to the question of taxation, it seems to me that even the Choctaw Indians would adopt a method more rational than that pursued by the Commonwealth and States. Here we have seven distinct Departments engaged in the collection of taxation, a work which could be most effectively carried out by one Commonwealth Department. So far as I have been able to ascertain, &#163;128,705 per annum is spent by the States on their Taxation Departments, while the Commonwealth Department costs &#163;273,067 per annum. An enormous saving could be effected by the amalgamation of the State and Federal Taxation offices. The Commonwealth is expending &#163;417,496 per annum, and the States are expending &#163;368,495 per annum in respect, of these several instrumentalities qf government, making a total of &#163;785,991. I am confident that by a judicious amalgamation of these State and Federal Departments at least &#163;250,000 per annum could be saved. In my opinion, a commission of clever accountants could effect a saving of at least &#163;250,000 on- these figures. The uppermost thought in the- minds of the taxpayers generally is that we should do something in this direction. At least, we ought to co-ordinate taxation work. I spoke of this matter recently to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoi-</inline> man, Premier of New South Wales, when travelling with him in a railway train, and he said that I was right in the contention that I have just advanced, and that something should be done in this direction. I venture to say that every&#39; legislator in Australia would agree that something should be done to bring about this reform. I know that our Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> is as anxious as any one to bring it about. In fact, he has put the necessary legislation through this Parliament, but it has not been favorably accepted by State Houses, or has not yet been submitted to them for consideration. I hope our Treasurer will submit the matter to a referendum at the next general* election. I do not think there would be half-a-dozen votes in opposition to a proposal to have one taxing Department for the Commonwealth. It is a scandal that we should have seven taxing Departments working in antagonism to one another, and causing great dissatisfaction to the taxpayers. Notwithstanding the view that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> expressed to me personally* I heard him subsequently make a statement at a public meeting that the Commonwealth Treasurer&#39;s proposal was impracticable, because, while the Commonwealth collected the income tax upon the distribution of earnings to the various units in the Commonwealth, State Governments collected their tax upon those earnings at their source, and confusion would result if, when taxpayers sent their returns in, one office had the task of dealing with those two. methods of collecting the tax.  It seems to me that there should be- no confusion. It should be an easy matter for the Commissioner of Taxation to discriminate, and say, &#34; This man pays a tax under the Commonwealth system. Very well; we shall tax him upon the distribution of a dividend. The other man is paying State taxation under the State method. Very well, we shall tax the source of his dividends.&#39;&#34; . </para>

                            <para>- The present system of taxation is a great annoyance to ,the taxpayers. Many uneducated &#39;people who do not keep accounts are obliged to forward returns to the Taxation Department, although they may not be liable to pay the tax. Many farmers are obliged to pay fees to agents to prepare the necessary forms for them. Many of them pay a great deal more to have their forms made out than they pay in actual taxation. I was recently speaking to an ex-member of this Parliament, who has interests in every State, and is obliged to send in every year seven different income tax returns. It is necessary for him to pay a man &#163;400 a year simply to look after that one section of his various undertakings. There are so many Taxation Acts in the different States, and there are so many amending Bills passed each year, that it is almost impossible for a man who draws an income in each State to know where he stands. I am sure it would be of great advantage to the people generally if they were called upon to furnish one taxation return only. </para>

                    <para>I was very pleased to hear the Treasurer, during the course of his Budget speech, refer to the consolidation of State and Commonwealth debts. This is a matter we shall need to look into in the near future. A big saving can be effected if the Treasurer&#39;s proposals are carried into effect. State loans to be renewed during the next ten years amount to &#163;200,000,000. The Commonwealth will be called upon to renew loans in the same period to the extent of &#163;190,000,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins,</inline> Secretary to the Treasury, has informed me that local governing bodies in the Commonwealth borrow &#163;5,000,000 annually. Their borrowings for the next ten years will thus amount to &#163;50.000.000. In all, loans amounting to &#163;440,000,000 will have to be renewed in Australia during the next ten years. If we can make a saving of 1 per cent, in interest on all these renewals we shall effect a total saving of &#163;4,400,000 per annum. Another saving may be effected in the matter of flotation charges. In London we pay 25s. per &#163;100 for underwriting, 5s. for brokerage, 5s. for bank commission, 12s. 6d. for composition duty, and 5s. for advertising. The total charges amount to &#163;2 12s. 6d. per &#163;100. It seems to me extraordinary that we should be obliged to pay 25s. per &#163;100 for underwriting when we have the Commonwealth Bank and the High Commissioner in London. Of course, I under stand that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Nivison controls underwriting matters in London. </para>

                        <para>. - The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> and the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> have asked for information in regard to several matters. The first is in relation to the position &#39;of the Assistant Commissioner of Invalid and Old-age Pensions. The Commissioner of Invalid and Old-age Pensions is the Secretary to the Treasury. He was drawing no remuneration for his administration of pensions, but, in consequence of the great stress of war work imposed upon Treasury officers, it was plain to me that the two senior officers should be freed to a great extent from routine work in order that the questions of taxation, loan raising, and spending should receive more deliberate attention, which the rush of work upon those officers had made impossible. I therefore assented to the proposition that a &#39;man to take charge of this work as Assistant Commissioner, and do all the routine work under the direction of and responsible to the Commissioner, should be appointed. The officer selected at that time was in the Queensland office of the Department, and, speaking from memory, he has been promoted from the second class . to the first class in order to give him status to do thework. </para>

                            <para>- I believe he is. As to the increase of officers and salaries in the Old-Age Pensions Office, the steady expansion of the work is accountable for that. The number of pension eases dealt with in 1915-16 was 115,000 ; in 1916-17, 120,000 ; in 1917-18, 125,000 ; and up to the 3rd November, in the current financial year, 126,000. That increased business accounts for certain additions to the staff, whilst the statutory increments to which officers become entitled year by year explains, to some extent, the greater amount provided on the Estimates for salaries. </para>

                    <para>As to the entertainments tax tickets, the Taxation Branch informs me that the Attorney-General&#39;s Department ruled that it was necessary to supply showmen with tickets, and that we could not charge promoters of entertainments with the cost. </para>
                    <para>Reference was made by the Leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> to the fact that the amount provided on the Estimates for the Government Printing Office is exactly the same as the amount expended last year; I am entirely responsible for that. In the chopping of the Estimates there were requests from the Government Printer for increases, but I told the Department that its expenditure must be kept down to last year&#39;s amount. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Treasurer has to do arbitrary things of that kind, and an instruction was issued to the Departments that they must live in the current year within the amount they received last year. I knew that in the case of the Government Printing Office that would be difficult, because the cost of paper is very much higher than it was, and increased expenses have to be met in other, directions also. </para>

                            <para>- Many Departments are in that position. The Government Printing Office can only conjecture what its requirements will be. The number of papers that this Parliament orders to be printed, and the quantity of printing which the Departments may feel compelled to order, will condition the expenditure of the office, but the Treasury must keep a repressing hand upon that expenditure. If a- Department cannot live within the amount that has been provided on the Estimates, it must show good reason why it should receive a supplementary provision. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. As honorable members are aware, the Government Printing Office in Melbourne is a joint Department. The building and nearly all the machinery, excepting certain linotypes and presses, are owned by the Victorian Government. The Government Printer is a servant of the Victorian Government, but for the purposes of that co-ordination to which the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pigott)</inline> so ardently aspires, Commonwealth work is done at that office, and the State Government Printer is also the Commonwealth Government Printer. Attempts were made at different times to found a separate Commonwealth printing office, but the arrangement made with the Victorian Government has worked so successfully that a continuance of it is mutually advantageous. </para>

                    <para>In regard to the remarks of the honorable member for Calare on the subject of statistical co-ordination, the States in conference assembled some time ago, decided that statistical collection and compilation should be a function of the Commonwealth. Although that apparently meant great -expense to the Commonwealth, the Government at that time signified their acquiescence in the proposal. Since then the States have receded from that position. I re-opened the question this year, and asked them if they would give effect to the unanimous resolution of the Premiers arid Treasurers, but for some reason State after State refused to do so. We are powerless to compel them to move in this matter, but co-ordination of the statistical activities is an object at&#39; which we should aim. If we achieve that, a vast sum of money will be saved to each of the Governments. Not long ago I had occasion to direct the attention of the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> to a publication by the Statistician of New &#39;South Wales, which duplicated almost to a letter a previous Commonwealth publication. The expenditure seemed to me quite unnecessary. I hope that when we confer with the States in the&#39; new year about many questions that must be dealt with, and some of which must be settled, we shall be able to arrive at a satisfactory agreement. </para>

I cannot pledge the Government to any course of action, because I have not been able to finalize the matter yet. The weakness of the present system is that women of means who do not require the money draw the bonus in the same way as poorer  People  who really need it. I am not prepared . to say that . it 1 should be abolished, but any Government which will look into this matter - 1 have not yet had an opportunity to do so- will devise a better system than the one which is now operating. </para>

                    <para>Regarding the amalgamation of the Savings Banks, I am one of those who was very strongly opposed to the establishment of Savings Banks in connexion with the&#39; Commonwealth Bank. I fought very hard against the proposal, and with considerable success in Victoria, the only area over which I was able to exercise any influence. I still believe that the competitive system is evil, and can be eliminated. Since I have been in charge of the Treasury, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank has been absent from Australia, and he is now in quarantine at Sydney. I have just . received from him a&#34; letter sent from the <inline font-style="italic">Makura,</inline> which is anchored off North Head, Sydney, and he intimated that he expects to be released next week. I hope to be able to discuss this and other matters with him after the holidays. It is possible, I believe, to arrange, satisfactorily to the Commonwealth Bank and the Governments of the States, for the elimination of that competition; but it. may mean a recasting of the structure, principles, and activities of the Commonwealth Bank. That is a course that in war time- could scarcely be attempted with prudence. But now that we have a temporary peace, and permanent peace is about to dawn&#39;, this reconstruction seems feasible, and I intend to proceed with it. </para>
                    <para>Not for any purposes of the Government,, but in accordance with a desire that has been expressed by honorable members, I suggest to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> that, instead of the discussion being confined to any Department, the members of the Committee ought to be free to deal now with any item in the Estimates. </para>

                            <para>- I accept the honorable member&#39;s assurance. In regard to the Commonwealth police, I say, quite frankly, as I did in an interjection the other day,, that I have been too busy on other matters to know much about it. It was not my creation. I think that there should be investigation officers to do special work for the Commonwealth, though not necessarily to strut about in uniform, vieing, with the State police. The honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> as a Southerner, may not know as much as the Government dd of some facts affecting the administration of northern Australia. There are Queenslanders who could affirm from personal knowledge what I know only from . documentary or hearsay evidence. There was a time - I cannot say whether it still exists, because I have been chained to my desk for months - when orders for the execution of Commonwealth decrees were impossible of enforcement in certain parts of Australia. I hope that that time has gone. I wish for an opportunity to look thoroughly into the facts. If our responsibilities will allow of the scrapping of the Commonwealth Police Force, or the putting of it in a different position, that will be done. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> with the consent of his colleagues, was primarily responsible for the creation of the Force, and I am not entitled to repudiate anything that he has done, but I ask for an opportunity for examination to see what is the best course to be taken. I hope next year to pare out of the Estimates all. unnecessary expenditure. I say that to men who are prepared to take my word. </para>

As the time allotted to the discussion of the Estimates is limited, it might convenience the Committee if honorable members were allowed to refer to any item in them instead of being confined to those of the Department of the Treasury, which is now before the Chair, and then, in their order, to those of the other Departments. </para>

                        <para>.- I am pleased at the great success that has attended&#39; the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank. The Budget papers show that there was a deficit on the 30th June, 1913, in connexion with the operations of the Bank during the first six months of its existence, amounting to &#163;46,636. In 1913-14 the Bank made a profit of &#163;9,640; in 1914-15, of &#163;39,217; 1915-16, of &#163;144,847; in 1916-17, of &#163;379.223; and in 1917-18, of &#163;232,659; the net profit for the whole period totalling &#163;758,951. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In the few moments at my disposal I wish, by placing some facts on record, to do justice to the gentleman who conceived the idea of establishing this Bank, who took the necessary steps to bring it within the range of practical politics, and, subsequently, by his strenuous advocacy of it, led to the passing of the law under which it was established - I refer to my old friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O&#39;Malley. He has been most unjustly treated. At the head office of the Bank in Sydney there are foundation stones in. scribed with the names of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> and of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs,</inline> but my old friend, who was really responsible for the establishment of the Bank, and had to fight for it against the opposition of some of these men, is not remembered there. Year after year he put before this Parliament a well-thought-out scheme for the establishment of a national Bank, and on his initiative the matter was taken before the Brisbane Labour Conference in 1908, with the result that it subsequently became a plank of the Federal Labour platform, on which the party to which I belong contested the election of 1910, and was returned to power. </para>
                    <para>The honorable gentleman had to put up a fight for the Bank even in his own party. I do not say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> who was then Prime Minister, opposed the establishment of the Bank. He could not do that, because it was a plank of the Labour party; but evidently he was very much afraid of it. </para>

The only name that I mentioned in connexion with the Conference was that of King O&#39;Malley. On page 10 of the re-  port of the Conference a motion for the establishment of a national bank is recorded as having been moved by King O&#39;Malley. The matter was afterwards referred to a committee, whose recommendation was adopted by the Conference, and later became a leading plank of the Labour platform. </para>

                    <para>Mr.J. H. CATTS.- I was present at the Conference, and have refreshed my memory by reading the report of its proceedings. The proposal was referred to a committee, which reported on two questions, the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank and the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. Its recommendations were adopted by the Conference, and the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank was made a plank of our fighting platform. The bank which we were pledged to establish was a bank of issue, deposit, exchange, and reserve. </para>

                            <para>- He took from the Bank the power of issuing notes. I do not think that I am unjust in saying that at that time he had no intention of proceeding with the Commonwealth Bank scheme. It seemed a little too big for him. Knowing this to be so, a number <inline font-style="italic">o&#163;</inline> us took steps in the party meeting to prevent the project being dropped. I think that was done on the initiative of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O&#39;Malley, and I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chanter,</inline> who occupies the chair at this moment, was on one of the committees which threshed out the matter. </para>

                    <para>I have refreshed my memory with the recollection of several honorable members, amongst them the  Hon.  W. G. Higgs, M.H.R., ex-Treasurer; the <inline font-weight="bold">Hon. Dr. Maloney,</inline> M.H.R.; the  Hon.  James Page, M.H.R. ; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Mathews, M.H.R., as to the action which had to be taken by the Labour caucus to force the Government to establish the Bank. These gentlemen support my statement of the facts. I remember the incident in the party meeting, complaint being made that Mr. Fisher was not proceeding to establish the Bank, and, notwithstanding the strenuous opposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pisher</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> the party instructed these gentlemen to bring the Bank into existance. I am reminded by the ex-Treasurer  <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> who sits beside me, that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fraser,</inline> then a Cabinet Minister, said that the establishment of the Bank would ruin the Government. </para>
                    <para>There are those who from time to time have spoken unkindly of King O&#39;Malley, but whatever may be that gentleman&#39;s defects, it must be remembered in&#39; his favour that he is responsible for this institution, and did more than any other man in the country to bring it into existence. It, therefore, seems paltry that his name was not placed with the others in the head office of the Bank. </para>

                            <para>- I have really finished what I have to say, and only desire to add that the Bank was established amongst the misgivings even of those who were its nominal sponsors. The establishment of the Bank was not in any sense due to those gentlemen, who might be called the Leaders of the Government at that time, because it was really forced on them by the younger and more active members of the great party to which I belong. I notice, however, that those gentlemen who blocked the Bank as long as they could now figure as the authors of it, and take great credit for its establishment; and I desire to take this opportunity, though it is late, to place on record some of the facts, so that justice may be done to my old friend and colleague. </para>

                            <para>- The Estimates are now under discussion, and the question to which I am referring involves expenditure. My desire is to show reasons why I intend to vote in favour of the Chief Justice&#39;s Pension Bill, although I voted against pensions for Judges on a former occasion. I think that the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> is very unjust in&#34; trying to prevent my giving reasons for my vote on the present occasion, for it must be admitted that it is not very often that I address either the House or the Committee. I submit that we have already established a principle of pensions by the&#34; payment of old-age pensions and soldiers&#39; pensions, and neither the person nor the amount involved in any way vitiates or affects that principle. </para>

                    <para>At one time I evolved a scheme by which, members of this Parliament might themselves be pensioned, and it was approved by every one to whom I submitted it; so much so, that many honorable members signed it, including the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> the honorable member for Maranoa. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Page), Senator Rae,</inline> and others. My scheme took cognisance of the fact that a man&#39;s first election might be something in the nature of a fluke, and made -no provision under such circumstances j but if a man were elected to a second Parliament he became entitled, on retirement, to a pension of &#163;60 per annum, or &#163;5 per month. If he were elected to a third Parliament, and continued to be elected to successive Parliaments, he was allowed an increase of &#163;50 per annum&#34; in respect of each Parliament, until the pension reached a maximum of &#163;260 per annum, or &#163;5 per week. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> was  chairman,  and I was a member, of the Old-age Pensions Commission, and when taking evidence in Sydney on one occasion, an incident was brought&#39; before us which clearly illustrates the usefulness of making provision by way of pension for days of misfortune. During the discussion on the Chief Justice&#39;s Pension Bill&#39; much was said to the effect that men with large incomes should make provision for themselves, and not ask others to &#34; go round with the hat &#39; &#39; - an expression to which I take strong exception in this connexion. However, one witness before the Old-age Pensions Commission gave us. some evidence in confidence of a case of a man who, at one time, was a very noted figures in .sporting circles in Australia. He had a fine stud farm in New South Wales, and had won many classic races. He had sold that stud farm for a very large sum, and yet, at the time that evidence was being given, he was in receipt of an old-age pension of . 10s. a week from the State Government. I mention this to show that, no matter what a man&#39;s position may be, it is possible! that, at a later period in his life, he will get into such necessitous circumstances as to make a pension, however small, very desirable. </para>

Just about that time the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> propounded a scheme under which every member of this Parliament was to be paid &#163;1,000 per annum, &#163;600 in cash, the other &#163;400 being placed to his credit, and given to him when, either compulsorily or voluntarily, he ceased to be a member. But neither that scheme nor my own was indorsed by the Government, although I believe that my scheme, at any rate, would receive support were it submitted now.

                            <para>- I shall not pursue that line of argument any further, and thereby raise the ire of the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs).</inline> I should now like to say a word in relation to the Commonwealth police. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has referred to Queensland as a place where the people know something about this- force, and what rendered its establishment necessary. In my electorate there are a few of the Federal police, all good men, doing good work; and I take exception to the action of the Government in dispensing with their services. There may be still a few members of the Federal police in the  electorate, but certainly not more than five. These men were offered the positions by the Government, and though they did not wear uniforms, they went about doing, in some cases, very necessary work. Some of them, in order to take up the positions, had left other employment, and it is known that on their appointment they immediately became marked men amongst those in their own walk of life. The result is that since their services have been dispensed with by the Government, they are boycotted, and cannot obtain employment in the work to which they had previously . been accustomed . In my opinion, the Government have treated these men very badly. As to the necessity for a Federal Police Force, I was told by a military officer of an incident that occurred in Queensland a little while ago. A meeting was being addressed by a number of Industrial Workers of the World men, of whom only two out of about eleven were British; and when one of the foreigners made remarks of a distinctly offensive character, a man in the crowd called out, &#39; &#39; You are a liar !&#34; A State policeman, who had taken no notice of the disloyal utterances on the platform, immediately tapped this man on the shoulder, and told him that if he interrupted the proceedings again he would have to be &#34; taken care of.&#34; I know that, even if there had been several Federal policemen there, they could not have taken any action in the presence of the State policeman, and with the crowd to a great extent in sympathy with the speakers. In some cases, however, the Federal police have been instrumental in suppressing and preventing disturbances. In my electorate there is an hotel called Cassidy&#39;s, and not long ago a party of soldiers - every one of them a wounded man: - was there celebrating the armistice. A strange crowd, of men caine in, and commenced to &#39; &#39; slang-wang &#39; &#39; the soldiers, one going so far as to pull a badge off a soldier&#39;s coat. Of course, there was immediate trouble and the wounded men were so badly treated that some of them are, I am told, in hospital even to-day. Two pr three Federal police, it is said, came along and attempted to do something, and their efforts were very greatly assisted by a number of. boy scouts, who went around to the various picture theatres and places of amusement, calling out, &#39; &#39; Diggers, your mates are being atacked at Cassidy&#39;s. &#39; &#39; This brought every soldier in the place to Cassidy&#39;s, and the first party of attackers were very severely treated. </para>

                        <para>.- On page 35 of the Treasurer&#39;s Estimate there is an item of &#34; Unforeseen expenditure,&#34; in respect of which we are asked to vote &#163;1,500. Under the same heading in 1917-18 a sum of &#163;2,500 was voted, and the amount actually &#39;expended was &#163;836. I should like the Treasurer to state whether, put of this item, provision is made for the payment of a salary of &#163;300 per annum received by a certain man, who is employed at the present time in the Defence Department, but who instead of doing any work for it, is engaged in looking after the requirements of the Prime Minister&#39;s constituency of Bendigo. He is drawing &#163;300 per annum of the taxpayers&#39; money, and although he is on the permanent staff of the Defence Department he does no work for that Department. </para>

                            <para>- No. In the first instance he was employed as a temporary clerk in the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. The Prime Minister evidently had sufficient influence with&#39; the head of the Defence Department to obtain for this gentleman an appointment in that branch of the Service. This is an item , of &#34;Unforeseen expenditure.&#34; It could not have been foreseen by honorable members that a man employed nominally in the Defence Department would be in reality looking after the constituents of the  Hon.  William MorrisHughes. He signs&#39; himself &#34; Private Secretary.&#34; He is not private secretary to the Defence Department, but acts in that capacity for the Prime Minister, who is in England. </para>

                    <para>I do not object to the Prime Minister or any other member of the Government having&#34; a duly appointed private secretary. But, in view of the fact that Ministerial supporters are constantly preaching economy and demanding retrenchment, it is interesting to know what is being done in this regard. I have no fault to find with the man &#39; who is drawing this salary. The fact that he is employed in this way by the Prime Minister shows that the right honorable gentleman has confidence in him, and believes him to be a very capable man. </para>

The honorable member will not be in order in discussing the Defence Department or any of its officers, but he will be in order in discussing any disbursement through the Treasury for any purpose. </para>

                        <para>.- So far our most brilliant legal men have accepted positions as Justices of the High Court, the fountain head of our justice, for the sake of the kudos appertaining to them; but whether this will be the case in the future or not is open to a great deal of doubt, because of the very low salary offered. Owing to the fact that our High Court sits in the different capitals, our Justices are practically away from their homes half the year; and,, no matter how frugal they may be, seeing that they are obliged to live at a fairly high rate, their salary is quite inadequate for them to make provision for that time, when they will be obliged to retire. In carrying out his duties, a High Court Justice has y to devote the whole of his attention to * very intricate matters, requiring the application of all his intelligence; and we know that a professional man is lacking in a certain amount of practical knowledge, which is a drawback to him in seeking to invest his savings to advantage. We ought to provide our High Court Justices with adequate pensions, so that we may secure the very best men obtainable. It would be a tragedy for Australia if the High Court simply became the resting-place for second-class or briefless barristers. This is not a matter of economy. It is a matter of getting the very best men to dispense justice on our High Court Bench. If we do not do this, litigants will go past the High Court to the Privy Council, and we shall be paying seven second-rate men for doing nothing. Everybody in Australia, no matter how worthless he may be in the ordinary walks of life, or how thriftless, or how criminal, is entitled to receive a pension at the age of sixty-five years; but for men of the highest integrity, intelligence, and moral character on our High Court Bench no adequate provision is made if they have been unfortunate. </para>

                    <para>It is fair to assume that when the Federal Land Tax Bill was first introduced, very few. persons except the then Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who introduced it, knew what it would mean. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> the first Commissioner of Taxation, pointed out in his first report that the revenue received from secondary taxpayers - that is to say, shareholders in land-holding institutions - did not pay the cost of collection. The Department has an army of clerks endeavouring to bring within the clutches of the Federal land tax all those persons who, while not owning land themselves, hold shares in Dalgety&#39;s, the Bank of New South Wales, or the  New  Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency. * The valuer, who, by building up his department, comes into a higher grade in the Civil Service, has every particular locality valued, although it is well known to practical men that there are thousands of acres in the interior which are all practically of the same value. If the value of one place is determined a man can easily ride over the others and fix a value upon them. </para>
                    <para>It seems to be the object of the officers of Departments to get as much work done as is possible. If a person writes to the  Deputy  Commissioner of Pensions the Federal member for the district receives a copy of the communication, a copy of the Pensions Office communication, and a copy of. his covering letter. It seems to me a waste of clerical labour. </para>

                    <para>According to one item on the Estimates, the Commonwealth Bank is paid &#163;8,000 for bank exchange from all Departments. As it gets the whole of the business of the Departments, to the detriment of the general public, it ought to do the exchanges for nothing. Previously the private banks did it for nothing, and seeing that the Commonwealth Bank has been bolstered up at the public expense, and that it has a vast amount of money lying idle to the credit of the Commonwealth Government, it should also do this exchange for nothing. </para>
                    <para>Our note issue is up to its limit, and should not be increased any further. I understand that &#163;10,000,000 of the gold backing does not belong to the Commonwealth Government but has been borrowed for the period of the war from the private banks. In these circumstances the interest earned by the notes fund should be applied for the purpose of building ur&#62;&#34; a gold reserve, so that the Government can say honestly that the backing to our note issue is our own, and is not borrowed. </para>
                    <para>Ever since I have been a member of this House I have protested against allowing Commonwealth loan money and our ordinary Consolidated Revenue money to remain idle in the Commonwealth Bank. For the last three quarters of the year the deposits in the Commonwealth Bank amounted to about &#163;30,000,000, while the advances to the public were not more than &#163;8,000,000. I have asked year after year why we cannot adopt the procedure followed in other countries, and  How the loan moneys to remain with the private banks who have found them until they are required by the Government. </para>
                    <para class="block">With so much taxation and such a heavy drain on the. private banks and on the public for money for war loans, our position soon will be that the private banks will be obliged to borrow from the Commonwealth Bank, and pay a high rate of interest for the taxpayers&#39; money, which has been drawn from them and paid into the Commonwealth Bank. </para>
                    <para>A great deal might be said on these Estimates, but time  will not allow it. Our finances ought to be looked into by the Treasurer. Particularly should he take notice of the money lying idle in the Commonwealth Bank. Attention should be paid to the growing size of the various - Departments, and to the number of employees in them. When I go into a public Department I can always see half-a-dozen young fellows standing about, carrying files of papers tied up with red tape, and chatting away to one another. We should pay our public servants well, but we must have an efficient and capable Service, which does not include one man more than is necessary. In regard to the High Court, I hope the Treasurer will bring forward a Bill to provide for pensions for all the Judges, so that they may be given that independence which is essential to their high position. </para>

                        <para>.- The remarks of the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falkiner)</inline> regarding the Public Service may be applicable to a few men, but it is .unfair to make a general charge against a service which, in war time, has done good work for the country. . I do not defend a waster in any department of life, but in all large institutions, whether governmental or private, one may see at certain times of the day men or women who are, apparently, doing nothing. But it is unfair to accuse them of idleness because of what one sees on a casual visit. We have no continuous oversight of them, and it may be that when they are apparently idle they are waiting to receive the attention of some, other officer who is busy. The New&#39; Zealand Government has provided &#163;400,000 on the Estimates in order to pay bonuses to the public servants. </para>

                    <para>I agree with the other remarks of the honorable member for Hume regarding  the Commonwealth Bank. The last quarterly balance-sheet of that institution shows that &#163;21,000,000 was lying at short call. Presumably the bulk of that money is operated through the branch in London, where there is more opportunity for investment at short dates. I believe that most of it represented deposits on current account by Commonwealth Departments. The Commonwealth has &#163;18,000,000 lying in the Bank not earning one penny of interest for the Government. </para>

I know that the form used by the Repatriation Department must mean a saving of hundreds of pounds per annum. And why should the Departments continue using stamps which represent a certain quantity of paper and gum and involve the use of special machines, when a stamped form could be used, allowing the adhesive stamp to be dispensed with. </para>

The Commonwealth Savings Bank has been very well conducted. </para>

                        <para>.- I find that in the Treasurer&#39;s Department twelve new officers have been added to the staff at salaries ranging from &#163;535 down to &#163;39. They include a clerk at &#163;140, a clerk at &#163;320, an Assistant Commissioner at &#163;535, a special magistrate at &#163;320, a draftsman as &#163;300, a chief assessor at &#163;430, a draftsman at &#163;126, and so on. I do not understand why these new positions should have been created under existing conditions. </para>

Unfortunately the administra We have just received information of tha Northern Territory comes within the Department of a Minister, who, though sprung from a very combative race, meets opponents in such a way that it is almost impossible to assail him as one ordinarily assails political adversaries ; because it takes two to make a quarrel. The information I have been receiving for months past prevented me from being surprised at the recent news. 1 have informed the Minister of the situation in the Territory. When Professor Gilruth was appointed Administrator of the Territory, he was understood to bo an exceptionally strong man; but strong men must learn that they cannot govern by brutal methods, and that, in addition to strength, they must have discretion. Professor Gilruth has no discretion whatever, and he alone is to blame for the trouble that has occurred - lt was the outcome of the seething discontent which has prevailed in the Territory for some considerable time. I informed the Minister that the sending out of correspondence and telegrams from the Northern Territory was being suppressed, and that persons leaving the Territory were being searched for letters which might contain information of what was happening there. Characteristically, he spared no trouble to investigate all the details, and I must admit that he endeavoured to prevent what has taken place. Nevertheless, what I said would take place has occurred, and on him must fall the blame. If the Northern . Territory had been ruled by the German Kaiser, it would not have been ruled more despotically than it has been by Doctor Gilruth, who has no leaning towards conciliation. He regards, and has made, himself a dictator, censoring all the communications from the Territory to the Seat of Government. Such a man does not deserve the support of his Minister or of the Government. I cannot say that the judiciary of the Northern Territory is corrupt, but, like the Administrator, it is pig-headed, and has proceeded along such lines that it has made the people of the Territory believe that they have no chance of getting justice from it. Such a belief breeds discontent in a British community, and develops trouble such as has occurred. It is admitted that the report of this trouble was censored, and that the newspapers at the Seat of Government were not allowed to publish it. What can be obtained by suppression of news concerning the discontent in the Territory ? Of course, I cannot blame the Minister for Home and Territories
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline>
                        for the censoring of the press reports, because that is not within his control; but why does he not assert himself and prevent the Minister who does supervise the censorship from exercising it in connexion with the affairs of his Department? Of course, I realize that there is such a thing as Ministerial responsibility, and also international responsibility, and that Ministers have to acquiesce sometimes in a course of action that does not meet with their approval. But this interference by one Minister with another in such a matter as the censorship requires some explanation. Nothing that can take place in the Northern Territory to-day can prejudice the safety of the Empire, because, to all intents and purposes, the war is now over, and to me it is an atrocity that the Minister who controls the Censor&#39;s Office should go out of his way to interfere in the way I have described. Such conduct ought to be condemned, and will be condemned by the public. Personally, I have often had to complain about the attitude of the press ; but even if I myself were prejudicially affected, I would never advocate the suppression of any news of thekind.

                            <para>- The present trouble is the culminating point of all that has occurred in the Northern Territory. The main charge is, and has been for some considerable time, that the Judiciary is biased. The Administrator is isolated from the rest of Australia, and. has complete control of telegraphs, postal affairs, shipping, and so forth, and can suppress what information he desires. If he does suppress&#39; information, he is exercising a power that he ought not to possess. </para>

                            <para>- This trouble has been led up to by the actions of, not an Administrator, but a dictator. There are three men in Melbourne who assure me that before leaving the Territory they were searched, in order to insure that they did not fetch away with them any  documents that could prove the statements made by residents; and the postal law has been broken in order that I might not receive communications from the Northern Territory. The magistracy is a cause of much of the trouble, and has been so all along. The following communication has been received by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> from Messrs. McCay and Thwaites, solicitors, Melbourne: - </para>

                    <para>Since writing our first letter of to-day date  to you, we have received the following telegram from Darwin: - &#34; Since my last, two justices appointed here, namely, Evans and MacDonald. Evans is Government Secretary, also holds various other posts. MacDonald minor Government official Protector Aboriginals, keeps the aboriginals enclosure near Darwin, also Darwin Point keeper, was constable. Comment in this wire superfluous.&#34; </para>
                    <para class="block">Messrs. McCay and Thwaites are acting on behalf of the people of Darwin. This is not a Labour party affair, but embraces the whole population of. the Northern Territory outside the public officials; indeed, I may say that many of the officials are with the rest of the community in this matter, but are afraid to assert themselves because of their position. The communication continues - </para>
                    <para class="block">As you will see by the telegram, the two new justices are both Government officials, which . makes the position with regard to justices a great deal worse from the point of view of our clients. </para>
                    <para class="block">Bad as the conditions are in these southern centres of civilization, where all sorts of favoritism is exercised to place mon of a particular political colour in power, such appointments and such administration as has been experienced in the Northern Territory would not be tolerated for two minutes. It is useless to appeal to the Judiciary, and the partisanship of the magistracy is undoubted. Whatever the private feelings of the public servants might be, they are still public servants, and they do not exercise their functions as magistrates otherwise than at the pleasure of the dictator. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to place before the Minister some facts in connexion with the appointment of justices of the peace in the Territory. Even in the wild political appointments made to the magistracy in other parts of Australia there is a certain decency observed; and the people in the Northern Territory desire that in such appointments all shades of opinion in the community shall be represented. I have presented a petition to Parliament on this question, signed by almost the whole population of . the Northern Territory outside the officials, and I have received another, with 251 signatures, objecting to the whole of the present procedure. The Territory, financially, is subsidized by the rest of Australia, and I am not asking that the people of the Northern Territory shall have the full control of the money thus received. If I did, I should only make myself ridiculous ; but we must remember that these people are Australians, like ourselves, and that they have no representation in this Parliament. They have to trust to honorable members, and I dare say there are very few of us who have not been asked, and who are not willing, to present any fair case that they may submit. They are, of course, very much isolated, and we are only too desirous to assist them in any way we can. Much as I respect the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn),</inline> I would not place even in his hands full control over the lives and wellbeing of the people of the Northern Territory, because that is not the civilized way of governing a community. I admit that a benevolent dictatorship may produce even a better civilization than we have ; but, unfortunately, we cannot make people run in grooves, and some regard must be paid to their feelings and desires. Professor Gilruth is, of course, very human, with the peculiarities and weaknesses of humanity, and it is impossible for him to rule with justice the people with whom he has for so long been disputing and fighting. What is really &#39; wanted is a new Administrator, able to put aside the hatreds of the past, for it is evident that Professor Gilruth is not one who can forgive and forget. I have suggested to the Minister that, he should visit the Territory himself, and see the people who are working under disabilities that do not obtain in any other part of Australia. It is possible, in a community like that of Darwin, for persons of all shades of political thought to sign such a petition as that to which I have referred. No doubt it would be signed by hundreds of people who would not even dream of voting for a Labour man. I am willing to admit that there are in Darwin men who, in politics, differ as widely as the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce Smith)</inline> and I do, and that amongst those who take the stand that the Administrator is not administering the Territory in a way most beneficial to&#39; the Commonwealth there may be men of extreme views. The Northern Territory is a kind of sink, into which the money of the taxpayers has for years been poured. We must expect large expenditures to take place in connexion with it. People of all shades of political thought feel that it must be kept white. It was a kind of vampire, sucking the very life&#39;s blood of South Australia, and it was because that State had kept it &#34;white&#34; that I voted for its transfer to the Commonwealth. &#34; I believed that the Commonwealth Government would be in a&#39;better position to keep it &#34; white &#34; and develop it. </para>

                    <para>Many Ministers have been condemned for their administration of the affairs of the Territory. I recognise that it is necessary to intrust some one with executive power in respect of the Territory, and the powers so conferred on the Administrator, if rightly used, would be productive of much good. We find, however, that they have been so exercised as to bring about chaos. It is time that the Government considered the desirableness of removing the present Administrator, and of replacing him by some one who will not be ready to vent his spleen on individuals. </para>
                    <para>I have heard of a statement that a man named Nelson, secretary of the local branch of the Australian Workers Union, had- induced the people of Darwin to riot a few&#39; days ago. As a matter of fact, I have, during the last few months, received from this very man dozens of letters and telegrams, pointing out what would happen if improvements were not made, and showing that it was impossible to live under the conditions imposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth.</inline> Nelson will possibly be prosecuted, and if he is tried in the Territory he may be sentenced to twenty years&#39; imprisonment on each of three charges, or sixty years&#39; imprisonment in all. </para>

Even if he were tried down south, no Judge would be likely to display any mercy in dealing with a man&#62; suspected of inciting a riot in such a community. The point I wish to emphasize, however, is that Nelson warned the authorities down here that this trouble was coming. He urged that much discontent would be removed if the people of the Territory were given representation in this Parliament and a jury system such as we have in the several States. He urged, further, that what was desired was a magistracy which would deal out justice, and the decisions of which would not be coloured by the opinions of the Administrator. I am satisfied that if what is taking place in the Territory were known in certain quarters, it would be said at the Peace Conference that Australia was tolerating there a form of Kaiserism such as even Germany would not allow. </para>

We should have regard to the experience of the Empire, and avoid these blunders in connexion with the Territory. The Administrator of Papua, Judge Murray, has to deal with even more complex questions than those associated with the -Northern Territory, but although some of the traders may occasionally complain, we . do not hear of any trouble up there. </para>

I have no personal feeling against <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth.</inline> Prom what I have seen of him, I think he is just the sort of man with whom I should Like to spend an evening over a glass of whisky and .a game of bridge, but he seems to be temperamentally unfit to administer the affairs of the Territory. He is a dictator in every sense of the word. I have full confidence in the Minister, however, and know that he will see that justice is done. I am aware that before allowing certain .action to be taken in the Territory, he has devoted weeks to the consideration of bulky files of papers dealing with the matter. </para>

So far as I know, all such messages are published, although the honorable member who watches over the affairs of the Territory with the constancy and credit of a direct representative, has often told me of complaints as to administrative interference with communications between Darwin and Melbourne. As a matter of fact I find that even the ordin&#34;ary letters of the Department are sometimes delayed in the post for some days.

                            <para>- It is not an ideal country for expeditious development, but <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> went there with a reputation which his past justified. He has a good deal of direct knowledge of cattle, and he is a man of exceedingly active temperament and of admitted ability. He has done, in the circumstances, his best to meet the somewhat rather difficult condi-tions. We cannot hope for success at once, or in all things perfection; but there has been evidence of probable success in lines in respect of which much condemnation was heard not very long ago. For instance, the Mataranka Farm, as a test station, is practically a success, and the Oenepelli Compound, according to a report which I recently gave to the papers, is able to show a profit. The breeding of cattle there has been a success, and dairying has also been successful, although about two years ago experiments on these lines were condemned as among the follies of the Administrator. </para>

                            <para>- Most of the complaints that have recently reached me have been directed against particular incidents that have occurred in the local Court, and not in the Supreme Court of the Territory. The other day there was sent to us by the Darwin Town Council a resolution couched in such terms that a Minister would have been justified in ignoring it altogether. It was stated, in effect, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Malism,</inline> a solicitor, complained that he was handed a jury list which was invalid - this jury list related, not to the Supreme Court, but to the local Court. As a matter of fact, the two lists in material lines are substantially identical, so far as the names appearing on them are concerned. On going into the matter I ascertained that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mallam</inline> applied for this list five or six days before the Court sat, but he got the Local Court list - the rotation of which was somewhat irregular - instead of the Supreme Court list. A day or two afterwards, I understand, he was informed of the fact, and if he had wanted a Supreme Court list he could have obtained one. </para>

                            <para>- Simply for the purpose of challenging jurymen, I suppose. As every lawyer knows, he could have applied for a Supreme Court list and obtained it, but he evidently preferred to go into the Court, challenge the jury list, and upset the whole panel. Complaint was made immediately, and this has been one of the causes of disaffection among some of the people of Darwin. I merely give this as an instance of some of the matters upon which Ministers are compelled to spend valuable time. There was a similar complaint, by some former dwellers in those regions, in regard to the Macdonnell Ranges. An allegation was made that was not sustained. The finding of the Judge was apparently justified. </para>

Last Wednesday about 500 men assembled outside his residence, and asked him to come outside and address them. He was asked to give an account of his five years&#39; administration or be prepared to leave by a steamer departing next day for the South, and remain out of the Territory of which he was an Administrator until a Royal Commission had inquired into his past administration. Of course, he refused to do so. Subsequently, after he addressed the men for about twenty minutes he was assaulted and knocked down. </para>

                            <para>- There was a body of about 500 men there, and, according to a telegram, the orders were given by some of the leaders of the unionists, the very men that are not always in harmony with the societies down here of which they are supposed to be members. The same discord seems, at times, to an extent, to exist between the general secretary of the union for Australia, and the local secretary as apparently exists between the Administrator and the men at Darwin. That will give honorable members an idea as to the merits of some of the complaints that have been put forward. </para>

                        <para>. - I would like the Government to reconsider the sugar question in its application to the jam-making industry. It is fully recognised now that the production of sugar for the present year is not equal to the requirements of Australia, and that at least 25,000 tons of sugar, must be imported. This sugar can be landed in Melbourne, Sydney, or Hobart for about &#163;15 or &#163;16 per ton f.o.b., but the Government are charging the jam manufacturer &#163;27 per ton. Surely they are not anxious to make a profit out of the jam-making industry ? In the limited time at my disposal I shall give a few figures in regard to jam production. In 1915 there were 128 factories in Australia engaged in the manufacture of jams and jellies, employing 4,393 persons, distributing &#163;326,440 in wages, purchasing &#163;1,600,000 worth of raw material, and having an output valued at &#163;2,417,000. It takes one ton of sugar to manufacture one ton of fruit into jam,, but while the value of apricots, peaches, plums, &#38;c, is about &#163;7 or &#163;8 per ton the sugar is sold to the jam manufacturer by the Commonwealth Government at a price which is four times as great as the duty paid on the imported article, and that is nearly equal in value to the cost of the fruit utilized in the manufacture. By an award of an industrial Court the orchardists and the packers have just been called upon to pay increased wages. If the Government do not wish to make a big profit on the sugar which they are importing for the manufacturers at a cost of about &#163;15 or &#163;16 per ton f.o.b., why should they charge &#163;27 per ton for it? We are not dealing with the sugar produced in Australia. In this connexion! we are dealing with sugar that must be imported to make up for the deficiency in the local&#34; production. But the Government will not allow the manufacturers to import sugar for themselves. They prefer to import it and, apparently, make a profit of &#163;10 per ton, including the duty, out of it. I ask  Borne  Minister to make a note of these facts and  endeavour  to treat the small fruit-growers of Victoria, Tasmania, and New South Wales more liberally, otherwise they wilt be driven off the orchards on which they have spent thousands  of  pounds. </para>

                        <para>- We have been discussing the Estimates, and when the guillotine fell we were dealing with the Treasury votes. There were many matters which honorable members were prevented from discussing, particularly in regard to the Defence and Postal Departments. I failed to get any reply to a question I submitted in reference to the training of returned soldiers. I pointed out that the Department of Repatriation had agreed to appoint committees of employers and employees to -value the work done by those returned men who have been given positions in various factories, and that although the organizations had appointed their representatives, the committees had not been called together. If we can interest the fellow employees of these returned men in this way we may possibly be able to give them the best of training. The scheme has everything in its favour, but although the representatives of the organizations were appointed in August last, so far no word has come from the Departments. It was asserted in a letter I quoted - and I believe the statement is true- that the &#39;value of the work done by returned soldiers is such as to justify the employers paying 80 per cent, instead of 40 per cent, of these men&#39;s wages. As the position is now, the Commonwealth are paying 40 per cent, of the wages that the employers should be paying. </para>

The Treasurer has agreed to make available an amount from his Advance Account, which will enable me to pay to cleaners and messengers who have dependants, and are in receipt of less than &#163;204 per annum, a bonus of &#163;10 each in the case of males, and &#163;5 each in the case of females. This bonus is not to be regarded as a precedent; it is granted in recognition of the unusually high cost of commodities during the last twelve months, owing to war conditions. </para>

                    <para>The Bill covers a promise made some time ago by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> when he stated that the original Act was not to be regarded as the last word upon repatriation. He still had under consideration various proposals, and amongst those was a scheme for the building of homes for returned soldiers and sailors. The necessity for this Bill arises from the fact that it is exceedingly difficult at the present time, particularly in New South Wales, to obtain dwelling-houses. The object of the measure is really to provide homes and acquire land for homes, in contradistinction to what may be termed the land settlement portion of the repatriation policy, although it is quite possible under this scheme to acquire a home, surrounded by a small area of land, which may be of some assistance in making the burden of life easier to the . returned soldier. The general application of the scheme will be to all returned soldiers, sailors, and nurses. The measure will apply only to such soldiers as are defined as &#34; eligible,&#34; and as the home idea is the . vital principle in the Bill, an eligible person is defined as an Australian soldier who satisfies the Commissioner that he is either married, is about to marry, or has dependants for whom it is necessary for him to maintain a home. Others who may benefit are the female dependants of soldiers, and they are defined as being the widow of an Australian soldier, or, in the case of a deceased Australian soldier who was not married, his mother, provided that she is a widow and was, prior to the enlistment of the soldier, dependent upon him, or that her husband is so incapacitated as to be unable to contribute materially to her support. </para>

                    <para class="block">Commissioner who, subject to the Minister, should be responsible for the administration of the Act. He is to hold office for a term of seven years, at a salary of &#163;1,500, and he will be removable from office only upon the conditions set out in the Bill. These provisions indicate the character of the person whom we desire to get for this position. He must be a man of high qualifications, because large responsibilities are to be intrusted to him in connexion with the acquisition of. land and the erection of houses. Provision is made, also, for the appointment of an Acting Commissioner&#39; in the event of the suspension, absence, or sickness of the Commissioner, or the vacancy of the office. The staff will not be governed by the provisions of the Public Service Act; that is to say, officers will be appointed to hold office during pleasure only. Civil servants, however, who may be appointed to assist in the work of the Commissioner will have their rights as members of the Public Service preserved. </para>

                            <para>- It will be a separate branch, working under the Minister for Repatriation. There will still be the Controller doing the general administrative work of the Department of Repatriation, but there will be also the Commissioner appointed under this measure to carry out this housing, scheme. The Commissioner will be expected to utilize the existing agencies of the Commonwealth and the States wherever possible, in order to avoid duplication and unnecessary expense. The first power of the Commissioner will be to acquire land for the purpose of erecting, homes. The land may be acquired from private owners, or, with the consent of the Minister, any Crown land of a State may be acquired. The land acquired may be vacant land, or land upon which buildings have been erected. Very wide discretionary powers are given to the Commissioner, but there is a limitation that land, or land and buildings, exceeding &#163;5,000 in value shall be acquired only with the approval of the Minister. All lands will be vested in fee-simple in the Commissioner. In regard to the erection of dwellings, he may call for tenders or have the buildings constructed in any way that he thinks advisable, but the total cost of any dwelling-house erected or. acquired, together with the land, is not to exceed &#163;700. The Commissioner may ascertain that in some suburb a large area of land may be acquired, and he will have authority to purchase the land, subdivide it, and erect dwellings thereon, either on applications made or in anticipation of applications. In some of the more populous centres, such as Sydney and Melbourne, the Commissioner may find it cheaper, when he knows there is likely to be a number of applications in excess of those already received, to let a contract for the erection of a number of cottages, and to obtain all his building materials on a wholesale basis. </para>

                            <para>- That is the idea. &#39; The Commissioner is given power to sell to any eligible person who is riot the owner of a dwelling-house within Australia or elsewhere. This scheme being for the benefit of returned soldiers, and such female dependants as come within the definition, the Commissioner can sell only to them. The sale will be upon prescribed terms, and the price must not exceed the capital cost to the Commissioner of the dwelling-house and the land. The land may be sold either with or without a deposit. If the soldier or sailor is able to pay a deposit there will be a transfer of the land and the building to him, subject to a mortgage to secure the balance of the purchase money. If he has no money with which to pay a deposit there may be a sale of the land to him, tut it will be in the form of a lease-purchase agreement, the title remaining in the Commissioner.. The land will be leased on a weekly tenancy, for which a rental will be charged sufficient to cover interest at 5 per cent, of the capital cost of the property, insurance, rates, if any, &#39;repairs, and such sum towards the reduction of the purchase money as the Commissioner may think fit. </para>

When a sum equal to one-fifth of the purchase money has been paid, a transfer, to the purchaser may be effected, and the land will be vested in him, subject to a mortgage. He will thus become the registered proprietor of the estate, subject to this mortgage. . </para>

                    <para>The advances may be made in instalments, and their purposes, are determined by clause 23. The Commissioner cannot make an advance unless he is satisfied that the dwelling-house in respect of which, or for the purpose of which, it is applied, is intended to be used by the applicant as a home for himself and his dependants, and that neither the applicant nor his wife, should the applicant be married, is the owner of any other dwelling. </para>
                    <para>The conditions of the advance are specified. The Commissioner is to be satisfied that the house, when erected, will be a substantial dwelling, and that the plans and specifications comply with the prescribed conditions set out in the regulations, and the plans and specifications must be approved by him. Further, the Commissioner must be satisfied that, having regard to the locality . in which the house is proposed to be erected, the risk is a reasonable one for him to undertake. In all cases where advances are made, there must be a mortgage executed to secure it, and the property must be unencumbered by any previous mortgage or charge. </para>
                    <para>There are certain general conditions which apply both to sales and to advances. In the first place, the Commissioner is not bound to make a sale or advance to every eligible person. Before he makes an advance, or executes a contract of sale, he is to be satisfied that the returned soldier or sailor has a reasonable prospect of carrying out the terms of the contract, or repaying the advance. That is an&#39; ordinary proper business precaution. The terms of repayment which are applicable to mortgagees and to sales, may be made either weekly, fortnightly, or monthly. They will depend entirely on the terms contained in the contract of sale or governing the advance. Where a dwelling house is of brick or stone, or material  of similar durability, the life of it is set down at thirty-seven years, and the life of a wooden building is set down at twenty years. The life, for instance, of a mixed wood and stone, or wood and. brick, or wood and concrete building is to be fixed at the discretion of the Commissioner, but is not to exceed thirty-seven years. </para>
                    <para>Persons, on making a contract, may give a deposit, &#34;which will be treated as a deposit bearing interest, and the accumulated interest will be taken into account in the final settlement. The rate of interest is not to exceed 5 per cent. </para>

                        <para class="block">Tally speaking, as long as there is money owing by the purchaser or the persons to whom an advance has been made, the property in. respect of which it is owing must be kept in good and tenantable repair, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, who, should there be default, has the necessary power to step in and protect it. While money remains unpaid, the soldier or sailor who owes it is prevented from sub-letting the property on which it has been advanced, except with the consent in writing of the Commissioner. But as in Australia persons find it necessary to move about a great deal, the Commissioner is empowered to permit sub-letting. It may be found desirable to exercise such a power in cases where a man finds that he has to leave his home to go elsewhere to get work. </para>

If a man has paid for his land, then, of course, as I say, the Commissioner has done with him. At the same time, there are some transfers that will take place by the operation of law, where a man goes insolvent, or dies, and the property descends. In addition, a man may arrange with the Commissioner to transfer his land to an eligible person, but he will not be allowed to transfer except oh prescribed conditions or in cases of hardship. </para>

                    <para>As regards default, in a case where it is a matter of three months, the Commissioner has power to sell; but I wish honorable members to bear in mind that there is a relief clause in the latter part of the Bill. Clause 44 enables the Commissioner, in cases of hardship, to extend the period under such conditions and terms as he may think fit for the payments required under the Act. That is a very proper clause, enabling relief to be given. </para>
                    <para>Insurance of the property is required. By clause 38, the purchaser or borrower has to take out a policy, and it is proposed that the Commissioner shall have his  own insurance fund. It is believed that there will be a sufficient number of persons and homes under the Act to justify a fund of the kind being established. </para>
                    <para>For the purposes of the scheme a special fund known as the War Service Homes Trust Fund is to be created. It will be supported by the sums of money which come from loans under Acts to be passed by Parliament from time to time; by certain moneys which are to be appropriated out of revenue and paid into the fund; re-purchase moneys realized in cases where the Commissioner sells properties; and any moneys received in payment of loans. As against that fund there will be debited all those moneys which are paid out for the purpose of acquiring land, for loans by way of advances,, or expended on the erection of buildings and on the salaries of the Commissioner and staff, and all other payments, excepting those relating to insurance. &#39; </para>
                    <para>In conclusion, I wish to refer to one other clause. I may say incidentally, however, that the Bill refers to the Northern Territory, and the Commissioner is enabled to deal with leaseholds in accordance with the .Territory Ordinances. I particularly desire to call attention to clause 49, which indicates one of the most important methods by which the Commissioner proposes to carry out the Act. That clause provides - </para>

                            <para>- The men will require houses&#34; immediately, and the Commissioner must do his best with the material at his disposal ; the mere fact that timber, and so forth, will be cheaper two or three years hence is no justification for not assisting the men as soon as possible. How many will take advantage of the scheme it is impossible to forecast. There are about 70,000 soldiers here already, and there are to come from 180,000 to 200,000. A great many of the men are single, and some are married with families, while a certain proportion have homes already, and no doubt there will be others who do not desire to have homes. Many have been killed, but their dependants are here, and we may have to provide homes for them. </para>

I submit the Bill in the hope of seeing it placed on the statute-book before we rise for Christmas. It is a big housing scheme that we are initiating to provide homes for a large number of men over the whole of the continent. The scheme, I believe, can be carried out satisfactorily, and, if it is, the Commonwealth Parliament will have performed a very useful function, and assisted in solving the housing problem of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>This is a Bill to simplify dealing with what may be called the military estates of deceased soldiers. In many cases, the estates of deceased soldiers consist only of their military pay and personal effects in the control of the Department. In such cases, the practice of the Department has been to follow the provisions of the Regimental Debts Act, an Imperial measure, so far as it is considered applicable. We have been in the habit, where the soldier died intestate, of communicating with the next of kin and paying over moneys in hand, and also handing over the effects to persons whom we believe, on the evidence submitted to us, to be next of kin. Where there has been some doubt, the practice has been to ask the Curator of Intestate Estates, or the Public Trustee, as the case may . be, to obtain administration of the deceased  soldiers&#39; estates; but, even in these cases, the Curator or the Public Trustee has asked us for indemnities against any mistake that might be made in paying over to the beneficiaries on the information we supply. </para>

                            <para>-No; only in cases when we deal with the estates, or ask the State officials to deal with it. Of course, in cases where the wife or next of kin has thought fit to take out letters of administration in the State where the deceased was domiciled at the date of death, no  trouble has arisen; but, in many cases in  which we have endeavoured to avoid administration, . and have handed over small amounts of money and personal effects, we have subsequently found ourselves called upon to make good claims made under wills subsequently found. In other cases where we have asked the Curator to administer, he has called on us under our guarantee to&#39; refund to him amounts he has paid over when subsequently claimed by executors under wills. In one case, we paid over, I think, &#163;60 odd to a widow, believing her to be the next of kin and the only person entitled, and twelve months after, a trustee company proved a will in which the  money was left to the deceased&#39;s father. He made a claim on the Curator, who called on us to pay under our indemnity, and we had to do so. The object of this Bill is to clear up any doubt as to the Imperial Regimental Debts Bill being applicable to the whole of the Dominions, and also to enable us to deal&#34; wholly and solely with the military estates of deceased soldiers. It is provided in the Bill that- &#34;Military estate&#34; means- </para>

                            <para>-This Bill will grant relief to many beneficiaries who cannot now obtain money which should properly go to them. As a lawyer, I know of such cases. In a Queensland case the Curator was asked to administer the estate of a single man. In such circumstances, under the State law, the father was entitled to the proceeds. The deceased&#39;s brothers and sisters could not prove the death of the father, although it was morally beyond doubt that he was dead, and the money lies to-day in the hands of the Curator, and will ultimately go into the State funds. If this Bill had been in force, the money could have been paid over to the brothers and sisters of the deceased who were the only persons entitled. There was no moral doubt as to the father&#39;s death. He had gone to Western Australia on the discovery of gold there, and although his death could not be proved, there was no doubt that be was deceased. </para>

On asking for evidence of her widowhood, we have been told that the husband is alive, but has not contributed a penny to the support of his wife and family. In such circumstances, we cannot pay the mother of the deceased soldier a penny. The Curator takes over the estate, and if the father hears of what has happened he comes in and claims. </para>

                            <para>- No. In one case, as I have already stated, we paid over the money coming to a deceased soldier to his widow, who was living in England. Twelve or sixteen months later a trustee company in Melbourne proved the will of the deceased, in which he left everything to his father, and ignored his wife. The trustee company called on us to pay over the amount involved - &#163;60- and we had to do so. . That was a case in which we had. done an act of simple justice, but on the will being subsequently proved, an action could not stand. </para>

Since Monday I have conferred on more than one occasion with the Commissioner of Taxation, to see if it would . be possible to adopt the principle embodied in the proposed new clause and in the suggested amendment of that clause, but I have been assured that the acceptance of it would mean that the Bill and the original Act would need to be recast. I am not prepared to do this at the present stage. The measure, as it stands, contains some very remedial provisions which will be appreciated by the community generally, and I ask honorable members not to press the matter further. </para>

                        <para>.- While many of the amendments incorporated in this Bill give some relief to the taxpayers, I wish to place on record my objection to the exemption of people who may earn&#39; profits without having to spend 6d., and simply live on their wits. I have fought very strongly to secure some relief for those persons who go out in the back country, and endeavour to build up one of the best assets of the Commonwealth, but I have not succeeded in getting it. If two persons have a few thousand pounds each, the one who goes out into the back country and endeavours to develop our resources, who provides employment for -many people, and takes the risks of drought and many difficulties unforeseen, is called upon to pay war-time profits taxation on any profits he may  happen to make, although they may be profits on paper only; whereas the other, who may invest his money in mortgages, and come to the city to get a living by his wits, will find himself exempt from this war-time profits taxation, no matter how much money he may make. The man who may make &#163;15,000 or &#163;20,000 by securing an option of a mining property, will not be called upon to pay 6d. in the shape of war-time profits taxation; whereas the man who is engaged in the task of developing the resources of the Commonwealth will be deprived of 50 per cent, or 75 per cent, of his profits. It is a flaw in our legislation, and I would not be doing my duty if I did not draw attention to it. </para>

                    <para>. - It is not because of any feeling against the present Chief Justice of the Commonwealth that I oppose the granting of this pension. He is a man who has filled &#39;a great public position in Australia, and has been prominently before the people for many years, and we feel that he is entitled to all honour and respect. He was a shining light in the political arena, and also as a Judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland, and of the High Court. I have watched his career for many years, and have regarded him as a highly talented lawyer and Judge, who has given what some people would regard as his best to the country. I have differed from him on many occasions, but that does not influence me in my opposition to the motion before the Committee. If the circumstances warranted the granting of this consideration to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, I would still think the amount was too large. But one cannot forget that when he accepted the position of Chief Justice of the High Court, there was a clear understanding that no pension attached to the appointment. He has dra&#39;wn a bigger salary than any other Australian Judge, and why a. pension should be granted to him, and not to any other members of the High Court Bench, I cannot understand. During my membership of this House, many men have left political life, and some of them have since died. Although they had been receiving the emoluments which attached to membership of this Parliament, and in some cases to Ministerial positions, some of them were in poor circumstances. Yet, though they had given their best to their country, there was no thought of granting a pension to them. I could enumerate twenty or thirty men who are equally as deserving of a pension as is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith. Although they had not advertised their impecuniosity, their circumstances were well known. Their talents had been employed with profit to the country in Federal and State politics. Their income was much less than that received by the Chief Justice, and, in addition, they were subjected to demands upon their resources, as all members of Parliament are, from which a Judge is immune. The Chief Justice has not a large number of constituents who think that they are entitled to a portion of his salary. I have never refused in this House to vote for increments to men who were receiving high salaries., I have recognised that there are established standards of what men in certain positions are worth; and if increments were due I have always voted for them, and in consequence have brought down upon myself a good deal of adverse criticism. Some persons think that the salary of the- King&#39;s representative is very large; but, although I would vote for the abolition of the position, I would not, while the position remains, support a proposal to reduce the salary attaching to it. A reduction of salaries will not effect in any way an alteration in our economic system. I, with many others, believe that the whole economic  system should be changed, so that pensions might be granted to all  men and women when they are compelled to retire from work. One could understand a proposal being submitted to pay the old-age and invalid pensioners an allowance sufficient to maintain them. There is no pretence that the small pension now paid to those people will support them; it is recognised to be only an aid. My view is that adequate provision should be made by. the community for the old-age and invalidity of all men and women after their working days are over, because, whether they work with their mind or with their hands, all contribute something to the welfare of the community. It is quite possible that the Chief Justice has been unfortunate in investments - I should not think that that is the case - and the Government may be &#171; of opinion that it is not right that an ex-Chief Justice of the High Court should spend the leisure of his old age without an income sufficient to maintain him in the state to which he has been accustomed. But no such consideration is shown in respect of other people. For instance, old soldiers who have fought for their country, and by reason of that fact have been incapacitated in life earlier than they otherwise would have been, are left to their own resources in their old age. We hear of no proposal to give to them an increase in their pensions. Perhaps they have never had an opportunity to set aside any money for their old age or to keep them in the event of their becoming invalids. It is a well-known fact that 95 per cent, of the community have very little opportunity to save, and the most they can expect is that, with a fair amount of luck, they may possess a home of their own and be independent of the landlord. But no effort has been made to introduce a comprehensive pension scheme for the benefit of. the whole community. With the knowledge I have, I wonder at that omission. If I could think that&#39; this Bill was the forerunner of an extensive system of pensions to all aged and invalid people, I might be inclined to regard it more favourably ; but we know that this proposal stands alone. In my electorate there a&#34;re many people who for a number of years have just managed to exist. Many in&#39; years gone by may have been in comfortable circumstances, and lived  and dressed well. But as they grew older, especially if they were unskilled workers, and their muscular strength was their only industrial asset, they were no longer wanted, and now they are obliged to eke out an existence by taking any job that offers. I have always regretted that our economic system permits of such And bearing them in mind, I cannot conscientiously vote to grant a pension to a gentleman who has been drawing &#163;4,000 per annum for fifteen years, and had received &#163;3,000 per annum in the preceding ten years. I agree as to the need for paying our Judges adequately, in order that the Judiciary may be kept pure. But the salary which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith has been receiving has been high enough to secure that end. Many people are of opinion that a person drawing a large salary ought to save a good deal of money. Some of my constituents think I can save &#163;500 per annum. They say that a man who has been a member of this House for fifteen years, and has not made a competency, must be thriftless, and it is a peculiar fact that those who expect one to save most make the heaviest demands. Surely, if a member of this House is expected to save on an income of &#163;600 per annum, after paying election expenses, and meeting all the other demands that are made upon his resources, how much more should a man&#39; be- expected to save out of an income of &#163;4,000 per annum. Knowing that the Chief Justice has been drawing a large salary for many years, and that he was appointed on the understanding that he would receive no pension, those honorable members who vote for this Bill will be adopting a course that is not justified in the circumstances. Of course, this Bill is a legal method of providing such a pension; but the proposal is not fair to the rest of the community. Whilst I have the highest opinion of the gentleman for whom this pension is proposed, I know there are hundreds of thousands of men and women who have never had an opportunity to save a penny, and who require pensions but do not get them. Before a woman of sixty years of age can obtain a pension of 12s. 6d. a week, we insist that she shall prove that her husband is not earning &#163;2 a week. If he is earning &#163;1 17s. 6d. a week, she can get a pension of only 2s. 6d. a week. Similarly, a man of sixty-five cannot get a pension of 12s. 6d. unless he can prove that he is not earning more than a trifling amount, and has not put by for a rainy day. Under these circumstances, we should not give a pension to the Chief Justice without requiring of him the declaration that he is in an impecunious position, and would not be able to live if he left the Bench. At any rate, he should be asked what his position is, and a pension of &#163;1,750 would be too much, whatever the circumstances. I have no feeling against the Chief Justice, but I think that, while we are niggardly towards those who have never had an opportunity to make any provision for their old age, it is not fair to grant a pension to a man who has always drawn a large salary. </para>

                <para>If I might digress a little, I would ask Ministers to consider in the recess the advisability of amending the War Pensions Act. At the present time, pensions granted to soldiers and their relatives are Eased on the earnings of the soldier at the time he enlisted. Many boys enlisted at the age of eighteen years, when they were either not wage-earners at all, or were getting very, little. They were away at the war for three or four years, and during that time did a man&#39;s work; but when one of them has fallen, the amount of the pension payable to his mother is made to depend on the amount of his earnings at the time of his enlistment. </para>

                        <para>- I am opposed to the payment of pensions to officials and others until the workers, who produce the wealth of the country, toiling in factories and workshops, can obtain more  than a mere pittance in their old age, and are , not forced to go through a humiliating procedure to get it. An old gentleman of seventy, who has resided in the &#34; colonies,&#34; as he calls them, for sixty-three years, a widower, and by trade a carpenter, has written to me to say that he has been refused a pension because he earns more than &#163;58 a year. He has worked as earnestly and thoroughly at his occupation as has the Chief Justice; but contrast the treatment of the two ! The carpenter cannot get a pension of 12s. 6d. a week because he has earned &#163;58 10s. in the last twelve months. The country does not care what may become of him, though if .he drops in the street the police will take him to the hospital, where he can die if he gets there in time. Until the country recognises the worth of its toilers, and provides for the time when they can no longer be usefully employed by placing them above want, I shall not vote for the payment of pensions to officials who have always drawn big salaries. I get many letters of complaint about our pensions law. Recently, a gentleman in my electorate was refused a pension because he happens to have acquired a house. I do not reflect on the public officials who are administering the law; they have to carry out its provisions. At my request, when I forwarded the papers in the ordinary way, the case was reviewed, and the magnificent sum of 6d. per week increase was solemnly given. </para>

                        <para>- The facts are as I have stated. The only point on which I am uncertain, in the absence of my memoranda, is whether he actually lives in the house, but, in any case, I am certain if he does not he is not receiving rent for it. Then, there is the case of. a lady in Broken Hill, who - has an invalid son of about seventeen and a paralyzed husband. The son, who has to be moved about by mechanical means, was in receipt of a small invalid pension, but the amount was regulated by the fact that he had a father living. As I say, the father is now paralyzed, and the lady told me a month ago, when asking me to try to secure a pension for her husband, that unless something was done she would have to disown her child, and hand him over to the State. All who read the newspapers must know of such cases as those cited by the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> the other night; and only a day or two ago we had that awful case in Fitzroy, where a woman had to wheel her dead child, and abandon him under a tree, because she was too poor to bury him. From personal experience, I know how these things hurt, and so does every working man or woman in the country who lives on the borders of starvation. &#39; There is not a worker whose family could exist for a fortnight if the wages were cut off. And how are these people treated when they are old ? They are thrown on the scrap heap - there is no talk of a pension of &#163;33 odd a week for them. All honour to the Chief Justice for obtaining the position he did ; but he was well recompensed with a magnificent salary for any services he rendered to the Commonwealth. It has been pointed out that during the period he occupied the position of Chief Justice of Queensland and the Commonwealth he received in return something like &#163;87,000. In his case it is not desired to take into consideration how much he earned last year, or what he did with the &#163;87,000; and this difference is because of the difference in the social scale. </para>

                        <para>- There is just as much difference in intellect, possibly, as there is between the honorable member  and the Chief Justice. The honorable member reminds me of a gentleman of the other side who spoke to me when I first came into this House as a member. One day, in conversation, he said, &#34; If you want to stay here you will have to keep your opinions to yourself.&#34; When I replied that I had not got here by holding my tongue, he said, &#34; Wait until you have been here a bit longer, and you will realize that if a man has brains enough to get here he could, by the exercise of them, have attained a very much better position outside.&#34; &#34; But,&#34; I said, &#34; if it was my brain capacity that brought me here, how is it that my employer did not take that brain capacity into consideration when I was &#39; rattling the banjo &#39; at Broken Hill, where I did not get anything more because of it?&#34; To this he retorted, &#34;You are a hard case.&#34; It is the same with the honorable member who interjected ; he talks about brain capacity, but he might just as well have directed his question to his present leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> some twenty odd years ago, when that gentleman was walking about the country without a decent suit of clothes to his back. He might then have twitted the present Prime Minister with want of intellect, though now he is willing to follow that gentleman as leader to-day. The workers I have been talking about may have far more brains than either myself, the honorable member for Koo-  yong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best),</inline> or the Chief Justice, but they lack the opportunities to acquire education and so enable themselves to occupy highly-paid and honoured positions in the country, as the Chief Justice has done. If these workers are robbed of these opportunities, they, like the poor carpenter of whom I have spoken, have to stick to whatever occupation they are following, and when they become old they are asked, &#34;Did you earn &#163;58 10s. last year?&#34; If they have earned more than that sum then they are refused the paltry 12s. 6d., though they have helped to pay the Chief Justice&#39;s salary, and, in doing so, if they happen to be miners, have run the risk of falling rocks, pneumonia, lead and other diseases inseparable from their occupation. They may &#34; hew the wood and draw the water &#34; all the days of their, lives unless some happy accident gives them the chance to develop their intellect. If they are given the chance, and succeed in spite of their disadvantages, they are patted on the back&#39;, and told what clever fellows they are; if they fail, it is 12s. 6d. per week or the scrap social heap, not the &#163;33 odd which goes to the successful man. </para>

                <para>For those reasons I am opposed to the Chief Justice, or any other official, receiving a pension of any kind. They are, in my estimation, paid sufficiently well to enable them to practice that thrift which they are always urging on the workers. Does any honorable gentleman who is supporting this measure propose to put the Chief Justice, or any one else to whom they are willing to pay a pension of this kind, through the sort of social &#34;third degree&#34; -that the workers have to face? Do they wish to make the Chief Justice or his family the subject of the same kind of investigation that is being made in&#34; the case of the telephone girls at the present time, when they are asking for an. increase of wages? Do they desire to know, like the gentleman on the Board of the jam factory employees, in Sydney, why a work girl, who was under cross-examination, wore lace on her clothes? Would they ask the Chief Justice&#39;s lady that question ? </para>

This .humiliating procedure is gone through under our arbitration system -when it is a question&#39; of the bare necessities of life, and it is all based on the fact that society does not recognise the people on whom the whole social fabric rests. Because of this, I am irrevocably opposed to giving a pension to anybody until we here, in Australia, set an example by recognising the workers&#39; right, to whom we owe everything - who have made it possible for us, who have escaped from the risks and misery of starvation, to know a little of the joys of life. </para>

All workers, mental or manual, who contribute useful work to society are entitled to at least the necessities of life, and, until these are guaranteed by society, I, for one, will not vote in support of any pension for people who all their lives have enjoyed all the advantages of our social system, and for whom it is now proposed to make life more easy; the more people have, the more is given to them, while the poor devil who does not know where his next feed is coming from, and requires a pension, is asked what he earned last year. If such a man, or his wife, or sister, happens to get a job,. they are put through a humiliating examination as to how much they have paid for their clothing, their tobacco, or their newspapers when they seek decent wages. All this humiliation for the man who creates the wealth of the country, but nothing of the kind for the Chief Justice, or those of his class. This is but the forerunner of other proposals of the same character. If the Chief Justice is entitled to a pension, it will be said that other occupants of the High Court Bench should receive&#39; a pension upon their retirement, and so we are to be saddled with this added burden. </para>

                <para>I referred this afternoon to a gentleman who is on the salaried list of one of our public Departments, and who, in the absence of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is looking after his constituency. There we have yet another instance of the truth of the saying, &#34; That to those who have shall more be given, and the country shall pay.&#34; Honorable members know of these things. No solid reason has been given for the payment of this pension only that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith has a long list of scholarly achievements and that he occupied a high position in the political life of Queensland prior to his elevation to the Bench. I do not claim to be. able to pass judgment on the services he has rendered the Commonwealth, but as the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> has said, he has been well paid - and paid according to the agreed terms of his contract - for the work done by him. Contrast his treatment with that meted out to men and Women in our factories and workshops. There are no pensions for them, when they are no longer able to work. Take again the case of the Broken Hill miner. When his system has run down, or he has broken up, does his employer say to him, &#34; You have worked for me for eight or ten years; you have done good work, and you have been paid the wages that were due, but now that you are no longer able to work I will pay you a pension.&#34; Not at all. If he cannot do his work it is a case of &#34; Up the shaft,&#34; and his job is given to the next man. And so in every calling with the exception Of those in the higher walks of life. The Chief Justice, having obtained the best- that could be- given him. is now told that the Commonwealth will pay him a pension of nearly &#163;34 a week. It is a scandalous outrage on justice. There is no excuse for it; and the working men and women of Australia will justly resent this attempt to further load the country with an unnecessary and unwarranted liability. </para>

                    <para>.- I fail altogether to follow&#39; the arguments of the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> who has just resumed his seat. Our statute-book clearly indicates that the Commonwealth Parliament has at all times been alive to the necessities of the whole community, and has ever been animated by a desire to deal out even-handed justice. The legislation of the Parliament proves that. </para>

                <para>I regret that this Bill has afforded some honorable members an opportunity to cast reflections upon one of the most eminent men who has ever lived in Australia. He has rendered to Australia services which seem to be unappreciated by some honorable members. In order to show the immense responsibility that is cast upon our Judiciary, may I refer honorable members to the Commonwealth Constitution. Under section 51, the Federal Parliament is empowered to make laws covering some thirty-nine subjects which in that section are enumerated. In ordinary colloquial language, the bare statement of the subjects with which we may deal has but a small meaning. Following the example of the United States, the subjects in respect of which we may legislate are merely enumerated in the Constitution, and there is cast upon the High Court the responsibility of determining the full scope and width of our powers to legislate in respect of those subjects. In other words, the Judiciary has the responsibility of clothing the words employed and of defining the ambit of jurisdiction covered in regard to each of such subjects, giving to them their full meaning. The Federal Parliament, for instance, have power to make laws with respect to &#34;defence,&#34; and the luminous judgment on the subject delivered recently by the High Court affords the honorable member for Barrier an opportunity to realize the meaning that may be given by the Court to that one word. The Court held that the one word &#34; defence &#34; used in that section gave Parliament power to legislate with respect to every sphere of activity which could be directly or indirectly associated with the defence of Australia and the Empire. This illustration, which might be extended to the other thirty-eight subjects mentioned in section 51, shows how great is the responsibility cast upon the Commonwealth Judiciary. </para>
                <para>We were singularly fortunate in our selection of a Chief Justice, and in considering this Bill I desire that honorable members, if. possible, shall consider for a moment the value of the services rendered by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith. He is not only an eminent Australian lawyer, but is recognised as an eminent Imperial lawyer, and is a member of the Privy Council.  His  judgments have been able and powerful, and of the most luminous character. They have indicated on his part a breadth of thought and juristic learning of immense value in the guidance of this community. Were it possible for us to fail in securing the highest and most accurate judicial interpretation of our laws, it would be a calamity to the community, the gravity of which could hardly be estimated. It is absolutely necessary that, we should have men of the highest legal acumen and ability in the occupation of our Judiciary, since such immense responsibilities are cast upon them. No one challenges the Chief Justice&#39;s ability. Every one should realize the magnitude of his services, and if we recognise to the full the colossal character of those services, surely we have a right to say that they entitle him to some further acknowledgment, in the form of a pension as provided by this Bill, at the hands of the people of Australia. </para>
                <para>It has been suggested that the Chief Justice has been well paid for his services. I do not agree that such is the case. True, his appointment took the form of a contract, but no one with a full knowledge will venture to say that the services he has rendered have&#39; been adequately rewarded by the salary of &#163;3,500 a year which he has been receiving. </para>

We are at liberty to review the position in the light of the work he has done for us. There is no legal right as between the Commonwealth and Chief Justice under which he could demand a higher salary than he is receiving, or a pension. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. His appointment stands as a legal contract, and he is receiving all that Parliament bargained to give him. To say that, however, is to view the matter from a very rigid stand-point, and to ignore the fact that the services actually rendered have surpassed our highest anticipations at the time of the contract. Surely in his declining years we may review his services, and determine whether it is not reasonable to grant him some further compensation. </para>

                <para>This is, I admit, an act of grace; but the services of the Chief Justice warrant us in awarding him this extra compensation. We admit that he stepped out of the position of Chief Justice of Queensland, which carried with it a salary of &#163;3,500 a year and pension rights, in order to accept the higher position of Chief Justice of the Commonwealth. He saw fit to give up that position and to accept the Chief Justice ship of the Commonwealth, with the same salary attaching to it and without any pension rights. </para>

                        <para>- From the highest sense of duty, and because of the opportunity which his new position would give him for a greater career, and to render greater service to Australia. Those were the animating causes. He was not moved to accept the Chief Justice ship of the Commonwealth because of any paltry, sordid consideration. The one thought animating him was whether in this position he could render greater service to Australia. No one can suggest that he has failed to render that greater service. He has succeeded to the very full. Australia is richer for his work - and richer to a greater degree than we can calculate. If so much is admitted, then it is not an unreasonable act of grace on the part of Parliament to grant this pension to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to give one or two reasons why I shall record my vote against the grant-&#34; ing of a pension to the Chief Justice of our High Court. In the State of Victoria the granting of pensions to public servants was abolished by Parliament in the early eighties, and it was provided that any person entering the State Service and occupying a permanent position in it should take out a life insurance policy, and maintain the premium payments year by year, so that when he reached a certain age he could, draw a lump sum of money from the insurance company. In the early days of the Federal Parliament, when in both Houses there were many eminent men in the political and legal world of Australia there was a great consensus of opinion against the provision in the Judiciary Bill for the payment of pensions to the Justices who would be appointed to the High Court. There was an extended debate upon the matter, but neither House would consent to the provision. It is an undoubted fact that many gentlemen of the legal profession who are elevated to the Bench surrender practices at which they have been earning twice the amount they receive as salary, for the high and honorable positions they occupy as dispensers of justice in out Courts. It only shows that when these positions of honour are open to the legal world, there are &#34;men, eminent in their profession, who are pre-&#39; pared to give up highly remunerative practices in order to occupy positions on the Bench. It is strange that at this late stage we should find before us so many advocates for the granting of a pension to a member of our High Court Bench. We are all anxious to eliminate personal matters in considering this question; but it seems to me that the Ministry could have overcome the difficulty without seeking to place on our statute-book a principle that will form a dangerous precedent, and may land future Parliaments in considerable difficulty when efforts are made to reward the eminent services of other Justices of the High Court Bench. There was no pension attaching to the position of Chief Justice fifteen years ago, when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith accepted the post. Since then he has been drawing a magnificent salary, which should have enabled him to make pro vision for himself, without any necessity arising for the submission of a Bill to Parliament having for its purpose the granting of a pension to him equal to half his present salary. . Are honorable members opposite, who are willing to support this Bill, prepared to apply the same principle throughout the community ? Are they prepared to give a man who has been drawing &#163;150 per annum during his best years a pension of &#163;75 a year in his old age? If a man has been earning &#163;300 in his best years, are honorable members willing to reward him with a pension of &#163;150 per annum so that he may enjoy himself in comfort in his declining years? I do not think so. Yet if they are prepared to give a reward to one man who has done his task faithfully and well, they should be ready to carry the same principle into effect, and reward every citizen according to his ability and the services he has rendered to his country. Otherwise, they are not consistent. I see no reason why our Justices should not have made provision for their own .declining years. Some of them would decline to accept pensions from us, no matter how unanimous we were in our desire to make provision for them. On the other hand, there are others on the Bench who might look forward to receiving them. Many men have died in poor circumstances, but yet, because of their inventive genius, have left rich heritages to humanity. Have we rewarded them ? I remember one man who worried himself into a premature grave through giving his country the benefit of his invention, but nothing was done to help him.  His  wife also went to a premature grave, and his family have had to toil very hard, and overcome&#39; great difficulties. As I am reminded by an honorable member, this country gave no reward to Farrar, whose researches enabled Australia&#39;s wheat production to increase to a wonderful extent, and whose efforts stimulated others to follow up his work until, step by step, a grade of wheat has been produced here that induces one to believe that very soon we shall be able to garner fair harvests with a very small rainfall. One could go through a long list of men whose services to the nation have not been rewarded. </para>

                <para class="block">Have we rewarded men who have discovered rich gold-fields where thousands have found employment&#93; I venture to say that if a proposal came forward in this House to reward such men, it would be ridiculed by the very honorable members who will vote for a pension for the Chief Justice. We have all known men who have died almost in poverty. What is the pension given by the Commonwealth to nien and women who have rendered very valuable service to their country ? We dole out to them the miserable pittance of 12s. 6d. per week. I agree with the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> that we ought to recast our ideas. If this Bill is a beginning, we should set to work in earnest and apply the lessons -we have learnt during the war. It needed the war to make the statesmen of Great Britain realize what inroads the factory system and slum life had made on the population of the Old Country. Sociologists and others have known that in the wealthiest country in the world, with a population -of 40,000,000, no less than 14,000,000 people are living below the poverty line. We require a levelling-up system. All honorable members opposite are prepared- to do is to pick out here and there some distinguished individual, and deal with him with exceptional liberality in his declining years, whilst they make it a struggle for other people to get a dole of 12s. 6d. per week. Honorable members know how hard it is to live on an ordinary wage. If a workman loses a week&#39;s work through illness he is rarely able to make good the loss, especially if he has to keep a family.  His  life is a veritable struggle. If honorable members intend to give pensions to men who have been enjoying large salaries, let them treat persons in other walks of life in the same liberal fashion. I suppose honorable members read the report of the recent trial of a workman who had been detected in stealing certain articles from the workshop in which he was employed. Week after week he had stolen and sold goods to the total value of &#163;13. When he was brought up for trial before the Chief Justice of Victoria <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine)</inline> he pleaded guilty. Asked why he, the head of a family, a man in regular employment, and with a previously clean record, had resorted to stealing, he said - and his statement was corroborated by reliable witnesses - that in order to buy boots for his children he had been tempted to sell certain articles belonging to his employer. The Court was so satisfied of the genuineness of his statement that he was liberated on simply entering into a bend. That proved conclusively that, although the man admitted his guilt, the Court regarded him as a reputable citizen who was fit to resume his place in the world. Does not that indicate a sad state of affairs? In this land of plenty there ought to be no men and women out of work. I have heard some talk of an unemployment allowance; there should be no need for such a thing in a country like Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I warn the &#39; Committee that in granting this pension they are taking a dangerous step. On principle, I could not vote to give a pension of &#163;1,750 to a man who, I admit, has eminently well discharged the onerous and responsible duties that he has been called upon to perform. I know nothing of the antecedents of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith. It may be that he had exceptional educational opportunities in his youth; he certainly had a fine brain, and displayed gifts which we are all delighted to find in any walk of life. But, on principle, and because so many people find it hard to live - because, although they have fought life&#39;s battle until they were sixty-five years of age, they have not been able to save sufficient, to maintain themselves in their old age. and this Parliament has made it difficult for them to get a pittance of 12s. 6d. per week - I am opposed to the granting of this large pension. The time is coming when the people will be educated enough to sweep these unfair distinctions aside, and those who advocate, the continuance of them will not have the remotest chance of finding a place in this Parliament. </para>

                    <para>.- After the very able remarks of the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best),</inline> it seems hardly necessary for me to add anything to this debate. I listened with sympathy to the tale of woe related by the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton).</inline> When we leave this chamber at night the tears almost stream from our eyes at the sight of masses of people, with every appearance of poverty, coming out of the theatres and picture shows. Those people have my sympathy. I regret that this pension proposal does not apply to all the Judges of the High Court. I think it is a pity that the pension of a Judge should be left to the whim of any Parliament or party. If, as honorable members say, men eminent in the legal profession should, out of a sense of duty, make great monetary sacrifices in order to occupy a position on&#39; the Bench, why did honorable members raise their own salaries? Why did they not regard it as an honour and a duty to serve their country at &#163;400 per annum, instead of increasing the salary to &#163;600? </para>

Men who are qualified to take positions on the High Court Bench have ample scope in the practice of their profession, and they make a big monetary sacrifice in accepting a judicial appointment. I do not see why a man should be required to make sacrifices, because he is willing to do his duty. That is not right or reasonable. The Judges of the High Court were appointed at salaries about equal to the income of a second-class barrister in the Criminal Court. The salaries are not high enough, and should be supplemented by pensions, so that the best men may be attracted to the positions. If we do not do that we shall some day see some servile political hack appointed to the Bench. The Judges who receive &#163;3,500 per annum are required to visit all the capital cities in the discharge of their duties, and that entails the maintenance of two homes. To some extent, Judges must live a life of isolation, and they have not the time that an ordinary man has to pay. attention to their financial affairs </para>

In regard to the pathetic pictures of poverty which have been painted by honorable members opposite, I remind the Committee that a man is paid according to the measure of his ability. There are some honest, moral, good-living people who do work which is worth practically nothing to the community. An under-gardener, for instance, may give satisfaction to his employer by adding to the refinement of his surroundings, but the world would be none the poorer without his work. As a supporter of the Government, I urge them to introduce a Bill in the next session to give a pension to all the Judges of the High Court, so that they may be placed on that footing of financial security which is essential to the positions they occupy. </para>

For many years, railway labourers in Victoria were receiving only 6s. 6d. per day, their wages being of late years raised to 7s. per day, and recently to 8s. or 8s. 6d. per day. Of course, there are many cases in which the parents are not dependent on the lads who went away; but had those lads&#34; returned, they would have contributed to the upkeep of the home. Yet I know of cases in which pensions have been refused to parents because their lads were only eighteen or nineteen years of age when they left Australia. </para>

                            <para>- My experience of the Commissioner for Pensions is that he is a fair man, with a human heart, as no doubt all the officials are. These cases have only to be brought under his notice. The father&#39;s letter, in the case to which I have referred, is pretty strong. He says that the treatment he had received was not likely to encourage recruiting. I am glad that, as the result of my action, the family is getting a pension of 14s. per week, or 7s. for each of the sons who were killed. That is &#34;nothing to write home about &#34; - a pension of 7s. for a son who has been killed is certainly not a subject for boasting. We were told the other day that the Bill passed by the Government of which I was a member fixed a maximum; but it is not a question of the maximum in the majority of cases; it is a question of bringing a number of people up to that rate. </para>

                            <para>- But I was asked for a definite case, and I am showing the different treatment that is me&#177;ed out to two different sections of the community. When the Judiciary Bill was before the House in 1903, the present Minister for the Wavy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> in the absence of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McMillan, moved to reduce the proposed salary of the Chief Justice from &#163;3,500 to &#163;2,500, because there was no provision made for a pension. The honorable gentleman was induced to withdraw that amendment, until it had been decided whether there should be pensions for the Judges. Parliament, by twenty-nine votes to twenty, representing a division of two-thirds of the House, decided that there should be no pensions, and the salary was then fixed at &#163;3,500. This Bill is departing from the contract that wa3 then made with the people of Australia. We pay pensions of 5s. to 7s. a week on account of sons killed at the war, whom no power on earth can replace, and this Bill proposes to give the Chief Justice a pension of &#163;1,750 a year. I shall vote against the second reading. </para>

                        <para>.- I am opposed to the Bill, and will vote against the second reading. I take the view that the making of grants to any member of the Public Service, or to any other person, in an arbitrary way out of the public Treasury, is to be deprecated. The policy of granting gratuities or making donations to persons because of their public services, or their alleged public services, without any settled principle to guide those who are responsible for doing so, does not appeal to me. Bearing in mind the question of pensions to the aged and the invalid, I contend that the only ground on which pensions of any kind are justifiable in a civilized and progressive community is to make provision for those exceptional cases of sickness, invalidity, and weakness which cannot be provided for by any just system of distribution of the world&#39;s good things. I say this quite recognising the fact that it may be suggested for a moment that I am giving only half-hearted support to old-age and invalid pensions. I give those pensions a full measure of support, because they represent just those exceptional cases for which any civilized community must make provision, even though the wealth of the community were distributed with ideal fairness. </para>

                    <para>It seems to be assumed that the Chief Justice of the High Court has claims of unanswerable character to recognition in the form of a pension. Apparently it is taken for granted that his public services, taken alone, are of such a character that they should, if I may put it so, in the evening of his days be the subject of some special recognition. I challenge that view at once. I do not admit for a moment that the services of the Chief Justice are necessarily of a specially distinguished character. I admit that the Chief Justice is, and has been for many years an eminent lawyer, who, by his training, and by his capacity, was likely to make a success of his work, and, probably, to amass a fortune out of his earnings. But I do not admit for a moment that, as a citizen of the country promoting the best interest of the community, his work has been such as to recommend any special or, at all events, any monetary recognition. The Chief Justice came into his office from the political arena. </para>

                            <para>-I heard that chapter of the political history of Queensland from the honorable member for Brisbane, and there may be something in it; but I am not at present concerned with that aspect of the case. I am not going to attribute any unworthy conduct to the Chief Justice, nor am I going to. attribute anything but the highest motives to him in the discharge of his public duties as Chief Justice. But I venture to say that, coming to his office out of the arena of politics, he brought a cast of mind to bear there which was certainly a keen and logical mind, but which, so far from breathing life, as the Minister has said, into the dry bones of the Constitution, rather tended to dissect and analyze those bones than to vivify them with any new life whatever. When I say that, I am not for a moment, as a humble member of the lower grade of the profession, putting alone my own view of his work. I am holding up, in comparison with his public services, the work done by other eminent men on the High Court Bench. I take courage to say, with the knowledge we have of their work, and the interpretation that they have fearlessly given to the Constitution, and to constitutional points of law brought before them for their decision, that there are men on the High Court Bench to-day - and we are likely to have other men to succeed the Chief Justice - who will follow the pattern of the great Chief Justice of the United States, and will breathe into this Australian Constitution, whether amended or not, that humanizing interpretation which could never be drawn from the decisions of the academic mind of the present Chief Justice of the High Court. </para>

                    <para>A somewhat amusing and painful suggestion has been made by, I think, the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd),</inline> that a Judge, although eminent in law, may possibly have such meagre business capacity as to fail, though drawing a large salary, to make adequate provision in his life for his later years. If it is a fact that the Judges of the High Court bring to bear* such a small measure of worldliness into their work, and are so equipped mentally that they are to be regarded as deficient in making adequate, reasonable, and lawful provision for themselves and their families, I think it is a very disquieting disclosure as to the calibre of the High Court Bench. </para>
                    <para>The Minister is making a personal matter of this, although honorable members, whom I have heard speak, are agreed that it should be regarded rather as a matter of principle, in which invidious distinctions should not be drawn between the various holders of this high office.

                            <para>- Very much so. But whatever may have been the performances of the present Chief Justice, at school, in the University, at the Bar, or in politics, he has up to the present been able to say that, whatever he has won he has won by his own effort and his own ability; and he has not been behoven to the State for any special gratuity to make up, as is suggested by some honorable members, for his deficiency in business acumen. I remind the House, though probably they have been reminded already, that when the Chief Justice renounced the position of honour and fairly substantial emolument which he held in Queensland to become the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, he enjoyed all the kudos, and adopted all the praise, which came to him by reason of the fact that he was giving up a position which would have entitled him later on to a pension. I venture to suggest that it is unworthy to ask the Chief Justice, and it is unworthy of the Chief Justice, in the language of the Bill, to &#34; demand &#34; a pension - because, curiously enough, that is the verbiage adopted - in view of the contract he then made with the people of Australia, the terms on which he was appointed, and the fact that lie enjoyed all the honour and distinction of having made some monetary sacrifice in connexion with the acceptance of the position. It is pointed out, of course, that in many of the transferred offices, the persons transferred carried with them their pension rights. That. is true; but I think the general tendency of Australian legislation for many years past has been to abolish the pension system altogether. We know that for many years - I should say nearly thirty - the system has been abolished in Victoria. The system has ceased to be acceptable to the people of this State, and the general tendency is to abolish the pension system, for public service. That being so, the claim that in 1918 the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth acquires any special right to a pension by reason of his being a transferred officer falls entirely to the ground, not only on its merits, but upon a reference to the terms on which he accepted the position.  <inline font-style="italic">*.c- &#39;v</inline></para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falkiner)</inline> adopts a principle that we should be prepared to hold out this special  inducement to members of the Bar to become Judges, otherwise we shall fill the offices of our highest judicial tribunal with &#34;second-raters.&#34; If a man who is earning at the BaT more than &#163;3,000 per&#39; annum is still so animated by the greed and lust of gold, that he cannot be persuaded to give up his additional financial gain in order to accept the position of a -Judge with a salary of &#163;3,000 a year, together with all the honour, distinction, and dignity attaching to the office, that -fact discloses him to be a person whom it is well to keep off the Supreme Court benches. That is a complete answer to the honorable member&#39;s contention. There is, moreover, a counter-argument, and it is this: that men who are earning at the Bar up to &#163;3,500 per annum are exceedingly hard worked. No man can earn such an income without working very hard. I have in mind the case of a barrister who was earning a very large income, but was working so hard that his health threatened to break down. &#34;When an opportunity presented itself of taking the more moderate emolument attaching to the position of a Supreme Court Judge, together with the additional attractions to which I have referred, he had no hesitation in moving up to the Bench. I do not believe that the absence of a pension will prevent our having the services of the very best man at the Bar. I should be sorry to think that men of high standing at the Bar were of such a cast of mind that they would decline to make a financial sacrifice in order to go on the Bench. The number of even - eminent lawyers who are making incomes equal to the salary received by our Chief Justice is very few. The number, I think, is often exaggerated. I have no doubt whatever that their services could be obtained for the Judiciary in return . for the emolument offered. At a time like this, when the whole of the efforts and genius of this Parliament should be directed- </para>

It does not establish a principle; it is not offered by way of principle. This pension is offered as a gratuity to a public servant who, having, perhaps, treated the State well, as far as he could, has been well treated by the State, and who, to my mind, has not anything like as strong a claim upon the special beneficence of this country as have thousands of others who could be named, but whose claims are not considered in the &#34;Bill before the House or any other Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - A point to which I should like to draw attention is that this Bill does not provide that the Chief Justice shall spend his pension in Australia. In the early days of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Andrew</inline> Clarke, after about four and a half years&#39; public service, and the Right Honorable C. E. Childers, after something like three and a half years&#39; work in this State, were granted a pension; and they lived thereafter for close upon half a century in England. They continued during that time to draw pensions from a people whom they never benefited, but upon whom they fastened like leeches. These pensions, amounting to about &#163;800 per annum in the one case, and to some &#163;600 in the other, were granted to them because it was thought they had risked their chance of advancement in accepting high posts in the then young Colony of Victoria. To show how absurd was the reason given for their payment, I might mention that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Childers</inline> rose to the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Gladstone Government. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Let us analyze the figures relating to this pension. During twenty-five years on the Bench, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith has received about &#163;82,000. In round figures, he has received &#163;70 a week, in addition to his share of the &#163;5,000 per annum divided amongst the Judges to cover expenses. I do not know whether the &#163;4 4s. per day to which they are entitled by way of travelling expenses is included in that amount. By the terms of this very measure, the Chief Justice becomes an old-age pensioner; but he will draw as much as fifty-three pensioners under our Old-age Pensions Act receive. I resent that. All men when they have reached a certain age, and have&#39; become too old to work, should receive the same rate of pension. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has referred to the pitiful case of the mother of four sons who went away to fight for the Chief Justice, for me, and for every other citizen of Australia. One of these boys paid the supreme sacrifice, and the mother was granted a war pension of 5s. per week. The pension of the Chief Justice is equal to the pension received in 134 such cases, and equal to sixty-seven war pensions of 10s. per week. Will any one say that what this man has done is equal to the services that have been rendered by our men at the Front. Then, again, under our War Pensions Act differential treatment is meted out to the mother who has been deserted by the man who should have cared for her. It was not the intention of Parliament when the War Pensions Bill was passed that there should be any such  differentiation, but it exists to-day. Then, again, in determining what rate of pension shall be paid to the mother of a young man who has been killed at the Front, the authorities take into account the amount that the deceased contributed to his home for twelve months prior to enlistment. Many of these soldiers of ours enlisted when they were only eighteen years of age, and that is very often the most expensive time of a boy&#39;s life. As a rule, boys of from eighteen to twenty-one years of age can take very little into their homes, but when they reach the age of twenty-five years they are able to give substantial help to their people. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I am proud to think that the laws of Australia no longer contain what was an impertinent insult to thousands of innocent children. Thanks to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher and those who supported his Government, the word &#34; illegitimate &#34; has been erased from all our Commonwealth laws: It is an infamy that the amount to be .paid as a war pension to a mother or father of a youth killed at the Front should be based upon the amount he was able to contribute to her support for the twelve months before he enlisted. If the assistance to the home be made a basis of computation, why should it not be made at the time of the death of the brave soldier ? </para>

                    <para>I have no personal animus towards the Chief justice. . I. have, if anything, a kindly feeling for him. I had one experience of his Court, and three afternoons spent there cost me something like &#163;200. The cost would have been greater but for the generosity of the legal men in charge of my case. I have never heard a poor man bless the name of the Chief Justice or declare himself to be thankful for his help. Is he &#60;a poor man ? Then my pocket is at his disposal. If he has speculated and been comparatively ruined, I am willing to give equally with any man on the other side of the chamber; but it is discreditable to him if he has had anything to do with &#39; this sending round of the cap asking for the people&#39;s money. It is the people, those who have no say in the matter, who have to pay. I cannot conceive that the man who had the honour of translating Dante&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Inferno</inline> into English verse similar to the original would stoop to accept this pension. At any meetings I shall address in the near future I shall move - </para>
                    <para>That it is disgraceful, dishonorable, and foolish on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith to accept this pension. </para>
                    <para class="block">We_have paid him &#163;70 per week, with many extras, for putting in five hours&#39; work five days a week, and sometimes he has had five months&#39; holiday in the year. There are fathers of families who are trying to feed their children and clothe them in these expensive times who are not .receiving per week, even what he draws per day as travelling allowance, namely, &#163;4 4s. Would they not look forward with pleasure to the receipt of even one day&#39;s wages as a pension when they get old and weary. I have sounded a warning note. If <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith dares to leave this country drawing this pension to spend it outside Australia he will not be an honorable man. _ Any member of this House who goes away has to obtain leave, and if he wishes to go away from Australia, let him obtain leave from the people who pay him. I resent the granting of this pension. When we ask for 2s. 6d. extra per week for those who will never draw &#163;4 4s. a week in all their lives, the Treasurer cannot grant it. When we ask that the little children of the mon who have lost their lives at the Front, or in dangerous trades and callings that sometimes take a greater toll of life than does warfare, should be allowed a little more than 3s. 6d. per week, they cannot get it. At this time, when the war has demonstrated to us the value of human life, this Government will make partial provision for soldiers&#39; babies to the number of five in a family, hut the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth arc left without a penny piece in the shape of assistance. Go &#39;to the homes for neglected children, and ask some of the angel women connected with them how much a child costs, even in its earliest years, even when its only food is milk, and then judge how far the pittance of 3s. 6d. per child will go. I shall vote against the Bill, and if I can get meetings to support in I shall ask them to resolve that any man who has earned the salary that Sr Samuel Griffith has earned is not a real Australian or a real human being if he accepts a pension when those who have to apply for an old-age pension can only draw 12s. 6d. per week with which to keep life and soul together. </para>
