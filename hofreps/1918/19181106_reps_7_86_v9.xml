                            <para>- I believe that all steps necessary to prevent the introduction of Spanish influenza into Australia have already been taken by the quarantine authorities. A number of persons are now undergoing the inconveniences of quarantine, and the Government went so far as to arrest two persons who came from New Zealand surreptitiously and evaded the quarantine regulations. One of these was arrested in Sydney, and the other in Melbourne, and 'both have been sent into quarantine. So far as I am aware, no steps have been left taken to prevent the introduction of this disease from New Zealand'. </para>

In the casual moments that we have to devote to the reading of newspapers nowadays, the discovery of gross misstatements of fact is not infrequent. I shall read the article, because the newspaper referred to in recent months has displayed considerable acumen in presenting matters of important public concern. I shall see what foundation there is for the statement. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is aware, that the Commonwealth Government decided some time ago to ask each of the four wheat-growing States interested! in the Pool to appoint one representative to the Central Board. The representation when arranged will, I think, give considerable satisfaction. The Minister in charge of the matter says that since the Advisory Boards are subject to the Central Board the duplicate representation suggested by the honorable member might lead, not <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> satisfaction, but to confusion. That is his impression, and I would .prefer to wait until the State representation which we are now inviting is effected, to see how far it necessitates any addition such as the honorable member suggests. </para>

In view' of what is known as the doctors' strike, and the fact that people in the back-blocks are left practically without medical advice, will  the Minister direct his officers to immediately publish in the newspapers, and by means of posters on the railway stations and other public buildings, simple instructions as to what to do ? </para>

                <para class="block">War Loan may now be made. The figures are- </para>
                <para>There were 143,748 subscribers to the Sixth War Loan, which  reached  Â£42,851,960-. The average subscription to the Sixth War Loan amounted to Â£29S, and to the Seventh War Loan Â£181. The subscribers to the Sixth War Loan numbered 1 in 34 of the population; to the Seventh War Loan 1 in 20. The great success of the Seventh War Loan may, in general, be ascribed to the determination of the people to carry on the war, but the particular factors which brought about a better result than before may be set down as better organization and publicity, and the introduction to Parliament of the Loan Subscriptions Bill. On this occasion, for the first time, the Treasury had the assistance of very active Loan Committees throughout the length and breadth of Australia. To all the workers the Government cordially extends its thanks, and trusts that when the time comes for raising another loan their valuable ' services may again be available. To the banks also thanks are due. They worked very hard indeed to obtain subscriptions under what Ls known as the special advances system, and succeeded in obtaining assisted subscriptions of the very large amount of Â£21,892,122. The aid of the press must also he gratefully acknowledged. In the opinion of those competent to judge, the loan would not have been successfully raised had not the minimum public duty of citizens been set before them in the Bill referred to, and the Go,vernment believes it is necessary to place the Bill upon the statute-book. It is pleasing to record that the interest on this, the largest loan ever raised in Australia, is subject to taxation. That fact disposes, once for all, of any suggestion that freedom from taxation must be given to attract money for war purposes. Another satisfactory feature of the loan is that the number of subscribers is much larger than ever before. The war loan has thus been distributed widely throughout all classes of the community. </para>

                        <para>- Statements have been made by the military police that their hours of duty are sometimes from 8 a.m. till 11 p.m., and that meat is no longer served with their last meal, which they have at 4.30 p.m. Their evening meal consists of only tea, bread, and jam, although they are kept on duty till 11 p.m. I ask the Assistant Minister for Defence why Captain Graham has ordered that change in the evening meal; and, also, why he said to a man, named A. C. Fisher, who had obtained leave for forty-eight hours to attend an examination for the Railway Department, that he was a disgrace and a dishonour to the service, although tha man has a good discharge after 505 days' service? Is it the intention of the Department to starve the military police, and thus render them unable to do their duty? </para>

                        <para>As regards the two main bases now under construction, the Naval Board know exactly what their objective is. Messrs. Goode, Matthews, Fitzmaurice, and Wilson, of London, furnished a complete report and lay-out plans of Henderson Naval Base, which the Naval Board adopted on 2nd February, 1915. Complete lay-out plans of Flinders Naval Base were approved on 20th February, 1914. The ultimate object of Naval Base construction is to provide an establishment where the seagoing fleet can in security be refitted and repaired,  coaled,  victualled, stored, &amp;c, and where the personnel can be trained, exercised, and. accommodated when not actually at sea. A base may contain all or part of these facilities. </para>

                        <para>- I am advised by the Minister for Trade and Customs that the industry of mica production and manufacture in Australia is one which is considered to be deserving of support, and which, there is no doubt, can be developed into a permanent and prosperous business. The matter has been the subject of careful inquiry and consideration, but it does not appear that at the present time any Government assistance is called for, as the investigation of local deposits with a view to supplying mica to the British Government is at the present time being vigorously conducted by certain parties without any assistance from the Government, the market price being a sufficient inducement. The question as to the placing of an import duty on its manufactures has been noted for consideration when the Tariff is being further dealt with by Parliament. </para>

                        <para>With reference to his reply, on the 18th October, 1018, to the honorable member for Echuca, relative to his desire for time to discuss the question of certain chaplains on troopships, that the Minister "did not think any good would be served in discussing the matter as suggested," is the Acting Prime Minister aware that the file does not disclose any such attitude on his colleague's part, but that on the 18th October he informed the Acting Prime Minister by minute prepared for the information of the House that he had "no objection to such opportunity being given " if the Acting Prime Minister saw fit. 1 have looked through the papers relating to this matter, and find that the Minister for Defence expressed no objection to such an opportunity as the honorable member for Echuca desired being given if the Acting Prime Minister saw fit. In deciding the form of the answer to be given to the original question of the honorable member for Echuca, I did not make this clear, but as I held the view that no good purpose would be served in discussing the matter as suggested I expressed that plainly. I regret if the form of the answer caused the honorable member to believe that the Minister for Defence held similar views to myself with regard to the procedure in this House. </para>

                    <para>Effective .preference is already afforded returned soldiers in connexion with appointments to the Commonwealth Service. On 26,tl June, 1915, an instruction was issued that until six months after the termination of tuc war, except in special cases approved by the Prime Minister, positions in the Commonwealth Public Service were not to be tilled by permanent appointments of persons of military age. This was done to safeguard the interests of those who enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. .Returned soldiers have merely to pass the prescribed examination, and they are appointed to the Service, irrespective of the fact that persons who arc not returned soldiers may have secured higher marks. Special examinations have been held for appointment as clerk, open only to returned soldiers. Power is given to the Public Service Commissioner to appoint returned soldiers who have qualified by passing the prescribed examination to any particular class or subdivision of a class of the clerical division, and under this provision a higher commencing rate of pay has been fixed for returned soldiers appointed to the clerical, division. In connexion with the appointment of returned soldiers who pass the prescribed examination, such persons are regarded as senior to all persons who have not served with the Expeditionary Forces appointed as the result of the first examination held after the date of enlistment. The age limit for candidates for the clerical division has been extended from twenty-five years to fifty years in the case of returned soldiers. Provision has also been made for returned soldiers to be appointed to the Service though suffering from physical defects, so long as they are able to perform efficiently their duties. In connexion with temporary employment, returned soldiers have preference, married men receiving first preference. Returned soldiers replace  eligibles.  In regard to casuals, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> persons employed for brief terms, returned soldiers receive first preference, and are to replace  eligibles  wherever possible. Provision has been made whereby the passing by returned soldiers of certain prescribed examinations other than the Commonwealth Public Service examination constitutes eligibility for appointment. </para>

                            <para>In May, 1915, a report was received by the Department indicating that certain irregularities existed in regard to the work being carried out. After investigation, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> referred the matter to the Auditor-General for inquiry. The Auditor-General's inquiries did not reveal any irregularities on the part of Cone and Company, but the Minister decided that the contract between the Department and Messrs. Cone and Company, viz., 10 per cent, commission on cost of labour and material, was not sumciently definite, <inline font-style="italic">e.g.,</inline> differences with contractors had arisen over the interpretation of the meaning of " cost " of material, &amp;C.

Accordingly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen,</inline> Assistant Minister, arranged a now contract with Cone and Company, which superseded the original arrangement of 10 per cent, commission, and had retrospective effect from 1st February, 1915, thus covering all work done by Cone and Company prior to date of new contract, viz., 4th August, 1915. The terms of this second contract are summarized as follow: - " 1. That the contractors be reimbursed the actual amounts paid for day labour, plus 10 per cent, thereon. 2. That hardwood timber be purchased at the prices in the published  lists of the Associated Timber Merchants, less 10 per cent. 3. That all other timber be secured at most favorable prices, plus 5 per cent, on amounts paid. 4. That all other stores be obtained at cost price, plus 5 per cent., less any discount allowed by vendor. 6. That in respect of all sub-contracts, the actual cost be charged, plus 5 per cent, for supervision, subject to the Minister being satisfied that the' prices charged by the sub-contractor are fair and reasonable, and that such work could not be carried out by the original contractors. 0.

Peacock and Smith. As the result of the investigations the Minister instructed the Auditor-General to take such action under the War Precautions Act as waa thought necessary. The Auditor-General reported the result of his examination on 6th December, 1915, and on 13th December, 1915, the Assistant Minister  (Hon. J. A. Jensen)  directed that the report be referred to the Crown Law Department for consideration as to action to be' taken against Peacock and Smith. On 11th January, 1916, the Attorney-General  (Hon. W.

                        <para>- On Thursday last the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> asked me a question relative to preventing the manufacture of starch from rice. After consideration, I now desire to inform the honorable member that maize and rice are both valuable foods, and maize probably more so than rice. For laundry purposes it is considered that rice starch is much to be preferred to that manufactured from maize, and it is on this account that the demand for it greatly exceeds that made from the latter product. This is emphasized by the fact that there are five rice and only one maize starch manufacturers in Australia. </para>

                        <para>I wish to ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence whether he regards with complacency the fact that a mother of a soldier killed in action is, in one case of which I know, absolutely destitute because, since her son was born out of wedlock, she is not entitled to receive a pension. This woman is fifty-nine years of age - just too young to obtain an old-age pension, and too old to work. Will the Minister consider the advisableness of issuing an amended regulation to permit of mothers of soldiers killed in action, and who were born out of wedlock, receiving a pension like other mothers who have lost their sons? </para>

                        <para>The mother of a soldier born out of wedlock is entitled to a war pension (in the event of the death of the soldier) providing she was dependent either wholly or in part on the soldier during the twelve months prior to enlistment. Such pensions are continued indefinitely if the pensioner is considered to be unable to earn a livelihood. If such a mother was not dependent on the soldier prior to enlistment, no pension is payable. The Act provides that pensions may be granted to the parents of a deceased soldier who, although not dependent on him prior to his enlistment, are at any time without adequate means; but the Crown Solicitor is of opinion that the provision does not extend to the mother of a son born out of wedlock. In the case referred to, if the woman is unable to work, it is suggested that she should be advised to apply for an invalid pension. </para>

                        <para>- On Friday last the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> asked a question with reference to the dismissal of disabled soldiers. In reply, I beg to inform him that it is regretted that there are no suitable vacancies in the Department in which these men can be placed. As previously indicated, owing to the general reduction of the district guard only the most effective men can be employed, and other returned soldiers with the necessary qualifications for any vacancies are available. The matter of finding employment for these men is one for the Repatriation Department, to whom it is suggested the men should apply if in need of assistance in this direction. The Defence Department is bringing the cases referred to under the notice of the Repatriation Department. </para>

                    <para>.- I have opposed this taxation from the beginning, and shall, therefore, do my best to reduce it as much as possible. We give in our income tax legislation - and some, if not all, of the States do the same - an exemption in respect of children under the age of sixteen years, and in our war pensions legislation we make provision for the payment of allowances in respect of children up to the age of sixteen years. Why, then, should we limit the exemption from the entertainments tax to children under the <inline font-style="italic">ase</inline> of twelve years? </para>

It will give parents who visit our cities or large provincial towns on a holiday an opportunity to take their children to a picture show, or some such place of amusement, without having to pay this additional tax. This, I think, will appeal to the Acting Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>- My object is to extend the concession which the Government propose in the measure as it has come from' another place. Although I opposed this additional taxation on entertainments, I am at the same time prepared to assist as far as possible in making it acceptable to those who have large families. On public holidays in nearly every part of Australia, parents take their little ones either to the seaside, or, if they reside in country districts, to the nearest town, for an outing, and, to give them a treat, allow them to visit a picture show. Public holidays, in this respect, are more important than Saturdays. </para>

                        <para>- The effect which my amendment would have on the revenue earning provisions of this Bill would be infinitesimal. I submit it, not with the object of preventing the speedy passing of the clause now before us, but merely to extend the concession which the Government had in their minds when they agreed to amend this Bill in another place. It is only fair to give some consideration to families. A working man with five or six children has to spend more than one day's earnings in order to give them a holiday; and surely a man who gives his children an outing on a public holiday should be allowed to take them to a picture show without being called upon to pay this additional tax. </para>

                        <para>- It will bring this measure into conformity with other measures already on the statute-book. Even under our Income Tax Act we grant an exemption in consideration of. children up to the age of sixteen, but this Bill, as it stands, proposes to penalize them from the age of twelve. The amount of revenue involved is very small, and I think the Treasurer might very well accept the amendment. The honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> must not forget that the repeal of the bachelors' tax has been announced; and yet this Bill would impose a penalty on people who are doing their duty to the country by bringing children into the world . </para>

                    <para>.- I do not like the taxing of 3d. tickets, and only the necessity for revenue induces me to follow the Treasurer. I cannot see any analogy in the argument of the honorable member who has submitted this amendment. Children are supposed to be supported by their parents until they are sixteen years of age, and up to then are somewhat of a burden; and in this regard some consideration is shown to mothers whose husbands are at the war, and who have to support children. If there were two rates of charges for admission, the possibility is that the management of  a  picture show would refuse to admit for 3d. any children over twelve years of age. </para>

                    <para>.- I am surprised at the honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> opposing a simple amendment like this. If the honorable member had a family to support I might understand his attitude; and, really, I think this is a question which can only be dealt with by family men. As a rule, children do not go to work until they are over sixteen years of age, and it is quite possible that a father with a growing family might find this tax quite burdensome. It is a paltry means of raising revenue in a wealthy country like Australia. I trust the Government will not deal with this as a party question, but will allow their supporters freedom of action. The honorable member for Wilmot has told us that he does not desire to have this tax imposed, but is prepared to follow the Treasurer. </para>

                    <para>.- A common-sense way of meeting the difficulty has been pointed out to me by the manager of Hoyt's, the largest picture show in Melbourne, if not in Australia, and, if adopted, would, in his opinion, bring in additional revenue. It is that the tax should start at1d. on the 6d. ticket, and be increased by1d. for every additional 6d. in the charge for admission. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; the manager of Hoyt's comes from England. This would wipe out the anomaly which would place the heaviest burden on those least able to bear it. All the theatres have increased their charges of admission since the outbreak of war, and are reputed to be making large profits, but this Bill will allow theatre proprietors to escape, and the purchasers of the higher -priced tickets will be taxed only to the extent of 8Â½ per cent, as compared with the tax of 331/3 per cent, on 3d. tickets. I feel sure that if the Treasurer were agreeable the House would indorse an equitable system such as I have suggested. If the Treasurer would agree to that amendment it would remove much of the ground for our complaint that the purchasers of the cheaper tickets are being taxed disproportionately. </para>

            <para class="block">In my remarks, in introducing the increase of the income tax, I showed that the war expenditure payable out of revenue had increased rapidly. That is also the reason for proposing this additional land tax. Land was originally taxed by the Commonwealth in November, 1910. In December, 1914, owing to the need for additional revenue arising out of the war, the rates were increased. It was not a <inline font-style="italic">pro</inline><inline font-style="italic">rata</inline> increase, and the exact effect of the alterations on individual taxpayers cannot be stated, but it is estimated by the Taxation Office that the increase varied from 30 to 50 per cent. The proposal now is to further increase the land tax by 20 per cent, on the existing rates. It will be interesting, perhaps, to note the burdens which will be borne by certain classes of landholders if this additional impost is assented to by Parliament.  I have asked the Taxation Commissioner to furnish me with four typical examples, without giving the names of the -taxpayers, from a land-holder of moderate size to a very wealthy land-holder, in order to show what each will have to pay to the State and Federal authorities in land and income taxation. These examples will illustrate the burden which wealth will carry for this year when the Budget proposals are fully effective - </para>

I believe that honorable members may best inform their minds as to the proposed taxation by studying classified information, thus saving themselves a good deal of trouble and search, and for their information I have prepared certain other classified cases to show what State and Commonwealth land  taxation amount to in different portions of the Commonwealth on four different classes of holdings - </para>

Honorable members who are familiar with the history of the Commonwealth land tax and the considerations which induced this Parliament to impose it over the whole of Australia need not have their minds refreshed as to the objectives of the tax. I am not dealing with the subject as a land taxer, although I am, and always have been, a land taxer of a progressive kind, but as the financial Minister responsible for recommending to the Commonwealth measures that will protect the credit of the country, and give us sufficient revenue to discharge our liabilities for this year. In view of the circumstances of the past four years, I feel sure that this Parliament can confidently and fairly ask the land-holder, who is the subject of our taxation, to bear an additional burden, and thus, out of his stored results represented by' his landed assets, assist the Treasury in the time of its greatest stress. In that spirit I recommend the resolution to the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- What I have in mind  principally is the position of the Chief Electoral Officer, who is under the control of the Minister and should be independent of him, and subject only to the control of Parliament. I am not permitted to go into that matter now, but honorable members who reflect on what has happened during the last two or three elections will call to mind very grave and unfair actions on the ,part of Ministers controlling the Chief Electoral Officer. In my opinion, that officer should be quite independent of any member of Parliament, and if it should be necessary to call his conduct into question the Government should only do so before the House. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to discuss the merits of the proposal now, but I shall do so when the Bill is under consideration. For the present it is sufficient for me to point out that the discussion  upon  it might reasonably take up a very great portion of the eighteen hours that the Minister proposes to allow for the consideration of the whole of the Bill. Honorable members on this side have no desire to delay the measure unnecessarily. Because of the manner in which, the Government have brought forward their business, we have only a few days before the recess in which to deal with highly important matters, and I do not wish to offer needless opposition or take up unnecessary time in dealing with any measure, but I wish to make my protest as briefly and as strongly as I can against the step the Government have taken. We on this side are prepared to concede that electoral reform is an urgent matter,  but we object to being allowed only until 3 o'clock on Friday afternoon to discuss the Electoral Bill in Committee. </para>

                        <para>- No ; and I do not believe in the electoral system in force. Some honorable members who have been so persistent in referring to minority representation first graced the House by means of minority votes. Evidently it is not the desire of the party opposite to give honorable members an opportunity to discuss the advantages or disadvantages of the new system proposed by the present Administration. There is a considerable difference of opinion about electoral systems. In New South Wales the National party are about equally divided upon the subject. </para>

                        <para>- That is because the honorable member has refrained from speaking. Had he done so, no doubt we would have been in a far better position to understand the working of the proposed reform. It is lack of material from honorable members opposite which has led us to allow our imaginations to run riot as to the benefits that this alteration may confer. But it matters very little what honorable members on this side say, either about the limitation of the debate, or about the proposed new method of electing members. The time is to be fixed, and we are to be prevented from discussing the Bill adequately. The measure is to be railroaded through in order to get it out of the way in time for any by-election that may occur in the near future. The only hope that honorable members on this side have is that gentlemen in another place may exercise their brains in a better fashion, and give opportunity for the measure to be more thoroughly digested before it is rushed through its final stages. Then we may not have the spectacle of this Parliament sitting for months at a time dealing with comparatively trivial matters, while such an important matter as the mode of electing Parliament is to be guillotined through the House in order that discussion may be stifled at the most important stage, namely, while the Bill is in Committee. Most honorable members have said that the measure is essentially one for Committee discussion, and for that reason they have refrained from discussing the electoral law as a whole. They were looking forward to having ample opportunity for discussing details when the measure reached the Committee stage, but now the Government have come down with their guillotine proposal in order to cut short the discussion in the Committee stage*. I register my protest against the action of the Government in .pretending to give an opportunity to discuss the Bill, and yet actually railroading it through without proper discussion being possible. </para>

                    <para>- There are several that might, and more that ought to, take place. There might be a fair opportunity for the discussion of the measure between now and Friday next, were the members of the Government to refrain from introducing irrelevant matters with a view to taking up time, but when the limits of a discussion of this kind are fixed, it is easy for a strong Government party to deprive an Opposition of its opportunity to place its side of the case, and at present we are few and they -are many. It would not be the first time that such a thing had been done in this House. There are many clauses the consideration of which should occupy a considerable time. I would not be permitted to refer bo them in detail, even if my speech were not limited to ten minutes; but I may refer to one - that providing for preferential voting. There are only two political parties in Australia. Any new man coming into this House, whether he be a supporter of the cold-water section of the community, of the strong-liquor section, a Free Trader, or anything else, must sit either behind the Government or on these benches. His Majesty's Opposition is regarded by many as a useful parliamentary institution; and we, being so few, should be given an opportunity to consider fairly, clause by clause, a Bill dealing with the methods of parliamentary election. Although the measure, before its introduction, was carefully considered by Ministers, aided by the electoral officials, notice has already been given of a large number of amendments. </para>

                        <para>- If this motion be carried, I shall take no further interest in the measure, because we are not being given a square deal. The Minister says that the amendments of which notice has been given affect merely matters of detail, but he knows that sometimes one - amendment necessitates, perhaps, a dozen - others. We should have time to consider the measure effectively. It is a Bill of the utmost importance to all parties, because it provides for the method of electing parliamentary candidates. Although, by the garrotting system, the Government can force through Parliament anything that it thinks may suit it, I would remind Ministers that accidents have happened, and this party may regain the position which it lost through the machinations of certain individuals. The Acting Prime Minister, in fixing a time for the consideration of the measure, has adopted the method of a thug. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw it, and apologize for having used it, though I cannot see why it should be unparliamentary, if the word ' ' guillotine ' ' is not. I make no charge against the Acting Prime Minister personally, and would apologize twice over if I thought that my remark was considered to have a personal application. If we had a fair opportunity for the consideration of the Bill between now and Friday next without the intervention of Government supporters, the arrangement proposed would suit us; but if that is not promised, we shall have to leave things as they are, although there is much in the measure that we should like to alter. May 1 add, not as a threat, but as a warning, that the time of this party may come again ? </para>

                        <para>- As a matter of fact, I think this is the correct course to follow. When a Bill as a whole is in Committee, I do not believe in withdrawing it and bringing in another Bill for a specific purpose. The amendments I propose will make the policy of the Bill immediately effective in respect to such parts of it as should be brought into operation at once. There are parts - such, for instance, as those relating to the postal vote - which could not immediately be made operative. Applications for postal ballot-papers would have to take place after the nominations were out, and papers would have to be distributed all over the Commonwealth to facilitate voting. The only proper, honest, and straightforward course is to go on with this Bill as it is, and to do what I propose, which has often been done in connexion with certain Acts. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot deal with everything on the spur of the moment; but in some Acts there are provisions, applicable to exceptional circumstances, which are to be brought into force before others. In this case, I wish to have that part of the Bill which ought to be brought into force at once - I refer to the preferential voting provisions - made immediately operative. That can be done without inconvenience; but it would be unfair to the Department, and, incidentally, to the electors, to attempt, on paper, to bring into force at once parts which, in actual practice, could not be immediately brought into operation. </para>

                        <para>.- On one other occasion only have we had amendments to a Bill brought down in typewritten form, and not circulated among honorable members. That was in connexion with the War-time Profits Bill, certain provisions of which were objected to at a meeting of the Ministerial party upstairs, and Ministers were instructed to see that they were amended by Parliament. I am confident that the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> is. utterly ashamed of the position he occupies at the present moment. From the inception of this Parliament, he has been noted as a firm believer in straight dealing, and as a Minister he has always been regarded as being utterly opposed to subterfuge. To-day, however, he comes forward with this amendment, which is designed to secure a party advantage. He states that a similar provision has been made , in other measures, but, although honorable members on all sides regard him as having a most complete knowledge of the Commonwealth Statutes, he was unable, when questioned on the subject, to mention a case in point. </para>

                        <para>- In that case an alteration was made to extend the time within which persons might register for a pension, because it was found that many had not registered within the date fixed. The  Chairman  seemed to think that the several amendments indicated by the Minister would be put at one and the same time. I am not surprised that he should have entertained that view, having regard to the guillotine proposals that have been passed, and to the readiness of Ministerial supporters to vote for anything that will prevent discussion, and secure for them a party advantage. They are willing to sacrifice the principle of fair play and to prevent the fair consideration of this measure. I was temporarily absent from the Chamber when the division was taken on the motion to apply the guillotine to this Bill, otherwise, if allowed to do so, I should have debated the question. The position is that  a  Bill containing over  200  clauses is to be passed through this House in two and  a  half sitting days. </para>

                        <para>- It provides for  aD  amendment of two very important principles of our electoral law. Deputations have asked the Minister to make other alterations, and in this and the next clause lie proposes to make three or four amendments which will have the effect of bringing the Bill into operation bit by bit. It is to be dealt with like mincemeat. We are to deal with the Bill as if it were a sausage, and it is to be brought into force bit by bit for the advantage of the Ministry. When it was being introduced I interjected that it should be entitled " A Bill to dish the Labour party." The action now taken by the Minister shows that my. statement was absolutely correct. </para>

                </continue><para>In order to secure a party advantage the Government wish to apply the preferential voting provisions of this Bill to the election for Corangamite, which is fixed for the 14th proximo. The Department is not ready to bring into  operation  at once the Bill as a whole, and, therefore, the Government say, " Let us bring into operation a bit at a time, and so gain a party advantage." The postal voting provisions, according to the Minister, cannot be brought into operation at once, although some supporters of the Government have said that the abolition of postal voting has deprived from 77,000 to 80,000 people of the right to vote. The Minister will not provide for the postal voting provisions of the Bill coming into operation at once because he knows that a number of shearers have been living in the Corangamite electorate, and that they would vote by post in the interests of the Labour party's candidate. The Government should either bring in the Bill as a whole or let it go altogether. Every Government that has tried to fake or gerrymander an election has met the same fate. When, in 1910, the Labour party, then in Opposition, were denied the right to reasonably discuss the measures brought down, the Government responsible for " gagging " them were dealt with by the people. I am confident that the people will deal with this Government as soon as they realize the true position. It will be difficult, however, for them to learn of their shortcomings since 99 per cent, of the newspapers of the Commonwealth support the Ministry. Be that as it may, the Government will find that, while they may fool some of the people some of the time, they cannot fool all the people all the time. As the Minister himself admits, this Bill and the amendment are intended to apply to the Corangamite election. In order to meet the position, the Government propose to chop the Act off in sections, like a sausage, and in so doing apply preferential voting to that contest. Believing, however, that postal voting would benefit the Labour party, the Government do not intend to apply that system, but only the portion of ' the Bill that it is thought will benefit the Government and their supporters. We know, of course, that the Government have servile followers who will support any proposals submitted by those in power, and with a safe majority, they propose to bring into operation at once a portion of this Bill. The Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act has 'been cited as a similar instance. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn.</inline> - There are other measures. </para><continue>

                        <para>- There may be, but never a measure like this one. An Electoral Bill should not be a party matter. There has never been a more flagrant misuse of governmental control of the business of Parliament than that witnessed to-day. Owing to illness and other causes a great number of the members of the Opposition are absent, but those who are here will all vote against the amendment. No one can accuse me of ever doing anything of this kind in order to gain a party advantage; and I hope that all honorable members will realize their responsibility, and vote against the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- From a purely party point of view, the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> would be quite legitimate, but, speaking as he has sought to speak recently, showing himself to be most solicitous about the welfare of returning and  absent soldiers, he now fails absolutely to have any regard for the men who aspire to have political representations such as is enjoyed on the other side of the House. Personally, I should have preferred to see preferential voting the law of the land, long since. We could not then have been accused of indecent haste with this measure in order to gain a party advantage. I can acquit myself of any such intention in supporting the Government on the present occasion. During the war period, and quite recently, there have been evidences of a desire on the part- of the people to see the various parties and sections of the community represented in the National and State Parliaments. The farming community are anxious to send forward their representatives, and so are the great body of soldiers and their, immediate friends; and this is an addition to- the. two long-established political parties in this country. This Bill, will afford the Labour party the fullest measure of support to which it is entitled. Every vote will be effective, but the country will be safeguarded from having foisted on it the representation of an enslaved minority, which is amenable to drill and order. </para>

                        <para>- That is why I congratulate the Minister on his admission that the amendment is in order to have some effect on the by-election. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> interjected that this Bill should have been described as the " Corangamite By-election Bill," and certainly such a measure would have been easily put through, and we could have discussed this Bill, in its broadest aspect, free, perhaps, from, any party feeling. No argument or statement by the Minister can get over the fact that this Bill is to be used in sections in order to secure a party advantage. Is the reason for the Bill the result of the Swan by-election? Have Ministers got scared ? Do they read the signs of the times? </para>

                        <para>- Quite so, and I am prepared to support preferential voting, but not to support the Government in applying only one part of the electoral machinery to a particular election. If this may be done for the forthcoming by-election it may be done for any election. Under this provision the Government may at  any  time put into operation a part of the electoral machinery, and leave any other part inoperative. There are a number of honorable members opposite who can always be relied on to regard questions  with  a certain amount of reasonableness, and I ask them whether they think that the electoral machinery of this community should be open to juggling at the hands of a Minister. Is it fair at any time that  the  Government should be able to  put part  of the Electoral Act into operation just as they may choose? That is   what  this amendment gives the Government power to do. Any part of the Bill may be brought into operation. Who knows but that there may be another by-election in three months? It would be quite open to the Government to apply postal voting to that election and leave out preferential voting. There never was a proposal that left the electoral machinery so open to jugglery as the one before us. I sympathize with the Minister, because I feel quite sure  that  he does not believe in the proposal he has made. He has established a reputation  for  himself for fairness and straight-dealing; but if he persists with the present proposal his reputation will be gone, and we shall regard him as merely  the  tool of the Government, willing to do anything, or be anything, in electoral matters, so long as his party  wins.  The proposal brings forcibly to one's mind the experience we have already had of interference  'With  elections. Goodness knows, at the last referenda and general election we had interferences that spoiled the name of Australia from this point of view. Australian elections had hitherto been regarded as representing, perhaps, the ideal system of conducting such business. We were not perfect, but, at any rate, we were far ahead of any country in electoral affairs. The Prime Minister at that time introduced into elections a new feature that destroyed our previous confidence and dependence upon fair dealing in electoral matters. To-day the Government are copying his bad example, but are acting even worse, because, with all his faults, the Prime Minister had the courage to introduce a Bill to give the Government authority to do the things he proposed. To-day the Minister has deliberately brought forward an amendment to allow the Government to manage the elections according to their own sweet will. Surely after our experience in the past, we want no more of that sort of thing. The time has come for straight and clean sailing. The amendment introduced by the Minister is one that ought not to commend itself to right- thinking men in this chamber. I shall discuss this Bill throughout entirely free from party prejudices, and without any wish to gain a party advantage. I have no hope that the Government will give any advantage to the Labour party in electoral matters, but the time will surely come when the Labour party will be in office, and then will belong to them whatever advantages the Bill confers upon the Government. </para>

                        <para>- If the Government did not hope to gain an advantage they would not be rushing the Bill through the House. I ask the Minister to relieve himself of the charge that will be laid forever at his door that he is proposing to use for a particular party purpose an Electoral Bill, although the electoral law is the real basis of the whole of our governmental institutions and the guarantee of their purity. No matter what party is in power, the electoral machinery should not be available for such a purpose; it should be above suspicion and the danger of manipulation. The Government would be acting more honestly if they put through the whole Bill as representing their ideal of electoral reform, or agreed to the elimination of the objectionable features. The only reason why the Bill is not to be operated as a whole at the Corangamite byelection is that the Government have not time to make provision for postal voting. The Minister is placed in an unfortunate position by his party, and if honorable members opposite wish to relieve themselves of the charge of partiality and of seeking a party advantage they should not press this amendment, but allow the Bill to go through in its entirety, and stand or fall by it. </para>

He admits that he is in favour of preferential voting, which is the real essence of the Bill. The purpose of the introduction of that system is that the people shall be more effectively represented than they have been in the past. Instances innumerable have occurred in which the people have been absolutely misrepresented by the result of an election. </para>

                        <para>- So that the people may at the forthcoming byelection be properly represented, rather than that we should have a miscarriage of representation such as took ,place in connexion with the Swan by-election. The contest for Swan is only one of many in which the people have failed to secure proper representation. Only one-third of those who voted are represented by the result of the election j the other two-thirds are practically disfranchised. The honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> has said that preferential voting is fair, because he realizes that by that means people will secure proper representation ; therefore, the sooner we have an effective piece of legislation in operation the better. The general provisions of the Electoral Act are very good, but two amendments certainly should be made, namely, the introduction of preferential voting and the re-establishment of the postal vote. The honorable member for Brisbane objects to postal voting, and he cannot justly complain that that system is not to be immediately introduced, even in connexion with the Corangamite by-election. The Minister has frankly told the Committee that he intends to give the people at that election wider scope in the choice of their representative. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister has already said that it is nob within his power to do that, but that he will give the electors the advantage of that portion of the Bill which is most advantageous to them. In other words, if the whole of the Bill cannot be operated for that election, that the electors shall at any rate, have its essence and best feature, preferential .voting, so that there may not be  another miscarriage of representation such as took place in connexion with the most recent by-election. I should have been glad if the Minister could have mentioned the sections which he proposes to bring into operation at once, but as he is unable to do that we have the next best thing in his assurance that the immediate proclamation shall apply only to preferential voting. That assurance does away with the contention that it will be possible for the Minister to operate one portion of the Bill for one purpose and another portion for some other purpose. He has assured us that, with the exception of the preferential voting provisions, the Bill shall come into operation in the consolidated form in which it is passed by Parliament. After all, the Bill is a consolidating measure, and in the forthcoming by-election we shall be relying upon the present electoral law, plus the advantageous provisions for preferential voting. I strongly urge that if we cannot operate the whole of the Bill for that occasion, the people have a right to demand that they shall be given the opportunity of securing effective representation by the immediate operation of the preferential voting provisions. </para>

                    <para>. -  Honorable members have asked' for precedents for the action which I have proposed. I cannot look up precedents at a moment's notice, but I recollect that, owing to the difficulties _ of administration, portion of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act was to be operative on a date later than the remainder of the Statute. Similar provision was made in connexion with the Patents Act 1903-9 and the Navigation Act. Even before the Patents Act came into general force applications under .it could be made. Again, owing to administrative difficulties Part 2 of the Electoral (War-time) Act, relating to the voting of members of .the Forces, was to be brought into force on a different date from that on which the balance of the Act commenced. As a matter of fact, standing order 250 gives power for a Bill to be divided into separate Bills in Committee,  or for a number of Bills to be consolidated. That would have been a most cumbersome way of attaining our end, and I thought the better way would be to pick out that portion of the Bill which is relevant to the peculiar conditions of the moment, and which can be absolutely separated from the other portion without any inconvenience. I have sought for the clauses that will be affected by the amendment I have proposed, but I cannot possibly specify them in a hurry with" out some risk. I have, however, made a note of clauses 76, 125, 134, and 137. The balance of the Bill will be brought into force in one block, and cannot afterwards be withheld. Postal voting could not possibly be applied to the forthcoming by-election, because, after nomination day, it is necessary to have postal certificates all over Australia. No one can fill up postal certificates until the candidates are nominated, and in order to print them and have them distributed all over Australia in time for this election, it would be necessary to anticipate the nominations. About 250,000 persons avail themselves of the absent voting provisions, but of these there are only about 15,000 who use this method of voting outside the State in which they are enrolled. Tn any case, absent voting cannot generally apply to a by-election, because there are no polling places outside the division in which the election is held. It would be absolutely useless to apply the postal voting or absent voting provisions of this Bill to the forthcoming by-election. The Government's proposal could not possibly affect the relative strength of the parties in this House. </para>

But there is a provision in the Bill before the House which can be made to apply at the present time without embarrassing the electoral administration, and the Ministry thought it was sound policy to ask Parliament to sanction its immediate application. In asking for the sanction of Parliament, we are following a correct course. </para>

                    <para>.- It is quite true that, if this amendment is passed, the sanction of Parliament will be given, and the Ministry have the necessary majority; but the method they have adopted is not in accordance with the past actions of the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn).</inline> I would far rather hear him say that the exigencies of the moment have rendered it necessary. This course may have been adopted on previous occasions, but not to my knowledge; and it seems to me that it is the shadow of the Swan election which is causing the Government to apply to the forthcoming Corangamite election the portion of the electoral law which will suit them. I do not wish to stress the point, but I am perfectly candid in saying that the example set to-day will not be forgotten. The party which occupies the Government benches for the time being will always be justified in making full use of the Standing Orders, applying the closure or limiting debate. I welcome it if it means that certain legislation will be carried into effect. More particularly would I welcome it if we had adopted the principles of the initiative, referendum, and recall, because then the people themselves could say, " We will not have such legislation; we will have the Bill, and the whole Bill." If the Government had been more open about this matter, they would have been more honorable. They say that they cannot apply the postal vote to the Corangamite by-election. Why not postpone the election for a fortnight? I do not suppose that the fixing of the date for a byelection is like the laws of the Medes and Persians - unalterable. . Speaking subject to correction, I should imagine that it is not compulsory to hold an election on a certain date after a member's death. If we could delay the Corangamite election, we could apply the whole of the provisions of the Bill, and so enable the Minister to escape from an unpleasant situation. No one has a greater regard than I have for the honorable gentleman's character, which has been built up in successive Parliaments, and, therefore, I regret that he should be forced into such a position. While preferential voting must appeal to the majority of honorable members of the House, postal voting was unanimously accepted by the Electoral Commission, which submitted the following recommendation upon the point: - </para>

                    <para>The electoral law should not he forged as a party weapon, but should aim at making it possible for every elector to record his vote. Apparently, about 77,000 electors were unable to vote at the elections in consequence of the abolition of postal-voting facilities, many of whom would be the mothers Of our people, fulfilling the noblest duties of life, and would have a keener personal interest in the government of the country than many who recorded votes. Wc, therefore, suggest the amendment of the Act to provide for postal voting prior to the day of- election, with sufficient statutory safeguards. </para>

                        <para>- No one would be harmed if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> would postpone the election, if it were the wish of honorable members that he should do so. It would relieve the Minister. Honorable nl embers would rather have the whole of the Bill applied to the election than part of it, because if only one portion of the law is applied to this election, supporters and friends of the Government will say that only the portion which suited the Ministry was employed. I would be prepared to expect such criticism if I were supporting the Government. I have suffered more than any honorable member or, perhaps, any two honorable members may have suffered, from the villainies that were perpetrated under the old postal -voting provisions; but yet I hope that the Corangamite election will be postponed, so that the whole of the measure which will be passed by this Parliament may be applied to it. </para>

                    <para>. -  As I understand the proposal, it will have the same effect as if the Government had introduced a separate Bill providing for the contingent vote only.  I  am unable to understand the amount of heat which the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> has been able to put into the discussion of a proposition of that kind. Only a party spirit of the most violent kind could rejoice at the Democracy being forced to accept a candidate elected by a minority of electors in opposition to candidates supported by a majority of electors. The man who professes to be a believer in democratic principles, and yet is prepared to support a system applying to any election which will enable a minority of electors to force their candidate upon an unwilling majority, has a very small claim to be a Democrat. The sooner that awful system comes to an end the better it will be, no matter what party it may. affect. It is undemocratic. The proposal of the Government is in the interests, not of party, but of the electors, who have a right to be represented in Parliament by men approved of by the majority. For that reason I heartily support the proposal. </para>

                    <para>.- I did not think th'at this great National, Liberal, or Win-the-war party, with such a substantial majority at their back, would yield to the dictates of the morning press. This morning we found the- newspapers in Victoria telling the Ministry what they should do in order to save the Corangamite seat, and now we see the great, strong party opposite cringing and crawling on their bellies to these journals. It is a fine spectacle, apart altogether from the principle of the thing, to see the whole process of dealing with the Electoral Bill interrupted by an amendment to establish preferential voting at a by-election, which happens to be forthcoming. If the Government should happen to lose the seat, it would not affect their stability, or alter the state of parties in the House. The real test will come at the next general elections, for  which we ought to have the best machinery available. We ought not to be wasting our time over by-elections. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. The Minister has not had the Government proposals printed and circulated. My desire is that the ballot-papers shall be the same for Senate and House of Representative elections, the electors being required to mark all the ballot-papers with figures showing the order of their preferences for the various candidates. The Government, however, is willing to pass a piecemeal measure in order that the preferential system may apply to an approaching by-election. The result of this election is not material to the Labour  party,  because, should we win it, we shall not have a majority. Our desire is to have an Electoral Act under which justice will be done at the next general election. We do not wish to waste time in patching up a measure merely to serve for a byelection. The Bill contains over 200 clauses, and yet we have only from now until 3 o'clock on Friday afternoon next in which to consider them. </para>

                        <para>- It is my duty to seek to .protect my party's interests and the interests of those who sent rr.e here. I have always been elected with a majority of from 8,000 to 9,000 votes, and most of the members of the Labour party were returned by a big majority. I believe that we should have got through the Bill just as quickly had no limitation of discussion been agreed to. The Senate may " stone- wall " the measure. We must intimate to our friends what has taken place here, and senators may not agree to differentiation in the method oÂ£ Senate elections. In my opinion, there should be absolute uniformity. </para>

                    <para>.- I have not yet spoken to the Bill, and in the ordinary course of events would not have done so; but I understand that the Minister in charge of it has announced that it is the intention of the Government that certain parts only of the measure shall be applied to a by-election that is to take place at an early date. That announcement is a political indecency, against which I protest. It amounts to a deliberate declaration that the Government proposes to tamper with the electoral law to suit its party interests in connexion with the election. </para>

                        <para>- I was not here when the Minister was speaking, and, therefore, deal with the proposal entirely  on its merits. The Government evidently consider that certain provisions of the measure are calculated, if applied to a forthcoming election, to serve its interests. I do not know that the Liberal party would win the Corangamite election in a straightout fight, because Labour has already held that seat. But evidently the Government thinks that it will secure a party advantage by applying to the election the principles of preferential voting. </para>

                        <para>- Whether the method is a good or a bad one may be a matter of opinion, just as what the effect of preferential voting would have been on the recent Swan election is a matter of opinion. Members opposite and their journalistic supporters wish it to be believed that under the preferential method all the votes not cast for the winning Labour candidate would have gone to a Liberal candidate. But there is no proof of that. </para>

                        <para>- This proposal- on the part of the Government represents something new in the way of " speeding up." The Government already have the advantage of the " gag " and the new standing order which enables them to forcibly put through a measure in good time without regard to either 'the desires or the rights of the Opposition, or the needs or the rights of their constituents. In addition to these salutary proposals - salutary in the sense of being useful in preserving the life of the Ministerial party - we are now faced with a proposition  to  enable the Government to bring into immediate effect any part of the Bill which may serve their own political interests, and to reserve to themselves the right  to  postpone indefinitely any other part of the Bill - introduced, perhaps, in some of its phases, as a result of pressure from outside - which may not be so pleasing  to  them either individually or as a party. </para>

                <para>Looking at the amendment before the Chair, one would suppose that the principles of the electoral law, as they existed before the introduction of this measure, and as they exist to-day, were something new. One would scarcely think that they represented the policy of the Federation since the establishment of the Commonwealth. It is curious that after an experience of Federation, extending over seventeen or eighteen years, it should be discovered only to-day, and in the stress of present political circumstances, that an amendment of the electoral law in the direction of preferential voting is not only desirable,- but so urgent that that part of the Bill which provides for it must be tom from its context and put into operation in anticipation of other provisions in the same measure. Such an action on the part of the Government, quite independently of the principle of the preferential vote which the proposal involves, immediately challenges criticism. It challenges their sincerity  since, if they had been as sincere as they might be, it is clear that preferential voting could have been provided for long ago, without any waiting on the part of the Government for the recent " unfortunate " happening in the far west of this continent, and without being put into operation in immediate anticipation of another by-election. </para>

                        <para>- Some faint consolation might be drawn by the Ministerial party from its experience there if it were not that at that election there was returned to this House a man who, by virtue of his having been to, and suffered at, the war, had some such claim upon the confidence of the people as is possessed by the very man just now returned as a Labour candidate to represent the great constituency of Swan. Leaving out the consideration which prevailed in the case of the Flinders election, we find that, whether it be by referendum, or by vote in a single constituency, or whether we judge by the prevailing tone of the people outside, it is becoming increasingly evident to the Government and their supporters that they are in a condition of discredit which forbodes their rapid dissolution. </para>

                <para>My objection to this amendment does not go necessarily to the principle of preference. I hold it to be an act of political indecency to pick and choose the electorates to which such a system is to be applied. And that is what is being done in this case. Does any one suggest that if the electorate of Corangamite, which is to be contested shortly, had been a distinctly Labour stronghold honorable members opposite would have been so much concerned about the eternal principles of electoral justice as to apply preferential voting to the contest? Not at all. They have seen what they, believed to be a stronghold of Liberalism in Western Australia pass into the hands of Labour, and they see the danger, from their point of view, of the not-so-great stronghold of Liberalism - Corangamite - also passing into our hands. In these circumstances . they have suddenly become seized of the intrinsic justice of the preferential system, notwithstanding that during the seventeen years of Federation they have never suggested before that it should be brought into operation. I repeat that I am not opposed to the preferential system of voting. So far as our party is concerned it is unnecessary for the reason that we adopt a very simple and just system, which, however, depends for its success upon the loyalty and public spirit of the party. It ill becomes a late member of the Labour party to take exception to a policy under which he has more than once submitted himself without success. I would not like to be severe on the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lamond),</inline> but I am bound to pal nt out that, though frequently rejected as an exponent of Labour, he appears to be good enough to be picked up as an exponent of Liberalism in a new party. </para>

                        <para>- That may be. Our system of selection, so far from being unfair or unjust, consists in taking an absolutely untrammelled democratic vote of every member of the party in the selection. Having done that, we even then do not say that the one selected should represent the whole electorate, but we do say that he is. entitled to be classed as the nominee to run in the interests of the party, and that he is selected in a very democratic way. </para>

                        <para>- Under the preferential system; 1 am prepared to take the matter on that ground, although this is used as an interjection against me. We select the candidate by a democratic vote of every member of the party, and I cannot  imagine  a system more fair. Having made our selection, the candidate is submitted to the whole electorate for acceptance or rejection. As I have said, this ,pre-selection policy of ours depends for its success on the loyalty of the party. That is how it comes about that, while the preferential VOte st elections is a matter of perfect indifference to the Labour party, it becomes a vital matter to the congeries of the parties opposite, for the reason that they cannot depend for a moment on the loyalty of each other when a candidate has been selected. What occurred in the Swan electorate? The nominee of the Ministerial party was at the bottom of the poll. </para>

                        <para>- He was second last; the candidate who was last was such a rank outsider that it is hardly worth considering his claim for recognition. I believe 1 am right in saying that this gentleman was a contributor to the Consolidated Revenue in a way painfully well known to members of the party opposite. We, therefore, do not require the preferential vote, but we offer no objection to it. We apply it in our pre-selection ballots, and, therefore, my objection "to the amendment does not rest by any means upon the fact that I have a rooted antipathy to the system, for I have not. </para>

Let me warn him that he will not have to live very long before he finds that those soldiers of ours are coming back more democratic than they wen): away. They will come back to record their votes with a lively recognition of the fact that this war is being won the world over by the forces of advanced Radicalism, and that the victory is, not only for one or two countries, but for the Democracy of the whole world, including the countries of our present enemies. </para>

                        <para>- Then I shall not pursue that aspect of the matter further; indeed, there is no need for me to add anything to what I have said. I propose to vote against this amendment on the grounds that have been put by other honorable members and myself. It is a party political move, which ought not to have been resorted to in the case of an Electoral Bill, under which appeals are to be made to the great tribunal of the people. It is a party political move at a time, and in circumstances which make it peculiarly objectionable and unworthy of the large party, whose numbers are sufficient to enable them to carry on until the next election. After all, that is all that the party opposite can desire; they cannot avert the fate which is sure to befall them at no distant date. It is perfectly clear that they desire, by picking an electorate suitable, as they think, for the application of the preferential system, to arrest the  Tot  that is setting in - the rot which set in some time ago - in the ;party, or congeries of parties, as I have called them, of which they are made up. This rot has given a very bad impression to their friends, and to their so-called leader across the seas, at the very time when those stay-at-home warriors are desirous of acclaiming themselves a successful Win-the-war Government and party. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman and his colleagues, after the remarks of the honorable member I have mentioned, at once started to lay and hatch eggs, of which these amendments are the outcome. The Government is strong enough, and has subservient followers enough to do this dirty kind of business. Why do they not go one step further, and disfranchise every man and woman "with Labour sympathies and tendencies, and thus make things still more easy for the Government? There is an old saying to the effect that those whom the gods wished to destroy they first made mad ; and honorable members opposite are going mad on electoral matters. All the powers of the Government - all their trickery and machinations - will not save the honor able member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archibald)</inline> next, time he faces his masters. The honorable member, who does not appear to like what I am saying, will remember  the  old yarn about the pitcher and the well. As a Labour man I do not object to the Government doing these things, for they are only rushing to their doom. If there is one thing more than another that an enraged Democracy will not have, particularly in Australia - and I know  a  little of the Democracy of this country, having grown up with it for the last thirty years - it is electoral methods of this sort. The Government and their supporters are to-day doing to the Labour party and Democracy what the squatocracy and the autocracy of Australia did to the manual workers and toilers in the earlier history of the Labour movement. We on this side  aTe  impotent, because the Government have an overflow of numbers; but the scene will change, as sure as we are here. The time will come when the Nationalists will be sorry for their misdeeds. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that because a man alters his opinion he is a traitor. If a man does not change his opinion at some time there is not much in him. I know that when I came into this House I had certain fixed opinions which have been at least modified, and I give other honorable members the same right in that respect as I claim for myself. Things that the Australian Democracy will not stand are Tammany practices in politics, and tinkering with the Electoral Act. The enraged Democracy will scarify honorable members for what they are doing to-day. I know that in regard to the Corangamite by-election, the Government are only obeying the dictates of their masters. The Employers' Federation, the Women's National League, and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> have told the Government what they are to do. The result is the series  of amendments' which the Minister has brought before the  House  to-day. Honorable members opposite cavil about Labour candidates being returned on a minority vote. In the first Federal election some honorable members on the Government side, and one member of the Labour party were returned on a minority vote; but until this Bill was brought forward, I never heard of any complaint on that account. There must be something rotten in the state of Denmark when,- after having endured the present system for eighteen years, the Government are induced to rush an amending Bill through in the few days before a by-election. What will happen if, notwithstanding all the anxiety of the Government to insure the return of a Nationalist candidate, the Labour candidate wins ? </para>

                        <para>- They always have done so in my electorate. A blind man can see through what the Government are doing to-day. But a reaction will take place in the constituencies, and many honorable members who are reclining on the soft Ministerial benches to-day will be sitting in the galleries' watching their Labour successors doing what they ought to have done. It seems peculiar that , the Government should be so small-minded as to misuse the whole powers of Parliament and the electoral machinery in- order to gain one seat, for no" other reason than that a Labour man won the Swan seat with a minority vote. But even if the Labour candidate had not won the Swan seat, the Nationalist candidate, who had the indorsement of the Government, would have been defeated, and success Would have gone to another man, who would have been opposed to the Government. </para>

It is remarkable that the Government have made their first use of the guillotine on a Bill which most honorable members have referred to as a non-party measure. I do not think that any man should win an election on trickery ; a constituency should have fair and proper representation, and if the Government think that preferential voting would insure that, I have no objection to giving it a trial. </para>

The proposal now before the Committee will not redound to the credit of the Government, and I am sorry that it has been brought forward by the Minister for Home and Territories. He is one of the fairest and  squarest  politicians I have ever met in the whole of my political career. Always when there has been anything wrong in a Bill introduced by him, he has pointed out where the fault lay. I feel sure that he is taking this action to-day in opposition to his principles. </para>

It is the small abuses against which a Democracy rebels, and the Government are building up a nice little list for which the electors will call them to account. If honorable members opposite will not follow the straight path their blood must be on their own heads. </para>

Under preferential voting, the names of the candidates have to be written in. We must know who are nominated before preference can be marked on a ballot-paper. The absent voting provisions will not be affected. As the absent voting within a division is practically small, no substantial purpose is served by applying the system to a by-election. </para>

                        <para>- The Government are employing this piecemeal method in order to evade putting the Bill into operation at  a whole. I would like to hear some honorable members defending their action. It is taken in the interests of party only, and I am sure they are ashamed of it. I am told that I must not attribute motives. There is no need to impute them. Honorable members think that, because they have the press on their side, they can do no wrong. In order to prevent honorable members on this side from having a fair opportunity to discuss the matter, they bring forward a proposal in this piecemeal way. Instead of giving the country a solid joint, they give it a pound of sausages, cutting off a piece at a time, and applying it piecemeal to the elections. A Ministry which brought forward a regulation on the eve of the conscription referendum disfranchising Australian-born citizens would bring forward another regulation putting part of the Electoral Act into operation for one election, and then, if it did not suit them, they would not apply it at the next election. </para>

By means of a regulation, they have already disfranchised certain citizens; and what they have done in the past they will be prepared to do in the future. I shall do my best, not only to prevent this Bill passing in the shape they desire, but also to prevent them from retaining the Corangamite- seat. I am not allowed to say they will endeavour to do so by faking the election, but still I think it. </para>

There is a growing tendency on the part of some honorable members to indulge in reflections upon the personal honour of others. The practice is becoming so prevalent that the Chair must take notice of it. I ask the honorable member for Darling not to pursue that line of speech, and I ask all honorable members to support the Chair in preserving that decorum which should be observed in an institution of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- The Government are not devoid of responsibility in the matter of the conduct of business. If an amendment is brought forward by the Ministry, which does not give a fair deal, and which, only by the greatest stretch of imagination, may be called honorable, the responsibility for any remarks which may tend to be personal must be equally shared by them. We surely owe something to those who have sent us here, and if, smarting under the injustice heaped upon us, we say something out of place, the Government must take the responsibility for it. The Parliaments of Australia are being used tQ save, if possible, the face of the National party, which fairly stinks in the nostrils of the people. </para>

                        <para>- I have already called attention to several infractions of the Standing Orders. The honorable member and others have been disorderly in discussing matters other than the amendment. The Government and the Ministerial party have nothing to do with the amendment. If honorable members wish to discuss the conduct of the Government, they should do so on a proper occasion; it is disorderly to discuss it now. I am sorry that I have allowed so much latitude, but I shall now draw the rein tighter, confining members strictly to the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I realize that it is hopeless to say anything that will convince any honorable member opposite of the iniquity of what is being perpetrated. However, they will yet realize it themselves, and more keenly than any one inside or outside of Parliament can hope to bring the fact home to them now. The repeal is to take place from such date as may be fixed by proclamation. There will be a proclamation putting this business on, and another taking it off again - something like the case of the Prime Minister, who promised to resign after a certain event, and who did not. </para>

                        <para>- We expect none, and we get none. The Government can fix a date by proclamation, calling the whole thing off and can fix another date by proclamation, putting it on again ; which is just what the Government probably will do. We have never had such action taken before as to bring into operation an Act a bit at a time. It  is  a case of " one step at a time; do not do it altogether." The Government are going to bring into force this Act a lit at a time, and will repeal it a bit at a time. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> has admitted that the proclamation is to take place from time to time, simply as it suits the Government. There is to be nothing in the interests of fair play, or of having a pure Electoral Act, or in the interests of the people exercising a proper franchise. It is entirely to be a matter of, " How will it suit the Government?" A more discreditable motive has never been expressed by any Minister in this, or any other Parliament of Australia. I defy the Minister to point to any measure under which part of an Act may be repealed at one time, and another part of it repealed at a later period. Such a method of legislating  is  absolutely unheard of, and a Government that resorts to it is unworthy of the position it holds. This proposal  is  made, not for the purity of elections, but to further the interests of the Ministerial party. </para>

                    <para>.- In the amendment now before us we have another illustration of the truth of the old saying that if you take one wrong step you have to take many more to cover up your wrong-doing. Having amended clause  2,  the Minister is now proceeding to submit consequential amendments which must necessarily be made throughout the Bill.. We are professing by means of this measure to consolidate the electoral law of the Commonwealth. I invite honorable members to observe that it is entitled, " A Bill for an Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to parliamentary elections, and for other purposes." I am beginning to discover what is meant by the use of the words " and for other purposes." </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but apparently a new use has been found for them. This Bill is supposed to provide a complete and permanent machine for the conduct of Commonwealth elections, and yet to meet political exigencies the Minister is compelled to introduce into it a number of amendments so that the Government may be secure in winning a by-election. If the party numbers were very close, I could understand the urgency of the amendment; I could understand the Government doing a lot of things with the electoral law; but since the Government have an enormous majority, and are so sure of the success of their candidate at the forthcoming election for Corangamite, why should they resort to this subterfuge? Why should they be ready to manipulate and juggle with the electoral machinery to suit their own necessities? </para>

                </continue>
                <para>If the Government would consider this matter apart from the party stand-point they would recognise that it is immoral to descend to the subterfuge now being resorted to by the Minister. Not content with the amendments made in clause  2,  under which such parts of the Bill as axe found convenient may be made operative, he now proposes to make it possible to repeal only such parts of the existing electoral law as the Government may consider it convenient to repeal. When the election, for Corangamite takes place no one outside the Government officials will know what particular Electoral Act is being applied to it. Under this amendment any part of the existing legislation may be retained or repealed. Is it not reasonable that the Opposition should claim that, whatever else of a party character there may be in the legislation proposed by the Government, no attempt should be made in an Electoral Bill to secure a party advantage ? Ministerial supporters have continually assured us that they approached this question from a non-party stand-point; that they had no wish to gain party advantage, and that their only desire was that by means of this Bill everything relating to the. conduct of elections should be fair and square, and that every candidate should have a square deal. And yet by the amendment now proposed the Government will hold in their hand the power so to utilize the electoral machinery that it may be made to go and stop and made to restart and restop just as the exigencies of the party political situation require. </para>
                <para>I enter a most emphatic protest against this manipulation of the electoral machinery of the Commonwealth. This is one of the most comtemptible actions ever taken by any Government in any Parliament. We, as Britishers, have always claimed that, no matter what may happen in other countries in the way of electoral corruption and the manipulation of votes, our elections are always beyond suspicion. </para>

                        <para>- Can my honorable friend point to any instance in history where the electoral machinery of a country has been so manipulated that the Government of the day have been able to operate one part and to hold back another part? This Bill is supposed to supersede' every other Common-wealth Electoral Act in existence, and yet we are now asked to insert in it an amendment which will enable Ministers, as they choose, to drop part of it and to bring into operation other parts. At the same time they will also be able to repeal or to continue any part of the existing electoral law. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is confusing the point at issue. He is thinking now of preferential voting, and when we come to that part of the Bill which deals with it, no difficulty will be experienced. It is evident that the Committee as a whole is prepared to uphold the principle of preferential voting. I  arn  dealing now with the effect of the amendment immediately before the Chair, and I think I am putting up a good case to show that  it  embodies a hitherto unknown method of dealing with the electoral machinery. The supporters of the Government, however, have given their instructions, and the Minister is either carrying out their will or they will carry out his will. The amendment will go through, and, as a result of it, we shall have an electoral machine which is neither the old nor the new, but a bit of both. It is the most immoral and disgraceful proceeding in connexion with electoral affairs ever perpetrated in any community. </para>

                        <para>- It is. All the arguments of the Opposition fail, because there is no such proposal before the Committee. The amendment submitted by the Minister  is  simply to give the Government power to bring into operation the preferential or contingent voting sections of this Bill for by-elections. The Leader of the Opposition declared  that  this was an iniquitous proposal. For  the  leader of  a  great professedly Democratic party to declare a proposal to give  the  majority of electors at a by-election  the  right to select their own candidate,  an  iniquity, is testing our forbearance to  the  breaking point. </para>

                        <para>- It is an iniquity that honorable members have been returned to this House by only  a  minority of electors. It is an iniquity that honorable members are able to come here with two-thirds of the electors opposed to them, and help to make the laws of this country  in  the  name  of the Democracy that they do not represent. The blame lies at the door of men like the Leader of the Opposition, who has been for years a member of Ministries that have not remedied this undemocratic state of affairs, or even attempted to do so. When a Ministry does come' forward prepared to give the majority of the electors the right to select their members, it is strange that there should be this "stone-walling" because the provision will apply to one particular election. From a purely party point of view, it is very, consoling to know that honorable members on the other side see so small a chance of getting majorities, that they  Want  to catch odd seats on a minority vote. But they may take heart. The Labour movement will not die because a few leaders have got into the wrong place, or a few men have turned it down. The contingent vote that this Bill will secure to the electors is the only democratic way to elect members of a Democratic Parliament. I hope honorable members will cease their opposition to a principle which will give greater power to  a  majority in each electorate to obtain representation of their views. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is quite wrong. If the Government want the people to be left free to elect members to this Parliament by a majority vote, the simpler the voting system is made the more the people will go to the polls. Anything that makes the system complicated will tend to frighten people away from the polling booths. When honorable members now on the Government side were in the minority, they constantly expressed the hope that the people would go to the polls. They said that all they wanted was a full vote to assure them of a majority. This proposal will do nothing towards getting a full vote. If the Government were doing something new, they might claim that they were trying to improve things, but all they propose in one connexion is to restore a system which this House tried and threw out because of the corruption that occurred under it at general elections. </para>

It is dangerous to give a Minister power to issue proclamations that have the force of law. At the outbreak of war, we passed a War Precautions Act which we thought would be fairly administered ; but under that Act powers have been exercised which were never anticipated when the Bill was before us. </para>

                        <para>- The Labour party ; and  I  would vote for  a  War Precautions Act to-morrow, because it is necessary. Under the Bill before us, the Government might at any time issue a proclamation reducing or extending the hours of polling.  I  am reminded by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> that prior to the taking of the last referendum  a  regulation was issued permitting certain questions to be asked of the electors; and such powers no Minister ought to have.  If  the Government have only the Corangamite election in view, why deface the Bill with such a clause as that before us.  I  do not think that the House would agree to a permanent measure of the kind; and surely Parliament will not stoop to pass  a  measure which can only affect one by-election? I warn the Government that this proposal, if carried into effect, may prove a boomerang to them; and certainly the measure will not result in that purity of elections that we have been led to suppose. In any case, if these powers are given to the Minister, I hope they will not be exercised in the same way as have the powers under the War Precautions Act. My own opinion is that if the Minister had his way this clause would not find a place in the Bill, and it is only there as a result of influence brought to bear on him and the Government, in view of the approaching Corangamite election. </para>

I repeat that honorable members on the other side of the House are absolutely inconsistent, and I ask that, for once, we should consider the interests of the people, and not regard this as a close preserve for members of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- The departmental officer will have to obey if the clause passes. We have been grinding out laws as with a sausage machine of late. No less than 290 laws have been issued this year under the War Precautions Act. Honorable members may- call them regulations, but if they will have the effect of imprisoning or fining any man, they are laws, call them what you will. And now we are being asked to pass electoral machinery upon which the Democracy of Australia will rest at the will of a Minister; but I stand for placing power in the hands of an officer to defy a Minister if the Minister is working against the law. </para>

                <para>We are now fighting on the question of re-introducing postal voting. What does it amount to? Honorable members may not be aware how few electors would be affected in the Division of Corangamite. The latest return I have had from the Department shows that at the election on 5th May, 1917, there were 36,733 electors enrolled, and if there were only 77,000 postal voters out of 3,000,000 electors in May, 1917, that would be, roughly, about 4 per cent., so that in Corangamite the number would be about 1,500. I spoke, subject to correction, when, earlier in- the afternoon, I said I understood that the date of an election following a vacancy was fixed by law. I find now that this is not so. There is no reason why this election should not be postponed seven or fourteen days; and allow the Electoral Department extra assistance in any temporary work that may be needed. If this were done, it would disarm any criticism against the present measure. If we commit a wrong now, we shall be creating a precedent, and we all know that precedents are beloved by the legal mind. But the Government have the numbers, so they can rush this measure through if they like. </para>

                <para>Minister may order. "We speak of the purity of our electoral system, and we should so frame our electoral machinery that an officer of the Department may be able, when this is expedient, to stand up to a Minister and be subservient only to Parliament. If we had what I have always contended for - the referendum, initiative, and recall - we could recall the regulations under this Bill. It would give me some pleasure to take the platform throughout the length and breadth of Victoria, as well as further afield, to urge that this course be taken. Honorable members opposite will find that even their political friends will believe that the course now being taken has been dictated by the results of the by-election for Swan. The honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> must agree with me in this matter. It is quite palpable that this action is being taken to insure that Corangamite shall be safe for the Government. But the Government have large numbers behind them, so they can afford to be generous. They should see to it that no slur is cast at them over this matter. If I were on the other side of the House, I would speak in the same strain, and, if necessary, would vote against the Government. I recollect with some amusement what the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foster)</inline> said while we were on the inquiry to which I have referred, and in which the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> was associated with us. We had to work very hard to get justice at that time. I remember how strong the feeling was on both sides. If the honorable members to whom I have referred vote for this provision, they will be supporting a principle which will place in the hands of the Minister more power than any other Minister has yet enjoyed in regard to electoral matters. The honorable member for Wakefield will not deny that. </para>

                        <para>- If I am, it will only, be because of the esteem in which I am held by the men and women of the division. I am very sensitive about placing power in the hands of the Minister :n the manner proposed by this Bill. I know that the present Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)'</inline> has a splendid record, and that he would prefer the Bill to be so worded that if a Minister controlling a Department became so lost to a sense of duty as to order the public servant controlling the Electoral Department to do something which he thought he should not do, that servant should be able to say, " There is the Act, sir, and I read it in another way." Let us give the public servant that right. I ask honorable members on the Ministerial side to support me in requesting the Ministry to do the right thing. I do not care how quickly the Government pass this Bill, because if the opportunity ever comes to me to move in a particular matter I shall move quickly. It seems to me absurd that in times like the present we should have such long vacations and brief sittings. Our position is akin to that of Nero fiddling while Rome was burning. Let us get through the business and dispose of every motion standing in the names of private members. I suggest that the Ministry should withdraw the amendment. On the average, only 1,500 persons in a constituency with 36,000 electors vote by post, and to say that it is not possible to do what I have suggested is to reflect upon the capacity of the splendid band of officers who are controlled by the head of the Electoral Department. </para>

                        <para>- Not exactly; no Minister would dare to allow an Act to go unrepealed. Clause 3 states that certain Acts are to be repealed from such dates as are respectively fixed by proclamation, ' so that the Minister is given power only to repeal those Acts by proclamation, and when they have been repealed this provision becomes a dead letter. If honorable members opposite will assist me to take, as far as practicable, all control out of the hands of the Minister in regard to the administration of the Act and the conduct of elections, I shall be pleased to have their support; but the clause under consideration is not the one upon which such an amendment should be considered. </para>

                    <para>.- The proclamation under the Old-age Pensions Act has been put forth as a justification for the procedure proposed to be adopted in connexion with this Bill. Honorable members know perfectly well that the proclamation under the Old-age Pensions Act was provided for for the specific reason that it was impossible to bring the whole of the provisions into force at the time the Act was passed, because there was not enough money in hand to pay the pensions. How can honorable members compare such a proclamation with one which is to be used merely for party purposes, to stave off the evil day for the Government, and to prevent the people from getting accustomed to seeing the National candidate at the bottom of the poll? </para>

                        <para>- I sincerely believe that the guillotine was employed this afternoon in order that those portions of the Bill which are likely to be most satisfactory to the Ministry may be forced through this Chamber by Friday afternoon, sent to the Senate, and , passed through that Chamber in the same hurried manner, so that they may be operated in the Corangamite by-election. I further believe that this action has been taken because of the awful beating which the Nationalist candidate received in the Swan by-election. That is the opinion of honorable members on this side and of the outside public, and, no matter how Government supporters may try to hide their heads in the sand, the people will take that view with increasing conviction when they learn of what is being done in regard to the Corangamite selection. Fancy the whole parliamentary institution being employed to enable the Government to win one seat. It is not the probable loss of the Corangamite seat that worries the Government so much as the effect which another defeat would have on the minds of the people. In order to stave off the evil day, and to bolster up Nationalism, all sorts of devious and sinister methods are being used. The Government to-day instructed the Minister in charge of the Senate that that House should be adjourned, but with instructions that its members should assemble on Tuesday next. Up to the present, during this part of the session, the Government have not thought fit to bring the Senate back to duty on the Tuesday, although on several occasions honorable senators have been sent home for a week. However, on the present occasion, knowing that the guillotine would give the Senate the Electoral Bill early next week, honorable senators are being brought back on the Tuesday to save the face of the Government, to stave off the evil day if possible, and to get their machinery to work that something may be done for the National party, whose foundations are crumbling away. No doubt, everything possible will be done by honorable members opposite. The Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I do not think so, but I have little doubt that he is happier than is the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archibald),</inline> who will be singing his political swan song very shortly. The fact remains that the Minister for Home and Territories is called upon to do a work which I have no doubt is very distasteful to him. He is being used as a party tool. He has to do the dirty work of the National party in order to bring about a result at the Corangamite election which could not, under the existing law, be achieved. I have no fear at ali of the operation of the preferential system of voting. It will put more Labour members into this House than will the sudden-death system. The Labour party have nothing to fear from the preferential voting system. Many honorable members opposite owe their return to the sudden death system, and with the adoption of a better electoral system I have no doubt at all that the Labour party will benefit considerably. If the Government had the courage to stand up against the signers of the round robin in the Senate, and introduce proportional representation for the Senate as the logical corollary of the preferential system of voting for the House of Representatives, the Labour party would do very much better than they did at the elections in 1917. If the proportional voting system had been in operation at those elections they would have secured eight Senate seats, whereas under the existing system they did not secure any. "When the numbers go up for Corangamite I am not at all sure that a Labour man will not be returned, provided that voters are not disfranchised. I am not too sure that honorable members opposite will not disfranchise a number of voters. I say quite candidly that a Government who could bring down a measure such as this, and hurry it through without permitting it to be properly discussed, are' quite capable of dis franchising voters. It would not be difficult to bring proof that this Government did disfranchise thousands of native-born citizens of Australia for a political purpose. They did that at the last general elections. It requires courage even to be a rogue, and if the political party opposite had had the courage to carry out the regulation providing for the asking of infamous questions of electors as they went to the poll, a large number of young men in this community would have been disfranchised. I am not at all sure that some " gerrymandering " will not go on at the Corangamite election. A Government or a party capable of disfranchising electors are capable of anything. I know that in the State of Victoria the electorates have been "gerrymandered " by the same class of people as those who constitute the Federal Government. They stand on the same platform, are behind the same party and represent the same interests. Whilst 1 may be young politically, I know a good deal about our electoral systems and the way in which they have been used throughout Australia. I know that the National Government are proficient in the art of gerrymandering, and are capable of using every evil practice during the Corangamite election in order to save their faces. This would not be because of their desire to retain Corangamite as a Government seat since they could afford to lose half- a- dozen votes or more in this House, and still have quite sufficient numbers to carry any proposals they considered important. But it is a question of the moral effect which the loss of the seat might have on the minds of the people. The citadel of Nationalism is crumbling, and no matter what sinister and evil practices are adopted to prop it up it will fall. Provided that the electors are given the opportunity to exercise the franchise, I have, personally, no fear of the result from the adoption of the preferential system. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to say a word or two at this stage on a measure which honorable members opposite have pointed to as one, the effect of which the Government propose to test at the Corangamite election. It has been my privilege for a considerable time to have been, as it were, the <inline font-style="italic">locum tenens</inline> of the late honorable gentleman who represented that electorate. A more honorable man never crossed the threshold of this chamber, and no voters ever had a more "sterling man to represent them. I feel that any measure passed in this House which might he open to the suggestion that it proposed the application of improper methods to that constituency would in all the circumstances be a slur on the Government who introduced it. I wish, therefore, to define the position clearly for the benefit of the electors of Corangamite who are shortly to be appealed to. The Government had, prior to the demise of the late honorable member for that constituency, determined to bring in a measure to provide for preferential voting, and the Bill had been circulated. A by-election becomes necessary, and the Government have determined to apply the provisions of the measure to that election. Every honorable member who has spoken from the other side has admitted the fairness of the principle of preferential voting. Its application must be just the same to a by-election as to a general election. If there be any inequity or gerrymandering possible under the principle of preferential voting its effects would apply in the same way to a general election as to a byelection, and there is, therefore, no justification at all for any suggestion that an attempt is being made to take an unfair advantage by applying the principle to the by-election for Corangamite. On the contrary, it will give every man that comes forward an open field and a fair chance of support. It will gain for the Labour party every vote to which it is entitled. It will gain for "every party the support to which it is entitled. The Government are justified in taking this step to provide a fair basis for the elec.tion of a successor to the late honorable member, whom we were all delighted to call a personal friend. </para>

                    <para>.- This Bill perpetuates the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral (War-time) Act, which, among other things. provided that, in the event of the death of a candidate after nomination day, the parties could re-nominate some one to take his place. That Act will be repealed by effluxion of time, and I would like to see some provision made in this Bill so that if a candidate should happen to die after the day of nomination, there will be a contest, and the other candidate will not be elected .unopposed, as is likely to be the case if some such provision is not made. </para>

                    <para>.- I have given notice of an amendment to deal with that matter. I wish to take this opportunity of repeating my objection to the inclusion of the sub-clause perpetuating the Electoral (War-time) Act. As that measure is applicable only to elections for the Senate and general elections for the House of Representatives, it can have no application to the Corangamite by-election. It provides for voting by  soldiers. That, also, is impossible in  connexion with the Corangamite election. It disqualifies certain citizens of Australia, but they cannot be disfranchised at the Corangamite election, because the Act does not apply to by elections. It also provides for certain questions being asked when electors proceed to vote, and for the matter mentioned by the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Sinclair),</inline> which I hope to deal with in an amendment.  I  consider that the provision to meet the case of the death of a candidate after nomination day should be a permanent portion of the electoral la-w. I see no necessity for perpetuating the Electoral (War-time) Act. It will not apply to the .Corangamite election, and there is no danger of  a  general election being held before the end of the war. Why should we perpetuate in the electoral machinery an Act which is only temporary, and which can be of no use during <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> period of its <inline font-style="italic">currency ?</inline></para>

                    <para>.- The provision to meet the case of the death of a candidate after the day of nomination was inserted in the Electoral (War-time) Act because, under a .system of voting which is not preferential, it is almost obligatory to have nomination by parties. That provision will continue as long as the Act will remain in force; but I do not know that it is a very good policy to continue nomination by parties. Seeing  that we are introducing a system of preferential voting .which may affect the old method of party government, the Commonwealth may not be divided into two stereotyped parties to the extent that has previously existed. Therefore, we have not included in this Bill the provision which finds a place in the Electoral (Wartime) Act. </para>

                        <para>- The principle of party nomination applies to the Senate as well. I do not think that the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> will object to keeping in force a provision which will assist our soldiers who are abroad. It is possible that the principal Act may have to be amended in the light of the amendments we embody in this Bill. We may have to adopt some principle of preferential voting for our soldiers at the Front. But, as the Act will continue in force for the period of the war and for six months afterwards, I do not think it will be wise to amend it in the direction indicated, in view of the possibility of a great number of our soldiers, who have done so well for this country, remaining abroad for some considerable time. </para>

War-time Electoral Act. When the measure reached this Chamber, that provision applied only to Senate elections. But I moved that it should be made to apply to elections for this Chamber. It is all very well for the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> to say that when we have preferential voting party lines are likely to be removed. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that they are. In a dozen or twenty constituencies that I can mention,  the candidate who secures the nomination of a particular party has a rattling good show of being elected. Let us assume, for example, that both the National party and ;the Labour parity nominate a candidate for the division of Wimmera, and that, after nomination day, the National candidate unfortunately dies. What would be the result? Our party would hold the seat by a mere fluke. In similar circumstances, the candidate nominated by one of the recognised political parties would be returned for the electorates of Kooyong, Henty, Melbourne Ports, Newcastle, and Yarra. If death should unfortunately overtake the nominee of the dominant political party after nomination day, is that party to be disfranchised for the whole Parliament? The party system, I affirm, is not likely to be abolished. What will happen in the case of elections for the Senate? There will be three candidates put forward by the National party in each State, and an equal number by the Labour party. Should one of the Labour party candidates die after nomination day, as happened in the case of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> is that party to be disfranchised for the entire Parliament? </para>

                        <para>- The difficulty might easily be overcome by postponing the date of nomination, say, for a month, to permit of fresh nominations being made. As an alternative, the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> suggests that we could allow the nominators of the candidate who has died, to nominate another candidate in his stead. Personally, I think it would be far better to insert in the Bill a clause which would prevent the majority party in any constituency from having a candidate foisted upon it in opposition to its wishes. There are plenty of constituencies in which the electors are so pronouncedly of one political view that the nominee of a particular party is bound to secure election. In the absence of a provision such as I have suggested, the candidates for these constituencies will always be opposed, on the off chance that one of their number, representing the majority party, may die after nomination day. The effect would be that the country would be put to the expense of an election in numbers of cases in which there would be no possibility of the old member being defeated. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire that the Chief Electoral Officer may be made independent of the Minister by being put into a position analogous to that of the Commissioner of Audit and the Commissioner of Taxation, so that should a Minister be so ill-advised as to order something to be done contrary to the law, the Chief Electoral Officer may be in a position to say, " As I am answerable to Parliament for giving effect to the law, I decline to do what you have directed to be done." The Minister, of course, could appeal to Parliament, and if the officer were in the wrong, punishment would follow. It will be recollected that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> issued a proclamation under the War Precautions Act which prevented Australian natives from recording their votes. </para>

                    <para>. -  I hope the Committee will not agree to the suggestion of the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney).</inline> A lamentable state of affairs would <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> brought about if his proposal "were adopted. If an alteration is to be made it would be well that the Department should be placed under the control of the Attorney-General. It is right that a lawyer of ability should be the responsible Minister. So far as the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> is concerned, I am. satisfied that while he is in office everything will go satisfactorily. But there is no guarantee that a gentleman learned in the law may continue to occupy his position ; and it would be a fatal mistake, therefore, to adopt the suggestion. There would not he very much danger, so long as a Government supported by honorable members on this side remained in power ; but there is no use in ignoring  fact3  as they stand. Suppose that the alteration were made, and Parliament had control of this officer. The Caucus, comprising honorable members opposite, is dictated to by the autocracy outside, who say. " Certain things have to be done," and they reply, " They will be done." What sort of a position would the country be in ? My reason for supporting the Government in their desire that certain parts of this legislation should come into force by regulation  is  that the safety of the country demands that honorable members opposite shall not get into power except by an absolute vote of the constituents. The Chief Electoral Officer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Oldham)</inline> is a man with strong personality, and I would like to see the Minister who would suggest to him anything of an irregular character. But we might not always have a Chief Electoral Officer possessing such attributes. In a certain State which I know something about, a drastic alteration was to have been made in the electoral machinery which would have been detrimental to the electors. Fortunately, the then Attorney-General had control of the Electoral Department; and, when I called his attention to the position, the Minister said, " This must not be done," and that was the end of it. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The idea that the Chief Electoral Officer should be controlled by Parliament is ridiculous. Parliament is the very last body which should be engaged in work of a judicial or executive character. The Department, should be in the hands of the Government, and under the control of the Attorney-General. I know that, so long -as the honorable member for An ens <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> occupies his present position, we shall have a Minister in control who would be utterly incapable of acting in any but a fair manner. I appeal to the Committee not to be led away by any of this so-called Democratic rubbish - for that is all it is. It would be positively dangerous where there is a party in existence which is simply a lackey to the autocracy outside. </para>

The honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archibald)</inline> would have the electoral law administered by the Attorney-General's Department. In connexion with the administration of the Electoral Act, what we need is not law, but justice and common sense. If the Act were administered by the Attorney-General's Department, we might get a lot of litigation, and sometimes more than we wanted. Why should we make any change? The Minister in charge of the Electoral Department at the present time <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> has the confidence of every man in the Parliament. We could not find a better man for the position if we searched the whole Commonwealth. The Minister in charge is responsible to Parliament, whereas if the official head were placed, so to speak, in a glass case, and made directly responsible to the Parliament, it would be hard to reach him. I am satisfied that the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney),</inline> upon reflection, will agree that we have no cause to complain of the way in which, the Act has been administered. </para>

                    <para>.- I am inclined to think that the position would be improved if the officer in charge of the Electoral Department were made directly responsible to the Parliament. Under this clause, the Minister and the official head of the Department are to be bound by the Act and regulations made under it. The Executive will have full control, and they alone will be able to make regulations. It would be in the interests of all candidates if the officer in charge of the Department were removed as far as possible from political interference. It is useless to attempt to disguise the facts. The general impression throughout Australia was that the elections for 1913 were not fairly and properly held. I am not attaching any blame to the Department, but I believe that political influence was then introduced. I would have the officer in charge removed from the control of whatever party might be in power. I would have him responsible to the Parliament, and not to any Government or individual Minister. It is for the Committee to determine the wisest course to adopt. </para>

I have asked for as much information as possible as to what is necessary to enable the Chief Electoral Officer to carry out the intentions of Parliament.

                <para>I may say at once that I do not believe in destroying parliamentary responsibility. A Minister ought to be responsible to Parliament for the honesty of his administration. If he does not honestly discharge his duties, he should be dismissed. We cannot set up a new principle of responsibility by making an outside officer directly responsible to Parliament. In only one case has that been done. I refer to the position of the Commissioner of Audit, whose circumstances are most exceptional. He has to check the finances of every Department, including those of the Prime Minister's Department, to which he is technically supposed to be subject, and therefore he has to be made practically independent, so that, on behalf of the Parliament, he may see that appropriations are carried out in accordance with the law. Surely there must be some medium of communication between the Chief Electoral Officer and Parliament? If the law is not properly administered, the Minister must be responsible to Parliament. I cannot see what justification there is for altering the existing provisions. </para>

I have asked whether there were any defects in the Act, and I confess that the only one I could hear of was in relation to the seventy-five Divisional Returning Officers who, perhaps, might take differing views on such a question as whether a particular nomination was right or not. Even supposing it was wrong, there is power to apply to the Court to get a decision on the point. Are we to say that the Divisional Returning Officers are to settle such a question of legal technicality as that? What the Chief Electoral Officer has power to do under this Bill is, with the assistance of the Minister, or, if necessary, of the Crown Law Department, to give general instructions to his officers. </para>

                        <para>- No; but the principle of administration is that the Chief Electoral Officer ought to guide these men as to the meaning of particular positions, so that there may be uniformity of interpretation throughout the Commonwealth. No amendment setting up the Commissioner to be independent of responsible Government can cure that. I have looked into the question exhaustively, and examined all the existing Acts, and assert that as the Act now stands the Electoral Commissioner is freer from parliamentary control than any officer except the Auditor-General, who is in a most anomalous position, because he must be responsible to Parliament in order to check the honesty of the financial administration of every Department. During the course of my administration, I have seen nothing to justify setting up any officer outside of responsible Government. God help Democracy in this country if we set up a number of officers who are not subject to the ordinary responsibility to the Minister, and through the Minister to this Parliament ! I have done my best to ascertain if there were any defective powers, and any powers that this officer has asked for have been put into the Bill,  as my notes will show. I mention this, because it is due to the members of the Electoral Commission, who took a very keen interest in the subject, and did some excellent work, to show that their suggestions on this point have been thoroughly considered. I ask the Committee, therefore, not to make any amendment. The honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> has proposed an amendment which does not touch the status of the officer, so far as regards responsibility. I do not think any one would say that his independence of the Minister, to the extent to which he ought to have it, depends upon whether he has seven years of office or the. existent term, which is indefinite. The honorable member's proposal is to make it seven years. If we do that, we put him in an anomalous position, as general transferred officers are kept on, as a rule, to a certain age; and, if necessary, their term may be extended. </para>

                        <para>- But there is an Act. The question is, has there been such a tampering with the laws laid down by Parliament as to justify us in giving practically judicial powers to an officer, irrespective of the Minister, to determine what is to be done? I ask honorable members to preserve the principle of responsibility. I have seen no evil arising that would justify a change. I speak in the best terms regarding the administration, which is very effective. The officers are zealous men. It is the duty of the Minister to see that no alteration of a fundamental character is made unless there is clear evidence of its necessity. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall not accuse the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> of answering in a flippant way when I suggested that simple instructions should be published broadcast to enable ordinary Australian citizens to know what to do at the first onset of the form of influenza called Spanish. Simple instructions could be given as to the symptoms and the treatment, the best of which is rest. I brought this matter up on the adjournment last week. The Minister, after a question from the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett),</inline> gave an answer which I do not wish to term flippant, but if the same thing happens again I shall use the word. The matter is of great importance. At the present time, owing to the unfortunate difference between the medical fraternity and the friendly societies, medical attention is not so readily obtainable as it was in the past. I am speaking particularly on behalf of the people in the back country, where the disease is liable to spread like a tornado, as it did in London during the outbreak of what was known as Russian influenza in the years 1880 to 1885. I was there at the time, and know that nearly everybody in the streets was suffering from it, and a number of deaths occurred. I believe this to be a more deadly form of the disease, if it is of the influenzal type, than any similar epidemic that has occurred, and I would impress on the Minister at the table <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> the importance of bringing under the notice of the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs the suggestion I have now repeated. </para>

                        <para>.- I was not able when asking a question to-day to place before the House facts that are within my knowledge regarding the spread of Spanish influenza in New Zealand. Immediately after the arrival of the <inline font-style="italic">Niagara</inline> at Auckland, it was well known that the disease had been on the vessel. Passengers were not put in quarantine at all, but Were allowed to mix freely with the people, with the result that the disease is now rife in New Zealand. What steps are being taken in Australia to keep it out? The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> gave me an answer to-day with which I was not in the least satisfied. I have here a statement made to a committee of citizens in New Zealand on the subject. T regret that there is not a committee of citizens in Australia to take the matter up in the same way. The nature of the reply given on behalf of the Minister for Health for the Dominion makes one fear that a similar state of things may easily prevail in Australia unless public attention be drawn to it. The following is the statement made to the committee of New Zealand citizens on behalf of the Minister: - </para>

                        <para>Criticism had been levelled at the Government because it had not declared influenza a  quarantinable  disease, but to do this they would have had to declare it infectious, probably a dangerous infectious disease, meaning a serious disorganization in the Dominion. Moreover, if that had been done, shipping between New Zealand and Australia would be declared infected, and there would probably he a complete stoppage of shipment. The medical authorities agreed that it was nothing more than pure influenza, and  so  far Australia had not declared New Zealand infected. </para>

                    <para class="block">The reason given for this attitude is that the steps desired would create disorganization in the shipping trade; but we would willingly meet disorganization ten times greater than we can dream of to keep this disease from Australia. I am not at all satisfied with the statement of the Minister to-day, nor am I satisfied that proper precautions are being taken to combat the disease. </para>

                        <para>.-I was interested to bear that the return I had asked for as to Australian products had given rise to great expense and much energy on the part of those concerned- in preparing it. I have since had an opportunity of perusing this immensely expensive document in a cursory way, and I extend my hearty congratulations to the ; Government on having supplied- me with information for which I did not ask, and with no information at all for which I did ask. The information supplied covers a few pages of typewritten foolscap, and must in its preparation have taken at least an hour of some Government servant's time. The information that I asked for is that for which I again ask the Minister, and that is information to show who is getting the benefit of these prices. The only way that can be done is to show first what the producer of the raw material gets, what the man gets to whom the producer sells the raw material, what the man gets at the next stage, and so on, right up to the British Government. </para>

                        <para>. - I am not sure that I apprehended the reply of the Minister for Recruiting <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Orchard)</inline> to the request that copies of the literature issued at the present time shall be supplied to members of the House. I understood the honorable gentleman to say that if we applied we could have copies, but my object is to have this literature brought to the notice of honorable members who are not taking any interest in the matter, and who, when they see the expensive and wasteful character of it, may have something to say. I have had an opportunity of looking at it, and if the object is to bring the facts set out before the people, they are in the most inconvenient form possible for reading, and the quality and weight of the paper used indicates , the wildest extravagance on the part of those in control. Ministers are preaching economy, and I think that every honorable member should have a copy of every important document issued to the public by this Department, so that we may know, when we are asked to waive our right to send <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and other literature to our constituents, how Ministers are practising the precepts that they teach. </para>

                        <para>.- This morning I asked the Minister for Recruiting <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Orchard)</inline> two questions' concerning a pamphlet, or some printed illustrated matter, of which I had been able to secure a copy. I am given to understand that this pamphlet has been issued for circulation amongst the returning men. A perusal of it shows that it has been compiled mainly, in fact, exclusively, from the anti-Labour press of Australia, extracts from other papers not Australian, and from various cartoons. In the pamphlet there is the following, over the signature of the Minister for Recruiting :  - </para>

                    <para class="block">At this time, when there is so much talk about the shortage of paper, and the need for economy, we have a pamphlet of this character, which, on the face of it, appears to be circulated amongst the returning men for one . purpose only, namely, to create discord between them and that section of the community who do not see eye to eye with the present Administration either in regard to the war or the recruiting campaign. The Minister for Recruiting shakes his head; but I defy anybody who reads this pamphlet impartially to say that, from one end to the other, it is anything but an appeal to the prejudice that the Minister, or whoever compiled the pamphlet, assumes that the men from the Front possess. Personally, I believe there are any number of men who, on coming back, will treat this pamphlet with the contempt it deserves. From my contact with a considerable number, I have found that they are just as capable of understanding people who differ from them as are any other members of the community.

                            <para>- I am prepared to stand by my statements, as I have been all through, whether I am on the popular or the unpopular side, and whether I have a majority behind me or not. Before ever I came to this House I had to take my risks, and I am prepared to do the same again. It is not creditable to honorable members opposite that any member of the Government should use the taxpayers' money at a time like this, and when there is need for economy, owing to the shortage of paper, in what looks to be an attempt to stir up trouble between the men who are coming back and the civil community. </para>

                        <para>. - I am sorry the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lamond)</inline> is not present, because this morning he evidently misconstrued my answer to his question. I am quite prepared to supply each honorable member with a copy of the pamphlets in question. The honorable member was labouring under a misapprehension when he spoke about the paper. A certain number of copies were printed on special  art paper to be sent to the various Consuls-General representing the different countries as au example of recruiting efforts in Australia. Evidently the honorable member for Illawarra secured one of these particular copies. In reply to the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. -Considine)</inline> I want him to accept my assurance that when the pamphlet referred to was compiled there was no thought whatever of attaching political significance to it. No suggestion of that kind entered my mind, but I admit, now that he has drawn my attention to it, that that construction may he  placed upon it, though I can say that I was absolutely honest in my intention to compile something that the men might care to read. It was our desire; also, to use the Anzacs who were returning on furlough to assist in some portion of their spare time to secure recruits, and whilst many of the statements in the pamphlet may appear offensive to men who are eligible, but have not seen fit to enlist, it was merely our object to place the true position before our soldiers in order that they might assist the recruiting staffs in the strenuous work they are engaged in. </para>
