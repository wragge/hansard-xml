I ask, too, what business is to be dealt with before the adjournment? </para>

            <para>- The desire of the Government is to finish the present business of Parliament next week. It is not proposed at this stage to increase the number of sitting days. What will be done in that matter will depend upon the progress made this week. The Government wishes to pass the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill, the Income Tax Assessment Bill, the Defence Bill, the Apple Bounty Bill, and to get Supply for enough of the coming financial year to cover the period of the proposed adjournment. </para>

            <para>- I thought that I had made the position plain. The Government propose that the House shall rise next week if honorable members will assist towards that end. We need as much time as can be secured for the immediate study of the finances, and for taking part in the recruiting campaign. We hope to call Parliament together again early in August for a financial session, because we regard the approaching financial problems as grave enough for special treatment. </para>

            <para>- On the 19th July last the House abolished private members&#39; day. At that time there were quite a number of notices of motion on the business-paper, but, according to the practice now pursued, notices of motion which have been placed on the businesspaper at a later date take precedence over those which had previously been put on it. There are motions standing in the names of private members which have been on the business-paper for nearly twelve months, and some of them deal with matters of serious importance, but there is no present opportunity to discuss them. I believe that the practice which is followed is in accordance with the Standing Orders, but I would like to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> whether there is not some means of obviating the difficulty. I would also like to ask the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> to promise that when the House reassembles, the motion which abolished private members&#39; day will be rescinded, so that opportunity may be given to discuss some of the very important matters which have been brought forward by private members in the shape of notices of motion now appearing on the business-paper? </para>

            <para>- The business-paper is prepared in accordance with the practice of the House. There has been some interruption in the usual course of proceedings, which is largely accountable for certain aspects of the difficulty to which the honorable member  for  Franklin has drawn attention. However, I will look  into the matter, and see if some arrangement can be made without prejudicing the rights of honorable members generally. </para>

          <para>A feature of the fat cattle sales at Newmarket yesterday was the sale by Messrs. Mathieson and Davis, on account of Messrs. J. JR. and H. J. Manson, Summerlea Estate, Newry, of a truck load of sixteen wonderfully primevealers. These calves were ShorthornHereford cross, twelve to fifteen months old, and were greatly admired for their breeding and altogether exceptional quality. They realized up to &#163;19 per head, and the whole consignment made the high average of &#163;15 5s.8d. The purchasers were Messrs. W.E. Glendenning, Nicholson-street, Footscray; Mark Morris, Metropolitan Meat Market, North Melbourne, and C. H. S. Ellis, 339 Burwood-road, Glenferrie. </para>
          <para class="block">In view of the high price of cattle, will the Government hasten its decision in regard to the method to be adopted to reduce the price of meat? Cheap meat cannot be obtained while such extraordinary prices are being given for calves. </para>

            <para>- The Government considered a proposition submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone,</inline> of South Australia, last year in connexion with the building of concrete ships; but, in view of the lack of experience of that particular type of vessel for ocean-going purposes, deemed it inadvisable to proceed with it, more especially as it then had in hand the building of steel ships. The matter was again considered in the early part of this year, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone</inline> was asked to submit a definite proposition. No decision was arrived at in this connexion pending the receipt of information from the Prime Minister, who undertook to make personal inquiries while passing through the United States of America, and to furnish a full report on the question of concrete shipbuilding. Further negotiations are now being conducted with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stone.</inline></para>

          <para>. - That provision is more liberal than the one contained in the Original Act. The honorable member for Maribyrnong has raised another question - that of circumstances arising some time after the date of discharge of a soldier. Repatriation can only deal with soldiers who return and the families of those who do notreturn. We cannot, in connexion with repatriation, accept an indefinite liability. The War Pensions Act does that, to some extent, except that dependency must occur within five years of the death of a soldier. </para>

          <para>. -In the original Act discretionary power was conferred for the granting of pensions to the widowed mothers of deceased Australian soldiers. The amendment which the Minister has proposed liberalizes that provision a good deal, but there are cases which are not met by it. I refer to the  mother of a deceased or incapacitated soldier who is either living apart from her husband or whose husband fails to make any provision for her support. Prior to his enlistment the son of such a mother was her sole support. I ask the Minister if he will consider the advisability of making a further amendment to give discretionary power to deal with such cases. </para>

The amendment goes further, and includes mothers of deceased and incapacitated soldiers whose husbands are so incapacitated as to be unable to contribute materially to their support.

Her  husband went to the South African War and never returned to her. Until the sons reached earning age she reared the family. As the sons grew up they supported the mother and sister. The sons went to the war. That woman is excluded from making any claim under this measure because she is not a widow. </para>

            <para>- The mother in those circumstances should be placed in the same position as a widowed mother, without any qualification. Another case is that of a woman whose husband went to Western Australia six years ago. She was left to rear six children. Two sons, including the youngest, went to the war. When the eldest son became able to earn&#39; a living, he was the head and support of the family. He got married, and the second son. took his place. The third son &#39; also married, and the second son desired to do so. That woman is, to all intents and purposes, a widow; in fact, she is worse off, because a widow has the opportunity of remarrying. Then there are widowed foster mothers. Pour or five of such cases have come under my notice. Some of them are not in want at present, but, as they grow older, they are bound to come to a state of dependence. One woman has come to me whose adopted son was earning 21s. per week in a bank at Donald.  Her  husband was a policeman. When the son enlisted, she was not in any sense dependent on his earnings. He went to the war. While he was away -the husband died. It was only when this young man was going to the war that the woman told him that she was not  his  mother. As a matter of fact, he was her nephew. His mother died while he was in infancy, and this woman reared him as her own son. Later on the young man was killed. The woman applied for relief, but this was refused on the ground that she was only his foster mother. If this young man had not gone to the war he would have obtained within three years a higher position in the bank in which he was employed, and would to-day have been supporting his foster mother. Surely such cases are entitled to consideration. I think our object could be achieved by giving to the responsible officer thediscretionary power that is vested in the </para>

        <para>There must be thousands of these cases, and while I ask that consideration should be extended to them, I do not want the Department to be imposed upon. I know that many who have gone to the Front were not treated by their fathers and mothers as they should have been, and that some such parents are to-day receiving war pensions. It is difficult, I recognise, to draft a clause to secure the object we have in view, and at the same time to guard against imposition; but I think that the Minister should give us a definite promise that after he has conferred with his officers ho will afford us an opportunity to reconsider the clause, so that we may determine whether, as amended, it will meet our desires. I join with the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> in insisting that the clause, as it stands, does not meet the case of many deserving women. </para>

        <para>My object is to insure that returned sailors and. soldiers shall control their representatives on the various State Boards. When the original Bill was before the Committee, I endeavoured to provide for a representation of three returned soldiers and sailors, to be elected by the men themselves, and subsequently the Government accepted an amendment from its own side providing for a representation of two returned men, to be selected by the Government. The deputation that waited on the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> yesterday asked for the concession for which I asked when the original Bill was before us, and supported again yesterday when reading the remarks of the  president  of the Returned Soldiers Association at that deputation. The Minister stated that the Acting Prime Minister, or the Cabinet, had the matter under consideration, but he has not told us what decision has been arrived at. I cannot understand why the Government should refuse to give to the returned men the right to elect their own representatives, and to remove representatives and substitute for them men whom they think would act more effectively. It would be better to have matters like this controlled by those whose interests are concerned. Parliament could easily reverse its original determination in this matter. What I suggest does not raise any obstacle in the way of the scheme, but rather would enable it to work more smoothly. On the State Boards there are seven members, two of whom are returned men. If the returned soldiers and sailors were allowed to choose their own representatives that would insure the harmonious working of the scheme, and if they were not satisfied with what was being done they could withdraw their representatives and replace them with others more to their liking. I hope that the Minister will not regard what I am saying as a. personal request, but that he will remember that it is the men who are asking for this. The Government is not asked to give away anything. </para>

          <para>.- The amendment, by making the quorum of the State Boards three instead of four, seems to me a dangerous innovation. I suppose it has been proposed with a view  to facilitate the holding of meetings ; but it is contrary to the democratic principle of majority rule, because it enables two members of a Board consisting of seven members to decide matters of importance. There is an appeal from the Local Committees to the State Boards, and, in certain cases, to the Minister. The Boards are in a position similar to that of directors of a company. There might be fifty cases to come before a Board, all&#34; of which would be  carefully prepared Beforehand; but if the amendment were carried the presence of three members of the Board would constitute a quorum, and the cases would then be dealt with by a minority of the Board. If it be right to make the quorum of the Commission four, some good reason should be given for reducing the quorum of the Boards. </para>

Since the repatriation scheme has been in operation, I have noticed that a great many of those who have gone to the Minister to offer advice are not satisfied with the way in which they have been treated. During the discussion of the original Bill I said that I thought that in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> we had about the best man for the position. I hope that he is not adopting a Czarish  attitude to those who approach him. </para>

            <para>- From things that have come under my notice I had a suspicion that it was not so. There are many returned soldiers who. have served their country faithfully, and are capable of acting as members of any Legislature ki the British Dominions. They are not. satisfied with the way in which their representations have been received. I have looked carefully through the Minister&#39;s speeches without finding a cogent reason why the representatives of soldiers and sailors should not be elected by the men themselves. This is a scheme for the benefit of returned soldiers and sailors, and I desire to see as many men as possible put on the various Boards and Committees. </para>

            <para>- Yes. If the administration is not sympathetic and satisfactory to the men affected, we shall make a serious blunder. It is hard to say what number of returned men are represented by the Association, but I take it that a great number are members of the Returned Soldiers Association, and itwould be wise for those in charge of the scheme to allow that body to arrange for the selection of their representatives on the various Boards. There is an opportunity now for the Ministry to retrace its steps in this matter. Since the original Bill was introduced we have made a great advance, yet we are still only feeling our way, and must gain a great deal of experience before we shall know exactly what is wanted. Parliament will be called on frequently to review this legislation. Consequently it will be possible later to retrace any false step. I hope,  however, that the Government will not assume a hard-and-fast position, and injure the success of the scheme by refusing to allow the representatives of the soldiers and sailors to be chosen by those whom the scheme is designed to benefit. If there are capable men outside who could be selected - and I know there are many men connected with the Returned Soldiers Association who are capable - how much easier would it be to work the scheme if the soldiers on the various Boards were delegates satisfactory to the great body of men outside. If anything should go wrong, if any hitch should occur in the working of the scheme, the cause of which might not be apparent to the outsider, these men could go to the men and put the position clearly to them. They would be able to talk to the soldiers, and the soldiers would listen to them, and thus they could better understand the position. I have nothing to say against the men who have already been nominated by the Government - I believe that they are doing excellent work; but that is not the point at issue. The main thing is to give satisfaction to the great body of soldiers outside. </para>

            <para>- It shows that there must be a difference of opinion among the men. There is nothing to prevent each organization submitting nominations, after which a selection can be made. Already there is dissatisfaction among the men, and if, through the operation of this measure, further dissatisfaction is created, they will say, &#34;Why were we not consulted; why were we not given the right to appoint our own representatives?&#34; The only way in which dissatisfaction can be prevented is by letting the mcn feel that they are interested in the scheme through having their own representatives on the various bodies which are administering it. The gentlemen who have already been appointed may be ideal representatives, of the soldiers&#39; interests. Possibly, if nominationswere invited, they would again be nominated, and perhaps elected to the positions which they now occupy. But in any case it would be better to permit the men themselves to make the selection. It might possibly prevent a great deal of soreness and friction. When the men are given the right to say who their representatives shall be they may not be so&#171; ready to find fault with what has been done. The Minister would do well toaccept the amendment. </para>

        <para> The amendment submitted by the Minister to make the quorum three will be a highly desirable alteration. I do not know of any organization in which the quorum is a majority of the members of it. By requiring the attendance of four members of a State Board before business* can be done, it may not be possible to have urgent matters attended to. Therefore it is- a wise proposal to reduce the quorum to three. It will avoid the accumulation of business and obviate delay in attending to claims. </para>

          <para>. - The Minister would do well, indeed, toconsider the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Barrier. The future of the repatriation scheme will depend on the manner in which it is regarded by the returned soldier. Unless we can satisfy him, a good deal of the excellent labour put into it will be lost. Unquestionably, there is now a certain amount of dissatisfaction, which is finding expression among returned soldiers. I believe that there are three associations among them. One man will not join one association on the ground that it is a Labour organization. Another will not join a second organization because he says of it, &#34; They are your old crowd.&#34; There is also a non-political association, comprising another section of men. Beyond all three sections there is a great number of men who belong to no association. But whether a man belongs to an association or not, he should have a voice in the selection of his representatives or the Boards which are to have control <inline font-style="italic">oi</inline> the details of the repatriation scheme. As the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has said, the gentlemen who have already been appointed by the Government may be the very best obtainable, and if the choice of representatives lay with the soldiers themselves they might be the very men selected; but the very fact that the soldiers would have the right to choose their own representatives on the Boards would make them view them in a very different light from that in which they would regard them if their representatives were merely the nominees of any particular Government or party. This is about the only matter in which the people concerned are not allowed to select their own representatives. We provide that the Public Works Committee shall consist of so many representatives from the Ministerial side of the House and so many from the Opposition side, but Ministerialists do not interfere with the Opposition in the selection of their nominees, for which reason the Opposition view the Public Works Committee in a very different light from that in which they would view it if their representatives were selected by the Government, and, perhaps, forced upon them contrary to their own wishes. The method of selection throw&#39;s a great deal of responsibility on the party itself, and it would be a very good idea if responsibility were thrown upon the soldiers to take their share in the work of these Boards. It would bring them into closer touch with them. The whole success or failure of the scheme will depend, firstly, upon the work that will be put into it by the Central Commission and the various Boards; and, in the second place, upon the reception accorded to the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> and the working of the Commission and the Boards by the soldiers themselves. It is a very difficult matter to deal with some of the problems raised in regard to the treatment of returned soldiers, and which will be confronting us for the next three or four years. This matter was previously discussed, and I understood that it was to be given further consideration by the Government before an amending Bill came down. Had it not been for that understanding, the suggestion which has now been made by the honorable member for Barrier would have been incorporated in the principal Act. </para>

            <para>- I would strongly object to any particular association selecting them. I want to see the whole of the returned soldiers select them. Of course, there will be difficulties in the way of doing it, but the enormous advantages that will accrue from having the representatives of the returned soldiers selected by the men themselves will more than counter-balancethose difficulties. This is a Bill upon which we do not wish to have any divisions. The question of repatriation is as far above party considerations as I hope it is possible for any measure to be. Every honorable member and every member of the community wishes to do the right thing. The only differences among us are as to the best methods to adopt. I repeat, as emphatically as I can, that the very best way of securing success tor the repatriation scheme is to give the soldiers themselves the responsibility and privilege of selecting the men who should represent them on the various Boards. Therefore, I urge the Minister to adopt the suggestion which has been made. It will undoubtedly assure greater success for the scheme. </para>

            <para>- I have not seen the full report of that deputation, but I am under the impression that one association asked for representation. The best method is that which is applied to the appointment of all the representatives on the Boards. There is no election of industrial representatives, and the Government, in exercising its discretion, takes all the circumstances into the fullest consideration. </para>

The desire of the Government, whose attitude, I hope, is not misunderstoodby the mover of the amendment, is to give full and effective representation to the returned soldiers; and all their representations have received the fullest and fairest consideration. </para>

            <para>- Even supposing a number of soldiers were missed in the voting, it would be satisfactory if the great bulk had the opportunity to express their opinion. I quite agree with the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams)</inline> that this amendment, if adopted, would please the soldiers themselves, showing them that we have done everything we can to satisfy them in this particular. I do not know the numerical strength of the Returned Soldiers and Sailors Association; but at nearly every deputation, conference, and meeting we find opinions expressed unfavorable to the Government and Parliament, and a general request that the will of the returned men should be taken more into consideration. The Government would do well to accept the amendment, which, I am sure would result in lessening the troubles of the Minister, the Committees, and the members of this House. </para>

            <para>- That may be, but returned men in considerable numbers have urged that they should have the right to select their own representatives, and surely we ought to pay some regard to their wish, even if it does mean the expenditure of some money. Of course, this is not a party measure, for we are all desirous to do the best we can for these men. I suggest that if the men are given the right to vote, and anything arises in the working of the scheme to cause dissatisfaction amongst them, they will not be able to blame the Government or Parliament; while, on the other hand, if they are not given the right to vote, they will be afforded some grounds for a grievance, probably expressed in the opinion that the representatives selected are those most suited to the Government. The amendment gives us an opportunity to getout of a difficult position, and avoid much future irritation, which, of all things, is to be avoided. </para>

          <para>.- When I first heard of this amendment I imagined that it was suggested that certain associations or organizations of soldiers should have some power to elect representatives on the State Boards. Had that been the case I should certainly have voted against the proposal, because it would be a great mistake to give an association or organization of soldiers power on such bodies. I understand, however, that the amendment is a much broader one, namely, that the whole of the returned soldiers shall have a voice in the selection of two of the men who are on the State Boards. Up to now only a few of the men have returned, whereas some day we shall have thousands. Of those already here, I think the majority have expressed the desire to have their own representative on those bodies, and such being the case, I am not prepared to oppose the idea if it is practicable to adopt it. I see at the moment a number of difficulties, but it may be possible to arrange for the men to vote for the representatives mentioned in the amendment. If we do oppose such a request on the part of the men, we shall do the very thing that will be most fatal to the scheme; we shall create in the minds of the soldier a feeling of distrust. There is no ground for any such feeling, for it is perfectly obvious that those who have been asked, and have accepted the positions, will probably be admirable in every way. This is realized by us, but it may be difficult to make the soldiers see it. Every trouble that arises will immediately create in the minds of the soldier the feeling which I have indicated, and he will complain that he had no voice in the selection. I would prefer the amendment be not pressed at this moment; but, if it is, I do not feel justified in voting against what appears is the expressed wish of the men. At the same time, I see enormous difficulties in the way of giving effect to the proposal, which, to my mind, requires a little more consideration as to the method by which it may be carried out. A postponement would be desirable, if possible. </para>

            <para>- Not necessarily; but if the returned soldiers, who are the men most interested in repatriation, say that the men whom the Government have appointed do not represent them adequately, it is the duty of the Government to devise means of getting more satisfactory representatives. The Government have selected seven men in each State. The returned soldiers would be far more satisfied if they were given the right to choose their representatives, even if they chose the same men. Some honorable members ask whether we should allow the associations to carry out the selection. I would not. In connexion with the Wages Board system in Victoria we have an example of what can be done. If a certain percentage of the people on either side object to the Government nominees on a Wages </para>

        <para class="block">Board, an election must take place, and every person engaged in the industry has a vote in such an election. I see no in* superable difficulty in the way of the adoption of the elective principle in connexion with Repatriation Boards. The honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond)</inline> said that it would be equally as important to have that principle in connexion with, the Local Committees. I quite agree with him. The returned soldiers in any shire ought to be consulted as to their representation on the Local Committee. From the city of Richmond between 3,500 and 4,000 men have gone to the Front; over 400 have been killed, and a great number of the others have returned either wounded or incapacitated. Surely those returned soldiers living in Richmond are the people to decide who should represent them on the Local Committee. The more we give to the returned soldiers the right to elect their own representatives, the less complaint will there be. If there were complaints, then, the Government may say, &#39; &#39; You have two of your own elected representatives on the Board, and if yon are not satisfied with the conduct of the Board you have yourselves to blame.&#34; </para>

          <para>.- We ought to consider carefully before agreeing to the amendment, because every speaker has pointed out possibilities of grave danger in connexion with it. We realize the enormous responsibilities we have placed on the Minister for Repatriation. We have given him an almost free hand, and we are now awaiting developments. The Minister in charge of the Bill sought to take credit to the Government for what they have done. I  say it is a standing disgrace to the Government that, after having talked repatriation for so long, we have only reached the stage represented by this Bill. At the same time we must do nothing that has a possibility of danger, or that will create difficulties in administration&#39;. By carrying the amendment we shall not only put the Minister in a false position - that would not matter so much if we were satisfied that the results would be good - but I am afraid that it would be impossible to hold these elections, and carry on the work of the State Boards without delay, and, possibly, injury to the returned soldiers themselves. It may be possible, however, for the Minister for Repatriation to suggest a provision that, after a certain period, the returned soldiers shall elect their own representatives on the Board. The elective principle is quite practicable. A little time ago the Government allowed the wheat-growers to elect their representative on the Wheat Board, and the Commonwealth, and State Governments lent the services of their electoral officers. The election could be carried out, but it would need to be done quickly. It is possible, however, that the returned soldiers would not, in the early stages of the scheme, have sufficient knowledge to enable them to pick out the best nien to represent them in connexion with this administrative work. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> lias not shown that diplomacy for which I always gave him credit. Honorable members have frequently expressed the desire that returned soldiers should have representation on the repatriation bodies, and . I fully expected that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would have given every satisfaction to the soldiers in connexion with the nominations he has made. I&#34; cannot understand how he has failed to do so. </para>

With others who have spoken to the amendment, I foresee difficulties if it is carried. But I  urge the Minister to realize the strong opinion on both sides of the House that the soldiers should be allowed to elect their own representatives, and to endeavour to devise some method for the future by which direct representation may be given to them. </para>

            <para>- At any rate, that is what the amendment would result in, and even under the elective principle, there would be no guarantee that the best men would be selected. The amendment may at first sight appeal to returned soldiers and sailors, but we should be prepared at least to give the Bill a trial, to determine how far it satisfies the legitimate claims of the men. We ought to trust the Government to get the scheme into actual working order. If iu the course of twelve months it is found unsatisfactory in this regard, we might then consider such an amendment as this; but&#34; until we have proof that the Government proposal is unsatisfactory we should leave well alone. </para>

          <para>.- I think the Minister will recognise that the section proposed to be amended may be construed as an attack upon representation. That section provides that the Governor-General shall, as soon as conveniently practicable, appoint in each State a board of seven persons, two of whom shall be returned soldiers or sailors, and the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> desires to provide that these returned soldiers and sailors shall have been previously elected by the returned soldiers and sailors in each State. It has been said that our soldiers at the Front were allowed to vote. The difficulty in the way of recording their votes was very great, and, in my opinion, the proceedings were not fair. The ballot-papers have never been&#39; returned to Australia, although I have repeatedly asked that they should be, and I shall not be content until they are thrown open for inspection here upon payment of a fee by any person. This is a representative Chamber, and I am sure that the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Palmer)</inline> would object to a proposal to empower the Governor-General &#39; to appoint the members of this House. We have had experience of appointments to Committees by Governors in Council, and it has not been a satisfactory one. Returned soldiers and sailors justly complain of the carelessness displayed, perhaps unwittingly, by those in authority in attending to their complaints. I have had brought under my notice to-day the case of a woman who has not received a penny from the allotment of her son at the Front since 11th January last. Prior to enlisting, he used to allow her 30s. a week, and when his father was not bringing enough money into the home he gave hia mother his full  wage3  of 54s. a week. Since January last, however, she has not received a penny from the Defence Department. If the representatives of soldiers and sailors on the State Boards were elected&#39; by the( returned soldiers and sailors themselves, such an infamy would not be allowed to exist. I would remind honorable members of the recent appointment of the Director of Repatriation. Tn Heaven&#39;s name, what had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilbert</inline> done to deserve such an appointment! If my information be correct, he was appointed Director of Repatriation merely because of a promise he had received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> C. Watson and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> The honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lynch)</inline> would fill the position to far greater advantage. Was there no returned soldier available for the post? I have no personal feeling against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilbert</inline> - I do not know him - but I object to appointments to important positions being made in such a way. There are too many provisions in this Bill for nominations by the Governor-General in Council. </para>

        <para>I was glad to hear the soldier representative of Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> speak as he did, and the fact that he had to support himself with a walking stick as he spoke lent pathos and force to his words. I was glad to hear that he did not want a selection to be made by the Returned Soldiers Associations. A little while ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> published a letter signed by the secretary of one of the Returned Soldiers Associations in Perth, and within a few months the secretary and committee were dispossessed. I shall vote for the amendment, and I hope it will be pressed to a division. Returned soldiers might well be allowed to vote on . producing their discharges. Their discharges could be used just as we used to employ electors&#39; rights in the old days in this State. There should be- no difficulty in arranging for an election as proposed by the amendment, and such a &#34;system would remove from the minds of our returned soldiers and sailors any suspicion of gerrymandering. Under the Act as it stands, it is provided that the members of the State Boards shall hold office during the plea-sura of the GovernorGeneral. If the amendment be defeated, I suggest that the Minister should allow the returned soldiers and sailors to hold an election for the appointment of two members to each of the State Boards, and that the men so selected should be substituted for the nominees made by the GovernorGeneral for the time being. </para>

          <para>. -  If we are to have any regard for consistency, we must vote against this amendment. When the original Bill was before us last year, the Government gave us a pledge that returned soldiers and sailors should be represented on these State Boards, and that promise has been fulfilled. It is only reasonable that the Government proposal should be given a fair trial. Why should we ask, at this stage, for direct representation of returned soldiers and sailors on these Boards, and put the country to the expense and inconvenience of an election? The people have had so many elections during the last few years that I doubt whether they are as anxious as some honorable members opposite would have us believe, to inflict an election of this kind upon our returned men. A Government, actuated by considerations of equity and justice, could have no difficulty in selecting, with the advice of returned soldiers or sailors, men who are eminently suitable to represent them on these Boards. The amendment is really a reflection on the present members of the State Boards. </para>

            <para>- Quite so. To say that nothing has been done in the way of repatriation is merely to indulge in cheap clap-trap with the o&#39;bject of pleasing a few people outside. In carrying out this scheme, the Government have to feel their way, in order that justice may be done to the men who have done so much for us. I object to this attempt .to&#34; disparage the work of members of the State Boards, who have done their best according to their lights. They are profiting by the experience of the States, and are avoiding mistakes that were made before the Act was proclaimed. Any person of sense will gain by the mistakes of his predecessor. It would be well to wait a while before considering the request of the Returned Soldiers Association for the right to elect representatives to these Boards. Later, the soldiers themselves may not desire this. Those who represent Labour on these Boards are efficient and able men, who are thoroughly acquainted with the requirements of those whom they represent. But were an election to take place today their positions would be filled by men of quite a different stamp - by fire-eaters, whose desire would be to create disturb ances rather than to work in harmony with , their fellows for the improvement of the condition of the soldiers. Every one in Australia who knows the inside running of the unions at present knows that that is so. I hope that, as a matter of consistency, honorable members will not vote for an amendment the effect of which would be to remove from the Boards men who have not yet had an opportunity to show that they are capable of doing good work. The honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> proposes that there shall be an election of representatives, and the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> says, &#34;Hurry up with the election, get out your lists, and kick out as soon as possible those whom the Governor-General has appointed.&#34; That would be a very honorable thing to do, would it not ? Certainly I shall not be a party to dirty work of that character. </para>

Theirs is a difficult and arduous task, which I am sure they wish to discharge efficiently.

            <para>- That is so, and Parliament then determined that the representation of returned men should be given by nomination. The Act came into operation only on the 8th April last, and it is too early to propose an alteration of its fundamental principles. When a large number of soldiers have returned, and there has been a longer experience of the working of the Act, it may be desirable to make an amendment of the kind proposed. If such an amendment is then asked for by the returned men I do not think that any serious objection will be taken to it. </para>

          <para>.- I have listened attentively to the remarks of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> and of other members opposite who have opposed the amendment. They overlook the fact that a matter of principle is involved. Those who have been appointed as representatives of the returned men have not been chosen by the men themselves. I do not know the gentlemen who are now acting, and have not suggested that they are not most estimable and most capable. They may be both. Yet that does not affect the principle at issue, namely, the right of those who are represented to elect their representatives. The Minister objected to my proposal on the ground that some members of the State Boards would be nominated, and others elected. The representatives of employers and employees on the Wages Boards are elected, and the chairmen are nominated. Yet that does not effect the efficiency of the Boards. There is no-&#39; thing inherently bad in providing for two methods of choosing the members of the State Boards. The right of industrial labour to elect its representatives has been granted. There would have been turmoil in the industrial world had the Government proposed to nominate the repre sentatives of labour. The miners of Broken Hill or the miners of Newcastle would never allow a Government to choose certain men, and say, &#34; These are the most capable men to represent you.&#34; They would reply: &#34;What right have you to select representatives for us?&#34; If the returned soldiers and sailors are given the right to choose their representatives on the State Boards, they will have more respect for these Boards, and more confidence in their decisions, and this would be advantageous to the working of the scheme. If the amendment was adopted and complaints were made by returned men about the administration of the scheme, or the acts of a particular Board, the Minister would be able to say, &#34; You have on the Boards representatives that you have yourselves selected, and they have made no complaint.&#34; That is the sort of reply that is given repeatedly when industrial complaints are made. My proposal does not interfere with the administration of the scheme. The State Boards are composed each of four business men, chosen for their capacity and ability - a union representative to voice the opinions of Labour, and two representatives of the soldiers. But although these are the men most concerned in the success of the scheme, they are not allowed to choose their representatives. No adequate reason can be advanced why this right of choice should not be given. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As to the objections regarding the method of election, they can be dealt with hereafter. Reference has been made to the establishment of numerous polling booths, the printing of ballot-papers, and an expenditure of &#163;30,000 on an election. That is mere dust, raised to obscure the issue. Once it is acknowledged that the men have the right to choose their representatives, it will be an easy matter to provide the machinery of election. It could be easily done if publicity were given in the daily press to thefact that the Government had provided for the returned soldier the opportunity of participating in an election of persons to represent him. Local leagues could be formed which could select delegates to a triennial State conference, and that conference could select the men to represent the interests of the menon each State Board. The whole of the expense could be borne by the men who want the right of selecting their own representatives. The talk we have heard about the insuperable difficulties which stand in the way of achieving the end desired by honorable members is all so much moonshine. If it is right in principle to give the men what they claim, it rests with them to provide the logical and effective means of carrying it out. Let the Government provide the machinery by which the soldiers can control the selection of their own representatives on the various Boards. The men may not care to avail themselves of the opportunity if they find that the scheme is getting along successfully. That will be a triumph for the Government. On the other hand, if the scheme is not going along to the liking of the men most vitally concerned, it would be an unanswerable argument for giving them the right which I seek to give them by my amendment. </para>

            <para>- At any rate, we should have some idea of the expenditure which may be involved. I would not be prepared to agree to the amendment if I thought that a great deal of expense would be involved. I would rather see the money spent on the soldiers themselves. But there is no doubt that there will be organizations among returned soldiers from- whom it will be very easy to secure expressions of opinion, and, unless the expense involved in the honorable member&#39;s proposal is prohibitive, and provided there are no other great difficulties in the way of carrying it out, I can see no reason why the men themselves should not have a say in the choice of their representatives. The honorable member for Barrier has made out a very good case. </para>

            <para>- I do not mind telling the honorable member that I am one who believes that the producers should have direct representation on the various Boards dealing with their produce, but the result of the first application of that principle was that the farmers throughout the Commonwealth were voting for men about whom they knew nothing. That is the whole difficulty in this business. I hope that the associations formed among the returned soldiers will so develop that an election of their representatives on the various Boards may soon be conducted on an intelligent basis. The difficulty at present is for soldiers who have not yet settled down to citizen life to be able to select men whom they know, with whom the)&#39; have been closely associated, and who have proved themselves to be worthy representatives of the interests of soldiers. I admit that nobody should be better able to select the representatives of the soldiers than the men themselves, but in the existing chaotic condition of affairs, so far as returned men are concerned, it will not be as easy for the men to select persons to represent their interests, as it will be for the Minister to do so acting upon the advice of, and in consultation with, the various organizations of returned soldiers and with the men themselves. </para>

            <para>- That is my difficulty in regard to supporting the honorable member. The principle of his amendment is all right; but for all practical purposes the Minister is at present in a better position to make a selection than can be thousands of unorganized soldiers who do not know the men for whom they may be voting. When a farmers&#39; representative on the Wheat Board had to be chosen, every farmer who had wheat in the pool was entitled to vote, and in my district very many men asked me for a lead. I declined to give it. As a matter of fact, many of the candidates were unknown to me. I have no hesitation in saying that the choice made is not a uniformly popular one at the present time. Discontent cropped up after the election. </para>

          <para>.- This clause proposes to make a most important alteration, the effect of which will be to unduly restrict the operations of Local Committees, particularly in the country districts. Under the original Act, the Local Committees are empowered, subject* to the regulations, to collect funds and disburse those funds within their districts, and this clause proposes that the granting of this assistance from the funds shall be limited to the classes specified in section 22 of the Act, &#34; or for any other purpose prescribed by the regulations.&#34; Section 22 has been enlarged by the addition of certain beneficiaries, and to that I take no exception. But the proposed amendment takes away from the Local Committees their power to use the local funds without limitation to their discretion, and confines them to the persons and purposes set out in the Act. It is quite right that in the disbursement of money raised under the Act, and in their capacity as advisory bodies, the Local Committees should be confined to the Act; but the clause, as it stands, will prevent them doing much good work that they have been doing in the past by means of funds raised locally. The restriction placed on these committees by the clause is altogether too great. We are endeavouring to entice into the arena of local war work well-balanced Local Committees, consisting of successful men of all shades of opinion, who understand the district, its industries, and its people well; and yet it is proposed to limit them in what they may do with their own private funds. These funds are collected in various ways for a hundred and one different objects, which the Act, and perhaps very properly, may have omitted to provide for; and I sincerely hope that the Minister Will not press the clause in so far as it has the effect I have described. The clause will interfere most seriously with repatriation work in my own district, limiting us entirely to the cases set out in the main Act. </para>

            <para>- And also as to the purposes for which relief may be given. With the wider discretion in the past we have been able to assist cases which neither the State nor the Commonwealth could assist; and the limitation to cases specified in the Act will certainly tend to damp the ardour of the Local Committees. There is taken away that fine wholesome discretion which those who find the money ought to exercise. I hope that the Minister for Works and Railways will take an opportunity to confer on the point with the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> so as not to remove the one ground on which it has been possible for the Local Committees to make successful appeals for funds in their districts. Much original thought -and ingenuity is brought to bear, in the shape of working bees and other efforts, to raise money locally; and it would be a pity to do anything to interfere in this good work. I trust that other honorable members will support me in the views I have expressed. </para>

          <para>. - The honorable member who has just resumed his seat has made out a very strong case against the amendment proposed in the clause. I look forward to these Local Committees as a very valuable adjunct in the scheme of repatriation. Their appointment is for the purpose of dealing, as far as possible, with local men whose conditions and circumstances are intimately known to them; and if they can be encouraged to raise funds for this purpose and disburse them at discretion, every encouragement should be afforded them. The funds they raise in this way are essentially for the purpose of doing justice to their own people. If these local bodies have the confidence of the locality  and  the confidence of the Minister - and if, as they will be for the most part, they are composed of well-known men who are entitled to confidence- they may be trusted to deal with those funds in meeting the individual circumstances of those whom they desire to benefit, without any restriction such as that now proposed. The funds raised for the immediate purposes of the Act are a different matter, and must be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the Act ; but in the case of local funds for local individuals, . the Local Committees ought to have the widest discretion. </para>

            <para>- I am in full sympathy with that most appropriate illustration. On the second reading I stressed the desirability of provision being made in Australia for Imperial soldiers, with the object of encouraging them to settle here amongst the men with whom they have fought side by side. This, we recognise, is an Imperial matter; and such settlement is most desirable from many points of view. </para>

The Act provides that Local Committees shall have power to raiser- control, and disburse funds within their districts. The intention of the regulations is that grants on a uniform basis throughout Australia shall be made to specified persons, but the Local Com.mittees which are charged with the working out of the scheme may, if they so desire, raise funds to supplement, by local effort, what the Commonwealth is doing. The clause under consideration aims at defining more clearly and specifically the persons who may be benefited by the Local Committees referred to in section 12.

            <para>- Local Committees can raise funds for any purpose related to the war, provided that they obtain permission to do so. We say, in effect, that Committees formed to carry out this law may have liberty to raise and expend funds for the benefit of persons intended to be benefited by the Act; but funds for certain other purposes cannot be raised without the permission of the authorities. A controlling power exists to-day. It is already provided in the original Act that no person shall, without the permission in writing of the Commission or a State Board, invite subscriptions or organize a scheme for raising money for the repatriation of soldiers, and, under this Bill, that provision is extended to funds for any purpose related to the war. </para>

            <para>- Because there must be some supervision over the raising of funds for war purposes. An enormous burden is cast upon the community. Large sums are being raised by way of taxation and loan, for various war purposes, and there are also the funds raised for the Red Cross, soldiers&#39; comforts, and so forth. There is a limit to the power of the community to subscribe in this way, and surely its efforts should be organized in order that the best results may be obtained. </para>

            <para>- The patriotic funds are regulated at the present time by the State War Councils. There is a limitation as to the raising of funds. Regulation 13 of the War Precautions Regulations provides it. It will not be found that this provision restricts the fair and legitimate operation of Local Committees. As a matter of fact, the Local Committees deserve every encouragement and assistance, and are essentially a part of the whole scheme of repatriation. They give to the operations of the Act&#39; that personal touch of human sympathy which is so essential to success. A grant of money is often a cold and formal operation,and human sympathy is not infrequently more to a man than any monetary consideration. This clause will put the whole system on an organized working basis. </para>

            <para>- Let me put before the Committee a case with which I was intimately connected some two or three years ago. An Imperial soldier, Gunner Smith, arrived in New South Wales with a wife and five children, and shortly after there was another addition to his family. He was practically stranded, and a subscription was opened to obtain for him and his family a block of land, so that they would not have to beg on the streets. It seems to me that if this clause were adopted, it would not be possible f or any one, without the consent of the Minister, to raise 6d. for a man so situated. A considerable sum was raised for Gunner Smith and his family. A very talented young lady, Miss Dorothy Gordon, daughter of my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> A. Gordon, of Sydney, arranged a concert to augment the Gunner Smith fund, and raised &#163;132 for the purpose. If this clause were agreed to, such a concert could not be held without the permission of the Minister. On the other hand, the people of any district who desired to build a picture theatre, or to provide a public park or bowling green, could get up concerts or other entertainments to raise funds for the purpose without obtaining this permission. </para>

People should be able to get up subscriptions for a British soldier without the consent of the Minister. If that cannot be done without the consent of the Minister, no one in Australia should he able to get up concerts for other purposes without his consent. If the meaning of the clause is what I think it is, I shall do all that I can to prevent it from being passed. </para>

            <para>- He was complaining that persons are allowed to get up concerts and entertainments for public purposes without having to get the permission of the Minister, but that under the Bill they must get permission for such efforts when they have in view the raising of money for patriotic or war purposes. There would be a good deal in the objection of the honorable member if the position were as he states it ; but it is not. I take it that this and the subsequent clause will confine the purposes for which the permission must be obtained to legitimate war and patriotic purposes. </para>

            <para>- Prior to the framing of those War Precautions Regulations, an enormous amount of money was raised, and it was found necessary to give to the public some guarantee regarding the proper disposal of it, and to provide for the inspection of accounts. I quite approve of the restriction for which the Bill provides. The applications which have been made to the public have been too widespread. There have been too many funds, too many appeals, and too many methods, and many regrettable experiences could be recounted. Anything which will limit the appeals to the public, and will concentrate them on legitimate purposes, guaranteeing that the collections are for proper purposes, and that the money will be devoted wholly to patriotic and war objects, will be of advantage to the public. </para>

          <para>. - I do not think that permission ought to be refused in such a case. We cannot, however, provide for individual cases. The Bill applies only to those persons who come within the scope of our legislation. I have mentioned the various classes of persons to be benefited. If any one wishes to give assistance by raising funds to any persons not within those classes, he will have to get permission from the State Board. If a British soldier who has come here is in distress, it will not be a breach of the law for a private person to assist him. </para>

            <para>- Yes; of course, there would be nothing to prevent a few private individuals from helping such a man as I have spoken of ; but if an appeal were made to the public to form a fund, permission would have to be applied for. It is not advisable that there should be set up repatriation schemes to compete with the Commonwealth scheme. We are making an organized effort to deal fairly and legitimately with all the beneficiaries whom I have named, and we are legislating to require all who wish to raise further contributions for patriotic or war purposes to get permission to do so. But if a Local Committee raises money, it has absolute unlimited discretion as to its expenditure. The Local Committees can grant benefits and assistance in any way they like, so long as their grants are restricted to the classes of persons coming under our legislation. Whether they shall give a home, or set a man up in business, or do anything else, are matters within their discretion entirely. </para>

            <para>- The regulations conferring benefits and assistance will be uniform throughout Australia. We must lay down the principles on which help is to be granted by the Commonwealth, and they must apply uniformly throughout  the Commonwealth. But, no matter how we try- to strive for uniformity, we shall have diversity in the cases to be dealt with. There will be a man without an arm, another without an eye, a third who is capable of a little effort, but not much, and so on. An effort has been made to classify those for whom we consider it proper to provide relief. </para>

          <para>.- &#39; When I first commented on the amendment I was afraid that it limited the discretion of Local Committees in the disposal of their funds, and I am glad to have the assurance of the Minister that it does not do so. But it is abundantly clear that the funds raised by the Local Committees may be used only for the benefit of beneficiaries under the Act. Let me illustrate some hard cases which will be thus created. The Local Committees will have two sets of funds to administer. As advisory bodies in connexion with the Commonwealth scheme they will be largely responsible for the expenditure of the money provided by the Commonwealth Government, and they will also be responsible for the expenditure of the money raised locally. They will not be able, however, to deal with the case of a mother whose son has fallen at the Front and whose husband has deserted her, nor with the case of a wife whose husband, having gone to the Front, has not returned to her. Such persons, not being beneficiaries under the Act, cannot be assisted by the Local Committees, either with Hie Commonwealth money or with the funds that &#39;they have collected locally. I hope that the discretion of the Local Committees may be widened. It is quite right to limit the distribution of the Commonwealth money to the beneficiaries coming under the Act, but local funds, which are the result of local effort, should be spent as the Local Committees think best, so long as the expenditure is incidental to the war. A Local Committee should be able to meet such a case as that of a needy Imperial soldier. The Minister says that permission could be obtained to raise funds for . the assistance of a particular soldier; but it will be impossible in the working of the Act for the Local Committees to apply for permission for every case that will arise. I hope that the Government will not fetter the Committees at all. They should have the absolute disposal of the money, which, 30 to speak, has come to them on an assessment of the local conscience, which has been raised locally to supplement the Commonwealth grant. The establishment of these local funds will promote generosity. One mau will help with cash, another, perhaps, will be ready to hand over a piece of land for the benefit of a returned man. It may be that the man whom it is desired to help is an Imperial soldier. The distribution of the local funds, no matter who the beneficiary may be, should be left wholly to the Local Committee. We do not want to see two or three Local Committees appointed for the assistance of the deserving cases that will arise. I hope that the Minister will accept an amendment giving to the Local Committees entire discretion in the distribution of the locally raised money. They are now empowered, under regulation 26a, to raise funds for distribution at their discretion for the benefit of soldiers or their dependants. That limits the persons to whom they can grant assistance. </para>

            <para>- But we have no power to lay a finger on the regulations. Certainly Ave may disallow them, but the effect of doing so would merely be to hold up the work of repatriation. We cannot vary them. It is difficult to frame an amendment to meet my wishes, and as there is no one more disposed to help the soldier than the Minister is, I sincerely hope that he will draft one for me. If not, I hope that lie will promise to recommit this clause, so that in the meantime we may have the opportunity of drafting an amendment. I cannot see what holds him back from . agreeing to my request. If it meant the imposition of a new burden on the Commonwealth, or if it meant upsetting the uniformity of the regulations, exception might be taken to it, but I am merely asking for power to remove a responsibility from the Commonwealth. One thing that has prompted localities, to donate money for the assistance of returned men and their dependants is the right that each locality has had to spend the money collected. The procedure has been to circulate an individual appeal and to appoint a committee to work up united efforts. As funds are drawn out and distributed, they are kept up by means of bazaars and entertainments. One thing which induces people to continue in this good work is the fact that they realize that they are assisting men whom they have urged to go to the war. I ask the Minister to frame an amendment to meet the case. </para>

          <para>. -  The honorable member for Wannon has made out a good case. Personally, I do not care for local funds, because they have the effect of giving better treatment to soldiers in some parts of Australia than is given to men in other parts; but if we are to have local funds - and the principal Act provides for them - I cannot see what policy is behind the decision of the Minister not to allow them to be applied as the people who subscribe them wish them to be. One difficulty in connexion with the relief of dependants is the matter of defining who are &#34;dependants,&#34; and in the attempt to make general rules, injustice may be done to small sections of people who ought to be relieved if they are in distressful circumstances. If local people who come in contact with such cases are prepared to subscribe money for them, I think that the Government should rather welcome that assistance than seek to prevent its being given. Every honorable member must have had experience of some peculiar case which might make bad law if a general principle were laid down to deal with it, but which ought to be relieved if it is possible to do so without bringing in other people who ought not to benefit by it. What object can the Government have in attempting to prevent local people from helping an Imperial soldier? If Local Committees wish to help any soldier who has fought during the war on the side of the Allies, they should not be prevented from doing so if funds are raised in the district for that purpose. There is no tendency on the part of any locality to put money at the disposal of a Committee unless a good case is made out for the people who need the assistance. A striking case has to be made out before the public will advance funds, and where such cases exist the Government ought not to step in and attempt to prevent help being given. With the object of getting some definite decision on the matter, and in order to avoid the risk of recommittal being refused when honorable members may not be in the chamber, I feel inclined to move an amendment to strike out the words &#34; any of the classes of persons specified in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a, b, c,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of section 22 of this Act.&#34; </para>

          <para>. - I  ask the honorable member not to move any amendment. He seems to imagine that the Bill is intended to interfere with all sorts of local funds. The object of a  repatriation measure is to constitute an organization for the assistance of repatriated soldiers. Part of that organization is the system of Local Committees, which are endowed with the power of raising funds for the purpose of granting additional benefits to the persons covered by the Act. The object of the measure is not to constitute committees for the purpose of collecting funds for all kinds of purposes. One honorable member has suggested that funds might be collected for the purpose of assisting Imperial soldiers. Another honorable member would assist distant relatives of soldiers. Still another honorable member might seek to raise funds for the purpose of building a club house for returned soldiers. The Act lays down rules for the organization of a Repatriation Department to grant certain assistance to soldiers, and it defines the area over which that assistance can be spread. It may be a very laudable object to help an Imperial soldier - I am not saying a word against it - but that is not the purpose for which the Act was passed. We are not asking for Local Committees tobe appointed for that purpose. We are asking them to administer the provisions of the Act, and if they consider that our grants are not sufficient for the persons under their jurisdiction they will have power to raise extra money for that purpose. </para>

            <para>- The purpose of the scheme is to assist the classes of persons which are designated in the Act. Local Committees are to be constituted with a view to assisting in the administration, and they are also empowered to raise funds to supplement the grants that are made under the Act, with the provision, however, that the funds so raised be applied to the assistance or benefit of the classes of persons specified. There is no limitation on their power of spending the money. The regulations limit the nature of the grants that can be made  by  the Commonwealth authorities, but not the nature of any assistance that may  be  given by the Local Committee out of local funds to the persons specified. Honorable members have urged a limited extension of the Act. The Minister desires to see the Act in operation, and to judge its results, but he has promised to take into consideration one of the cases mentioned by the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> - &#39;that of a mother whose husband nas deserted her, and who was dependent upon a deceased or incapacitated soldier. The Minister regards that proposal as well worthy of consideration. The object of the Act is to secure, as far as possible, uniformity; but if different committees were assisting different  persons  in different ways, there would soon  be  a complaint, &#34; In some other districts certain benefits can be obtained, but in this district they cannot.&#34; </para>

            <para>- No; the Act constituted these Committees with definite powers and jurisdiction, and it is better that they should do the work which they were appointed, to do rather than that they should have power to engage in activities which are not strictly within the scope of the Act. Honorable members have expressed a desire that Imperial soldiers should benefit by the funds that may be raised by the Local Committees. Not very many of those men are likely to come to Australia. Of course, we shall welcome all who do come, but they are excluded from the benefits of the Act. </para>

            <para>- At the Repatriation Conference some of the States did not agree to include Imperial soldiers; and for that reason the scheme did not come into operation uniformly. Moreover, the State Act is limited to land settlement. This Federal Act deals with everythingbut land, settlement, therefore Imperial soldiers are outside its scope. I ask honorable members to realize that we are starting a big scheme which will involve the country in enormous expenditure, and that every extension will lead to further extensions. I suggest that the scheme should be allowed to operate for a time; then, if defects or injustices are disclosed, the Minister will endeavour to remedy them. It is very easy to open wide the doors at this stage, but if later we find that the doors are too wide, and we try to stop the flood of expenditure, we shall find ourselves in difficulties. </para>

I warn honorable members that if we extend the Act in the direction suggested, and some districts grant relief that is not now con templated in the Act, there will soon follow an agitation that the Commonwealth should undertake the whole work, and treat all districts alike. This scheme has been carefully considered by the Minister, who throughout has acted in a very generous and sympathetic way. He has no desire to unduly limit the benefit of the Act; on the contrary, he would like to grant even greater benefits than the Act contemplates. But we must be. limited by the exigencies of the financial situation. I ask honorable members not to press the amendment. </para>

            <para>- Quite so. There are many cases in respect of which Local Committees, by reason of their special knowledge, should have the power to assist in settling such soldiers on the land. The Minister will surely recognise that such assistance would be outside the local administration of Government funds, and would be confined to cases incidental to&#39; the war and to soldiers of either the Mother Country or the British Dominions. This is, therefore, a British Empire proposal. Where Imperial soldiers have come to Australia, and their interests have become those of the districts in which they have settled, it is surely reasonable that Local Committees should have power to help them. </para>

            <para>- None whatever. The Minister has explained that it is proposed by this clause to so amend the Act as to give the State Boards control of patriotic funds. That is only incidental to the Act, and is not part and parcel of its objects. It is a slight departure from the purpose of the Act designed to provide for the proper control of patriotic funds, and it would be absurd to go outside these Local Committees, and to require new committees to be formed to assist those who, although directly or indirectly connected, with the war, were not members of the Australian Imperial Force. The amendment is strictly and rigidly limited, so that the Minister can without hesitation accept what, after all, is only a nominal departure from the object he has in view. Numerous cases showing the necessity for such an amendment have been cited, and </para>

          <para>.- It does not appear to be recognised by those who have not followed the whole of this discussion that the amendment does not provide for the expenditure of any Government funds in assisting those to whom it is to apply. It is simply to give generous and charitable people power to raise funds to assist, or to spend their own money in assisting, British soldiers to settle upon the lands of Australia. Some two years ago <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Rider</inline> Haggard visited Australia, with the object of arousing interest in a project to settle British soldiers, after the war, on the spare lands of the Empire. I accompanied him in his travels through three of the States, and know that he opened up communications with each of the State Governments. Victoria, Tasmania, and Western Australia agreed to include British soldiers in the whole of their land settlement schemes, while Queensland decided that there should he power by proclamation to include them in its land settlement scheme. In January, 1917, a Conference, attended, with one exception, by, all the State Premiers, and also by the State Ministers for Lands and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> was held under the presidency of <inline font-weight="bold">.Sir Alexander</inline> Peacock. The Minister in charge of the Bill is under a misapprehension as to what happened at that Conference. </para>

This point was strongly pressed by the Prime Minister, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ashford,</inline> Minister for Lands in New South Wales, said he did not think that his State would be able to provide sufficient funds to permit of the inclusion of British soldiers in its land settlement scheme. All the other States agreed to the proposal, and before the Conference closed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ashford</inline> practically withdrew his objection to it. It was a case of hands across the sea, so far as the States were concerned. The Commonwealth Government alone is withholding its hand. </para>

            <para>- That may not be its intention, but unless this amendment be made that will be the effect of the clause. There may be some doubt as to the attitude of New South Wales, but practically the whole of the States are prepared to throw open their land settlement schemes to Imperial, as well as Australian, soldiers. They are prepared to assist British soldiers to settle on their land, knowing that, after the war, Canada, the United States of America, and the Argentine will bid highly for them. &#39; They want these soldiers to add to their populations, and to become the fathers of future generations. Many such soldiers will wish to come to Australia, and if they could get assistance under our repatriation scheme they would make every endeavour to come here with their families. </para>

            <para>- I regret that I have done so. I say, with particular reference to the amendment, and to the clause, that means must be found for assisting these most desirable immigrants to settle on our land. We have been told that it is impossible for the Commonwealth to provide funds for the purpose, because the financial demands that will foe made upon it in connexion with the repatriation of our own soldiers will be too great to prevent us from providing for any others. The amendment, however, seeks to allow generous individuals to subscribe towards the cost of settling on the land deserving, persons who are not Australians. </para>

            <para>-  His  was a typical case. He arrived in Sydney, with his wife and five small children - subsequently a sixth was born - -under  the impression that the New South Wales Government was providing farms for British soldiers. He was a British soldier who had been invalided. He reached Sydney with little or no money. Practically every fund there was was applied to for assistance, but none could be granted. Private subscriptions had to be obtained to buy him a house and land. If the Bill becomes law as it stands, it will be impossible for private persons to help an Imperial soldier so placed, unless the consent of the Minister has first been obtained. The Minister has made it clear that no committee may. under the Bill, raise funds for the relief of any but the beneficiaries provided for by our repatriation legislation. </para>

            <para>- Why should it be necessary to obtain the consent of a Minister? Our Ministers have very onerous duties to perform, and are exceedingly busy men, so that they cannot deal immediately with any matter that is put before them. A man and his children might be begging in the street before Ministerial sanction could be obtained for efforts towards his relief. In any province of Canada, the Australian soldier, if he likes to settle there, will be given the same treatment as a soldier from New Brunswick, British Columbia, or elsewhere, and the six States of Australia have endeavoured to reciprocate with other parts of the Empire in the matter of providing for the settlement of soldiers of the Empire. But the Commonwealth Government has bolted and barred the door against soldiers other than Australian soldiers, by providing that Commonwealth money shall not be expended in assisting any but Australian soldiers, and it is now.-  closing up every crevice by providing that no organization or committee shall be allowed to collect funds to assist British soldiers to settle on land in Australia. I do not say that that is the intention of the Government; but it is the effect of its legislation. I trust that the Committee will insist upon the reconsideration of the whole matter, and will support the amendment. </para>

          <para>.- One must have a good deal of sympathy with those who support the amendment; but in these matters we must go cautiously. We all desire, not only to repatriate the Australian soldiers, but also to assist all the soldiers who have been fighting for our cause. Our first duty, however, is to our own soldiers. When the war is over, we shall probably have thousands of men returning every month, until we get them, all back, and it will be difficult enough to provide avenues for their employment. I do not think that a hard-and-fast rule should be made to prevent outside bodies from raising funds for patriotic purposes, but it is right that the Local Committees under the repatriation- scheme shall be required to apply the moneys that they raise to augment the Government grants for the assistance of our own soldiers and their dependants. If they were unfettered in regard to the distribution of locally-raised money, and there was a big influx of British soldiers before we could get our own men properly placed, it might happen that all their money would be absorbed in assisting settlers from other parts of the world, and the Commonwealth would then have to bear the whole cost of repatriating its own soldiers. It is thought that after the war there will be a big influx of British soldiers, and, naturally, the Local Committees would endeavour to do what they could to place these men on the land. But the result might be that they would then have no money to augment the Commonwealth grants. We shall find it difficult, in any case, to provide a sufficient sum to carry this scheme into effect. Our income taxation will have to be doubled or trebled, and money must be obtained from the wealthy by other means as well. </para>

            <para>- I shall&#34; refer to that effect of the proposal. I admit it. No one is more sympathetic than I am towards those who have fought for the Allies&#39; cause, and I will do all I can to assist them; but there is one omission which we should rectify before we attempt to assist those who are not our own citizens. I refer to Australians who have enlisted in the Armies of our Allies. I understand that Australians who enlist in. the Forces of Great Britain or any of the Dominions are to be treated as members of the Australian Imperial Force under this measure; but there are many Australians who have enlisted in the American Army for whom provision should be made. I do not know whether the naturalization laws may interfere, but I ask the Minister to consider the point, in order to make the Act apply to all Australians, whether they enlist in the British Forces or in the Forces of our Allies. </para>

        <para>While it is necessary to have some controlling authority in regard to patriotic efforts, we may be interfering too much. It will always be found, in country districts, that a dozen or a score of persons do all the work in connexion with patriotic movements. I know several districts which have been working steadily towards the erection of monuments &#39;for the lads who have died in fighting for our cause. They have collected a few hundred pounds, and, by promoting sports meetings, concerts, and various kinds of entertainments, have been making steady progress towards the ultimate object of raising several thousands of pounds ; but now, unless they can get permission from the State War Council, they are not allowed to raise any further moneys for that object. When we begin to interfere with these local efforts, there will be a tendency to sour those people who have been devoting their efforts to the particular causes they have at heart. I quite admit that, in our anxiety to prevent the misuse of patriotic funds, and undue attempts to raise moneys for different purposes, it might have been deemed necessary to issue regulations under the &#34;War Precautions Act with that end in view, especially seeing that we have to face the money market from time to time for the purpose of raising war loans; but there should be some elasticity in the administration of those regulations, so that permission may be obtained by local bodies to continue the good work which they have already in hand. </para>
        <para>I hope that it is desired that assistance shall be given to all soldiers who have enlisted and fought in Allied countries; but, before that is done, we should look after our own people. We find that, when our men have married abroad, their wives have not been able to get a separation allowance. Such things do not tend to help recruiting. At the first blush, I was inclined to support the honorable member&#39;s amendment; but, taking everything into consideration, and realizing the necessity for making ample provision for our men when they return before we can take on a bigger contract, I am afraid that I cannot give it the support which I was at first inclined to give. When we have our own men settled, and further avenues of employment are opened up, we may be justified in bringing others to Australia; but, until Ave do so, we are not justified in extending assistance to them.  If we do what honorable members suggest, and our own men find, on their return, that they cannot secure employment, they will naturally complain of others being brought out here and assisted into positions. The best thing we can do is to devote our attention to finding employment for our own brave lads after they return, and if we have any vacancies afterwards, we shall be only too pleased to invite others to come here. </para>

          <para>. - I  was going to suggest the deletion of the words &#34;dependants&#34; and &#34;relations.&#34; If that is done I shall support the amendment, sincerely hoping that the Minister will concede the point desired by honorable members. The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> rather stressed the risks we might undertake by doing what is proposed in the amendment, but the Commonwealth Government are not asked to stake a single penny on the concession asked for. It is only to apply to money raised voluntarily, and if the Government find that any abuse takes place they can always step in and prevent it. Many hundreds of young women have left Australia as nurses. Some of them have been away for three or four years. If one or more of them have married a British soldier who has become partially incapacitated, it would be extremely hard if, on her coming back to her birthplace with her husband, no aid could be given voluntarily to him by any local body. It would not be British fair play to debar any district from raising money for that purpose, and to compel all the funds raised to go into one source for distribution as the Government direct. If people wish to go outside the taxation which will have to be paid for the repatriation of our own soldiers, and provide money for other purposes, it would be taking away the liberty of the subject to prevent them from doing so. I sincerely hope that the Minister will see his way to concede this slight amendment. &#176; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Considine.</inline> - Should there not be a reciprocal arrangement between the British Government and the Australian Government to eliminate this charity business? </para>

            <para>-It is a question of voluntary contribution. Surely men who have worked in Australia, and amassed wealth here, should have the right to expend some of it on soldiers who have been fighting for our liberty ? In any case, I do not think it should be considered to be charity. If I give anything to a soldier in those clrcumstances I would not consider it as charity. I would consider that I waa merely repaying a debt which I owed to him for what he has done for this country and the Empire. </para>

        <para class="block">Government proposals. It will not affect the Government funds. It will not take away Government control of the repatriation scheme. It will simply allow Local Committees freedom to supplement their operations by giving assistance to Imperial soldiers, as well as to Australian soldiers. I cannot see why the Government should oppose the amendment. If there is a fountain of charity actuated by a recognition of the value of the services rendered by others than our own soldiers, and if there is a desire to settle them in Australia, it cannot be regarded as being anything which is detrimental to a repatriation scheme applied solely to our own soldiers. The repatriation of our own men must be our first consideration and responsibility, but it will not be minimized by the honorable member&#39;s proposal. Surely there is no reason why, supplementary to our scheme, efforts should not be put forth to assist soldiers from other parts of the Empire. </para>

        <para class="block">So that land settlement legislation in Queensland is wide enough to recognise the duty which we owe, not only to our own people who enlisted in Australia, but to the Australians who enlisted in Great Britain, to the Imperial British soldiers, and to the soldiers of the Allied Powers. This amendment does not pretend to cover all that ground, but it certainly affords us an opportunity to recognise what has been done by Imperial soldiers, and I think there is considerable virtue in it on that account. There is just one other point which I should like to have cleared up. Section 12 of the principal Act empowers Local Committees to raise and control funds and to disburse those funds.

          <para>.- The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> has been good enough, not merely to move the amendment on my behalf, but&#39; to frame it. In it there are- involved two sets of interests, both of which might be placed in jeopardy if they were - linked together. I refer to the., widening of the field of Australian beneficiaries under the Act, and to the inclusion of members of the British Imperial and Dominion&#39; Imperial Forces. I would be very sorry indeed if the Committee were deprived of an opportunity to decide each of these matters separately. While I am perfectly in sympathy with the extension of the principle we have already adopted, namely, Empire reciprocity, so far as repatriation is concerned, I am of the opinion that the presence of tHe Prime Minister in the Old Country affords a fitting opportunity for him to negotiate upon this matter, not only with the Imperial authorities, hut with the Dominion statesmen who will be represented at the Imperial Conference. We have adopted this principle in our State legislation, which will, of course, be the most costly side of repatriation, because what we are undertaking to do for every individual soldier under this scheme is small, indeed, compared with the obligations which the States themselves have undertaken - an obligation up to a maximum of &#163;2,500. I ask the honorable member for Kooyong either to amend his amendment or to withdraw it, so as to enable some provision like the following to be inserted: - &#34; The granting of assistance and benefits to any persons who have enlisted or fought with the Australian Imperial Force in the present war, or any relative or dependant of such person..&#34; The Minister may say that the term &#34; relative &#34; is too wide.-. If we were providing in the principal Act for any &#34;relative,&#34; the term would be too wide. But where we are  merely granting a discretion to the Local Committees, I do not think that it is. Moreover, this discretion will be granted to those bodies without any obligation on their part to pay. Therefore, I ask the Minister to accept the word &#34;relative,&#34; relying upon the wisdom of the Local Committees and the limitation of their funds, to constitute an adequate safeguard against any possible abuse. If the honorable member for Kooyong will withdraw his amendment and move a fresh one in the direction I have indicated, it will afford us an opportunity of extending the scope of the measure, of increasing the number of beneficiaries, and of dealing with the many cases which the principal Act does not cover. </para>

I am very loath to urge objections which may appear to be in the nature of technical objections. But I emphasized again and again this afternoon that this Bill relates to an Australian soldiers&#39; repatriation scheme, and that any attempt to include in it an amendment of this character is an .attempt to introduce something which is outside the scope of the measure. </para>

            <para>- I ask the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> not to move the amendment he has outlined. The amendment now proposed is really outside the scope of the Bill. I told him before the adjournment for dinner, that if he would afford me . an opportunity I would look into the matte-r and see to what extent it was possible to meet him. I endeavoured, before the suspension of the sitting, to get some guiding principle which would assist me in the drafting of an amendment which would harmonize with the scheme of the&#62; Act. If the honorable member for Kooyong will withdraw his amendment dealing with the Imperial Forces, I will consent to the clause being postponed, with a view to seeing  if it is not possible to draft an amendment to give effect tb the intentions of the Committee. But I would remind honorable members that there is a limit beyond which we cannot go, without danger of incorporating in the measure something which is altogether outside its scope. If we adopt the principle that Local Committees may raise funds locally to provide for &#34; relatives &#34; or &#39; &#39; dependants &#39; &#39; of returned soldiers--- </para>

          <para>.- While I agree with the necessity for keeping free from sale all properties and chattels created by money given or lent, so that a soldier may be saved both from himself and his creditors, there is a difficulty with which this clause does not seem to deal. I allude to the progeny of stock, and also to the replenishing of stock acquired for the purpose of carrying on a business. A sum of &#163;150 may be granted under regulation 60 for the establishment of a business to one of the three classes of persons specified, and it may &#39;be necessary to actually sell the capital, as it were, to carry on the business - to sell the chattels acquired for the purposes of the business or trade. Under this clause a person so selling goods would be technically guilty of au offence, and liable to a penalty; and some arrangement should be made to meet such cases. The very character of the business may require a man, in order to obtain a livelihood, to sell goods which have been given to him. </para>

He purchases  300  or  400  ewes, and in the course of time he has, say,  200  lambs. What would happen if he then sold the ewes or the lambs, as any business man would do, since otherwise he would be overstocked ? </para>

          <para>.- There is another aspect of the matter which I hope the Minister has considered. Honorable members have heard something of the Returned Soldiers&#39; Settlement Act passed in Queensland. Only quite recently, I was requested by some of the committees in that State to ask the Government to make it possible under this amending Bill to finance soldiers to the extent of the deposit required by the Queensland Government under  the Returned Soldiers&#39; Settlement Act of that State. It may not be generally known to honorable members that under that Act it is necessary for the soldier to have land of his own on which to build, or to put down a deposit of  25  per cent, of the total cost of the building in order to take advantage of the Act to secure the erection of a dwelling. &#39; It is considered by several of the committees&#39; in Queensland that if the Repatriation Department would finance returned soldiers to the extent of the deposit required under the Queenslaud Act, that would be as cheap a means as could be adopted for their settlement. It has to be borne in mind that, under their Act the Queensland Government would take a lien over the property; and, in the circumstances, I am afraid that this clause, if passed as it stands, would prevent the returned soldier from mortgaging his property to the Queensland Government to secure an advance. The Queeusland Act is a very liberal one, and allows something like forty yars for the repayment of money advanced. </para>

          <para>. -  This Bill will meet what the honorable member for Moreton desires. A regulation might be . issued providing that the Comptroller, or a State Board, may grant a returned soldier  &#163;75  by way of a deposit for the purpose of taking up land or for the erection of a dwelling. If, having received that money, the returned soldier converted it to his own use, and did not apply it to the purpose for which it was  given him, he would be liable under this clause. </para>

            <para>-  My question really is whether, under this clause, the returned soldier might use the  &#163;75  as a deposit to enable him to take advantage of the Queensland Returned Soldiers&#39; Settlement Act, and give the State Government a lien over his property. The Minister will see that it would be a lien over the deposit also. </para>

            <para>- I understand the honorable member&#39;s difficulty. Obviously,- if the amount is given to the returned soldier for the purpose of making a deposit under the Queensland Act, he will be authorized, to take all the steps necessary to expend it for the purpose for which it was given, and these may involve the giving of the lien the honorable member speaks of. That would not be prevented by this clause. This clause applies only where a man has been granted money for one purpose and uses it for another. If money were given to. a returned soldier to enable him to pay a deposit inorder to take advantage of the Queensland Act, and he applied it to some otherpurpose, he would become liable under this clause. </para>

A man may be carrying on a business for a time, and find himself involved in liabilities. Security is a condition on which the loans are made. In some cases mortgages are being given. Recently I was informed that in New South Wales a young man who had started a business found that he could not carry on, and the State War Council, as mortgagee, took possession, and sold up the business. </para>

            <para>- Not at all. The amendment means that before the Lord Mayor of a city can organize any movement, having no relationship to repatriation, he must get the permission of the Repatriation Commission, or of a State Board. The Minister has indicated the clear line of demarcation which exists between repatriation responsibilities and other Commonwealth responsibilities to the soldiers. The day a soldier is discharged, he becomes the guest of the Commonwealth in respect of repatriation, but prior to that time the Repatriation Department has no interest in him whatever. The Lord Mayor of Melbourne may desire to create a fund to give comforts to men who are in the trenches, or to insure the lives of men who have not yet joined the Forces, or to stimulate recruiting by guaranteeing to the wives and children of eligible men that some provision will  be  made for them, apart from anything the Government does in their behalf. Why should he be subjected to the unnecessary humiliation of applying to the Repatriation authorities for permission to do that patriotic work? We would do well not to confuse with- repatriation independent efforts that have nothing to do with  repatriation  . </para>

          <para>. - Some authority must be intrusted with this responsibility, and the State Boards are properly constituted to deal with it. The function of looking after the welfare of the soldier was formerly vested in the State War Councils. It is provided by regulation 13 that any person who, without&#39; the approval of the State War Council, or in the Northern Territory without the approval of the Administrator, invites subscriptions or organizes any scheme for raising money for a patriotic fund or fund in relation to. the war, other than the Australian Soldiers&#39; Repatriation Fund, is guilty of an offence against the War Precautions Act. This body is taking over the function of looking after and safeguarding the soldiers, as far as repatriation is concerned, and this clause widens the original Act in that respect. It is fit and proper that this body, which considers all applications in the State in connexion with all the returned soldiers and their dependants, should have the authority to decide whether new patriotic funds should or should not be started, because they might conflict with the work being done by the Commission and the Boards. It is not desirable to have the funds duplicated. </para>

            <para>- I do not know who does it, but the War Precautions Act is obviously the proper place to deal with a temporary matter of that kind. The limitation of appeals to the public for repatriation purposes is properly included in the permanent scheme of repatriation, but regularly appeals are made to the public on behalf of the Red Cross, the Allies, and so on. All of these are proper subjects of appeal to the charitable public, and the response has been magnificent, but if the promoters have to obtain the permission of the Minister for Repatriation or of the Commission, they will run the risk of having their movements entirely blocked. </para>

            <para>- Yes; but not under the repatriation legislation. On a previous clause the acting AttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> quite properly pointed out that this was a Bill to deal with the repatriation of Australian soldiers, but on this clause he is arguing in the contrary direction, because no one can suggest that the promotion of carnivals, button-days, flag-days, and so on for patriotic purposes is in any sense associated with repatriation. They are merely matters of a temporary, character that will cease with the war. </para>

            <para>- The only danger of conflict will arise through the Commission fearing that an appeal for patriotic purposes may prejudice their appeal for repatriation purposes. That is not a fair position to put these patriotic organizations in. So far they have organized many splendid efforts for the benefit, not of the soldiers who have come back, but of those who are still , on the other side. For instance, I have been trying to interest the Government in the prisoners of war, especially civilians, in Germany. If it had not been for the organized philanthropy of the Australian people attending to the necessities of those prisoners, we should have had a much more sordid tale to tell. The Commission, whose interest in repatriation is local and permanent, should have no control over other organizations whose splendid efforts are directed to the assistance of the soldiers while they are away from Australia. Undoubtedly some control over patriotic funds is necessary. I have had instances brought under my notice of very regrettable occurrences in connexion with patriotic efforts and appeals, and it was not before time that the Government took action to control and limit them. A satisfactory control is already provided under the War Precautions Regulations. Why not leave it at that? Why give it to an outside body which may exercise a prejudicial influence on patriotic efforts? </para>

            <para>- That is the only danger, and, indeed, it may be the only reason for incorporating the provision in this Bill. It is quite possible that the Repatriation Commission may say, &#34; We are going to shut down on all these patriotic efforts in order to conserve the finances of the country for repatriation purposes.&#34; Australia is sound enough, loyal enough, and sympathetic enough to look after the repatriation of our soldiers, and also to do everything possible to&#39; help them while they are on the other side. I do not think the Repatriation Commission should be intrusted with this power, and I shall, therefore, vote against the clause. </para>

          <para>. - I should like to have from the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> a statement as to what will be the.position of patriotic societies if we pass this clause. The Anzac Club, in which I am interested, has collected a considerable sum of money, and has done much to alleviate the sufferings of the men at the Front. My reading of this clause is that it would be necessary under it for that club to apply again to the Commission for permission to carry on. It is questionable whether the Commission would be conversant with the working of the club, and pressure might be brought to bear upon it to wipe it out altogether. The Minister would help his case if he would give us an assurance, that existing clubs already established for patriotic purposes will not be interfered with. The Anzac Club had great difficulty in obtaining permission to carry on owing to the opposition of another body which objected to its use of the name &#34; Anzac.&#34; </para>

            <para>- That is so. The Anzac Club . got permission to carry on only after considerable trouble. Pressure was brought to bear upon a certain gentleman to prevent its establishment, but it is doing splendid work. Ladies and gentlemen associated with the club pack parcels of comforts for the nien overseas, and their work is followed up at Home, with the result that very few parcels fail to reach their proper destination. Is this &#39; club to be de-registered and compelled, so to speak, to go cap-in-hand to the authorities to gain permission to continue its efforts? It has a secretary and treasurer, and publishes from time to time a balancesheet detailing its operations. Everything associated with it is straight and above-board, and I should like to have from the Minister an assurance that such bodies now in existence will not be interfered with if the clause be agreed to. If I receive such an assurance I shall be prepared to vote for the clause. </para>

            <para>- I do not think so. The Government are proposing to largely expand the . power for which the original section provides. We should not attempt to block up the channels of charity. Xf the clause were agreed, to as it stands, I should have to obtain special permission if I proposed to bring together a committee of half-a-dozen men to build a home for a soldier. The necessity for this amendment of the principal Act has not been shown by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom).</inline> I recognise that the Government should have power to control patriotic funds, but they should be prepared to repose some confidence in public-spirited persons who are ready to make efforts to assist individual soldiers. I have not too much confidence in. some of the State Boards, and fear that they will be somewhat of &#39;an obstacle to the success of the scheme. Let us stand by the original section, which gives charitable persons an opportunity to exercise their philanthropic instincts. </para>

          <para>.- Since the Minister last addressed the Committee I have looked still further into the question &#39;, and am more satisfied than ever that this proposed amendment of the principal Act would drag into it a principle that has nothing to do with the repatriation of soldiers. I have been told over and over again by the honorable gentleman that the clause does not take from the people any power they already possess. I disagree with that view. I have illustrated my argument by referring to the case of a British soldier, Gunner Smith, who was assisted by public subscriptions, the holding of concerts, and so forth, to settle in New South Wales. We bought him a piece of land, and built him a home, so that he and his family would not &#39; have to go on the streets. This clause would take away from the Local Committee the power to deal with such a case without . the special permission of the Commission. The amendment will prohibit the raising of subscriptions for any people who do not come within the four corners of the. Repatriation Act. At the present time we . have this right, without the consent of the Minister, to raise subscriptions for soldiers who have fought for the Empire. I emphasize that we are dealing with a Bill to amend the Australian Soldiers&#39; Repatriation Act. Why, therefore, has this amendment been dragged in? It deals with a totally different matter altogether. I am quite prepared to drop my proposed amendment if the Minister in charge will withdraw the amendment now before the Committee. The section of the Act is quite sufficient as it stands. I am afraid, however, that I shall have little chance of converting the Minister unless I get his attention for a moment or two. </para>

            <para>- Yes, or in the waters under the earth, has this amendment, been introduced? The section of the Act is ample, and I submit that the amendment does uot come within the scope of the Bill at all. It asks us to omit certain words from the clause, and to insert words which will have the effect of prohibiting any one from inviting subscriptions or raising money by any means for any patriotic fund, or any fund in relation to the war. I should be delighted to assist the Government in taking whatever steps may be necessary to control all funds; but I do object most strongly to this attempt to single out only patriotic and other funds in relation to the war, and to place them under the ban of Ministers who may be exceedingly prejudiced men - not, of course, such men as now control the affairs of the Repatriation Act. The amendment, I repeat, is entirely outside the scope of the Bill, and I shall oppose it. </para>

          <para>.- I am pleased to know that the Government are seeking to do what the amendment will provide by legislation instead of by regulation. If the clause is amended as proposed, Red Cross Societies, and other societies engaged in war work, will have to ask for permission to raise funds, and I do not think that is right, because the time might come when a Minister would raise an objection to the button days for Red Cross purposes. At present they do not have to ask the Minister for Repatriation for permission. </para>

          <para>- I approve of the Government doing what is sought to be done by legislation instead of by regulation; but I think that, in this Bill, we should keep to repatriation matters only, and not seek to amend it so as to provide that permission must be obtained from the Minister for Repatriation before any effort can be made on behalf of any patriotic purpose. It is quite possible that a Minister for Repatriation, by virtue of his office, might be more&#39; in favour of efforts for repatriation than any other patriotic purpose, and he might argue that, as the Red Cross bad spent a large sum of money - I believe they have spent about &#163;500,000 throughout Australia - he could not agree to a proposal on behalf of the Red Cross Society. Those of us who heard what the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> had to say withregard to the splendid work done by the Red Cross for returning soldiers on the <inline font-style="italic">Llanstephen Castle,</inline> each man receiving a parcel to the value of &#163;3, except the unfortunate fifty men to whom the honorable member particularly referred, will contend, I believe, that the Red Cross should not be placed in the position of having to apply for permission to raise funds. </para>

            <para>- The same might be mid with regard to the New South Wales&#39; war chest fund. Speeial efforts are continually being made in various districts. One of the last public appearances of the late Chief Justice Madden was in connexion with such an effort at South Melbourne. A week before there had been a similar effort at Hawthorn; and, still earlier, one at Richmond, all for the benefit of blind soldiers, for whom a couple of thousand pounds was raised in one district alone. The . Minister for Repatriation, if asked to grant permission for such efforts, might refuse it, on the score that the- repatriation scheme was doing all that needed to be done for the help of these men. Only a fortnight ago I met the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> when he was assisting in the big Red Cross appeal in Melbourne, and similar appeals have been made ia Adelaide and Sydney. It should be possible to continue this work without having to go to the Repatriation Department for permission. </para>

          <para>. - When last I heard the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> speak, he contended that it would be most improper to introduce into the Bill any &#39; provision relating to any matter other than repatriation, and, according to the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers),</inline> the one thing that was needed was to authorize the Local Committees to spend money on objects other than repatriation.

        <para>My object in rising, however, was to ask why there are to be two authorities controlling the raising of funds? Obviously the State Boards are to supervise only the collections for patriotic purposes, or other purposes connected with the war, which leaves all other forms of collecting under the State &#34;War Councils. If it is necessary to regulate the collection of money for patriotic purposes, it seems more necessary to regulate the collection of funds for all and sundry purposes unconnected with the war. Indeed, there are only a few objects for which such collections should be permitted during the continuance of the war. </para>
        <para>I do not agree with the contention of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor).</inline> My experience is that persons who interest themselves in the activities of the Red Cross, War Chest, Comforts Fund, and other associations, have an understanding of the various war problems, and a common desire to do all that can be done to promote the success of the efforts to deal with them. In the big cities, we find the same men and women doing all they can to collect money for all the funds. Therefore, I think it is wise to place the regulation of collecting under the Minister for Repatriation; but I would go further, and require all applications for permission to collect money for any public purpose to be made to him. </para>

            <para>- Every little town has its patriotic committee, and almost every battalion has its comforts fund, the workers for which meet each week to knit socks, and make other articles, and some of them appeal on the streets for contributions. Is permission to be obtained from the Minister for Repatriation for all these efforts? Then you have local societies appealing for subscriptions for the building of homes, and others for the erection of memorials in honour of fallen soldiers. We say to them, &#34; You cannot go on with this work without the con sent of the Repatriation Board.&#34; What has it to do with the Board? </para>

            <para>- In connexion with &#34;welcomes home&#34; the same argument applies. The Minister asks, what about the State War Council? I am not going into that, further than to indicate that I have mentioned that matter in this House before. By the passing of this measure all these bodies to-day in existence - in connexion with which many of the lady helpers have been loyally toiling since the war began - will be in the position, because Parliament has passed another law, of having to make application for approval to go on with their good work. They will be saying, &#34;Is that the way you indicate your appreciation of our efforts? Have you nothing better to do than to pass legislation to compel us to seek the approval of some fresh body in order to carry on our organizations? &#34; The effect will be that those loyal folk may become tired of the work on which they are engaged. </para>

            <para>- It is these patriotic bodies that keep the war interest brightly burning. If we quench their spirit, not only will their immediate activities be  injured, but we shall be striking a blow at recruiting; everything else, in fact, that is tending for good in this war must slump. Local interest in patriotic movements from one end of Australia to the other must be fostered. We cannot afford to put obstacles in the way of these loyal workers. It may be said, &#34; It is not much to ask them to make fresh application &#34; ; but they do not look at it in that light. It may be that they are unaware of the exact procedure; and in all such dealings with officialdom many folk are apt to feel considerably harried, and may hesitate to proceed with their labours. </para>

        <para>This is not a matter concerning repatriation at all. And, if we must regulate all the various funds, let it he in some other way than is proposed here. The clause is ample as it stands. &#34;Where is the necessity for amending it? We shall gain nothing by it, while we shall be causing ill-feeling amongst worthy and patriotic people. Why should we, as a Parliament, adopt such an attitude? If there was anything to be gained, I would be in accord with it. But there is nothing to be gained, and everything to be lost. Since this is not a matter affecting parties at all, surely the good sense of the Committee must prevail, and the Minister must see that he would not be justified in pressing for the amendment. </para>

            <para>- I was about to&#39; raise that point. But, first, as to the remarks of the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> concerning the discouragement of loyal and willing workers, I hold that, contrary to depressing and discouraging those splendid people, this amendment will protect and definitely encourage them; because there is a great danger in these continuous appeals of dissipating the energies of loyal and consistent workers. So far as the Red Cross Society and the Cheer-up Society and other excellent organizations are concerned, they need this protection. There is a possibility of discouraging them because of the very lack of concentration. There are too many efforts; too many societies growing up. And then there is another element of danger. I do not like to call them bogus societies, but there is a fear regarding the promotion of efforts devoted ostensibly to patriotic purposes, but which really are for other purposes, that a very small percentage actually goes to the object for which the appeal is made. That sort of thing ought to be suppressed. I do not share the concern stressed by the honorable member for Hunter that the Commission will essentially be hostile to patriotic efforts other than for repatriation purposes, but I feel that the control of the matter might better be left in the hands of the Minister. </para>

          <para>. -  As the functions of State War Councils have been very much reduced, it is necessary to have some statutory body endowed with the power given in the amendment.  The Commission appointed by the Australian Soldiers&#39; Repatriation Act is a statutory body, as are also the State Boards, and they exercise some of the functions previously carried out by State War Councils. </para>

            <para>- That matter is not touched by this proposal. Horse-racing is dealt with by a special regulation which is quite apart from this provision. If application is made by any persons who wish to promote functions for the purpose of raising patriotic funds it must be submitted to a State Board. Requests have been made that funds raised for patriotic purposes should be placed under some properly organized body. That is a reason for seeking to insert this provision in. the Bill. </para>

            <para>- Patriotic funds have a great deal to do with repatriation. The State Boards will be dealing with soldiers and their dependants. If any body can have a proper knowledge of the position it ought to bea State Board. Their object will not be to destroy existing funds. It will be merely to regulate the times at which appeals shall be made for funds and the methods of appealing for them. One object will be to attempt to have some system about the matter, instead of one appeal conflicting with another. </para>

            <para>-  I rise to a point of order. The principal Act and this Bill deal with funds devoted to the purpose of repatriation only. The Minister has already indicated that funds raised in Australia for the assistance of Dominion or Imperial soldiers would fall outside the scope of the measure, yet he seeks to get power to control funds quite beyond the purview of repatriation work. If his contention in one regard is correct, then the converse is also correct, namely, that there is no power in the Act to prevent funds being raised for purposes other than repatriation. The State Boards are to be intrusted with <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> power to prevent the raising of certain funds which have nothing to do with repatriation, but have to do with other patriotic objects which fall right outside the scope of repatriation. Therefore, I contend that the amendment is not in order. </para>

          <para>.- I quite agree with the idea underlying the words which it is sought to introduce here - the idea that a proper control should be kept over patriotic funds, and that these funds should be systematized. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">But this does not appear to be the proper place to provide for that. The soldier has quite a lot. of friends who do very many things for him. The efforts of those who ,are anxious to assist him are largely directed to two classes of soldiers. The first class embraces those who are going away on active service. Efforts are made to provide comforts for these men, for the soldiers in the trenches, and also to assist the Red Cross. The other class of soldiers comprises those who have returned from active service abroad. Now the repatriation scheme is primarily interested in the soldier upon his return to Australia. Consequently it appears to be impossible to cast upon those interested in one side of this patriotic work the duty of determining the opportunities which shall be afforded to those who are interested in the other side of it. It is almost analogous to making one competitor the judge of another competitor. In my view, if there is one class of persons who should be prevented from exercising control over the patriotic efforts of various organizations, it is those who are actively associated with such schemes themselves. </para>

          <para>. - Already for patriotic purposes there is an organization of a very complete character in every municipality throughout Australia. Each municipality, with the consent of the State War Council, has been allowed to organize in( certain ways. It is true that no uniform plan has been adopted. Each district knows its own conditions, and is seized of its own advantages and disadvantages. Take the Essendon Red Cross Society by way of illustration. Every worker in that organization does not turn up at the Town Hall to work. Instead, a considerable amount of the work is allotted to church guilds. These have their evenings for knitting, &#38;c, and for the distribution of the comforts which they provide. When a bundle of comforts is finished, it is forwarded to the Essendon Town Hall, whence it is despatched to the head body in Melbourne for transmission to the soldiers abroad. If the Minister is going to introduce a new system now, all the organizations which have been in operation for the past three years will have to re&#39;-register, and it is quite likely that some of their particular plans may be banned by the new authority. Thus confusion and irritation  will be created. Instead of harassing these splendid workers, we ought to encourage them in every possible way. I trust that the Minister will pay some regard to the expressed will of the Committee, and will hesitate to interfere with the work of these patriotic organizations. </para>

          <para>.- I hope that the Minister will consider the almost unanimous representations of the Committee. So far, only one speaker has supported the view that has been expressed by  th6-  honorable gentleman, and hitherto there has been no adverse criticism of the measure. The only criticism indulged in has been of an entirely constructive character. The point put so well by the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> ought to weigh with the Minister. It will be greatly to the disadvantage of the different bodies who have worked so well for the benefit of the soldiers to feel that they have to come under the supervision and control of a new body with new powers, and, possibly, a certain amount of jealousy concerning their work. I agree with the Government that these functions ought to be controlled in some way; it should be by some Minister, and not by a competing body. </para>

            <para>- Honorable members on this side desire to stand loyally by the Government, and honorable members opposite show no disposition to embarrass the Minister. &#34;When all are really anxious to help, I think the honorable gentleman ought to give way. Otherwise there will be trouble, for  I,  personally, do not feel inclined to silently follow the Minister. In my own constituency there are route marches, the necessary funds for which are obtained from the sale of buttons and gifts in kind. &#34;We often find, after paying for the route march, that there is a surplus; and I ask whether, if we continue this work, as no doubt we shall under the new scheme, we must ask this body to superintend the matter. I appeal to the Minister to do what is generally done when a Committee is found to be unanimous, and gracefully accede to our wishes. We ought not to be forced to give a party vote, or, indeed, a vote of any kind on the question; and the reasons given by the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> seem quite sufficient to justify the Minister in giving way. I feel quite sure that if the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> had heard the speeches he &#34;would have adopted a different attitude. If the Minister in charge persists in setting himself against the whole of the Committee, we are certainly not a deliberative body. </para>

The Local Committees can be a power for good. If the right men are chosen, they will be men of experience and capacity, and if we try to tie them&#39; hand and foot by directions from headquarters, we shall damp their enthusiasm. </para>

          <para>.- At first I was entirely in favour of the idea of giving Local Committees power to collect funds with which to help any cases which seemed to them deserving. But I now see a danger in the proposal. While the war is in progress, and the people are full of enthusiasm, the Local Committees may collect funds and assist many persons who are outside the scope of the Act, but as soon as the enthusiasm dies down, as it will, and those persons who have been receiving voluntary assistance areno longer getting it, the cry will be raised that they should not be dependent upon voluntary effort, but that their help should be undertaken by the Government. There is a danger that in years to come our repatriation scheme may be on a par with- the American war pensions list. I think the Civil&#39; War terminated fifty-four years ago, and the pensions are now six times larger than they were at that time. </para>

            <para>- If we are to drag into this scheme every relative or person dependent at every possible opportunity, there will be no end to it. It is quite possible that the repatriation scheme will involve an expenditure of &#163;30,000,000 or &#163;40,000,000, and no matter how the rich may be taxed, the production of Australia will not be increased. With the present cost of civil government, and the expenses of war and repatriation, there is a limit to what this community can afford to undertake. </para>

          <para>. -  I do not think the definition in the amendment is sufficiently wide, because it confines relief to dependants, and honorable members know the difficulties that are put in the way of dependants in connexion with both repatriation and pensions. A young man who, as an apprentice, was just earning enough to keep himself when he enlisted, will come back after two or three years, by which time he would, in the ordinary course of events, have been contributing to the support of his mother. But, according to our legislation, the mother in such a case is rated as a dependant only to the extent of her dependence at the time when her son went to the war. Therefore, she will not be able to get the full benefit to which she is really entitled. The Local Committees are prevented from giving any relief to those who suffer, now that the soldier is absent, because they did not suffer at the time he went away. I know of soldiers who made no allotment of their pay, because at the time they went to the Front their parents were not in need, but since they have been at the Front some breadwinner in the family has died, and the others have become dependent upon the soldiers. Had they remained in Australia they would have helped their relatives, but the Local Committees have no power to grant relief to relatives, because they were not dependent when the man went away. Our legislation is putting outside the scope of relief a number of persons who are deserving of the benefits of the various funds. There are no committees going about the country hunting for persons to whom they may hand  out money that is not needed. The Local Committees desire to be able to help cases of absolute need, and should not be prevented from doing so by cast-iron regulations. We should try to cure the evil effect upon recruiting, caused by the knowledge of cases of hardship, to which no relief can be afforded under the existing legislation. The Government have no right to prevent the Local Committees from giving aid where aid is needed and when they are doing it with their own money and in their own districts we have every guarantee that the purpose of the Act will be achieved. </para>

            <para>-  On a point of order, before the Minister postponed this clause, an amendment was circulated by the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best),</inline> which contained in substance the amendment tha.t has been passed, and that of which the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> has given notice. I informed the Committee that I did , not propose to risk the provision that I desired to have inserted in the Bill by including it. with another, namely, the proposal to include the British Imperial and the Dominion Imperial Forces in an amendment to enlarge the beneficiaries associated with our own Australian Imperial Force. The honorable member for Kooyong, at my request, withdrew his amendment and gave notice of another. The honorable member for Grampians then notified the Committee that he would, at the right time, move  a  certain amendment, and I contend that the amendment made on the motion of the Minister does not deprive him of the right which was practically conceded to him by the Minister and the Committee. </para>

            <para>- During the second reading of the Bill I raised this question, and in Committee the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> supplied me with an entirely new and rather . effective argument in favour of the amendment when he said that the Bill was largely an experiment, that we were feeling our way, and that the Minister for . Repatriation should be afforded an opportunity to see how the scheme would work out. The debate on the Bill throughout has shown that honorable members on both sides are anxious to assist the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> in making this an efficient, workable measure. It is very evident that honorable members have a first-hand acquaintance with it. We know what we intend so far as repatriation is concerned, but we have no guarantee that the LocalCommittees may not operate the law in a way entirely different from, that intended by Parliament. It would, therefore, be rather an education for honorable members themselves to discover the working of the Act, as they would do if they were associated with the committees charged with its administration. I have already pointed out that certain members have taken a keen interest in repatriation, and have an extensive knowledge of the working of the scheme. The debate has also shown that many honorable members are quite competent to take an active part in its administration. But neither in the Bill nor the scheme is opportunity afforded members of Parliament to exercise their talent, and to give the Government any assistance in the administration of repatriation. I think Local Committees would afford the most reasonable opportunity for such work on the part of members of Parliament. The objection was raised as soon as I moved, this amendment that honorable members already had enough to do. We have plenty to do, but I know of no work that will demand closer attention, and be more worthy of our close attention, than that associated with repatriation. Many other matters will claim our attention and consideration, but there is not likely to be anything more important than this scheme, particularly in its initial stages. We are not only laying down new principles, but have to set this machinery in motion,, and it will depend upon the way in which we start it whether we have friction or smooth working later on. Every honorable member wants to have an active share in the work of repatriation, not only in theHouse, but in the filtration of the scheme throughout the country. I am not asking too much in proposing that an honorable member should be on the- Local Committees within his own division. He may not be able to attend all the meetings, but he can be a consultative and advisory member. . When the recruiting campaign was started in the early part of 1917, the member for each Federal division in the Commonwealth was <inline font-style="italic">ex officio</inline> chairman of the Recruiting Committee in that division. </para>

            <para>- It will cost just what a generous and patriotic people, who subscribe out of their own pockets, may decide; not one penny more, and not one penny less. If the Government had not insisted on amending section 21, there would have been no necessity for my amendment now. Under the Act as it _ stood, it was quite possible for any Local Committee to raise funds for any soldiers whowere settled on our lands. I think that, considering the relations between Australia and the Mother Country, as well as the other Dominions of the Empire, the least we can do is to allow the collection of subscriptions to assist Imperial soldiers who may come to Australia and settle upon our lands. Unfortunately, owing to the fact that a large number of members do not attend at all during the debates in this House, but only come in when the division bells are rung, the House and the Government have drifted into a position which it would be impossible to justify. </para>

          <para>. - I desire to move an amendment, which, I hope, the Minister will accept. This Parliament should have some control over the State Governments in the purchase of land upon which to settle our returned soldiers. At the present time there is no authority connecting the two schemes; and, in perusing the reports of the Premiers&#39; &#39;Conference held in Janu ary, 1917, I find that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> made a strong point of the fact that the Commonwealth should exercise some supervision over the expen diture of the many millions of pounds that will . be required for the purchase of land. That is a responsibility which Parliament should not seek to evade. We shall have to finance the various State Governments with large sums of money, and I know, speaking of my own State, that, unless adequate supervision is exercised, there is a strong probability that many hundreds of thousands of pounds will be wasted. </para>
