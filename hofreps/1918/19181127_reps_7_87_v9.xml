I thought that the honorable member was referring to Ministers of State, whereas his observations had reference to ministers of religion. </para>

Of that I know nothing, but I shall make inquiry to ascertain the facts. It was not the intention of the Government that the law should be altered except as to rates of tax, the alteration that Parliament authorized. The incidence of the tax was not affected by the Act recently passed. </para>

I have the Highest admiration for the organizing ability of Captain Dyett, and for such of his officers as I am acquainted with.

                        <para>- The honorable member was at the head of the Treasury Department for some little time, and should know that the Estimates of expenditure from revenue deal with no war expenditure that needs to be altered. The general war expenditure of the Commonwealth is being met out of loan money. How far it may be necessary to alter our loan expenditure proposals, circumstances alone will determine, but the signing of the armistice does not make it necessary to remodel the ordinary Estimates of expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- King Charles' head again ! Apparently the governing desire of the honorable member is to stir up strife between two of the most amiable men in the world; I refer to the two senior members of the Cabinet who are now in London. In accordance with the understanding with his colleagues here, the Prime Minister has been in consultation with us as to how far administrative work in connexion with the demobilization of Australian soldiers, &amp;c., requires the presence of a Minister in London. Just before the signing of the armistice, we were considering with him the subject of demobilization in the event of a possible termination of hostilities. We asked him to take charge of the matter while he was in London, and he is now doing so. How long he will be able to stop in London must be determined by the events of the next two or three months. All that is known at present is that a Minister will be called upon to direct from London the demobilization and the embarkation of Australians for Australia until the bulk of our men are returned. That will be done in conjunction with the highest civil and military authorities, for the use of whose brains we can arrange. When the Prime Minister knows when it is likely that he will leave London, we will be able to determine whether the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> should be asked to remain, or whether a Minister should be despatched from Australia. There the matter stands - just as I have told the honorable member. </para>

The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has handled - the matter week after week, and the only result of his efforts so far has been the extension of the contract from 30th June last to 31st December next. I can obtain no better information than that; but in the last communication on metals generally that I had by cable from the Prime Minister, he said that he thought the termination of the war would render it difficult, if not impossible, to secure an extension of any contract for which provision had not already been made. I notice, according to press statements - I have no direct information on the point myself - that the British authorities have made a free market in certain metals. If that report be confirmed by cable. I shall take steps to see whether Australia cannot obtain the advantage of that free market. </para>

                    <para>- My attention has only been called to-day to the fact that, on 4th June last, the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pigott)</inline> asked the Minister for Price Fixing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> certain questions arising out of statements that had been made by myself in regard to wheat payments. I think that the honorable member who sought to controvert my statements should, at least, have intimated to me his intention of putting those questions .to the Minister. </para>

This would have worked out at from8s. to 10s. per bushel net. This sale was refused on the ground that the British Government wanted the wheat to feed her armies and the civilian population. He applauded the farmers for their great patriotism and generosity to Britain. But the farmers should get credit for their self-sacrifice, and not have it drummed into them until the story became nauseating that they should go down on their knees and thank God for Billy Hughes, their saviour. </para>

                    <para>As a matter of fact, the payment for wheat to small struggling farmers only worked out at from 2s. 6d. to 3s. per bushel, instead of something like 4s. 6d. net as promised. The first dividend of 2s. 6d. did not clear the farmer of the expense of producing his crop. He was left in debt. The storekeeper in many cases supplied inferior goods at high prices because the farmer could not pay cash. The farmer was then charged from 8 to 10 per cent. interest on the account. When a " divvy " of 6d. came along it was mopped up with interest charges and excess charges for goods, and still left the farmer in debt. The same operation took place when the next " divvy " of 6d. was paid, which meant that those small dividends did not really go to the farmer, but to the army of middlemen supplying him with financial accommodation. </para>

                <para class="block">I notice that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> in answering these questions, challenged the accuracy of my statements generally. In the first place, my information as to the price being paid to farmers in Canada was taken from the records of the British House of Commons, in which it was set out, that the farmers were being paid something like 8s. 2d. per bushel for their wheat on the farms in Winnipeg, Canada. Secondly, as to the offer of Armours to buy wheat in Australia in 1916, it is within my own personal knowledge that that offer was made. The Minister referred to Armours as the " great meat-packers," insinuating, with something approaching levity, that it was ridiculous to suggest that meat-packers would be seeking to buy wheat. As a matter of fact, his own information on this subject needs to be corrected, since Armours have a great wheat-buying department. </para>

                        <para>- I contend, sir, that I was misrepresented by the Minister in his attempt to throw doubt upon my statement that Armours, whom he described as meat-packers, were a big wheat-buying firm. The truth is that they have a large wheat-buying department, and are one of the largest buyers of wheat in the world. Their wheat-buying department is managed by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey.</inline> In the middle of 1916 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Calkins,</inline> the manager of the Chicago-Milwaukee-St. Paul railway, was in Australia endeavouring to arrange with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> for a new line of steam-ships to connect with the port of Seattle. </para>

To that extent, he will be in order in setting himself right - in putting the right complexion on the matter, so far as he himself is personally concerned. Beyond that he will not be in order. A personal explanation is allowed by indulgence of the House; but it cannot be reverted to as a, means of debating a subject generally, or criticising the views or actions of other honorable members. </para>

                        <para>- The Government have had the control of the sale of metals for some time, and it is hardly likely that there will be any relief given until peace is completed. At the present time there is a good deal of fear that a large number of people may be thrown out of employment unless some guarantee is given in regard to price. Will the Government consider the advisability of giving some guarantee for a short period, say, quarter by quarter, in order to keep the industry going ? </para>

                            <para>- I have just explained the position in regard to copper as fully as I think I ought to at this stage. I waa under the impression that the general desire of certain members, and of certain interests in the country, is that we should relax all these things at once. Relaxation if it means the freeing of the market is one thing; but if it involves such action as guaranteeing price, I think that is equivalent to Government control, because we should have to play some part in the industry. In present circumstances, I am not prepared, to make a guarantee to the copper producers of so much per ton of yield, but I am prepared to stand by the statement I made to the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> a moment ago. </para>

                        <para>- As there is a question on notice in relation to blind soldiers I am not at liberty to answer portion of the honorable member's question, but in regard to the other matter I may say that there seems to be a misconception of Australia's position in regard to pensions. In the earlier days of the war we did fix what the pension should be for officers and men, but since then we - probably the first country in the world to do so - have brought forward a repatriation scheme which is superimposed on the old pensions system. It is not fair to judge the reward that the soldier gets in any of the circumstances the honorable member has referred to entirely from the scale of pensions appearing in the schedule to the War Pensions Act, because there is added to it a liberal supplement, which the Minister for Repatriation is giving in certain circumstances. I am not qualified to say whether in every case it meets the circumstances of the' individual applicant's life, but I do say that the two - the war pension together with the supplementary grant given by the Minister for Repatriation - form a more generous allowance than any other country has yet provided for its soldiers. </para>

                        <para>- Totally blind soldiers receive full pensions, together with an allowance, in certain circumstances, of £1 a fortnight to provide for an attendant. As the Repatriation Department is arranging for additional benefits to blind soldiers in special cases, an increase in the pension rights to blind soldiers will probably not be necessary. The matter will, however, be kept under notice in connexion with any amendment of the law. </para>

                </talk.start>
                <para>Profits  Tax Act, I should like to put  before  the  House  the difficulty which occur  under  standing order 159 in relation to this and similar measures. For some unknown reason that standing order does not permit the first and second readings of a Bill to be taken on the same day,  and,  as a consequence, only three  courses  are open to Ministers. The first  is  to circulate the Bill for press and public criticism  before it  has come before Parliament, which is an objectionable practice, and should not be permitted to contiuue. The second course is for the Minister to  explain the  measure on the motion for leave, but  that  presents two disadvantages, viz., honorable members have not the Bill in their hands, and cannot follow the explanation in detail, and, also, there is induced a double second-reading debate. The third course is to obtain leave to suspend the Standing Orders, so that the first and second readings may be taken on the same day, and the explanation of the measure given when a copy of it is in the hands of honorable members. I propose later to ask the Standing Orders Committee to consider this matter, and recommend a reform measure. In the meantime, I shall ask the House to suspend the Standing Orders so that the second reading of the Bill, which is now to be proceeded with, may be taken immediately after the first reading. That course is particularly necessary in connexion with this Bill, which involves an amendment of a highly technical Act, and unless honorable members can follow the explanation in detail, their difficulties will be intensified tenfold. </para>

The Standing Orders safeguard the rights of honorable members. I presume that there will be distributed with the Bill a memorandum showing how the proposed alterations will affect the principal Act. </para>

                    <para>The Bill provides for certain amendments in the original Act, which experience has shown to be necessary. The Government is alive to the fact that during the past twelve months there has been a sustained agitation for the repeal of that Act, but having considered the matter carefully, Ministers have decided that they would not be justified in proposing its repeal. They have been guided to this conclusion by two considerations: the prospective yield of the tax for the coming year or years - a sum which the Treasury badly needs to cover its necessities - and that it is within the knowledge of the Commissioner for Taxation that excess profits have been "registered during war-time by many different classes of business. We feel that the necessities of the Treasury make these profits a legitimate object of taxation, k am aware that the Act has proved irritating to many persons ; one could not be many months at the head of the Treasury without knowing that. I believe, too, that to some extent it has retarded new business enterprises, and has discouraged the expansion of existing undertakings. I hope that the proposal now submitted may relieve the situation, causing the tax to operate more equitably and with a less repressive effect. Accompanying the Bill is a memorandum showing the effect of the proposed alterations, additions being given in black type and omissions marked in erased type. </para>
                    <para>I propose to take in order the sections that we desire to amend. Section 8 deals with exemptions. We propose to increase the exemptions. First of all, the profits of shipbuilding undertaken under contract with the Commonwealth are to be  exempt. There is ample justification for these exemptions in the need for stimulating and encouraging an industry which is a war-time and post-war necessity. We feel that we should relieve those who embark in this industry from the anxiety or difficulties which might be caused by the taxing of their excess profits. </para>

                            <para>- The amendment is framed to apply only to the profits arising from the building of ships under contracts made with the Commonwealth between the 4th August, 1914, and the Declaration of Peace. The profits of certain mining businesses - such mining businesses as shall be specified by proclamation - are also to be exempted. The proclamation will set out the extent and conditions of the exemption. Coal mining is not to be exempted. Gold mining is exempted under the principal Act, and so is the mining for certain metals, such as tungsten and allied ores, if the output is disposed of to the British. Government, and if it was begun within the time prescribed by the original Act. The proposed amendment will permit of the exemption of tin mines begun since the 4th August, 1914, and of the mining for other metals if for any reason, such as the low-grade quality of the ore being worked, it is considered desirable to give an exemption. The provision is framed in an elastic way, and it was due originally to the strong desire evinced by the large section of the community interested in tin mining to obtain relief for that industry. </para>

                            <para>- It is excluded from exemption in the original Act, and there is a good reason for the exclusion. The price of coal has risen enormously since the war began, and, although charges have increased, certain mines, even with a diminished output, have made profits which should be taxed. However, I propose to deal in detail with objections when the Committee stage is reached. The profits of agency work arising exclusively from commissions on purchases or sales, wherein little or no capital is required, are exempted. This will probably involve a loss of revenue amounting to £20,000. Under the original Act commercial travellers, and those whose remuneration is fixed regardless of the business done, are the only agents whose profits are exempted. Under the Bill it is proposed to exempt from taxation agents whose business income is derived exclusively from commission, and whose capital expenditure is little or nothing. The provision in the original Act has, of course, been much debated, and I think that a reasonable compromise is now proposed. We shall still keep within the scope of the original. Act agents whose business is not the result of personal exertion, but is chiefly the reward of capital. </para>

                    <para>Under section 11, where a business has not had one pre-war year, or the business has become remunerative only since 4th August, 1914, the Commissioner may grant concessions regarding the tax, but he can do so only to insure the financial stability of the business concerned. Under this provision it has been impossible to avoid harshness in some cases. It is now proposed to widen the discretion of the Commissioner so that relief may be given not merely where the payment of a tax would affect the financial stability of the business concerned, but also in cases in which, in the judgment of the Commissioner, the severity of the tax should be abated. There may be a difference of opinion on this, as on other provisions, but the Commissioner has plainly expressed his view that the discretion proposed would be exercised without hardship, and would considerably improve the operation of the law. The Commissioner will also be empowered to allow to any new business such a percentage return on capital as he may determine to be just by reference to the pre-war profits of established taxable businesses of the same kind. Where- the new business is not of the same kind as any other established business, but is actually a new industry, the Commissioner is to be authorized to allow such percentage return as he may think necessary in the circumstances of the particular ease. A " new business " is defined in the Bill as one that was not commenced until on or after the 4th August, 1913, and was not reasonably established until on or after the 4th August, 1914. " Established businesses " are all other . than new businesses. These proposals ave, from many points of view, the crux of the Bill. The argument against the original measure was that it would operate not only to discourage, but even to crush, new enterprises. Of course, there were other objections, as that no allowance was- made for the growth of existing enterprises resulting from the prudent employment of capital. In studying, the circumstances of the new businesses that have come within the 1915-16 assessment,, it is plain that the tax has operated with repressive effect. The Act allows to new businesses. a maximum return on capital of. only 10 per cent. A new boot-making business may have to compete with an old-established business, which made on the average, in pre-war times, a profit of 15 per cent. The old-established business would still be allowed to make that profit during the period of this accountancy and taxation. But the new man, who has to buy and. sell in the same market, is allowed a maximum profit of only 10 per cent, on his capital. The amendment now proposed will have the effect of asking the Commissioner to allow to such businesses as these which are in competition with old businesses, and have not a pre-war standard, the average rate allowed to the old businesses with which they are in competition. Tn this way we feel that the load will be lifted off new enterprises, and that they will start off scratch with the old businesses with which they come into direct competition </para>

                            <para>- I was about to deal with that matter. My explanation has dealt only with new businesses relating to familiar occupations and industries. But there are in Australia a number of new industries having no competitors in respect of which any pre-war test can be made. In such cases one can adopt only arbitrary methods. This Bill, therefore, gives the Commissioner power to look into the circumstances in which such a new industry is established, to take into account all its risks, and the possible difficulty of continuing it when post-war conditions" arise and international competition is re-created. He will have power to allow as he thinks fit a fair profit rate before excess is awarded. This is safeguarded to the Commissioner and to the individual taxpayer by the other main provisions of the principal Act. The Commissioner does not finally decide all these matters. The principal Act provides for a Board of Referees to  whom  appeal can be made if the decision of the Commissioner is not regarded as satisfactory. If the decision is regarded as niggardly or as not being fair in all the circumstances of the case, appeal may be made to the Board of Referees. We are really giving primarily to the Commissioner, and secondly to the Board of Referees, power with regard to new industries, to take into account all the related and attendant circumstances, and,' before taxing excess profits, to allow what, in their judgment, is a fair amount of profit, having regard to all the circumstances of the case. </para>

                            <para>- I think not, because, whether we appreciate the fact or not, there have not been very many new industries established in Australia during the war period. We could well do with a great many more. At the same time a number of new industries have been started, while others have been diversified ; but the task of the Board of Referees an regard to this class or group of businesses will not be beyond their compass. </para>

Before the war some businesses' were earning 25 per cent., and in regard to competitive businesses, under the provision I have just explained, if the prewar test was 20 per cent, or 25 per cent, new enterprises will be given the same allowance as the old ones received. By this means both classes will be put on an equality. </para>

                    <para>I come now to section 12 of the original Act dealing with alterations of capital. Additional capital is at present entitled to the same rate of profit as the- old capital. This means that a business is exempt from tax on profits earned by new capital up to the percentage of the pre-war profits, or 10 per cent., whichever is the greater. It is now proposed to allow only 10 per cent, in respect of the new capital. Reversely a reduction of capital,- under this amendment, will affect the case at the rate of 10 per cent., whereas under the present law the rate of the pre-war standard is used in the calculation. To put the position more clearly before honorable members, let me explain that if a business which, before the war, had a capital of £100,000 and earned 25 per cent, profit, doubled its capital during the war period, them- under the principal Act, it was allowed a 25 per cent, profit in respect of the new £100,000 of capital. We think that that was excessive liberality on our part. We therefore propose that with respect to capital existing in a business, and brought forward from the pre-war time, the pre-war rates, whatever they were, shall be allowed, but that with  repect  to capital added during the war,- instead of the pre-war rate, only 10 per cent, shall. be allowed. This provision will be objected to strenuously by a certain class of taxpayers who,- in a quite unexpected way, escaped taxation under the original Act. I am quite satisfied, however, that when honorable members come to deal with the matter as a principle, quite apart from the incidental effect of its operation as a tax, they will see that this is a fair provision to make. It is impossible to estimate what revenue this new provision will yield, but I think it will bring to the Treasury a fairly substantial sum. Hence honorable members may expect that it will be resisted by certain individuals; but it is a tightening up of the Act where it should have been tightened up originally. </para>

                            <para>- It will apply to every kind of capital, and with respect to. new capital,- it will confine these businesses to the absolutely non-increasing maximum of ]0 per cent. That, I think, is fair.  It will not depress the reward of old capital in existence before the war; but we say to those who have extended old businesses by the addition of new capital, " We shall allow you in respect of these tragic times, when you might well have expected less encouraging conditions, a return of, at least 10 per cent, on your capital." That, I think, in view of all 'the circumstances, is very reasonable. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that; there might be a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> extension of business by way of the introduction .of fresh capital; but we say, in any event, that in. respect of new capital introduced, the profit allowed shall be only 10 per cent. This law is retrospective. The Act as originally imposed was to apply to the year beginning on 1st July, 1915, and closing on 30th June, 1916. That was the first year in respect of which an assessment was to be made, and the taxation in respect of that year has already been collected. Whether this Bill be carried or not, we have yet to collect the tax in respect of 1916-17, 1917-18, ..and 1918-19. We are, so to speak, by means of this Act looking backward to the extent of two and a half years. If these amendments in the principal Act be adopted, they will apply to all assessments covering the accounting periods beginning on 1st July, 1916. </para>

                    <para>The Government have consulted, I think, the convenience and necessities of the taxpaying community by not collecting more than one taxation yield in the one year. It would have been possible, under the Act, for the Commissioner to levy at once in respect of the three years, but because of the retrospective effect of the Act, he has regarded such a course as being likely to inflict undue hardship, and has therefore not followed it. He is, so to speak, two and a half years behind the clock, but he hopes in time to catch up arrears. </para>

The 10 per cent, arrangement on. old businesses is different from that in connexion with new businesses. I think that the 10 per cent. maximum allowed on new capital is fair in view of all the circumstances. That "boils down " the somewhat long explanation I made, and which the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> inadvertently overlooked.

                    <para class="block">In both these cases the Commissioner is restricted, in giving a concession, to what is necessary to insure the financial stability of the business. It is proposed to abolish the restriction, because in practice it has been found unfair. As an example of the first of the conditions referred to, it may be pointed out that fire insurance companies employ very little capital in the actual business of insurance, but the capital necessarily at stake is large. The premium income is, therefore, a better basis than capital for the comparison between pre-war and war time. May I say in explanation that the ordinary normal business of an insurance company is the reception of premiums and the payment, out of premiums, of working expenses and losses. Although capital has, as insurance to the insured, to be necessarily much larger than the premium income per annum, that capital is frequently invested apart from the business altogether, and is only there in case the premium income should not be large enough to allow the company to pay the losses. Difficulty has arisen in the assessment of such companies, because if it is based on the capital actually used in the business, it seems to be unfair, as compared with other businesses. The premium income is deemed by the Taxation Commissioner to be a better basis than capital for the comparison of pre-war and war-time results. If this amendment is made, the actual operations of the company and their effect on yearly profits will be more in the form of premium income, and not in the form of capital nominally employed in the business. </para>

                            <para>-We distinguish these companies from most, if not all, other enterprises because they are not identical. In consultation with the principal insurance men, I find that they see the utter futility of endeavouring to measure the results of their business by what capital they have in it. We have only made capital the measure of value, or of allowance before the assessment of excess, where it really operates in all the phases of the business. But in cases where it is merely nominally employed, and invested outside altogether, or in advertising, or in the insurance of the company, we have to seek a better basis, and the premium income is considered to be the ideal basis of a fire, accident, or marine company. </para>

                    <para>Under the existing law, there is a strong temptation for taxpayers to indulge in unnecessary embellishment of business premises, as three-fourths of the cost may be withheld from the Treasury. The Commissioner in administration cannot now check this; but under the Bill he will be able to disallow unnecessary expenditure. </para>
                    <para>It is considered proper to grant exemption from war-time profits tax in respect of donations to patriotic war funds or to the Repatriation Department. The provision in the income tax law for such deductions has, therefore, now been included in this Bill. </para>
                    <para>Income tax is allowed in calculating war-time profits, and war-time profits taxation is allowed as a deduction in the calculation of income tax. The result is not quite exact in practice, and a slight amendment is suggested to make the calculation definite. As an illustration of the effect of the amendment, the case may be taken of an individual taxpayer with war-time profits of £5,000 and a pre-war standard of £3,000; his apparent excess profits would be £2,000. From that amount there must be deducted his income tax, say, £566, leaving £1,434 as the taxable excess profits. The tax at 75 per cent. would be £1,075 10s. The income tax assessment of the profits would then be amended by deducting £1,075 10s. from the £5,000 profits, and calculating the income tax on the balance. Any over -payment would be deducted from the excess profits tax or refunded, as the case required. The present law interpreted strictly would require the adjustment to be continued at length in both assessments. </para>
                    <para>In the case of mining, the income tax law allows a. deduction in respect of profits expended on development or appropriated for development and new plant. The War-time Profits Tax Act only allows deduction of profits appropriated for development or new plant. Experience shows this to be unfair to small mining businesses, because they generally expend all their income on development as it is received, and have nothing at the end of the accounting period to appropriate. Large businesses did not suffer in this respect. The income tax law enables large and small mining businesses to enjoy deductions of expenditure on or appropriations for development and new plant, and it is proposed to embody the same provision in the War-time Profits Tax Act. </para>

                    <para class="block">Board, certain sums for development during the coming year. The Commissioner allows that, and deducts it from the taxation of that particular year. If the money is spent in development in the following accounting period well and good; it is not accounted for taxation purposes. If al!, or some of it, is not spent it is brought into the next accounting period. That is the law as it at present stands in regard to appropriated moneys, but expended money is not treated in the same way. I think that with fairness we ought to bring the War-time Profits Act into line with the Income Tax Act in relation to large and small mining companies engaged in business. </para>
                    <para>Where, since the first of the three prewar trade years up to the beginning of the accounting period under assessment, a business has shown a loss, and the profits of such accounting period have been applied in extinction of that loss, then a deduction is allowed under the present Act in reckoning profits for tax. Owing to faulty drafting the relief can be given only where there are three full pre-war trade years. An amendment is submitted to apply the concession where there are less than three such years. It has been found that the present law acts with undue severity on some businesses established one or two years before the outbreak of war. </para>
                    <para>The Act now permits a deduction to be made from profits equal to the difference between interest paid on borrowed money which has not been repaid at the end of the accounting period and the statutory percentage thereon. Let me make this matter plain. If a man has a capital of £10,000 of his own, and £5,000 borrowed, the latter by way of bank overdraft or otherwise, he is allowed on his own capital, either the pre-war test or 10 per cent., whichever he elects. On the borrowed capital he is allowed the same rate that he pays for it. If he pays 6 per cent. for the money, and elects to take the 10 per cent. rate, he makes a profit on the borrowed money of 4 per cent. nominal, but he is allowed only the amount that is owing, at the end of the accounting period, on the 30th June or 31st December. It is felt that the aver age amount of borrowed money used to produce the profits in the period under review is the proper factor to take into consideration, and not the amount accidentally owing at the end of the accounting period. </para>

                            <para>- It is arrived at by consideration of the facts. In the balance-sheet to be assessed the taxpayer can show that in daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly rests, his overdraft, or borrowed money, ran at so and so. On this it is a very easy thing to fix the average amount of money borrowed, and assess that sum rather than the particular moneys actually owing at the end of the accounting period. The Bill, therefore, provides for basing the calculation on the average borrowed money used in the accounting period. The deduction will not be made when ascertaining the pre-war standard, as that would penalize the business. It will operate only during the war period under review. </para>

                    <para>Another amendment will allow the Commissioner to recognise interest which has accrued and become due, but has not been paid. If a man's balance-sheet at the end of his accounting period is prepared in June, and the bank in which he- does his business closes its books on the 31st March or the 30th September, the actual interest on his overdraft is not paid at the date of the preparation of the balance-sheet, because the adjustments between the bank and the customer do not synchronize, but, nevertheless, the money is due, and he can bring it into account in the year as if it were paid. This simply applies a principle which is operating for deduction purposes in the Income Tax Assessment Act. </para>
                    <para>A new sub-clause is proposed to exempt such portion of the profits of co-operative societies as is distributed by way of bonus or is set aside for that purpose, but the tax will apply to reserve profits. This amendment deals particularly with an inquiry submitted by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton).</inline> This is a Bill that either sets out to catch or will catch what are popularly called profiteers - the original Act was designed in that way - 'but the particular institutions dealt with in this proposed addition to section 15 are the very antithesis  of profiteers. They are co-operating units, which seek to prevent men from battening upon them, and to procure supplies for themselves and their families with the abolition, as far as possible, of all secondary or tertiary charges, by cutting out the middleman and getting as close as possible to the producer. The Act, 'as drawn, has shown a danger - I am not sure that it is not more than a danger - of reaching people whom we never intended to reach, who may make a dividend at the end of a year, of, say, ls. or 2s. in the £1 on purchases from the co-operating unit, which is equivalent to a reduction in prices when profits are ascertained. We say that all money that comes back to the co-operators or is set aside for that purpose will be free of taxation under this Bill. </para>
                    <para>But there are other companies - and this is why we cannot exempt co-operative companies entirely without great risk -  that work under the clothing of cooperative companies, but are merely such in principle and not in effect. I could name numbers of them, but I have no wish to particularize, because they are beneficial organizations. However, mostly they arc trading propositions, which should pay this tax if they are liable for it. This provision will bring them under the tax, because it will apply to profits made by trading with people other than members of the societies. Honorable members know of societies in Melbourne and Sydney which started as co-operative societies, whose chief "business how is with the general public. We do not propose to release from the grip of the tax gatherer profits made from non-members in the ordinary wholesale and retail trade. </para>

                    <para>The last amendment I desire to explain is a simple one, but its effect may be very beneficial. It deals with section 59 of the original Act. Under the Land Tax Act a Board consisting of the Commissioner of Taxation, the Secretary to the Treasurer, and the Comptroller General of Trade and Customs may release taxpayers from the payment of the whole or any part of their land tax if by reason of drought, adverse seasons, or other conditions the returns from the land have been seriously impaired. It is proposed' to give similar relief in connexion with the war-time profits tax. The effect of the amendment will be to say to the primary produce* who is subjected to conditions over which he has no control, " We propose to apply to you in connexion with the war-time profits tax the same principle as we apply to you under, the land tax." I think this ought to be regarded as a relief. If drought should strike any particular group of landowners or any particular section of the community, 1 do not want to feel that we are taking, under this measure, any more than we do under the Land Tax Act from a man at the time he is smitten most, and calling upon him to pay taxation for an earlier period, with the prospect of ruining himself in the attempt to do so. The provision in the Land Tax Act, which was so very novel when the measure was first introduced, has proved safe and beneficial. Regularly the officers whom I have mentioned meet and hear appeals from taxpayers. A great many of the appeals are turned down. A substantial number is dealt with sympathetically by remissions or reductions. Returns axe made to this House once a year of what remissions are made, and the officers know that the eyes of Ministers and Parliament are upon them in making remissions. The same conditions should apply in regard to the war-time profits taxation. While giving substantial relief in cases where hardships strike the primary producer, we provide a safeguard so that he may not improperly evade the tax. </para>
                    <para>I do not pretend that this Bill will relieve the anxieties of every man who has had to pay this taxation under the 1915-16 assessment, or is expecting to pay under the three succeeding years, but while keeping in view the huge obligations that are mounting high on the Treasury, I say that we cannot alford to let this tax go, especially when we know that it rests mostly on those who, by reason of having made excess profits, are well able to pay, or can finance themselves so that they can make themselves able to pay. Having endeavoured, after many months of careful study, with the officers of the Treasury, to understand the difficulties of assessees, and keeping in view the needs of the Treasury, I feel sure that this Bill, when studied by honorable members, will be regarded as a reasonable advance which, while taking out most of the sting of the original Act, will yield to the Treasurer what he is entitled to get at this particular time. </para>

I regret that we have not had an opportunity of going through the Minister's speech carefully. I am opposed to the extension of the War Precautions Act by even one minute beyond the period fixed by the original Act. The Act was assented to on the 29th October, 1914, and honorable members will see, by referring to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> that from the motion to introduce to the carrying of the third reading, less than two hours elapsed. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Members are receiving new regulations under the War' Precautions Act every week, and I have previously referred to one regulation which amended no fewer than twenty-five others. A man .requires a legal training to be able to understand the effect of all these regulations. We have been governed during the last four years, and will continue to be governed for another twelve months if this Bill is  passed,  almost entirely by the War Precautions Act. The Peace Conference is not likely to reach finality for some time because of the disturbed condition of the enemy countries. Germany particularly is in such an unsettled state that the Allies' delegates cannot meet representatives of Germany at the Peace Conference with any certainty that the terms agreed upon will be carried out. </para>

In the Commonwealth we have passed a large number of Acts in which that or similar terms are used. This committee in Great Britain reported as to the date of the end of the war - " We assume that the war will be ended . by a treaty or treaties of peace. In order to arrive at a final conclusion of the treaty, various stages will probably be required, such as agreements for armistices, cessation of hostilities thereunder, articles, of peace, agreement of terms, signature of terms, ratification, exchange, or deposit of  ratification. In our opinion, speaking of legislation generally, the war cannot be said to have ceased until peace is finally and irrevocably obtained, and that point of time cannot bc earlier than the date when the treaty of peace is finally binding on the respective belligerents, and that is the date when ratifications are exchanged." </para>

But this definition is not exhaustive. The control of finance or trade may be the most potent weapon of all. One test, however, must always be applied, namely: Can the measure in question conduce to the efficiency of the forces of the Empire, or is the connexion of cause and effect between the measure and the desired efficiency so remote that the one cannot reasonably be regarded as affecting the other? . . . </para>

It is not necessary for the Court to point out the particular way in which they can have that effect. But the Court may, I think, take judicial notice of the fact that the past season's harvest was most abundant, and that vast quantities of wheat, far exceeding the possible consumption of the Commonwealth, are awaiting export; while, owing to the operations of war, the supply of freight is deficient. It is obvious that for economical, as well as other reasons, the export of the surplus to the United Kingdom or the Allied nations may be highly desirable for the more efficient prosecution of the war. It seems to follow that any law which may tend, 'with or without the aid of other measures, to encourage such export, may be conducive to the more efficient conduct of the war. </para><para class="block">

                            <para>- I draw the attention of honorable members to a report of a. speech which I delivered in Adelaide twelve months ago, which was so absurdly censored that things which I had said at an afternoon meeting were allowed to be published, but when repeated at an evening meeting were suppressed. The two speeches were censored by the same man. Perhaps he got tired of reading the report. The Minister, in introducing the Bill, said - </para>

                        <para>The far-reaching nature of the operations nf the war necessitated the exercise of extraordinary emergency powers, the administrative intrusion on the part of the Government into areas of finance, industry, production, and distribution never before contemplated, and an interference with the rights of individuals and their freedom of action of a character quite alien to the customs of our Tace. </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">We have had more than enough of the Act. It has not been fairly administered. It may be said that I was a member of the Government that introduced it. That is so. But I would have left that Government at once had the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> in introducing the measure, made plain the manner in which it would be used. He spoke of it as a measure affecting aliens, and as designed chiefly to prevent the enemy from getting information. Only last week-end we had an illustration of the manner in which the Act is administered. Some girls had cameras with which they were trying to get pictures of returning Anzacs, but these cameras were seized by the police, and the possessors told that they could not get them back until they had gone 1,000 yards from the pier. Of what use to the enemy could any picture that they might have taken have been ? The mere photographing of an empty wharf would result in the seizing of one's camera. Although these unofficial photographers had their cameras seized, the newspapers were allowed to take and ? publish photographs of the Anzacs coming down the gangway to the wharf. The incident illustrates the absurd way in which the Act is being administered by the Defence Department. Yet we are asked to extend its operation for virtually twelve months- longer. I hope that the peace treaty may be signed earlier than seems likely, though I think that it will be some little time longer before we have peace. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- We certainly have received  copies of every regulation framed under the Act, but we have not had an opportunity to discuss then', in the House. On the business-pa,per at the  present  time there are at least five notices of motion for the disallowance of regulations made under the Act, but no time has been set apart for their consideration. Those regulations, relating chiefly to industrial matters, are in operation to-day, and much of the industrial turmoil that has arisen has been due to them. Last year I gave notice of my intention to move for the disallowance of .Statutory Rule 217 of 1917, relating to the deregistration of unions. A big industrial dispute was then in existence. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wallace)</inline> also gave notice of motion to disallow Statutory Rule 190 of 1917. </para>

                                    note, with gratification, that the Labour party, being desirous of doing everything necessary and proper for the conduct of the war, takes no exception to any regulation which is capable of reasonable and equitable interpretation, and which is employed only in helping to secure the national safety and wellbeing. The general body of the regulations issued under the War Precautions Act is capable of such an interpretation. The importance of the impartial administration of the regulations is fully appreciated by the Government; but, in the exercise of their discretion, whilst desirous of securing the good-will of all sections of the community, the Government must be guided more by the nature of the acts, and the national interests involved, than by the consideration of the effect that any official action is likely to have in giving offence to any particular class of persons in the community.

                                <para>The Government appreciates with you the value of free discussion, the right of public meetings, and the freedom of the press; but in war time, rights fully recognised in peace are necessarily subject to certain limitations in the national interests. You mention the limitations imposed to withhold matters advantageous to the enemy or likely to give offence to an allied Power. The Government hold strongly the view that the further limitation not mentioned by you is also necessary - the prohibition of matter prejudicial to recruiting. You make reference to the censorship of the press, but you suggest the repeal of no particular regulation in this regard. It is presumed, therefore, that you are more concerned with the administration in this connexion. In reply, I desire to inform you that recently a conference of representatives of the press was held to consider the question of press censorship. A committee of four (4) were constituted as a Board of Appeal. The Labour press is represented, and any matter on which the press feel themselves aggrieved can be referred to this Board and dealt with. It is considered that this should remove any objections which have been raised in connexion with the administration. You specify Statutory Rule 1917, No. 304, and various amendments, and presumably refer particularly to Regulation 42 of the Military Service Referendum Regulations, which deals with the making of false statements of fact of a kind likely to affect the judgment of electors in relation to their votes. As regards administration, instructions were given some time ago to take no further action in any matter arising out of this regulation, and the Government is prepared to repeal it. As regards Statutory Rule 1917, No. 182, mentioned by you, that is the regulation which prevents the unlawful assembling of individuals in and around Parliament House. This regulation corresponds with the statutory protection which exists in connexion with the State Parliament. The area in which it operates around the Federal Parliament House is the same as that which previously existed in connexion with the State Parliament, and it in no way affects the general rights of citizens holding public meetings anywhere except in the prohibited area.

As the regulation was intended by the Government for the protection of the Commonwealth and State Governments, and officers and authorities of the Commonwealth and the States in respect of action taken in the public interest in connexion with the Wheat Pool, it is difficult to understand why the repeal of this regulation is asked for. Several regulations of a similar character exist, and are necessary for conserving public interests. This regulation can in no way be construed as an obstacle to recruiting. </para>

The Statutory Rule to which you refer is aimed at the punishing of any person who advocates, incites, or encourages disloyalty or hostility to the British Empire, or to the cause of the British Empire in the present war, or advocates the dismemberment of the British Empire. The regulation also  make3  it an offence for any person .to wear or display any badge, flag,  emblem, banner,  or symbol, being or purporting to bo the badge, flag, or banner, emblem, or symbol of a country with which the King is now at war, or of any body or association who are disaffected to the British Empire, or the Socialists Association, or movement known as Sinn Fein. From the reading of the regulation, you will see that the regulation is not designed to " placate the animus " of any section of the community against any other section; but it distinctly aims at the prevention of disloyalty or hostility to the Empire. As the advocacy of such disloyalty or hostility at the present time is so obviously inimical to the preservation of the Commonwealth, the Government cannot consent to its repeal.

Moreover, the vast majority of the regulations made under that Act are distinctly of a type usually made by the Executive, acting under statutory authority. The Government have already, by the release of persons in prison, the remission of outstanding penalties, and the abandonment of prosecutions, redeemed the promises made at the recent Conference; and assures you that, in the administration of the. regulations, regard will be had to the attitude taken by the Government at that Conference. </para><para>The regulations relating to publications have been discussed by the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> on several occasions. There are papers and books circulated freely in England which are not allowed to enter Australia. Action is taken in three different ways - under the Commerce Act; under the War Precautions Act, and by the Postmaster-General under the Postal Act. When the Government sent round to the chairmen of the various Boards and other public bodies asking for their opinion in regard to the repeal of regulations under the War Precautions Act, the Defence Department replied that, after careful consideration, the conclusion had been arrived at that immediate action should be taken to extend" their operation for six months after the war. That in itself would be enough to cause me to vote against the Bill, for we have been dominated by the military right through the trouble. </para><interjection>

In another case, a military man seized a camera, it being thought that, because the person concerned happened to be a relative of a member of Parliament, she might get to know all about the war regulations.

But it is only human nature to seek to retain any power that one may possess; indeed, that was one of the reasons which actuated the people in voting in the negative at the conscription referendum. By the way, there was a very instructive article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> a month or more ago, giving a list of the Boards and other bodies to which the powers of the Government have been delegated; and now we are told in the press that a Board is to be appointed to discover where economies can be effected. It should be the responsibility of the Minister of the day to undertake this task. Some per-; sons have done good work in an honorary capacity on various Boards, but if we are to believe statements which have appeared in the press, others are fairly well paid for the services they have rendered, particularly the members of one Board attached to the Defence Department.

                            <para>- Of course, directly the Government commence to specify regulations which ought to. be retained, we shall find that many honorable members will have something to say in regard to them. We are told that all these business regulations are necessary, but we are in the dark - we do not know what they are. The Government should come forward with a list of those which they consider necessary for maintaining the financial position of the Commonwealth. They have not acted wisely in asking Parliament to extend the operation of the measure. They would have done better by saying, " In order to bring these Boards into existence, we have taken powers, under the War Precautions Act, for which we had no constitutional authority, and in order to keep this power, which has proved beneficial to the community" - they have to prove that - " it will be necessary for the people to give us greater powers under the Constitution than we have now." They could have obtained them in a constitutional manner, and not by means of war precaution regulations, upon which, although they have the effect of Acts of Parliament, members of Parliament have not had the opportunity of voting. For these reasons, I shall oppose the second reading of the Bill. I trust that the Government will adopt my suggestion, and bring forward a list of regulations, to which the House can give fair and full consideration. </para>

                        <para>.- When the Government resumed the debate on this Bill this afternoon, I took exception to it, and said that the Minister had broken faith with the House. When the Minister on Friday last had moved the second reading of such an important measure, I asked whether he would circulate his speech, and he agreed to do so. I also pressed for the delay of the debate until to-morrow; but the Minister moved that the debate be made an Order of the Day for to-day. The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report shows that I interjected, "Make it Thursday," whereupon the Minister said that his only desire was to fix a day, and that the debate would be resumed on a day to meet the convenience of honorable members. </para>

                    <para>I am an uncompromising opponent of this Bill. The original Act was introduced for the purpose of dealing with war conditions in times of war, and in order to take precautions against our enemies, not against ourselves. As the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, if honorable members had known that the original Bill was being asked for to give power to frame some of the regulations which have been issued under the measure, it would never have been passed. When tremendous power is placed in the hands of any body of men, military, naval, or civilian, the same result is always achieved. I admit that, had I been the Minister controlling a Department issuing these regulations, and if I had been surrounded by bureaucrats pressing continuously for the passing of regulations to govern this thing or that tiling my view might have been just as circumscribed as that of the Minister, but looking at these matters from the point of view of the man outside, I feel that, after four years of stress and strain, the time has arrived when fears for the safety of the realm have passed, and there is no further need of the powers asked for in this Bill. At any rate, in times of peace Ministers should not combine the authority to control their big commercial operations with the general power to do just what they please. </para>

                            <para>- It was their duty to do so. No one ever contemplated that they would ask for an extension of the Act in its completeness. That they have done so indicates either their desire to keep the control which they have been exercising, or laziness on their part in not going through the regulations, and selecting those which Parliament should be asked to retain. Certain pools may not yet be cleared up. An indefinite time may be occupied in clearing them up. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the details relating to them to know whether they should be extended or not, but it was the business of the Minister to come to us and say, " Gentlemen, as a. result of the War Precautions Act we were involved as a Parliament in certain problems which have been carried on outside the mere matter of the preservation of the safety of the realm, and come within the area of commerce, and we ask you to extend the War Precautions Act in so far as .it relates to those specific details. We are prepared to give reasons for asking for this power." Had that step been taken, and if sufficient reasons had been put forward to justify the retention of certain powers to the extent of providing means for clearing up the financial pools in which the Commonwealth might be involved in difficulties, the measure would have had my support. In no circumstances would I hand over to the Government unlimited power to do in times of peace what it had authority to do in times of war. Since the passing of the War Precautions Act,- Parliament has been a mere cipher. Honorable members have been asked to come here and "vote money to enable the Government to .do just as they pleased, and our justification for voting the money was that we believed that we were giving the Government power to protect the lives and liberties of citizens of this country from the depredations of the enemy ; but now, although there is no signed declaration of peace, seeing that Germany has handed over her navy, that her soldiers have retired to the Rhine, and that eight or nine Republics have replaced the once powerful Empire, does any one believe that she is going to get together again a fighting force capable of defeating the Allied armies? No one with sense would make such a statement. Therefore there is no necessity for the extension of the powers given by the War Precautions Act. </para>

                    <para>Whenever the Minister, in introducing the Bill, quoted a specific case as an argument for extending the powers given by the Act, his statement contained a qualification. I shall quote a few notes which I have made from the Minister's speech to show how he did this. He must be an excellent lawyer, and, as in the case of the medical man who is able to give professional advice without committing himself too closely, so that he cannot be pinned down if anything should happen afterwards, it is hard to pin him down. Honorable members noticed how he brought me to book when I questioned his statement regarding the fixing of the day for the resumption of the debate. He said that the words,- " as far as practicable," were included in his remarks. I found that such was the case. I ought to have known that he was right bv the quotations from his speech which I have written out. At first one would think that they are definite statements, but afterwards one discovers that they are not. This is the- first - </para>
                    <para>When the war finished the regulations under the War Precautions Act would, generally speaking, cease to operate. </para>
                    <para class="block">There is the first qualification, the insertion of the words "generally speaking," in what otherwise would appear to be a definite statement. Again, he desired the Act extended so that the various Departments might make a most careful review of the regulations, and decide which of them could be brought to a speedy determination. The Act itself brings them to a speedy determination by specifying that they shall last only until the cessation of the war. It is the Minister's duty to find out which powers or activities cannot be terminated straight away, and ask Parliament to continue them, although not indefinitely. In reply to an interjection by the Leader of the  Opposition,  the Minister said it would not be necessary to ask 'for the extension of the War Precautions Act for more than six months. </para>

                            <para>- If the Minister takes responsibility for all the regulations under the War Precautions Act, the sooner he is thrown out of his job the better. Not that I wish to throw him out, because I think he is an excellent Postmaster-General, despite the jokes that are made about him. I do not think the average honorable member will contradict me when I say that the first stage in the initiation of a War Precautions Regulation is when a clerk in the Department, whose business is to deal with a certain difficulty that has arisen, concludes that the easiest solution of the trouble is to prepare a War Precautions Regulation. The suggestion filters through to the head of the branch, who places it before the Minister." The Minister does 'not waste too much time over the matter after it has been recommended by the head of the Department. Why should he? He has not to run the gauntlet of criticism in this House. All he has to do is to get the Attorney-General to draft a regulation, and the Government Printer to issue it. The first thing that an honorable member knows about it is that he finds in his letter-box some morning 10, 20, or sometimes 30 War Precautions Regulations. Some appeal to him as being of interest; the others he throws into the waste-paper basket. To some he takes very strong exception, and he knows that he has an opportunity under parliamentary rules of objecting within fourteen days after Parliament meets if the regulations are laid on the table. He goes to the House prepared to assert his rights as a member, and gives notice of a motion to disallow certain regulations. But that motion is placed at the very bottom of the list of private members' business, and the Government who control the business of the House, then induce their supporters to pass a motion abolishing private members' day. </para>

                            <para>- That does not affect the argument. I voted for the measure, and would vote for it again to-morrow if the  country were in danger. But, surely, the test is - Is there any risk of our country being submerged by the enemy? If so, I would give the Government or an autocrat any power necessary to save the country at such a time. If it is not necessary there is no reason why such a power should be given. . To-day the nation which has been the bugbear of Europe for the last forty years lies in the dust, down and out. And where do we stand ? Great Britain stands on the very pinnacle of both military and naval power, a position which it has never occupied at any previous time in its history. Even Australia has more than twice as many trained soldiers who have been in action than Britain had in its entire army when war broke out. And other Dominions of the Empire stand in exactly the same position. The only other nation of any consequence that could challenge the' might of Great Britain is America, which is now linked with the British Empire on more friendly terms than have ever subsisted between the two' nations since the American colonies won their independence. With such a power in the hands of the Anglo-Saxon race, what chance is there of any further war in the near future? The present war is practically finished, and if we accept the definition given by the British Legal Committee of the time when the war will end, as the date when the ratification of the peace terms is accepted by the belligerent nations, the War Precautions Act will cease automatically on that date. The Government have all the time between now and then to prepare what this House desires, and ought to have, namely, a .measure continuing those functions which the Government desire to continue to operate after the declaration of peace. To such a measure I do not think there will be any opposition; but unless the Government are prepared to take some means to meet the views of the House in that regard, they will have an extremely difficult task in placing on the statute-book a Bill to extend the duration of the War Precautions Act. </para>

                    <para class="block">What does that mean ? Absolutely nothing. It sounds very well, but its only effect is that Parliament will remain a cypher. As I have pointed out before, the modern tendency of Democracies which have constitutional government is to drift the power more and more into the hands of the Government, instead of the people's representatives. And within that charmed Ministerial circle there is a tendency observable, in Australia at any rate, to drift the power from Ministers into the hands of the Prime Minister until he becomes an absolute dictator. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly; we cannot get a better illustration of that than the position of William Morris Hughes, as Australia's dictator under the War Precautions Act. Realizing the position in which the Empire stood during the war we have had to agree to that state of affairs, because we believed that it was in the best interests of our country. But now that peace is at hand, I no longer believe that any man, no matter how shrewd or capable he may be, is able to control the affairs and destinies of this country merely through the inner consciousness of either himself or his colleagues. The assistance of Parliament is essentia] to the good government of this country, and people have only put up with the effect of the War Precautions Regulations for the reasons I have mentioned. Here is another carefully thought out and definitely expressed opinion given by the Minister - "The Government have no desire to control the censorship." It would have been all right had the honorable gentleman stopped there, but he added,- " beyond what is absolutely neces
sary. Of course, the Government lias no such desire. " Why," the Minister asks, " don't we allow you to publish the departure of ships, and the fact that a troopship is arriving next week?"</para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to pay tribute to the work of those who have steered the Empire through this crisis. No one doubts my loyalty to the Empire. There is no special genius in the British Government above other Governments. A British Cabinet is composed of men with the ordinary human frailties and liability to err. During the war I have, on more than one occasion, expressed in this chamber my opinion about the censorship. The manner in which the American Government has dealt with war news is in sharp contrast to the practice of the British Government. Every week the American Government has made public the number of American troops in Prance, and the list of casualties has been published daily. The advances made by American troops have been made known ; only details as to battalions and the like have been withheld. Ali that information was published in the American newspapers during the war. </para>

What is more, the American public was satisfied with the information it was getting. The British Government sometimes gave false information. It stated that the <inline font-style="italic">A</inline><inline font-style="italic">Audacious,</inline> which was torpedoed in the Irish Channel, was towed into port and repaired. </para>

                            <para>- No. Information which was censored in Great Britain has been censored again before being published in Australia. What does the Government mean in saying that it has no desire to control the censorship beyond what is absolutely necessary? The determination of the necessity lies with Ministers, not with Parliament. If Ministers think it necessary to prohibit the publication of a mem- - ber's speech, there is no preventing it. Parliament has given them the power to do this. Another statement made by the Minister was that " the general policy will be to restore the right of expression of public opinion and freedom of discussion as speedily as possible." Peace has practically come, but the Government still has power to prevent the publication of speeches delivered in .this chamber upon measures affecting the welfare of the country. What right have Ministers to say that there shall or shall not be an expression of public opinion and freedom of discussion ? They draw from the people the powers that they wield. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but during the war some persons have had to serve sentences for expressing their opinions, and rightly so, too. But the necessity for war-time restrictions does not continue in time of peace. The Government should take the earliest opportunity to wind up the different Pools, instead of continuing them a= a function of government. The. party that sits on this side is opposed to the policy represented by the establishment of these Pools. My friends opposite, who are believers in Socialism, approve of it. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister seems to have developed an extraordinary state of mind in contemplating the difficulty that would follow the non-continuance of the Act. I am led to that conclusion by the words that he used in referring to the extension of control over matters affecting the financial and business interests which have been handed over to Government Boards. After dealing with the Wool Pool., he said, " The activities of the Wool Committee include, also, the handling of sheepskins." He then went on to say, " A mere reference to this activity shows how impossible it is to contemplate its sudden termination." I do not know that there is anything extraordinary in the control of sheepskins. It seems to me an exceedingly simple matter. </para>

                    <para class="block">This resolution was passed by a body representing the commercial interests of this State, and the members of which are accustomed to deal with large business matters. They see no difficulty whatever in controlling activities which the Minister says must be controlled by Government Boards unless the commercial and financial interests of the country are to become disorganized. If these interests were controlled by a huge company which suddenly failed, they would not be in the least disorganized if handed over to a receiver. All these gigantic interests, the control of which seems to worry the Minister, would be attended to by capable mon if handed over again to those who were in the habit of dealing with them before the war. The Minister's attitude in this regard reminds me of the story of the young lady who for some months had been expecting her intended to propose, and who, when the proposal did at last come, professed to be surprised, and exclaimed, " This is so sudden." We have been anxiously looking forward to the termination of the war.We knew and believed that with the coming of peace the War Precautions Act would cease to operate. We knew, also, that there would be difficulties to overcome, but that they would not be insuperable. The difficulties attending the getting of these various activities under control during the war were infinitely greater than those which will surround their return to normal conditions in time of peace. The Minister says that the Government are gradually going to allow conditions to filter back to their pre-war state as times become normal. But will they ever become normal ? What will be normality ? We have undergone changes during the war that may prevent our ever returning to the conditions of life that prevailed before the war occurred. In any event, we are not likely to return to them for many, many years. Would that, however, be any justification for the continuance of Government control of these activities ? I venture to say it would not, and the sooner we get back to the conditions prevailing before the war, the better for the community and for this Parliament. </para>
                    <para>One of the activities referred to by the Minister was that controlled by the Dairy Produce Committee, which has just been constituted. The Minister read at great length the functions assigned to that Committee, which has just begun its work. But if the work ceased to-morrow, would the cows give less milk, or go dry? Are the owners of the cows, and the sellers of the milk, not possessed of sufficient brains to enable them to deal with their own products? Has the success of these Government institutions, which have interfered with the commercial life of the community, been such that we should withdraw everything from private enterprise, and hand them over to Government control ? We know that these matters are being controlled by officials who have been trained in the Public Service, and who may be very efficient public servants; but when they are asked to administer affairs which they do not, and never did, understand, what can we expect but inefficiency ? </para>
                    <para>We come now to another item. Let us consider for a moment the attitude of tha Government with regard to price fixing. The Minister, in his speech, said that they had changed their policy practically as the result of the armistice. He said, in referring to the desirability of introducing legislation to provide for the continuance of price fixing - </para>

                        <para>The termination of hostilities and the prospects of an early peace, in the opinion of the Government render this course unnecessary.  . . The position will, however, be carefully watched. . . . We say that as the conditions gradually come back to normal there will be a relaxation of the powers. It is not intended to extend the operation of the Price Fixing Department unless there appears to be grave cause to do so. </para>

                    <para class="block">In this statement we have the promise that the Government will abolish the right to control such matters, but will retain in their hands the power to interfere if they consider that there appears to be grave cause for interference. In the earlier part of the speech, the Minister made this statement, which I consider to be one of the most important uttered by him - </para>

                        <para>The far-reaching nature of the operations of the war necessitated the exercise of extraordinary emergency powers, the administrative intrusion on the part of the Government into areas of finance, industry, production, and distribution never before contemplated, and an interference with the rights of individuals and their freedom of action of a character quite alien to the customs of our race. </para>

                    <para class="block">What sort of representatives of the people would we be if we tolerated the continuance of that state of affairs five minutes longer than was necessary after the termination of the war? The public will not support the attitude of the Government, and it should be, as far as possible, the object of honorable members - I, for one, am prepared to give what assistance I can - to help the Government to classify those subjects in respect of which they feel it is necessary to have some power. But for the Government to ask for general power to control .anything that it may occur to them to control - or which it may be suggested to them should be controlled - is unreasonable. In seeking authority to do that without consulting the representatives of the people, they are asking for dangerous and autocratic powers which ought not to be granted to them. </para>
                    <para>The Minister told us that the War Precautions Act was passed, in the first place, to secure the public safety and the defence of the Commonwealth. All that has been accomplished, and there is no further necessity for it. The honorable gentleman quoted the decision, of the High Court in the Bread case - the only case relating to price fixing that went before it. The quotations that he made from the law reports, however, provide absolutely the best evidence we could get that there would be no possible chance of the Act being upheld in time of peace. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has quoted from the judgment of the Chief Justice, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, from which I propose to make the following short extract - </para>

                        <para>I agree generally with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mann's</inline> argument, that the power to legislate with respect to defence extends to any law which may tend to the conservation or development of the resources of the Commonwealth so far as they can be directed to success in war, or may tend to distress the enemy, or diminish his resources. </para>

                    <para class="block">Clearly , the Chief Justice had in mind the view that the only ground upon which he could hold that price fixing came within the War Precautions Act, and that that Act was  constitutional, was because it might be used for the maintenance of the integrity of the Empire, and more particularly of this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs, in his judgment, used practically the same argument.

We are told that until the different nations concerned agree to a ratification of the peace treaties, the war cannot be regarded as ended. But what is this measure for ? It is only for the legal technicalities iu connexion with the regulations passed under the War Precautions Act, and the longer the ratification of the peace treaties are deferred, the greater time will the Government have for winding up these affairs. </para>

                            <para>- The troops are being demobilized both in Britain and America. The question may arise whether we have power to put this legislation into effect if the War Precautions Act is abolished. According to my way of thinking, and I am not a lawyer, there are certain powers under the War Precautions Act which enable the Government to interfere in trade and commerce, and we are asking that the Government shall deal with these particular interests directly by a Bill. It may be argued that the Government have no power - that such an Act would be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires;</inline> but if that be so, there is no question that the War Precautions Act will also be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> on the declaration of peace. Whatever the security of the foundation may be, one measure will be just as secure, and no more, than the other. </para>

I do not care how patriotic a man is, the first thing he looks to is his livelihood; and there are many men employed by the Boards who have got into pretty good billets.

                            <para>- Nor on this side. This Parliament was elected in time of war, and I point out that the British  Parliament did not wait, but took the first opportunity to have a peace Parliament elected. If we are to preserve our war ideas in times of peace it is time we had a peace party; and after eighteen months' experience we ought to be able to meet the wishes of the people, and get back to peace- conditions. </para>

                            <para>- Some men have only one idea. We have had a most extraordinary reason, amongst many, for the preservation of the moratorium. We have been told by the Minister that the Farmers Union has asked for a continuation of the Wax Precautions Moratorium, as applied to pastoral and agricultural interests. I did not know that this Government stood for the Farmers Union or any other kind of union. </para>

                            <para>- We have a new member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corboy)</inline> who got his seat through the intervention of the Farmers Union. Has that anything to do with the attitude of the Government? Is it because the Farmers Union interfered- in the Swan election, and is interfering in the Corangamite election, that that union has to be placated? It is a new doctrine to me that, because some union, farming or otherwise, desires the extension of the moratorium, they should get it. It means that men who have certain obligations do not wish to pay their debts. </para>

                            <para>- There is as much hardship suffered in the community generally by people who are owed money under mortgage as there is by those who owe the money. Any interference by the War Precautions moratorium is not in the best interests of people who have invested in this country. Perhaps a reasonable time' ought to be given to clear things up, but this is one of the matters for which the Government should bring in a Bill. We are asked to consider what would be the effect on the community of a declaration that the War Precautions Act. and the regulations under' it, had ceased to operate. One would think the Government were standing on an avalanche. My own opinion is that the .effect would be a mighty good one on the community. If the Minister were standing on the brink of a bath on a cold morning the best advice I could give him would be to jump in at once, and rely on being nice and warm when he got out. This Parliament draws its power from the people, and not from the War Precautions Act. </para>

What our soldiers have fought for, and our people ha,ve suffered for, was to preserve the freedom of the race ; and axe our men to find when they come back that they are to be governed in a manner the Constitution does not contemplate'? I venture to assert that there will be trouble when this House goes to the people if such conditions prevail. The members of this Parliament who are prepared to sell the people's birthright by re-enacting this Act will, no doubt, find a resting place in oblivion when next they meet the people. </para>

As a representative of the people, I know that they feel keenly that they ought to be allowed their freedom now that the time has come for it. If there are honorable members who desire to shelter under the wing of the Government, they will find that Governments, like other, things, go like chaff before the storm when an indignant public is aroused. If the Government will specify - and they have four or six months to consider the matter - the things they want power to do they will get my- support, but if they seek all the powers they have had for the last four years they will have my- uncompromising opposition. </para>

                        <para>. -  I have read very carefully the speech of the Minister in which he sought to justify  the extension of the unlimited powers enjoyed by the Government under the War Precautions Act. A weaker and a more puerile speech has never been submitted to this House. The kind of contemptuous way in which the House was treated in this respect should arouse general indignation. After having this meaningless essay put before us, we should demand that the Government give us their real reasons for wanting the perpetuation of this obnoxious measure. What do the so-called reasons amount to, boiled down ? - </para>

                        <para>We assume that the war will be ended by a treaty or treaties of peace. In order to arrive at a final conclusion of the treaty, various stages will probably be required, such as agreements for armistices, cessation of hostilities thereunder, articles of peace, agreement of terms, signature of terms, ratification, exchange or deposit of ratification". In our opinion, speaking of legislation generally, the war cannot be said to have ceased until peace is finally and irrevocably obtained, and that point of time cannot be earlier than the date when the treaty of peace is finally binding on the respective belligerents, and that is the date when ratifications are exchanged. </para>

                    <para class="block">How long will this be? After the war in 1871, when Germany had absolutely conquered France and annexed Alsace-Lorraine, eight or nine months were occupied by the German and French delegates in determining matters which were trifling in comparison with the enormous difficulties that have to be settled as arising from the present war. By day-time the German surveyors would put in pegs to determine the territory to be annexed ; at night-time the French would pull them up, and so the work had. to be done all over again the next day. Although the Germans were absolutely in the position of dictators, the Peace Conferences extended over a period of eight or nine months. </para>
                    <para>The present task of settling the. peace terms will be infinitely greater than the problems the Allies have had to deal with during the progress of the war. The Central Empires and Russia are in a state of turmoil and chaos. A hundred or more distinct nationalities are claiming to be set up as independent States or Republics. Ordered government has to be arranged in connexion with the affairs of all these different nationalities, covering upwards of 100,000,000 or 150,000,000 people. </para>
                    <para>There are also slight differences among the Allies themselves. It is perfectly true that they have had their preliminary conference, and determined on the broad general principles outlined in  President  Wilson's fourteen points, but there are not wanting signs of disagreement which may hold up even the commencement of operations so far as the Allies are concerned. Is not our own Prime Minister striding up and down Great Britain sowing seeds of disaffection and sedition against the British Cabinet ? If any man in this country sought to say what he has said against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George and the British Government, he would have been given a very short shrift under the War Precautions Act; he would have been interned immediately. </para>

It is quite evident that it will be a long time before peace is signed. Certainly it will not be signed inside three years. It is quite possible that it will be five years before it is signed. As I have said here before, if peace is signed and ratified without another war breaking out, every man in this or any other country who has a sincere desire for peace, can go down on his knees and thank God that such is the case, because if ever there was material to engender dissension and disagreement among the Allies it is plainly to be seen by any one who seeks to analyze the position today. </para>

                    <para>The Government say that they require some time in order to taper off, so to speak, in regard to the administration of the War Precautions Act. What have they been doing during the last four years ? Did they not realize that the war would come to an end some time? It is the same with repatriation. They will wake up to the fact that repatriation is necessary when we have 200,000 soldiers knocking at our doors for employment. In the four years of fighting, the Government have not done one thing to prepare for the day when the war will cease, and enable the country to revert to normal conditions. There has never been a greater admission of incompetency on the part of a Government than the admission which is suggested in the Minister's own speech that the Government are not ready for peace. </para>

Of course it is. Otherwise, what would this great army do? They would have to go about their own business again. They would have to find work. I have had men come to see me who were employed in various branches of war activities which the Government have shut down. Is there one of them who is not bewailing his fate? Are they not all putting forward innumerable arguments why they should be kept on ? If the Government require arguments and reasons why these activities should be continued, and why the War Precautions Act should be extended, with the special powers and privileges it confers, they will get them from these camp followers, and from those who have been enjoying special privileges as the result of the war. They will advance innumerable reasons why the War Precautions Act should operate, not only until peace is signed, probably some years hence, but also until the crack of doom, or, at least, for the term of their natural lives. </para>

                        <para>Over and over again news that has appeared in other Australian papers has been refused publication in ours. What we really have in Melbourne is a censoring of the already censored, a super-censorship. Papers like the <inline font-style="italic">Argus, Age,</inline> SydneyDaily <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph,</inline> &amp;c., with a circulation of hundreds of thousands, have been permitted to publish what has been refused to papers like ours with a much smaller circulation. Such phrases as " Against Imperialism," " For a Constructive Peace by Negotiation," have been struck out, though one would naturally suppose that the qualifying word " constructive " would rob the word " peace " of all fears that are attached to it. </para>
                        <para>We are not making complaints against individual censors, with whom our relations have always been most friendly, but against the system which permits the political instead of the military censorship of a writer's contribution to public opinion, against the system which permits such subjects as freedom, Democracy, social and industrial reconstruction, to be dealt with from only one political stand-point, against the system which permits the free expression of hate and malice, and forbids the voicing of contrary sentiments. </para>
                        <para>For a hundred years, British people have accepted the fact that a free press is the only real bulwark of freedom, and we would remind you that both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> (Prime Minister), and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> (Attorney-General), in 1914 gave solemn pledges to the House, and, therefore, to the people, that the liberties of the people would not be interfered with under the Act; that it was merely devised to meet military needs, such, for instance, as preventing news of military importance being conveyed to the enemy; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> declared unequivocally that " no general powers " would be conferred under the Act. As far as the democratic papers of Australia are concerned, nothing but "general powers" have been directed against them since the Act was passed.

He said at a farmers' conference at Ouyen that £75,000 had been mysteriously paid to some person or persons for work which the Prime Minister said he himself had done, and when other serious questions as to the general administration of the Wheat Pool were voiced, what did the Government do? A report of the conference was telegraphed to the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> but the censor prohibited its publication, and sent a letter to the editor of the local paper at Ouyen, stating that the report of the conference was not to be published in any local newspaper. The suppressed report was not news of military value to the enemy; it had solely to do with the administration of the Government and the functionaries which they had set up. The administration of the Government and its pets must not be criticised; consequently, the facts disclosed at that conference were prohibited from receiving publicity. </para><para>Price fixing to-day is being carried on under a cloak of secrecy, and if there is not in existence in Australia the most rotten corruption that has ever existed in any country, it is only in spite of every invitation to such a condition of affairs, for the Government, by their censorship of the press and the secrecy of their methods in connexion with price fixing, have created those conditions which on other occasions and in  other  countries have produced everything undesirable in public life. </para><para>In Sydney a few weeks ago the milk vendors complained that the large milk companies were charging them a price in excess of that fixed by the Government, and their outcry became so insistent that the Government were at last compelled to initiate a prosecution. The cases came on before the Central Police Court, Sydney. The representative of the companies asked for an adjournment of the hearing for a fortnight. When the cases were called on a fortnight later the Crown Prosecutor, without offering any explanation, withdrew the charges, and there has been no further action since. There was undoubted evidence which would have led to a conviction of the companies, and had that happened the small vendors could have taken action against the big companies to recover thousands of pounds which they had been overcharged. It is said in Sydney that such adjournments are common, and that immediately they have been granted in connexion with cases for offences against the price fixing laws, there is a pilgrimage to Melbourne, which results in the prosecutions being withdrawn. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- It is impossible for me to make anything more than a general statement. The facts are that complaints were made in behalf of the Dairymen's Association in Sydney in regard to the outrageous violation of the price fixing laws by the great milk companies. Prosecutions were initiated in the Central Police Court, an adjournment was granted, and a fortnight later the cases  were  withdrawn without  any  explanation. </para>

                            <para>- That allegation is  specific, direct,  and true. The Government have  issued  a regulation, in consequence of which no officer associated with the Price  Fixing  Department dares to say one word about  its  operations, on pain of  being sent to gaol or fined £100. If the Government had desired to create a condition of affairs  that  would lead to rottenness and corruption, they could not have offered a greater inducement than their administration of  the law  in  that  respect. </para>

Why should a public man be not able to go into any Government office and obtain a list of traders who violate the law and rob the public? If there is nothing wrong, why should anybody keep the facts secret? I say deliberately that hundreds of prosecutions have been recommended, but never proceeded with. If the Government will give me authority to go into the price fixing o'ffiees, I shall state to the House hundreds of instances in which the Government have been recommended to institute prosecutions, but in which no prosecutions have taken place. There is no need for secrecy in this matter at all. I understand that since the present Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Massy Greene)</inline> has been in charge of price fixation no prosecution has been agreed to by him except such as were under wav before he took charge of the office. In fact, I am told that an instruction has been issued that if tradesmen disobey the price fixing regulations  they shall be warned; then if they do not discontinue their illegal practices, a prosecution will take place. </para>

I was required to appear within twenty-four or forty-eight hours, and the magistrate was ordered not to grant an adjournment  for  more than twenty-four hours, which made it absolutely impossible for me to obtain witnesses. </para>

The Prime Minister got two or three colleagues together, and sought to establish military interference at the polling booths.

Otherwise, the public would have known nothing of the attempt by the Prime Minister to corrupt the ballot-box. He sent out 5,000 urgent telegrams, the night before the poll, cancelling the regulation that had been issued, aud he lied to the people of the country by denying that any such regulation had been issued. This is the kind of thing that the Government asks us to perpetuate for from another three to five years, until the final treaty of peace and all its details, have been formally ratified. What have been the safeguards of the freedom, and purity of British parliamentary institutions other than a free press, a free platform, and freedom of Parliament? All these are abolished under the existing Act and regulations made under it; even the safeguards against corruption, as I have pointed out, are taken away. </para><para>It is said that the smell of Hun Limburger cheese is so aggressively rotten that it will carry 40 miles direct, and turn a corner, and travel another 20 miles,, and then knock down a Hereford bull.

Labour could have no better weapon against the Government now, or at the next general election, than would be supplied us by the continuance of the War Precautions Act and the regulations made under it. I would ask for lib better political weapon against them. During the last two or three weeks I have addressed thirty meetings in a New South Wales farming constituency. At each of those meetings I devoted one half of my time to an explanation of what the New South Wales National Government was doing, and the remaining half to an explanation of the doings of the Commonwealth National Government. I told my audience of what was going on, and of some of the things of which they are not allowed to learn through the ordinary channels. At every one of these thirty well-attended meet'ings I asked any Liberal or National supporter present to put up his hand if he was proud of the administration of either the Federal or State National Government, but there was not a 'microscope powerful enough to discover . one man throughout that electorate who would admit that he was proud of the administration of the National party in either State or Federal politics. </para><para>I would say to the Government, " Go on as you are and it will suit us very well as a party." But it is our public duty to point to the evils that are arising under the War Precautions Act and the regulations framed in connexion with it. We have to point to some of the evils which will  probably  be fully exposed when the War Precautions Regulations are lifted. When that comes about we shall have some disclosures. We cannot have this policy of suppression and the expenditure of a million of money per week in Australia in connexion with the war and at the same time expect to have angelic  purity  associated with it. If honorable members opposite are not prepared to say that the War Precautions Act shall be wiped out and an opportunity for better administration afforded, then an indignant and outraged public opinion will, at the first opportunity, sweep them into that outer darkness where there is weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth. </para></speech>

                        <para>. - I desire to register my protest against the continuance of the War Precautions Act. The people of Australia have lived for four years under regulations framed under that Act,- and it is up to the Government now to exercise their functions as a Government. During the last four years we have been governed by regulation. As the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> has said, during the war period it was no doubt essential that something' in the nature of a War Precautions Act should be in operation to enable the Government of the day to cope with war emergencies, but I certainly think that those charged with the administration of the Act exceeded the intentions of those who voted for it. They availed themselves of it to frame regulations, which would not only assist us as a community in discharging our functions from a military point of view, but to enable the Government to interfere with the normal conditions of labour and industry. I decidedly object to the <inline font-style="italic">personnel,</inline> of the Boards which are controlling industries in this country, and to the methods adopted by them. While it is necessary in order to prevent profiteering and the exploitation of the people, that the Government should exercise some control over various industries, I do not think it was in the best interests of the people to concentrate this power in the hands of the biggest capitalists in the community, and to totally exclude the small man. That, however, is what has occurred in connexion with the appointment of these Boards. Many of those who,- before the war, were in a small way of business, have been driven out. The capital and industry of the country have been concentrated in the hands of big financial magnates and institutions such as Dalgety and Company, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and the Shipping Ring. The Board controlling shipping is composed of the largest shipowners in the Commonwealth, and small ship-owners have to "  kow  tow " to them to secure a crust by the running of their craft. These financial magnates, flapping flags and assuming an air of patriotism, have declared that their operations are in the interests of the people. The truth is that they have, used their power to fleece the industrial sections of the community. That is the position in regard to several of the Boards that have been created to control various activities. The Coal Board, for instance, was appointed to regulate the price and supply of coal; but it has also regulated the labour associated with the getting of coal. If the Government would take direct control of these industries I should not object, but I do object to the camouflage in which they have indulged. I do not believe in creating a Board consisting of the wealthiest coal mine-owners in the country, together with two or three Government nominees, who, receiving instructions from the owners, issue, under the War Precautions Act, regulations which bolster up the interests of these men to the detriment of those employed in the industry and the consuming public generally. And yet the Government tell the people that they are protecting their interests. As a matter of fact, they have not protected the interests of the people. During the last four years, under the camouflage of appointing so-called boards to control various industries, they have been a party to the fleecing of the people. An honorable member opposite smiles. I would remind him that the report of a Commission which inquired into the butter industry with which he is connected, shows that a good deal of fleecing has been indulged in by his constituents. The consumers in Australia during the last three or four years have been compelled to pay for butter more than they should have done. </para>

                            <para>- Just as honorable members opposite will do a few months hence if they agree to the passing of this Bill. If it is passed, I am confident that within the next five or six months there will be such an outcry that the Government and their supporters will be forced to reconsider their decision. Honorable members opposite would be well advised in voting against this Bill. As to the press censorship, I have to-day received a letter stating that it has not been relaxed, in any degree. This letter refers to a case, not relating to the movements of our troops or troopships, or anything of the kind, but to a simple ode to Peace written by a woman for one of the Socialist organs. This ode has been censored. </para>

                            <para>- I am in accord with the idea that the Governmentshould exercise full restriction in certain directions, and that it is quite necessary that some of the regulations should be kept in operation, not only to the termination of the war, but, as a matter of fact, for all time. If it should be the lot of members on this side to be in power at the end of two years, as I believe we will, I shall have very much pleasure in supporting some of these regulations when they are put into the shape of Acts of Parliament. I remember hearing the late Lord Forrest saying that the War Precautions Act was brought into existence to deal with " the other fellow," and that he was going to deal with that "other fellow" effectively while the Government had the power. I remarked at the time that this was a policy of spoils to the victors ; and I can only now say that if we on this side get a chance of dealing with the "other fellow," we will deal with him just as effectively as we have been dealt with during the last three years. </para>

                            <para>- It is a promise. It appears very strange to me that, while the Government had all the power necessary to deal with any associations it pleased, they found it necessary to pass an Unlawful Associations Act. Evidently the Government recognised that the War Precautions Act would be absolutely invalid at the termination of the war, and, to make sure that the men whom they had imprisoned should be kept in prison, the special Act was passed. </para>

                    <para>It would be very easy for the Government to introduce a special Act, giving them the specific powers they wish to exercise after peace is declared; and that, I think, is the proper course to pursue. If there is not the necessary constitutional authority to enforce such an Act, let them do as a previous Government did - take a referendum of the people. On that occasion there were a dozen questions submitted asking for extended powers in regard to industrial matters, monopolies, price fixing, and in other directions; and I should be quite prepared to take the platform in support of the Government if they put their proposals in a similar form before the people. It is absolute despotism on the part of the Government to continue one moment longer than is necessary the War Precautions Regulations ; they have been most unfairly administered. All that is necessary is for the Executive of the Government - not the Government - to get together and issue what regulations they choose, which must be accepted with all the penalties. This is not government by the people, but government by ten or twelve members of the Executive; indeed, it is only necessary for three members of the Government to meet together and pass regulations, which are then binding on the whole Parliament and people. That state of affairs should not be permitted in Australia. We are here as representatives of the people, and if the Government desire these powers, they should appeal to the people to give them. </para>
                    <para class="block">As a matter of fact, the people recognise the necessity for certain powers that have been acquired under the War Precautions Act; but it is absolute arrogance on the part of the Government to assume that the people wish them to retain all the powers they have exercised during the last four years. The majority of the regulations should be burnt, so that there may be a little more freedom in the community, and better relations between employer and employed. To-day the employer is using the Act and the regulations to camouflage his business. Whenever the employees go to him with a complaint, or endeavour to take him into Court for an infringement of an agreement or an award, he pulls out a few regulations, and tells them that if they desire any alteration they must go to the Government, who are running his business. If the employees go to the Government, they are referred to a Board, on which they find the business manager to whom they went in the first instance. They are simply chased from pillar to post; and, in order that we may know exactly where we are, it is time the Act and regulations were " scrapped." </para>
                    <para>So far as the shipping is concerned, there does not seem to be any definite control by either the Government or the Board. The unions that are working under the Board can get no redress from either the Board or the Government; and, personally, , I should like to see the Board disbanded, and conditions put back to normal. In the past, as a union, we have done very well with the employers, and we can do very well in the future if we are allowed to take our own course. </para>

The amount in question was frequently1d., but more often½d. ; and I issued instructions that prosecutions were not to follow on such trifling breaches of the regulations until such time as printed price-lists were in the possession of every storekeeper. </para>

                            <para>- No prosecution can be withdrawn without the sanction of the Minister. I authorized the withdrawal of some prosecutions, and I did so for excellent reasons. When one is administering a Department, he must use his judgment in these matters. I can give an instance of the withdrawal of a prosecution. A regulation was gazetted for fixing the price of some kind of infant's food, the wholesale price being fixed at bo much per dozen tins, this being the contents of the package usually delivered by wholesalers. In the course of his business, one wholesaler was called upon to deliver quite a number of broken packages, and he adopted the usual trade practice of adding a small percentage per tin for the broken package. An officer in New South Wales strongly recommended a prosecution, and this had been taken in hand before I went to the Department; but when the facts came under my notice I took the view that the wholesaler had only followed the usual trade practice, and that the fault lay in the fact that our regulation did not prescribe that a <inline font-style="italic">broken</inline> packet should be charged for 'at a slight increase per tin. The officer in New South Wales took the strongest objection to what I had done, but, nevertheless, the prosecution was withdrawn, and I immediately gave instructions that the regulation should provide for an increased charge per tin for the broken package. </para>

                        <para>. - This question is by no means as simple as some honorable members seem to think it is. I have noticed that the speeches made on the Opposition side of the House have all turned upon some individual abuse in regard to one branch of the exercise of the powers given by the War Precautions' Act, and that they have not dwelt in any way upon the broad principle which we are now called upon to decide. I am not opposed to the Bill, but I am opposed to the form in which it has been brought before the House. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wallace)</inline> expressed an opinion which I thoroughly indorse, that, instead of bringing before the House a Bill containing one broad principle of renewal for a number of months, the Government should have specified the particular directions in which they desired to have the powers given by the War Precautions Act extended.. Looking at this question in a very broad way, we have to remember that u we pride ourselves on being a self-governing community. We have our Parliament elected upon a franchise which, I suppose, is the most liberal in the world, and, however unequal we may be to the expectation of outsiders in looking at our proceedings, we have the satisfaction of knowing that every detail affecting the liberties of our people- is fully, clearly, and freely, even if quarrelsomely, discussed in this Chamber. As a self-governing community, we found ourselves plunged into a war which sometimes necessitated very prompt and very drastic action regarding public affairs, and the party in power at the time - it must not be forgotten that it was the Labour party - followed the cue of the British Parliament, and introduced a War Precautions Bill. </para>

When the honorable member makes an observation, of that sort, I am disposed to think that he does not know much about the question. If Great Britain found that it was necessary to pass similar legislation, it was quite as necessary to introduce it here. I admit the necessity of the legislation. It would not have done to have left it to Parliament to discuss any measure - which might have taken weeks and months owing to obstruction - required for the purpose of carrying but certain things essential to our ' success in the war. But while it was necessary to pass this legislation, most thoughtful men regarded it as very dangerous to take away all the responsibility of Parliament and place it in the hands of an Executive who naturally would grow careless in the exercise of an arbitrary power. We know very well that in different countries of the world where oligarchies govern they grow careless, and get to think that the extraordinary power which  they  are able to exercise is an inherent power, and that they cannot make mistakes. The same infirmity attaches to a Government, Cabinet, or Ministry which has an arbitrary power placed long in its hands. I am not going to say that this Government or the Government which introduced the measure has exercised this power in a way that has done any great harm, but it is a power which we as a Parliament do not wish to see continued longer than is absolutely necessary. There is no doubt, if we could take a broad survey of the activities of the Government during the war, we should recognise that the powers given to the Government have helped very much in winning the war, and in making more effective our small contribution to the great struggle in Europe. </para>

                    <para>The war is now practically over, and we find that these powers will naturally extend up to a point at which we consider it is terminated. I read of a number of people saying, " Until peace is proclaimed." I do not anticipate that there will be any proclamation of peace between ourselves and our enemies. Our enemies are defeated, and there is no doubt a time will come when we shall lay down the conditions upon which we shall agree to terminate our invasion of their country. The armistice, according to the Hague Convention, is only a temporary cessation of war pending the securing of its purpose. Our purpose is to defeat our enemies completely. We do nothing now beyond suspending hostilities until we have actually entered the enemy country and demonstrated to its people, not only that we are going to hold ourselves as a company may regard a receiver, but also that we are an Army in possession until we get a clear acknowledgment that they are willing to carry out the terms which we impose upon them as a condition of our final cessation of war with them. At all events, the time will come when it will be held by the Courts that the powers of the War Precautions Act have come to an end. The Government anticipate, and we all anticipate, that possibly before the House meets again after Christmas, we may find these powers have exhausted themselves, and the Government naturally come to us and say, " These powers are so drastic, so far reaching, and so multifarious in their character and effect that we must ask you to give us authority to continue them for a certain time." I agree with- the Government up to that point, but I differ from them in regard to the form in which the Bill has been brought before the House. The onus is upon Ministers to select for the approval of the House those forms of the war precautions powers which they think it absolutely necessary to continue, so that honorable members may be consulted in regard to those particular activities. Prom the Minister's speech I gather that the principal powers may be comprehended under the following heads : - </para>

                            <para>- No, but I understood these to be the principal heads. I have observed in several of the speeches that have been made that there has been a tendency, especially on the part of the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts),</inline> to deal, not with the broad question, but with microscopic aspects of one or more of the powers. The honorable member seemed to think that some abuses had been practised.  His  first attempt was with regard to the regulation of prices, but the Minister in charge of price fixing very  soon satisfied the House that the honorable member had discovered a mare's nest, or a number of them, and had been misinformed. </para>

                            <para>- Because the honorable member dealt with one only. That was not a fair method of treating this measure. It must be dealt with in a broad spirit. We cannot say, "Here is an abuse in a particular direction under <inline font-style="italic">one</inline> of these particular heads, and, therefore, you must not have a renewal of any of these powers." That would be a schoolboy's method of treating the question. If the honorable member for Cook would take up the line which I am suggesting, and which the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wallace)</inline> took up, that we must perforce, as representatives of the people, consent to some extension of these powers, provided the Government show quite clearly that they are necessary, I would agree with him. Let me deal with these particular powers. The Minister in the course of his speech said that the gentlemen who have charge of munitions have pointed out that there are certain commodities connected with the activities under their charge which it is necessary to control, but I do not see any necessity at the present time for giving any further power to these gentlemen to control the particular commodities which go to the making of munitions. We have not succeeded in making munitions in this country, although we were invited by the British Government to do so. </para>

                            <para>- There is no doubt, as the honorable member for  Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> has pointed out, that the Boards created by the Government during the war are very apt to imagine that they have been created for all time, so that they may exercise the powers reposed in them to an unlimited extent, and for an unlimited time, in controlling matters which hitherto were regulated by the law of supply and demand and the commercial activities of the country. It is quite possible that those gentlemen may have represented to the Minister that it is very necessary to regulate some particular commodities for that purpose, but the Minister will have, even under the procedure which I suggest that the Government should follow, the opportunity of bringing these facts before the House and allowing members to decide with him or against him in regard to that particular activity. The subject of shipping is one I do not profess to be able to deal with. I think I know as much about shipping as do most men in this House, but I have no more than enough knowledge to protect me from being " dangerous " by forming immature opinions. A large body of our shipping has been commandeered by the British Government, and is doing, and will continue to do, great work in connexion with our troops and their demobilization. It is quite possible that some of those ships may still require to be detained by the Government under "the war precautions power before all our troops are returned. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know. On that subject I am just as ignorant as is the honorable member; but I think it is very probable that the Minister will be able to tell us that in regard to the vessels that have been commandeered for oversea traffic, it is necessary to continue these extreme powers. I am very doubtful, however, , whether it is necessary, to continue them in regard to Inter-State vessels. It is for the Minister to ascertain that through the proper authority, and explain the situation to the House. This is a very good illustration of the danger of the wholesale continuation of the war precautions powers. It may be quite apparent, when we know the reasons, that whilst it is necessary to continue the powers in regard to oversea shipping, it is quite unnecessary to interfere with the operation of the ordinary law of supply and demand and commercial competition in the Inter-State trade. </para>

In fact, as I grow older I am inclined to think that I do not know much about anything, and that makes me hesitate to express my opinions about matters which are far-reaching. If we knew all the circumstances connected with the shipping  question, we might come to the conclusion that it is highly unwise to longer interfere with the Inter-State traffic, that we ought to allow it to resume its normal movement, but that it m'ay be necessary to continue the extraordinary powers in regard to oversea shipping. </para>

                    <para>In regard ito wool, I think the Minister made it quite clear in his speech that the transactions that have been entered into by the Wool Committee extend so far beyond the date upon which the War Precautions Act will automatically cease tha't it may be necessary to extend the Government's powers in that respect. Price-fixing affords another excellent illustration of the difficulty and danger of a general extension of the war powers. There is no doubt that the Price Fixing Commission has created an immense amount of irritation in the community.' It may have had at times the effect of preventing the regular profiteer, with whom I have no sympathy, making exorbitant and wicked profits. I know of instances in which  colonially-made  goods have been sold at prices three or four times the cost of production. The manufacturers have availed themselves of the high prices prevailing abroad, ' and have made enormous profits, which ought to be  prevented while war conditions continue. We know that freights from a country like America, which were formerly 12s. per ton, have been in recent months £12 per ton, and that increase has so enormously added to the cost of heavy materials, like galvanized iron, that the prices have been almost prohibitive. But there are commodities in connexion with which there should be less extortion, and we might usefully discuss discrimination between those which it is desirable to keep our hands on, and those which we ought to put our hands off. I consider that the Government have framed their Bill in the wrong form. They ought to have asked the House, not for general powers, but for discriminating powers in regard to different matters. If they do that 1 shall be very glad to help in discussing the various items, and to give them the powers which they satisfy me and the House they ought to have. But I shall feel constrained to vote against the Bill in its present form. </para>

                        <para>.- Though I differ from the last speaker in regard to some matters of detail, I am in agreement with him on the general principles of his opposition to the Bill. The Act which gave such wide power to the Executive was passed while the country was in a state of war, and it was absolutely necessary to - do some things rapidly in the interests of the nation. It may not have been advisable to wait for Parliament to discuss certain measures, and thereby lose the opportunity of doing something which was essential for the welfare of the country. Many of the powers conferred by the War Precautions Act were distinctly outside the ambit of the Constitution!, and were justifiable only because the nation was in peril, and because the maintenance of the safety and the stability of the country must be the first consideration of the supreme Government. But the moment the danger to the nation is past those powers automatically cease, and there should be no need, and indeed there would be no right, to exercise them for one day after the safety of the country has been assured. I think this subject  is interesting enough to require a quorum. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> But certain powers which are necessary for the proper conduct of affairs may require to be continued, and so far back as the 12th June of this year I warned the Government that when the war ceased these extraordinary powers would automatically disappear, and I urged upon the Minister in charge of the House at the time the necessity for the Government immediately taking some steps to obtain an extension of our constitutional powers, so that Parliament might operate in a legal way those activities which are at present unconstitutional. No notice was taken of my suggestion, and now the Government are asking the House, not for power to deal with some specific subject, but for a blank cheque, and an authority which will enable three Ministers to exercise the functions which belong to Parliament itself. The request for such powers is outrageous, and Parliament ought to hesitate before granting them. Our system of government has been built up on the assumption that the people govern themselves by electing representatives to Parliament to decree the things that they desire. In no British country has any one man, or any two or three men, the right to shut the door of Parliament, and to do by regulation what Parliament itself would not do. Members on both sides should combine to restore responsible government to Australia. The danger that threatened no longer exists. This Parliament, elected by the people, should make the laws of the country; our laws should not be made by one or two Ministers. If the Government desires power to control the distribution of wool, or wheat, or metals, or anything else, let it bring down ' specific measures, and if its proposals can be justified, Parliament will grant the necessary powers. We should not, however, give to the Minister for Defence power to continue to do what he has been doing since the war began. Such powers should not be in the hands of any one individual. The Government should accept its responsibilities, and come to Parliament for the powers that it needs. Responsible government is menaced, and we should take care that the laws of the country are enacted by Parliament alone. </para>

                        <para>.- I confess that I was in more doubt concerning the wisdom of the vote that I gave for the War Precautions Act than I have been in concerning any other vote cast in this House. The bitterness that has been infused into the debate is to be regretted . It is due to the circumstances that brought about the disruption of the old Labour party shortly after the passing of the War Precautions Act. I clearly see the difficulties in which the Government is placed. The old props .by which business and commerce were supported have disappeared. They were anything but perfect, and often were rotten and corrupt. They have been supplanted by a system of Government control. We cannot now throw aside our responsibilities in connexion with this system without chaos supervening. The discussion has shown the division between the truly National Labour members and the Official Labourites, and between the National Labour members and the members of the old Liberal party with whom we are at present co-operating. Members opposite have had a great deal to say about the tyrannical application of the War Precautions Regulations. We are all largely in sympathy with what has been said on that head. We are also greatly in sympathy with the controlling of industry by the Government, and the co-operation of Commonwealth and State authorities to secure cheaper marketing. We are interested in maintaining and improving the soundness of the principles to which we have so long subscribed, just as we are anxious that human liberty should not be restricted. During the past four and a half years there have been many cases in which it has been unjustly restricted. I cannot' let the occasion pass without referring to the source of the whole trouble, and showing that if true principles had been subscribed to in the beginning the bitterness which has been displayed would not have been engendered, and the subject under discussion would have been approached in a fairer and more judicial spirit. The old Labour party, with a few exceptions, supported the War Precautions Act, which a Labour Government introduced. We did this either because we felt that the necessities of the war required the passing of  the Act, or because we thought that we  would have the administration of it, and that it was to be the other fellow who would  squirm  But when a few  irreconcilables  outside Parliament, who for many years had been  kept  in subjection, collared the Labour machine, and gave orders to the representatives of the people, and declared that the Labour member was no longer responsible to his constituents, but was the servant of those controlling the Labour machine, had we stood together like men for the Labour platform and constitution, we would not have seen the confusion that has entered into politics in Australia, and we should not have heard the bitter recrimination in which the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts)</inline> has indulged to-night, maintaining that the War Precautions Regulations have been used as a weapon against the members of the Official Labour party. In defence of my leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> M. Hughes - and I speak as a man who had no sympathy with the principle of compulsory service for defence overseas, though in accord with compulsory service for defence within our own borders, because the men so subjected to military discipline would be able to control that discipline by their votes and the votes of their relatives - I say that never was a man more reviled for asking a party to stand by the principles which it had always advocated. It was the saddest experience of my life to see men whom I respected, although willing to protest against the outrage which was being done to the Labour party's platform, acknowledge that they could not live in politics unless they submitted to the power that was dragging Labour principles into the dirt. I stand for the principles for which I have always stood. I believe that the Labour movement is a great humanitarian movement which cannot be stopped by a few extremists who try to take short cuts to liberty by trampling on every principle of individual freedom. </para>

                            <para>- There are men in this Parliament who are willing to make sectarian  gutter swabs  of themselves, and there are men who are willing to degrade their manhood for the sake of political advantages, taking their orders from irresponsible outsiders, and swallowing their principles, instead of. standing forth  boldly  as educators of the people, and showing how the . true doctrines of Democracy have been departed from in a manner which must mean the rise of Autocracy. If we trample on the principles of freedom, for which the Labour movement stood in the past, punishment will follow. If we prove unworthy of our inheritance of political freedom, autocracy will be the result. . What was on trial at the time of the Labour split was the principle of representative Government. No body of men has the right to control the actions of the representatives of the people. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member knew well that a joint protest was being drawn up against the tyranny that threatened. Some of us subscribed to it, not only with our names, but also with our deeds, and by following our leader out of the party room, made clear our opposition to an attempt at coercion which was contrary to Labour principles, and without constitutional warrant. Because we are now in co-operation with those to whom for years we were opposed, we have not in the slightest degree sunk the principles in which we believe. We maintain that it is for the constituencies to deal with their representatives. The Labour split was the result of the most tyrannous action ever perpetrated in the political history of any country, and it has brought about great trouble. As for the War Precautions Regulations, we hold that every restriction on individual action and freedom should be swept away as soon as possible. But the bitterness engendered by the disruption of a great party was like that caused by the quarrelling of the members of a big family, and the drastic application of the War Precaution's Regulations prevented certain developments that would have brought disgrace upon Australia. If we, a self-governing Dominion, possessing the freest Constitution and the fullest franchise on earth, had resorted to revolutionary or reactionary methods, we should have furnished the strongest argument for Kaiserdom that the world has known. We should have proved the unwisdom of trusting the people, and should have subscribed to a principle to which so many nations have subscribed to their utter discomfiture, namely, that the vast majority of the people are so ignorant and incompetent that government must be left to the intelligent few. However harsh the regulations made under the War Precautions Act may have been in their application, they did good service in certain cases, because it was known that there was a hand of steel behind them.  It was known that there would be no wincing on the part of the Government in giving effect to them. In this way Australia has been piloted safely through the most crucial period in her history. She has come through that period with credit. As an Australian who loves his country, I say that Australia has done her duty during this perilous period, despite the tendency on the part of a great many individuals to spend their force in fighting and rending each other in the unhappy circumstances to which I have already referred. I trust, however, that the Government will recognise that while their difficulties are great, all sections of the community are claiming with justice that many, of these restrictions upon individuals shall be swept away, while others are anxious for a measure of Government control. Although some businesses have suffered by reason of governmental intervention, and can be carried on reasonably and honestly without this form of Government control, there are many business people who are anxious to get rid of it altogether, so that the helpless in the community may be further exploited. I hope that the greatest care will be exercised by the Government, so that we shall not have the experience of other countries that are now in a state of chaos and disruption. Those who foolishly think that now that the War is over, every restriction may be removed, must be reminded that the world has been shaken to its very foundation. Wars equally as bitter, but not as bloody, as that through which we have just passed will be waged from one end of the world to the other with regard to the old systems under which  production and distribution were carried on, and upon which the relations between nations and Empires were based. There will be a tremendous upheaval, and it will require all the sagacity and statesmanship that every party can bring to bear to preserve the process of evolution by which better and truer methods with regard to not only individuals but nations and empires may be gained. Even the very principle of empire building is now at stake. Those who would rush us into extreme systems of communal Socialism need to be reminded that the peace with which we hope shortly to be blessed will be the greatest triumph for national individualism that the world has ever known. It will be a recognition of the right of small nations to exist, and of the right of a free people to determine their own future, and to give effect to it, according to whatever standard of honesty, and intelligence they can evolve. It is upon such a principle that peace will be based. Our hope of a League of Nations is also founded upon it. Those who challenge the right of the Government to gradually perfect a better system, and to carry on in this way until the world's peace terms are proclaimed -  -those  who would rush us into wild extremes must be made to realize this fact.. </para>

                    <para>We have great activities in full operation at the present moment. We have, for instance, the Wheat Pool. And as a working farmer, I say that we have to thank the Federal and State Governments for their co-operative action in respect of the Wheat Pool, as the result of which the Australian farmers have been saved during the last four and a half years from almost complete extinction. It is true that ill-informed people are constantly trying to poison the minds of the farmers of the community by pointing to what they describe as the terrible consequences of Government interference. But it is as clear as daylight, that no market would have been available for our wheat - no means of marketing or financing our wheat crops could have been evolved - if the credit of the country had not been pledged as it was by the Federal and State Governments. Although as a farmer I am well aware that grave mistakes have "been made in connexion with the administration of this scheme - although I know that wasteful systems have been developed - I recognise the absolute soundness of the basic principle of  this system of control which has spelt such success for the farmer. However distasteful it may be to many honorable members, I hope that when we get rid of party differences we shall be able to evolve great co-operative systems as between the Commonwealth and State Governments by means of which our produce will be carried by Government-owned fleets of vessels to the various markets at the very lowest rate, and that every farmer, whether rich or poor, will secure exactly the same advance in respect of his produce until it has been finally sold. In that way the salvation of our farmers will be secured. It is absolutely impossible for farmers' associations by cooperation or any other method to finance the needy farmers in their tens of thousands throughout Australia, and to remove them from that unfortunate position which made them the prey of the speculator in previous years. It is only by the strength and power of the Commonwealth and State Governments that that can be done. </para>
                    <para>In conclusion, I urge the Government to at least give us what the people outside are anxiously waiting for, and that is immediate relief from many of the regulations framed under the "War Precautions Act. I shall not discuss the question of whether they were necessary or not. The fact remains that at the present time they are utterly needless, and are as a galling girth round a free people who have shown that they can express in the highest degree the independence of a free people and at the same time perform the noblest duties of citizenship when their independence and freedom are at stake. </para>

In my electorate, there is the Mount Morgan mine, which employs about 2,000 men, and a recent statement by the director of the company goes to show that there is a fear that the mine will have to be closed down unless something is done in regard to copper. Then, the speech of the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> goes to show that, judging from the management of the wheat position, the Prime Minister is not fitted to carry out business dealings on behalf of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- That may be, but I draw attention to the fact that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> said in his second telegram, " I did not intend to convey that the wheat was sold. The wheat is not sold, though the Royal Commission contends that it is." My point is that the Prime Minister is so poor a businessman, and so little acquainted with business methods, that he offered the wheat at 38s. to the Royal Commission on certain conditions. I do not know their names, but I venture to say that the Commission is composed of business men, and they accepted the offer, and contend that the wheat is sold. After the Prime Minister had made the offer to the Royal Commission, and the offer was accepted, the Prime Minister commenced to haggle about the conditions. </para>

I suppose the Royal Commission found that the Prime Minister was not a business man, and they objected to his methods. Then the Prime Minister went, not to the Royal Commission, but to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. </para>

The right honorable gentleman, by his distinguished presence and his eloquence, might have been able to secure for Australia a sale of wheat which the Prime Minister, after five long months, has been unable to accomplish. </para>

He cabled to the Prime Minister on the 25th June, and got no reply. After some days he cabled again; and if honorable members look at the dates of these communications 'they will see that intervals from three days to thirty-one days elapsed before the Prime Minister sent replies. The Acting Prime Minister has endeavoured to excuse the Prime Minister by saying that those who know what cabling is, know that an answer cannot be got in less than four or five days. </para>

                        <para>- All this only shows that a mistake has been made in allowing the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> to deal with the matter over so long a period. At the end of five months he sends a cable, saying that it is impossible to make a deal with the British Government ; and now Australia and its wheat producers are to be placed in a disadvantageous position. The honorable member knows so little about business matters that it is unsafe to leave him on the other side of the world. </para>

                    <para>.- I rise to impress on the Government the necessity for improving their method of dealing with Bills. Last night we had the Defence Bill brought forward, and I hardly know a word strong enough to describe their conduct in managing the business of the House. There is no unanimity behind Ministers. Today we had a War Precautions Bill for consideration, and members sitting behind the Government seemed to have no idea of what Ministers had brought forward. They condemned  the measure wholesale. I want to ' give the Government a little advice. When these Bills are prepared, let them be laid before meetings of the party in caucus; so that their supporters may know what legislation is to be brought forward. The delays caused by the lack of knowledge of honorable members supporting the Government regarding the contents of "Bills are of serious importance to the people. There are honorable members on this side who are ready to assist in carrying on the business of the House; but when we see such an exhibition of incompetency on the part of Ministers, and such a disregard for the wishes of the country) we are justified in drawing attention to the wholesale delays which take place in the conduct of business. Honorable members opposite were sent here to bring forward certain measures, yet they do not agree among themselves when the Bills are brought down to the House. They are worse than a lot of school children. It is absolutely annoying to honorable members on this side to have to sit here and see this disagreement and misunderstanding among honorable members opposite. It would not matter much if the disagreement merely affected individuals. The trouble is that it affects the interests of the country. Honorable members do not seem to understand that the work of preparing for peace is just as great a responsibility as is the task of preparing for war. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, I have discovered it. If the Acting Prime Minister would only accept my advice and hand over his Treasurership to some other member of the Ministry who may be capable of filling the office, he could devote the whole of his time to the duties of Acting Prime Minister. There are many people who cannot obtain interviews with him, because it is impossible for him to spare the time to see them. I make no apology for delaying honorable members now. I hope that my few remarks will result in the Government bringing forward measures for which we are thirsting. We are anxious on this side that the business of the country should be proceeded with. If Ministers cannot carry on, let them say so, and we on this side will show them how to do it. In future I hope that Bills will be brought forward after the party has given consideration to them, so that we shall not have a renewal of the spectacle we have witnessed during the last couple of days. 'We should set an example to the .State Parliaments in the matter of the conduct of business. Until such time as we have freedom of speech and a free press in this country I shall take every opportunity of pointing out the way in which the Government have mismanaged the affairs of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Sinclair),</inline> and other honorable members who were on the Price-fixing Board with myself, know perfectly well that our resignations took place because the Government issued regulations making it absolutely impossible for our work to be carried on. Instead of the Government having the courage and manliness to say that they wanted to be rid of responsible men, who insisted on work being done instead of being mere tools whose recommendations could be ignored, they issued regulations which made it impossible for our work to be carried on, and immediately all the members of the Price-fixing Board, which represented both sides of the House, resigned. </para>

This means cheap rabbit poisoning material for the squatter, but dear bread for the people. In my time we did not have the wholesale violations of pricefixing regulations which we now see, and yet the Government absolutely refuse to initiate prosecutions. Price fixing so far as they are concerned is absolute make believe. There has been no serious attempt at price fixing or at policing and carrying out the law in that regard. </para>

                        <para>- I do not agree with the Acting Prime Minister. The Government received a report from the Inter-State Commission in which they were advised to institute control of meat prices. The Acting Prime Minister said that he would not be bullied by the meat interests; he was going ahead with price fixing. What has become of it ? There has been no diminution of prices; in some of the suburbs of Sydney, particularly Newtown and Enm'ore, prices have actually increased since the Government issued their fixed rates. Will the Minister in charge of price fixing have prepared a table showing the number of cases in which prosecutions were recommended for violation of the price fixing regulations when he came into office, the names of the firms concerned, and the number of charges against them; also in how many cases recommendations have been submitted to him since he became Minister to initiate prosecutions, and the names of the firms against which proceedings were taken?

                    <para>. - In reference to the remarks made by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> I do not desire to bandy words with the honorable member, who is an experienced parliamentarian, or to endeavour to engender bad feeling between the Ministerial party and the Opposition, but I say again that I doubt his <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> with respect to the alleged quarrel between the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy. I am in possession of enough information to say that the bulk, if not all, of the statements in the press are untrue, and I hope to be able to-morrow by means of a joint cablegram from those two gentlemen, which I shall read to the House if it arrives in time, to thoroughly confirm my statement. I say further that I am without doubt that the Prime Minister has with respect to wheat, wool, copper, and the other things, thirty or forty in number, which the Government have asked him to attend to in addition to his manifold other public duties, in the most assiduous way done all that mortal man could do under the extremely difficult conditions that obtain with all the watertight departments of the British Government to be visited, to uphold the interests of Australia. As to the Prime Minister's ability, I think it is so much nonsense to say to this House that he is unable to deal with a matter like the wheat sale. All the transactions that have taken place, with the exception of the last wool sale, were engineered and guided by him. They involved most important and tangled questions of finance and negotiation, and I join with the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lynch)</inline> in saying that, whatever people may think in regard to the honorable gentleman's politics or the cleavage that occurred in the Labour party during the war, this country must, when the record of Australia is read, give the greatest possible credit to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> not alone for his efforts, but also for his magnificent results which have largely contributed to stabilize this country during  the period of greatest crisis and tremor. It is of no use talking at this late hour for political purposes of either neglect or ineptitude, because I am sure that the right honorable gentleman has contributed all that is in him to settle these important questions. </para>

                        <para>- The Pools were established largely through the instrumentality of the right honorable gentleman, and but for them wheat would have been at a serious discount, compared with pre-war prices, instead of being elevated to a parity with all the wheats of the world. As to his selling wheat and wool cheaper than they should have been sold, ask the men who produce those commodities. </para>

                        <para>- Let me take for what it is worth that statement, made more in sorrow than in anger, if one can trust the countenance of the honorable member. If, as the honorable gentleman seems to imagine, the Prime Minister had nothing to do but to sell the wheat, if there were only one man in London to whom he could take it, and if the cables were free of congestion, one could expect to receive an answer within forty-eight hours. But that is not the position. Various authorities have to deal with this question. There is the financial authority on the one hand, the shipping authority on the other hand, and the purchasing authority for the third part. This question is mixed up with all the other matters with which the right" honorable gentleman has been dealing. The gaps in the cables do not represent either neglect or forgetfulness; they represent the difficulties in the situation. One gap is explained by  the fact that the Prime Minister of England was absent in the South of England for three weeks, and, therefore, it was not possible for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> to deal with the head of the Imperial Government in this matter. If time permitted, I could explain all the other gaps. I tell the honorable member that shortness of memory and political malevolence are responsible for many of his thoughts on this question. </para>
