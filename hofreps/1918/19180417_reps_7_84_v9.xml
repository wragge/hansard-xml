                        <para>- The answers to the honorable member's questions are as follow :  - 1 and 2. From 22nd February, 1915, the exportation of wool to Japan was confined to merino wool only. From 13th March, 1915, the exportation to Japan of crossbred wool was also allowed. From 27th April, 1915, the exportation of crossbred wool to Japan was again prohibited. From 21st September, 1915, crossbred wool was again permitted exportation to Japan in common with other allied countries. After 1st March, 1916, crossbred wool was prohibited exportation to Japan, unless advice was received from the British authorities that the wool was required for Japanese military purposes. After 23rd November, 1916, the date on which War Precautions ( Supplementary ) Regulations No. 23, acquiring the Australian wool clip on behalf of the British Government, were issued, the exportation of wool was subject to instructions received from the Director of Baw Materials, London, acting on behalf of the Imperial Government. </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable members will recollect that on Friday I was proposing to reply to the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falkiner)</inline> on the matter of wool-tops manufacture, and to give reasons why the Government should not hold office. The honorable member for Hume said that the capita] of the Colonial Combing, Spinning and Weaving Company, namely, £5,008, was not the whole of the capital which was used by it in carrying out its agreement with the Government. The honorable member's statement is probably correct. The capital which is being., used by the Colonial Combing, Spinning and Weaving Company is that which was used by F. W. Hughes and Company Limited. As honorable members may recollect from a previous debate upon this matter, the latter company went into liquidation on the 23rd July, 1915, and the former company was formed to take over its assets and liabilities. The shareholders in F. W. Hughes and Company were to obtain, and did obtain, I believe, debentures for their shares, and the Colonial Combing, Spinning and Weaving Company agreed to pay them 7 per cent, for those debentures, which represented a great deal more than the dividends paid by F. W. Hughes and Company. My objection to this agreement is that it lias been brought about in a secret way. The concession given by the Commonwealth Government to the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and &lt; Weaving Company is a very valuable one, and should have been advertised as we advertise all other privileges and concessions. We even advertise the appointment of messengers in the Telegraph Department; we do not appoint them secretly. This concession has resulted in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frederick</inline> William Hughes obtaining, in six ' months, profits amounting to £48,367, so that honorable members will readily see that it is, as I say, &amp; most valuable one. I am greatly surprised today to find that it is the Central Wool Committee which informed this House that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes was only indirectly interested in the profits of this concern. The Central Wool Committee knows as well as does the Prime Minister that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes holds 20,001 shares out of a total of 20,008 shares in the company, and his portion of the profits is £48,367, while his fellow share holders receive amongst them £16 8s. 4d. I cannot believe, as I propose to show later on, that this is the distribution of profits. </para>

                        <para>- All is allowed for. But I wish to come to F. W. Hughes Limited. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes is a very clever  man, I understand, and he was able to persuade this House to give him a bounty on wool tops. The bounty was in existence for several years, and was stopped on the 31st December, 1915. It was given because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes stated that the payment of the bounty would give employment to a lot of highly skilled labour. Having got the bounty carried as a matter of law, he formed a company, and promised the shareholders in that company £50,000 a year profit, though I do not think he quite got that sum. However, the company was formed; and I have here a document showing the shareholders' of the company together with 'the amount of the nominal capital, the number of shares taken, and the amount paid up. The items are set forth in the document I have in my hand, and as these would take up much time in reading them, I shall be glad if the  Chairman  will permit me to rapidly pass over them, and have them printed <inline font-style="italic">in Hansard.</inline> At present I shall merely give the totals. The sum of £1 per share was called up on 73,001 shares, 18s. on 76,999, £1 on 19,685, and 10s. on 10,315- a total of paid-up capital of £167,152 2s. 6d. ' The list shows the shareholders with the various shares held, and we find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frederick</inline> William Hughes possesses 67,628; Matilda Diana Hughes, 20,113; Frank Herbert Hughes, 2,050; Frederick Yelverton Wilson, .1,600; and Maud Yelverton Wilson, 3,000. The directors in this company hold the greater portion of the interest- -indeed. I imagine they hold a dominant interest - in F. W. Hughes and Company. </para>

                    W. Hughes, before the InterState Commission, declared that he held a half interest in Frederick William Hughes Limited." The devious ways of this gentleman entitle the public to a Royal Commission of inquiry into the methods adopted by him as a member of the honorary committee of the Central Wool Board to get the contract, or enter into the arrangement, with the Government which yielded him a profit of £48,367 within six months. He quite misrepresented to this House the reasons "why he should get the bounty. When he appeared before the Inter-State Commission to give evidence in 1914 that Commission decided that the intention of the bounty on wool tops was undoubtedly to encourage the exportation of wool in a partly manufactured state, " an attainment," says the Commission, "much to be desired, but the methods employed are more likely to prove to the injury than to the advantage of the Australian industry." The Inter-State Commission decided that the payment of the bounty was improper, and they recommended Parliament to abolish it, and it was abolished.

                <para>To ascertain what is the capital operated by, the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, we have to take into consideration a subsidiary company called the Colonial  Wholesale Meat Company. According to the Tariff Report 1914-15, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> W. Hughes, in his evidence before the Commission, said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>We supply about one-third of the Sydney requirements in mutton. We are killing about 20,000 sheep per week at the present <inline font-style="italic">time.</inline> We guarantee the Colonial Wholesale Meat Company, Which is a subsidiary company to F. W. Hughes Ltd., a dividend limited to 6 per cent, on its paid-up capital. The capital of the company is £30,000, of which £7,935 is paid up. The shares are held mainly by pastoralists. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That has an important bearing on the case, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> C. Watson, in a letter to the press the other day, said it was a very difficult matter to ascertain the profits of the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, because of the manner in which they worked their business, £hey having decided to lump all the profits together. According to the agreement between the Colonial Wholesale Meat Company and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> W. Hughes, the profits of the Meat Company could only be 6 per cent. However, I shall come to that later. </para>
                <para>To my mind, the most serious part of this agreement that has been entered into on behalf of F. W. Hughes and Company, otherwise the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, is the fact that the Commonwealth Government has, apparently, been a party to the restriction, in the interests of this company, of the export of greasy and scoured wool to Japan. The honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falkiner)</inline> said at our last meeting that it was not true that the Central Wool Committee were responsible for the restriction of the export of wool to Japan. Technically, he may be correct; but it is a fact that, for a period, as has been stated here this afternoon by the Prime Minister,' Japan, our ally, who has rendered splendid service during this war - who has, I understand, escorted our troops abroad - has been refused greasy and scoured wool, while permitted to buy ' as much wool tops as she cares to buy from the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company and F. W. »  Whiddon Limited. </para>
                <para>Who will believe for a moment that the British Government have ordered that Japan is not to get any greasy and scoured wool, while she may get as much wool tops as can be used in manufacture in Japan ? Who will believe that the British Government, occupied as it is with such stupendous and important work, have the time to go into these details ? In this connexion, a Royal Commission could ascertain what was the object of the visit of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> Y. Wilson, solicitor to this company, to England in the early part of 1917, and whether he pointed out to the British Government what a splendid thing it was for his company that greasy and scoured wool should be prevented from going to Japan, and Japan confined to purchasing wool tops from these two companies. I have here an extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> supporting the Japanese claim to be allowed to get greasy and scoured wool.* Japan has been compelled to go to America and South Africa for it, although prior to the war she was able to obtain large quantities of it from this country. While Japan is prevented from getting it, our other Allies - France, Italy, the United States, and Russia - have been allowed to obtain it. What is the reason for this? We ought to know. We know that wool has gone to America, because in the <inline font-style="italic">Textile World Journal</inline> of 16th June, 1917, it is said that - "The action of the British Government in ordering the release of 45,000 bales of Australian wools for shipment to this country was gratifying to American woollen manufacturers." If America can get this wool, -why not our Ally Japan? </para>
                <para>The Prime Minister and his Government are very much concerned ' lest any  member of this House should say anything to hurt the feelings of Japan. That is quite proper, too. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> made a great mistake some time ago at an Australian Natives Association banquet when he ridiculed Americans and the American. <inline font-weight="bold">President, Mr. Wilson.</inline> We ought to be very careful what we say to give offence to any nation that is on our side. The Government have taken very great pains to prevent any honorable member saying anything which will hurt the feelings of the Japanese people or Government. </para>

                        <para>- It is more likely to hurt the feelings of the Japanese nation to find that the British Government, apparently with the approval of the Commonwealth Government, refuse to allow Japan to get the greasy and scoured wool from this country that she used to get before the war. The Japanese people are likely to pay greater attention to an injury of that kind than to any remarks which a member of this House may make. The conduct of the British Government is under review from time to time in the Japanese Diet, and the action of the British Government in preventing the passage of this wool to Japan, with the approval of the Commonwealth Government to that action, is likely to support those members of the Japanese Diet who say that the alliance between England and Japan is more in the interests of one side than the other.

                        <para>- My statement can be substantiated. The Commonwealth Government has entered into an agreement with Messrs. F. W. Hughes and Company, otherwise the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, for the manufacture of wool tops. In a time of war, when poor persons axe being appealed to for subscriptions to war bonds, and are being asked to borrow money to lend it to the Government, this firm is permitted, under an agreement with the Government, to make a profit of £48,367 in six months. It is that that I wish to expose. </para>

                    <para>. -  I regret that I was not here last week when the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> gave the Committee the first instalment of this phantasy, with which he has entertained us again this afternoon. The honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett),</inline> in the admirable maiden speech which he delivered some time ago, set out the position  very  clearly. Since then the honorable member for Capricornia has been groping about for fresh ammunition, and that he has just fired off. The honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falkiner)</inline> is said to have stated that he is very sorry that the Central Wool Committee had had anything to do with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes; I congratulate myself that it was that Committee and not I that made this contract with him. I am certain, of course, that what the Committee did has been in the interests of all connected with the wool industry. I shall endeavour, so far as I can with the information at my disposal - for which I am indebted to the Central Wool Committee - to set out the facts. The honorable member for Capricornia says that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes is making a great deal of money Probably he is. Were he the only man in the country who is now making a great deal of money the matter would be simple; but he has been singled out for special treatment, the observations of the honorable member for Capricornia being smeared' with the venom of suggestions about corruption and improper conduct, though the honorable member did not venture to say to what person or body of persons his remarks apply. He made a general statement that there is something improper, if not corrupt, in the transaction about which he spoke. I do not believe it for a moment. On the contrary, I believe that the business men to whom the control of this gigantic transaction has been intrusted have done their work honorably, as might have been expected of them, and in a business-like fashion. </para>

                <para>The statement, first of all, is that the Government, through the Central Wool Committee, have permitted the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company to make exorbitant profits -the inference being that the Government assisted the company to do this by the terms of the contract made with the company. From the inception of the Central Wool Committee until to-day, the part played by the Government in all its transactions has been merely to give executive effect to its recommendations, and by way of general answer to the charges of the honorable member for Capricornia, I say that there is not a word of truth in them. I have received from the  chairman  of the Committee a memorandum setting out the major facts, and these speak for themselves. They are so plain that they do not permit of misunderstanding or misrepresentation. </para>
                <para>It may be well that I should  recall  to honorable members the genesis of the Central Wool Committee, and remind them of its functions and responsibilities. They will recollect that it was decided by this Government, on the request of the British Government, to take control of the whole wool clip of Australia. At every step that we have taken regarding the exportation of wool, whether as greasy, scoured, in tops, or in any other form, we have acted as the agent of the British Government. Not a bale of wool has been sent from this country except in accordance with the instructions of the British Government, which is the owner of the wool, and for which we act as agent. The honorable member for Capricornia has, by innuendo and statement, endeavoured to furnish the members of the Opposition party in the Japanese Diet with ammunition for use against the Alliance. The solicitude for the interests of Japan which he assumed this afternoon is a new thing with him. It would be a bad day for that country had it no other supporter. I do not think that the honorable member will regard that as a very hard saying. </para>

That conference could, and did, claim to speak for the whole industry. It accepted the offer of the British Government to purchase the unsold balance of our wool clip - amounting to about £24,000,000 worth - at ls. 3½d. per lb., and appointed a committee to carry out the transaction. The Government have ever since given executive effect to the committee's recommendations. For the first time in the history of Australia the wool industry has managed its own business, the Government lending legislative and executive sanction to its proposals.

                        <para>- Well, I leave the honorable member to explain that to the honorable member for Capricornia. The wool-top industry is of the utmost importance. It is the foundation of the great woollen industry, and if this country could utilize all its raw products as well as it is utilizing that portion of the wool which is made into tops, we should be making £50,000,000 instead of the £5,000,000 we are making now. The wool-top industry employs 800 or 900 men. The honorable member for Capricornia spoke as if the building up .from the void of an industry which already employs 800 or 900 men is nothing. Though those employees do not happen 1 to be working in the State which the honorable member represents, every one of them is earning good wages. </para>

                <para>On the 22nd December, 1916, the  chairman  and vice-chairman of the Centra] Wool Committee were appointed a sub-committee to deal with all private matters regarding wool-top companies. A form of agreement in connexion with wool-top contracts was drawn up and submitted to the Central Wool Committee which, on the 30th March, 1917, unanimously accepted the agreement and approved of the fixation of substantial guarantees for  the proper fulfilment of any contract. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes was not present at that meeting, and did not vote. That is the answer to the allegation of the honorable member for Capricornia that the Central Wool Committee made these agreements, either improperly or without due deliberation. The wool-top agreements were delivered to me on the 3rd April, 1917, by the  chairman,  and, on the recommendation of the Central Wool Committee, I signed them. Beyond that I took no part whatever in the fixation of the terms or the preparation of the wooltops contract. The negotiations from first to last were conducted absolutely and entirely by the Central Wool Committee. </para>
                <para>I come now to the financial side of this agreement. The statement made by the honorable member for Capricornia with regard to the capital of the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company is not correct. I refer to the statement he made last week, and if he corrected that statement to-day this contradiction will not apply. The Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company is registered under the Companies Act of New South Wales, and has a capital of £100,000 in 100,000 shares of £1 each. The company's position on the 1st March, 1917, the date of the commencement of the contract, was - </para>

                </para>
                <para class="block">The holders of the contributing shares were debenture-holders and depositors in the company; therefore the uncalled capital on the 20,000 contributing shares was secured. The honorable member for Capricornia stated that on this capital of £20,008 profits amounting to £48,000 were made during the last accounting period. That is not strictly correct. Of the shareholders' funds invested in the company - </para>
                <para class="block">
                    <graphic href="084331191804171_11_1.jpg" />
                </para>
                <para class="block">In other words, at the date of the commencement of the contract, 1st March, 1917, the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company Limited had funds invested in the business representing £400,000. Furthermore, the debenture certificates contained a proviso operative to the 31st July, 1917, granting the holders the right to convert the debentures into shares at face value ; and during the first accountancy period debentures to the value of £41,300 were so converted. </para>
                <para class="block">The profits earned by the company should be compared with the amount actually invested in the business, namely, £400,000, and not £20,008, as stated by the honorable member for Capricornia. The gross profit for the first accountancy period amounted to £96,768, of which the licence-fee to the Commonwealth Government represents £48,384, leaving £48,384, less war-time and other taxation, as the company's proportion. The maximum profit, as set forth in the wool-tops agreement, which the company can earn is one-third of the gross profit, or £32,256, the whole of which has to be re-invested in the company's business. I ask honorable members to take special notice of those two points. In other words, with licence-fee and war-time taxation, the Commonwealth Government receive two-thirds of the gross profits. No dividend or bonus was allowable to the shareholders. The total profit earned must be regarded in relation to the amount invested in the business, and the enormous business done. During the period under review, the company conducted operations by working three eight-hour shifts per day, and produced wool-tops and noils to the value of £629,933. The company paid the full price of15½d. for its raw wool, and the minimum selling price was based on figures fixed by the Army Contracts Committee in London. The Central Wool Committee, in all its ,  transactions, was guided by the most expert advice obtainable. All the figures and estimates supplied by the wool-tops companies have been carefully checked, and the accounts of the company have been audited by a public auditor appointed on the recommendation of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Capricornia has suggested that a Royal Commission be appointed to inquire into the wool-tops contract. The Government and the members of the Central Wool Committee would be pleased to have such an inquiry if it were thought necessary, hut the facts are so plain and so readily obtainable that the necessity does not exist. It might be well again to remind honorable members at this juncture that the Central Wool Committee was elected by a conference representing the wool industry in all its ramifications, that this Committee was elected to control and manage* the affairs of the producers, manufacturers, and others interested, and that the Committee is dealing with a commodity belonging to those who elected, it. It is their own business these gentlemen are carrying on, and not the business of anybody else. If it is suggested that members of the Central Wool Committee have conspired to defraud their principals or the Commonwealth, let that suspicion be stated plainly. If it is suggested that there is any corrupt or improper understanding between the Government, or any members of the Government, and that Committee, let the honorable member for Capricornia say so; but let us not have these vague and venomous charges about a transaction which was <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> and honorable, and which reflects great credit on every person connected with&gt; it. This Committee will handle this year wool to the value of £50,000,000 sterling, and I venture to say that no eight or nine business men in the country are able to say that they have dealt with an equivalent turnover. Instead of members expressing thanks to the members of the Committee, without whose aid it would have been impossible to carry out this gigantic transaction, we have heard venomous charges hurled against them, hints of corruption which the accusers have not the courage to press home, and statements about exorbitant profits. Whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes made great profits  or not is not to tie point; but I declare the facts to be as I have stated them, and I would point out that, under the agreement, he was entitled to only one-third of the profits, and that the whole of his share had to be reinvested in the business. In this way the Government were assured of the building up of a great industry that would transform the raw material into the finished product, and, at the "same time, assist Britain in this war most materially. It was vital to the conduct of the war that we should utilize freight to the best advantage, and to have sent wool away in its raw state would have been the worst possible way of utilizing freight. The wool has been reduced to wool tops, and in thus reducing its bulk for carriage overseas, we have done a lasting service to Britain in this war. I wish that we could make the same claim in regard to other products. </para>
                <para>I repeat what I have already said. If the honorable member for Capricornia declares the Wool Committee to becor.rupt, and if " he says that .there is some infamous or improper understanding between the Committee and F. W. Hughes and Company, or between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes and any member of the Government or any member of this House, let him formulate his charges; otherwise let him hold his tongue. The honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paley)</inline> knows that some 700 or 800 of the men engaged in this industry reside in his electorate, and I think the honorable member should rise and say something in protection of the industry. Why should this great  and growing industry be ruined merely because one member of this House desires to gratify his private venom ? </para>
                <para>I wish to make a brief reply to the statements made last week about the purchase of the Commonwealth steamers. The honorable member for Capricornia was good enough to say that there was some resemblance between myself and my late distinguished co-religionist, Disraeli. Of all the things I have done in my life, good or bad, I count the purchase of those steamers a's the most successful. It has been a most effective aid to the Commonwealth and the producers of 'the Commonwealth. My friends opposite seem to have forgotten, not only that it was done while the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> was in the Government, but that it was also approved by Cabinet at a meeting at which I was present on my return. Further, it ran the gamut, and evoked- the approval, of that distinguished  body of which I was, perhaps, not the most silent member, and at a meeting of which I was warmly congratulated, if I am -not mistaken, by my honorable and smiling friend, the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts)</inline> for the step I had taken. It was a good thing to buy those steamers, and I am sorry that instead of buying fifteen I did not buy fifty. But this can be. said by way of extenuation of my moderation, that I went as far as I could before I was found out. I gave instructions to a firm of brokers in London to buy all the steamers they could secure up to the full amount placed at my disposal. Naturally you cannot buy steamers as you can buy pins in a draper's shop; people began to ask who was doing the buying, but happily for us at that time there were two great mergers in progress, and each combine thought that it was the other which was making the purchases. In that way we were able to buy fifteen steamers before the trouble began. The vessels were bought at a price and under circumstances which are entirely satisfactory to the Commonwealth and the producers of the Commonwealth. It is suggested by the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McDonald)</inline> that there are ugly rumours about. If there are, perhaps the honorable member will give them a name. I guarantee to strangle all these ugly rumours with the noose of truth. No transaction of anything like the magnitude of this one has ever been carried out with so little cost to the Commonwealth.This great transaction, this purchase of steamers involving an expenditure of £2,068,000,was carried out, owing to the arrangement which I made with the brokers that the sellers' commission was to be handed over to us, not only without brokerage, but with a profit to us of £15,000. ' Since then, these vessels have earned over £1,000,000, and to-day they could be sold for two and a half times what we gave for them. </para>

If a certain amount of money is not earned during the year by a telephone service, the practice is for the Department to call upon certain individuals to pay the difference between the amount actually earned and the amount which it is claimed should be earned. </para>

                        <para>- When I mention the facts the Committee can judge whether I am correct or not. A public telephone was installed at the swimming baths at Elkington Park, Balmain, so that in case of accidents medical men could be quickly communicated with if their services were required. It is a regular practice to give the children attending schools in the district instruction in swimming in those baths. Honorable members will agree that it is a good 'thing for the country that young children should learn how to swim. Last week I received a communication from the Postal Department informing me that as the revenue earned by this public telephone was about £3 less than the amount which should have been received, this particular facility for the district could no longer be supplied. For the sake of saving a little over £3 the Department propose to cut off this telephone and accept the serious responsibility of, perhaps, risking the lives of some of those young children' who are learning how to swim. We all know that young boys and young girls cannot always be properly controlled, and that they will skylark. In a public bath skylarking is always dangerous; children may get beyond their depth, and at such a time every moment counts. If the people in control of the baths can get into speedy communication with a medical man and can secure proper medical attention when an accident occurs, it may be the means of saving life. To my mind, the chance of saving life is of greater importance to the Commonwealth than the saving of a paltry sum of about £3. </para>

                        <para>- That may be the case. I am prepared to support the honorable member in getting telephone lines in the western districts of his State, but in this case it ls proposed to take away an existing line in order to save a paltry sum of about £3. As it is, the telephone does earn some revenue, although it may he short of the amount which the Department estimated it should earn; but if it is cut out, the revenue received from it will also be cut out. As a matter of actual practice, the Department will lose more money than they would by leaving the telephone where it is. </para>

                    I am directed to acknowledge receipt of your favour of 4th inst., enclosing communication addressed to you from the Postmaster-General's Department in connexion with the public telephone at Elkington Park Baths, Balmain. It was unanimously resolved by the council to ask if you would be kind enough to use your influence to have the telephone retained in its present position, notwithstanding there may possibly bo a small deficiency so far as paying for itself is concerned. The object in having the telephone placed in this position was that it may be the means of saving life in case of an accident taking place at the baths. You are, no doubt, personally aware of the large attendances of school children at these baths, numbering some thousands in the week, and that accidents have happened, which is only to he expected under the circumstances. The telephone has been of great service in procuring prompt medical aid, and also ambulance transport. My council is of opinion that if you present this feature to the Postmaster-General it may possibly assist you in obtaining the council's desires.

We are being told just now a great deal about the need for national economy, and urged that money must be saved in order to swell the war funds. To-.day, however, the Government have instituted the Federal Police Force. What for? To sit down and twiddle their thumbs, with nothing to do, at a cost of £945 2s. 2d. per month. This police force has no duties that the State police could not more adequately carry out. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, they ought to be chasing something. Instead of the Government "chasing" this £945 odd out of the Treasury every month, they could better use the money to pay interest on war bonds. This money is flung away, and not a word is said. Because somebody happened to be hit with an ancient egg, this country has to find £945 per month - rather an expensive egg for the community. </para>

                        <para>- It is so "stale" that it smells in the nostrils of the people, who will not forget it at the next election. This money is being spent to provide some ex-policemen with a soft job, and yet we find no complaint from the other side about such an expense in time of war. On the other hand, we find objection raised to the expenditure of some £3 odd a year on a public telephone which might be the means of saving the lives of some bright young Australians. The whole position is absurd. </para>

                <para class="block">Supply Bill. I understand that the amendment has for its objective the presence of the Minister for Defence in this House as a member - the placing of the Defence administration under the direct control of the House of Representatives. There are, I think, very few member's who would object to that proposition in the abstract; personally, it would be difficult for me to conceive any such objection. When the portfolio of Defence was first given to a member of another place, the Defence expenditure was so small that it really did not matter in which 'branch of the Legislature the Minister had a seat. Certainly, at that time, there were other matters that pressed more strongly on the attention of the country, though I do not thiuk they, perhaps, deserved more attention than was given to Defence. I intend to vote with the Government upon this occasion, because I promised to give them fair and generous support in their policy of carrying on the war. </para>

                        <para>- I did not begin the " row " ; I am not responsible for the amendment. I do not take the view that the present Minister for Defence is infallible, and that nobody could administer the Department so well, but I take into consideration the abnormal times through which we have been, and are, passing; and it surprises me, not that there  are  causes of complaint, but that there are not more. With the growing demands caused by the war, mistakes and miscalculations must arise. This, of course, applies equally to the British authorities, though fortunately the British Government is in a different position from that of the Commonwealth Government. At Home they have not an Opposition that has no earthly object in view but to attack the Government by means of adverse criticism; the British Opposition, while it maybe critical at times, is always conducted in the best interests of the country. Here the criticism of the Defence Department is engineered for the party purposes that might be perfectly fair and above board in the piping times of peace, but not now. One criticism' levelled against the Department is based on the absence of business control. There is no doubt about the fact; and it is only comparatively recently that the control of stores and so forth has passed into the hands of business men. This question is as old as the hills. I can recollect how, forty years ago, the press in the Old Country advocating that the whole of the administration of the War Office on its business side, in relation to stores, contracts, and so forth, as distinguished from matters of discipline and purely military interests, should he placed entirely under business control. Although this view  was  presented year in and year out, no reform waa found possible until we were  in the war; and the employment of business men, not only in regard to Defence matters, but in many other directions, is now the policy of the British Government. An excellent opportunity has been presented to utilize the patriotism of our brothers and cousins in the Old Country. Men have willingly offered their services to the country, eager to do anything they were asked to assist the Government in the conduct of the war; but not until we were actually at war was it possible to make any change, and only since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. lloyd</inline> George came into office has it been made the success it is to-day. In Australia, however, when such a policy is spoken of, we are told that we are being governed by Committees and Commissions. Whip high or whip low, we cannot please the Opposition, who are out for party strife, and ho other object. Objections that can be urged against the administration of the Department to-day do not carry the weight that they would have carried twelve months ago. We are now putting the Department under the control of business men, and I hope that for the future it will always be under such control. In all appertaining to business, business men are the best authorities. The training of soldiers and sailors, excellent as the services they have rendered in the past may have been, and glorious as their services may be in the future, does not tend to make them good business men. </para>

                <para>The question of over-stocking has also been raised, and I think too much has been made of it. I dare say that if we had the opportunity to investigate conditions in connexion with the clothing and equipping of the British, the French, or the Italian Army, it is very likely we should find complaints similar to those made in Australia; indeed, it would surprise me if that were not so. The military authorities could not know exactly the extent to which the armies would grow as time went on, and, as I say, it is not at all surprising that there should be over-stocking. The stores referred to in the report of the Royal Commission are not so extensive or so serious as similar miscalculations might be in other Departments. The consequent waste is not at all to be compared to that which occurs, say, in a big engineering or railway work, when machinery is obtained for the carrying out of that work, and is found to be obsolete. It seems to me that the Commissioners who made the inquiry had too much love for red-tape methods, and were unable to grasp the difficulties that the Department had had to meet. </para>
                <para>There is some talk about a great loss of money, and a complaint that the financial transactions of the Department are not very satisfactory. When the war broke out, and the first enlistments took place, English officers of experience begged and prayed the Minister and those under him to let them go to the Front right away. They were allowed to go, and this meant that, for the most part, only raw and inexperienced men were available for the purpose of training the recruits as they came along. </para>

                        <para>- I should think it was. If I, as Minister, had to choose between sending efficient men away to the war when there was an urgent demand for troops, and running the risk of picking up what men I could at home, I would send the efficient men. Red tape, and circumlocution, and the criticism of members may be of some importance, but the first essential is to get an army to the Front, and equip it and officer it with the best material at your disposal. A mistake was made, but the action taken could not be helped. When the troops were in the various camps, pay-sheets came along to be signed by those at the camps who should have signed them, but they did not do this. We are told that there are thousands that cannot be checked. Did anybody ever hear such rubbish ? The money that has not been checked was paid to the soldiers, and they had it. If they had not had it they would have howled, and they would have been fools if they did not. The fact that there was no howl about non-payment is the strongest proof that the men were paid, and that there has been practically no loss. I do not say that there has not been the loss of a pound or two, nor am I defending the system, but for practical men, facing new and unforeseen difficulties, what they did was the only thing to do in the circumstances. The Minister for Defence acted quite rightly, even though there might have been what a shrewd business man would call an " absence of business control." The Minister and those under him preferred to run the risk of criticism for not conducting their affairs according to strict business methods rather than hamper the sending away of our troops. As time has elapsed that drawback has disappeared. It is also obvious that if the Department was not allowed to offer permanent employment to civilians, the field from which the Minister could draw the best talents in the country to do the work of the Department would be unduly restricted. If I were running a business concern, and were not allowed to offer a man permanency of employment during good conduct, what chance would I have of getting the best service? I ask honorable members to treat the Minister for Defence in the same way as they would expect to be treated if they were in , the same position. I do not claim that there has been perfection, or that mistakes have not been made, nor do I say that the House and the country have not a perfect right in the future, in order to guard our interests, to say that material improvement shall be made. To-day the Minister has two Honorary Ministers associated with him in carrying out his duties. The Minister has had control of the Department for a long time, and understands it, and if we putin a new man who has to learn the Department while the war is going on, we shall be disregarding  President  Lincoln's advice " not to swap horses when crossing a stream." We are asked by those distinguished gentlemen who are going to support the amendment to take that risk. I tell the Committee that this is not the time to make such an alteration. In future times, if I happen to be here, I shall certainly approve of a proposal that the Defence Minister shall be in this House, but in no circumstances, under existing conditions, would I agree to an alteration at the present time. </para>

                <para>We have been told that the party opposite have taken a very great interest in the control of the Defence Department, and have exercised their right of criticism from time to time on Defence matters. In fact, they took such a lively interest in the administration of the Defence Department, although they never went to the extent of removing the Defence Minister himself, that they came to the conclusion that it was very desirable to remove me and the honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spence)</inline> from office. Their object in removing me was very simple. I would not have troubled the Committee about this matter, but it is well that statements, without an atom of truth in them, circulated by honorable members on the other side should be nailed to the counter as soon as possible. I was removed from office because I would not be a lackey of the Trades Halls and Labour Councils of Australia. The Labour party began on that day a policy, the fruits of which they are reaping today. I refused, and always will refuse, either in or out of office, to be the lackey of any party. A man's oath, as Minister of the King, and his oath to the people, demand that he should do justice to all the King's lieges. How can a man do that and, at the same time, be a lackey of the Trades Halls of Melbourne and Sydney, or of the Labour Councils and other similar bodies? What is the result to-day? We find here what is called the Labour party, but I call them the wall-eyed lepers of the world, <inline font-style="italic">alias</inline> the Labour party. They stand out conspicuous today before the world as the only party that will not join' in the government of their country. There is not a party like them . throughout the English-speaking countries, or, in fact, in any country where the influence of European civilization is felt. In France, Italy, and all the other allied countries the Opposition as an Opposition is dead, and its members are joining in the government of the country. But what do we find here? Enemies of Australia, enemies of the Empire, enemies of European civilization, and I challenge them in the name of civilization - </para>

                        <para>- I am not built that way. Honorable members on the other side do not represent the workers of the country. They represent merely the militant section, who are only one-fourth of the workers. But the other three-fourths, the men who made the Labour party in the early days, and who arc the backbone of the workers of Australia today, have no sympathy with them. The only charge I bring against the great body of the workers is that they do not fight them as I would have fought them. There is no resigning about me. It is fight. I know thousands of these men in Australia to-day, and the charge I bring against them is that, instead of allowing the militants to dominate them, they should have fought them, and hunted them out of their unions, because they do not represent the workers of Australia. So far as the abstract proposition before the Committee is concerned, I am quite in favour of it; but, in the circumstances that exist to-day, it would be one of the biggest mistakes that it is possible for this country to make to change the head of the War Department. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that in whatever remarks I have to make on the amendment, I shall show due appreciation of the gravity of the Avar situation as it now confronts us. I believe it is the duty of this Parliament, as it has been ever since the war began, to bend its energies towards, and give the people of Australia a lead in, the prosecution in every possible way to a successful conclusion of the war we are now waging on behalf of our liberties and of the civilization of the world. I believe, at the same time, that in this Parliament, as in the other Parliaments of the world, it is necessary that the House itself should have some say in connexion with war policy, instead of that policy being handed over wholly to the Administration. I believe that, as the House which levies the taxation and collects and expends the revenue, we should have some say as to how the various Departments shall be administered. I do not think there can be any proper reply to the contention that the Defence portfolio should be held in the House of Representatives. Previous to the war the Defence and Navy Departments, which were then combined in one, constituted the biggest single spending Department; but its expenditure was then only one-fifth of the total expenditure of the Commonwealth. The Defence Departmentnow expends four-fifths of the total expenditure of the Commonwealth, and that expenditure has risen during the war from £20,000,000 to something like £100,000,000. It is, therefore, quite an anachronism and an anomaly that the Defence portfolio should be a senatorial one. Had it not been for the fidelity of the Prime Minister to the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline></para>

                <para class="block">Pearce) I believe that we should long since have had a transfer of that portfolio to the proper House, the House responsible to the people of Australia for the collection and expenditure of the revenue. I wish, first of all, to enter my strong protest against the Government regarding' the amendment as a motion of no-confidence. It appears to me that the Government, in taking that attitude, might very well be charged by the House with an endeavour to crack the whip over honorable members in order that searching criticism of the administration of the various Departments might be smothered. That is one of the positions that this House should resent. When an important amendment is moved, the object of which is to secure greater efficiency in administration, it is not right for the Government to declare that it stakes its existence on the defeat of that amendment. Not long since, notwithstanding the pledge of the Prime Minister at Bendigo that he would not continue in office if his conscription proposal was lost, Ministers decided that '.their continued administration of the Departments was essential in the national interest. In May last they promised that they would not do anything to bring about conscription until its adoption had been sanctioned by the people. This promise was regarded as sacrosanct, though the Bendigo promise was not. Yet, after failing to keep the Bendigo promise, under the* ^ plea that the retention of their offices was necessary in the public interest, Ministers now declare that they will retire from the Treasury bench if an amendment moved to secure greater efficiency in the administration of the Departments is carried. Those who support the amendment have been spoken of as disloyal, and as hampering the Government in the prosecution of the war. Australia has sent 300,000 men abroad to fight, and it has some splendid women's organizations doing work at home; but of all the countries taking part in the struggle it is least affected by the war.  The Government since the war began has taken control of colossal private interests, which previously were conducted without Government interference to any serious extent. This places on the members of this branch of the Legislature greater and more profound responsibilities in regard to the criticism of administration and  expenditure  than they had before. I have mentioned that £80,000,000 of the £100,000,000 expended by the Government is handled by the Defence Department, and much money is also spent on services which are intimately connected with that Department. Since the war began, the Government of the country has been conducted almost entirely by Ministers under regulations under the War Precautions Act. We have had but little opportunity for the discussion of questions affecting public finance at large, or to criticise the financial operations of the various Departments of government. The administration of the Defence Department so greatly affects the whole financial situation that the portfolio of Defence should be held by a member of the legislative body primarily responsible for finance. We have been four years at war, the people have been urged to practise economy and to place their capital and savings in war loane; but we have had from the Government no broad and comprehensive scheme for economical and efficient administration. We must consider where we are drifting in the matter of finance, and members should have an opportunity of reviewing the financial situation. The Government should give a lead to the people of Australia in the matter of economy. We have borrowed £150,000,000 from our own people, and nearly £50,000,000 from the people of the Mother Country, for the conduct of the war; and, even should there be an immediate cessation of hostilities, our indebtedness, by the time we have got our troops back, and carried out the policy of repatriation, to which we are committed, would probably amount to £300,000,000. On this the yearly interest will amount to £15,000,000, and our expenditure on war pensions will not be less than £8,000,000 per annum, or £23,000,000 per annum for those two items alone. Since the war started, we have imposed new taxation for war purposes amounting to between £8,000,000 and £9,000,0000; but we are committed to finding in the not distant future a sum nearly two and a -half times as great as that. The problem is, how the money is to be obtained, and whether the Government is practising that economy which they should practise to give the lead to the public of Australia, to whom economy will become inevitable. There has been an increase in the expenditure of a large number of our Departments besides the Department of Defence. For instance, the expenditure of the Prime Minister's Department has increased' from £122,000 in 1912 to £162,000 in 1916. The increase in the expenditure of the Treasury, taking the same two years, has been from £182,000 to £404,000; in the expenditure of the Department of the Attorney-General, from £66,000 to £100,000; in the expenditure of the Department of Home and Territories from £185,000 to £208,000; in that of the Department of Customs from £305,000 to £689,000; in that of the Northern Territory from £382,000 to £659,000; in that of the Department of Works and Railways from £2,554,000 to £5,519,000. Including Departments not mentioned, the total expenditure in the Departments, excluding the Defence Department, increased in round figures from £21,525,000 in 1912 to £2S,656,000 in 1916. </para>
                <para>It is with very great regret that I criticise the administration of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> because I have a great respect for him, and know that his labours have been Herculean. I doubt that a War Department in any of the Allied countries could have a searching inquiry made into its- administration while the war is in progress and come out unscathed- In time of war decisions must be come to so quickly, and action must follow so rapidly, that frequently the antithesis of business methods must be adopted so that time may not be lost. But that is the more reason why Parliament, or that branch of it which is in control of the public purse, should have direct communication with the Minister at the head of the Defence Department. The Royal Commission which has extensively investigated the administration of the Defence Department has not wholly condemned it. It commends the organization of the military camps, speaks favorably of the system of purchasing horses for remount purposes, says that the various Commonwealth factories are efficiently managed and do good work, and proclaims that the hospitals are well managed, especially the Caulfield Hospital, which is referred to as one of the best organized and most efficiently managed in the British Empire. These statements redound to the credit of the Defence Department. But the business management of the Department is condemned by the Commission. </para>
                <para>The criticisms of the Commission cover operations extending over a considerable length of time, and some of them have been met by departmental reforms. The delays connected with the paying office long ago warranted, searching investigation. We are told that the excess stocks of the Department are worth something like £2,000,000, that there were discrepancies in connexion with stock, and that something like £60,000 worth has been written off. The system of purchasing boots has been condemned. A large order for boots, we know, had to be cancelled. Generally speaking, the methods of the Department connected with the purchase and allotment of material, pay, and the control of finance generally, have been condemned by the Commission. It is the financial side of the Department which should come most directly under the criticism of the spending and taxing House. To my mind, the promise of the Minister for the Navy that there would be an improvement in the administration of the Defence Department is not satisfactory.  His  defence of the Department was one of the weakest that I have heard. The condemnation of the business methods of the Department by the Royal Commission furnishes the strongest reason for having the Defence Minister in this chamber. That would make it possible to restore the financial control which this House should exercise, and enable members to do their duty in this time of crisis. The amendment moved by the honorable member for Henty was not brought forward for the purpose of embarrassing the Government, but merely with a conscientious desire to bring about an improvement in administration and greater efficiency in the Government in order to enable us to prosecute the war more vigorously and do our duty to those who are fighting at the Front. The Government, in taking this action, after they had declared the necessity for the present party remaining in office to carry on the administration, have shown that there is no desire on their part to take this House fully into their confidence in regard to the financial affairs of the -country. In the midst of this war, it is time that the </para>
                <para class="block">House took a stand to determine to what extent the finances of the country are to be controlled by Parliament or by the Government. I agree with the statement of the honorable member for Henty that in a House of this size there is a possibility that by the cracking of the whip or the distribution of offices the Government will always be able to command a sufficient majority to enable them to retain control of the Treasury bench. I know that what I am about to say will not be popular, but I am convinced that a small House like this might easily become a real danger to the administration of the country. The Government, by a distribution of favours, may secure the support of a majority in a small House in. circumstances that could not arise if the House contained a larger number of members. We read that the ' latest scheme of Home Rule for Ireland proposes that the Irish House of Commons ' shall comprise 200 members. Canada has over 300 members in its lower House, and the American House of  Representatives, the British House of Commons, and the French Chamber of Deputies have 500 or 600 members each. It is the large number of members in those Chambers which constitutes the safety of the parliamentary system. It is written in the entrance hall of this building that " In the multitude of  counsellors  there is safety," and conversely there is a danger in this House, with a small membership of the Government holding an undue influence over their supporters in a party which at best can only number about twice as many as the members of the Ministry and the occupants of the offices controlled by the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I am not. I realize that this is not the time to talk about an increase in the membership of this House, but I am pointing out the danger that does exist of the Government exercising an undue influence over their followers in a way that -would not be possible in a Chamber with a larger <inline font-style="italic">personnel.</inline> I say again that in this period of war, when it is necessary for this Parliament to set an example in efficiency and economy of administration, I decline to be influenced by a threat on the part of the Government to vote against my convictions on a question of prime public importance. No question is involved that warrants the Government in regarding this amendment as a motion of want of confidence.  By making this amendment a vital question the Government are compelling the members to vote against a proposition which they believe to be in the best interests of the country, and which they, realizing their responsibility to their constituents and their country, feel to be necessary to enable this House to exercise that control which it should have over the finances of the Commonwealth. I personally decline to accept any responsibility for whatever may be the result of the vote that I will cast on this amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- Judging by the vigorous manner in which he spoke, the Prime Minister has made a very quick recovery from his illness, and I compliment the  medical  man who attended him! The speech of the honorable gentleman was nothing but a camouflage. He is the champion  camouflager  of .political life. He had a lot to say about wool tops, and he quoted a mass of figures so quickly that it was impossible for honorable members to follow him. If, as he said, everything in connexion with the wool-tops agreement is honest and above board, why does he not agree to the request for the appointment of a Royal Commission? When we asked for the  appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the Watson charges, was not the Prime Minister going to compel <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> to prove his charges in the Courts of law? But who crawled out of the case, and who paid the costs ? The Prime Minister would not grant a Royal Commission to investigate that matter, but lie said he would prove  his innocence in a Court of law. Can any honorable member say he kept his word? Of course, he was not the present Prime Minister; he was the1 Prime Minister of the late Government. He went to Government House and resigned, and then walked back into office- by another door. In that action, he was supported by the Governor-General, who could not find in the parliamentary history of the world a precedent for the course he took. Never has there been another instance of a man being Prime Minister in four consecutive Governments representing different and divergent parties without the interregnum of another Prime Minister and Government. Will anybody dare to say that the pledge of the Government to resign after the defeat of conscription was kept? Will honorable members bring up their sons and daughters to keep their pledges in the same way? The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> at great trouble, and with an immense amount of work, has endeavoured to clear up a transaction in regard to which he believes, as everybody outside believes, that the profits are too great, and are not being adequately taxed. Who will say that those who are making fortunes today are being taxed sufficiently? The price of every commodity has risen. Let honorable members inquire of the girls working in the factories, and learn how they have to scrimp and save in order to clothe themselves. I believe that, with the advent of a new Minister to control food prices, there will be greater simplicity in the administration, and that the people will have an opportunity to stand the prices that have been fixed for necessary commodities. The late Peacock Government said on the hustings that they would deal severely with those who were exploiting the food of the community. But once they had got into office, they snapped their fingers in the faces of the people. I have been in State and Federal politics, and have been honoured with the confidence of my constituents for over a quarter of a century, and I never thought that what I believed to be bribery and corruption would ever be so rife as it is at the present moment. I used to glory in the boast that in. this country of mine politics were on a higher moral plane than in any other country in the world. But I cannot say that at the present time. </para>

That paper was to have been published in Sydney. Why was it not published ? Whose was the fault? Honorable members may know whom I am indicating; but if they are in any doubt, and they will ask me later, I will tell them of whom I am speaking. He is a member of this House. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw it; and I ask the honorable member to spare me his interjections. I warned him earlier not to interject, but he did so again, and I had to hit him. I have referred to the Watson charges. Then there was the Ready affair; and it was to the honour of the Liberal politicians from Tasmania that that disgraceful conspiracy was nipped in the bud. Three members of this Parliament were to have gone to. attend the Imperial Conference. Their boat passages had been booked, but they did not go. One of them has recently accepted the gift of the Chief Justiceship of Victoria; and I do not know of any men in the Public Service, or the Police Force, or the Railway Department of this State, all of whom were robbed of their citizenship, who think that gentleman is fit to be a Judge of the Supreme Court. He boasted time after time that he would do anything to assist in the war, but when I suggested that he should lend to the country a portion of his income, free of interest, he would not do it. Nor would he accept my challenge to enlist and go to the Front, but on every platform he urged other men to go. I daresay if a man who would not go to the Front comes before this gentleman in his judicial capacity he will get a longer sentence. I hope that will not occur, but I would not put such an action beyond the late member for Flinders. He was prepared to send to the Front the son of anybody else, but nobody connected with him should go. </para>

                <para>I have always resented the introduction of certain titles into this community. As a member of the Victorian State Parliament, though I was unsuccessful, I tried to secure the passage of a provision that no member of Parliament should be permitted to accept a title without first resigning his seat and facing his constituents. We know that seats in the House of Lords are bought and sold for money to be used at elections. For fear of breaking the rules of debate, I will not make use of words actually used in the House of Commons and the House of Lords as to the manner in which money has been extracted from wealthy men's pockets for this purpose. It is quite a different matter altogether when a title is earned by competitive examination, or because the recipient has enriched the nation by some great invention, or has saved the Homeland or ourselves in time of war. Lest honorable members may think that I am speaking from my imagination, I quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Reform Almanac,</inline> the greatest authority of the Free Traders in England. On the cover is the picture of the greatest of Liberals, William Ewart Gladstone. On page 291, of the issue for 1898, I find the following under the heading of " The House of Lords": - </para>
                <para>That ancient institutions die hard and receive a veneration they do not always merit is a well known fact; and the House of Lords is no exception to the rule, for surely its age is the only reason for it being allowed to exist with all its present powers and privileges.  What is a Lord that he and his fellow Lords should have a Legislative Chamber all to themselves? A Lord is only a more-or-less ordinary - sometimes very ordinary - individual, who is possessed of a "patent of nobility"; that is to say, either he, or an ancestor of his, has, for some reason, been granted by the Crown the exclusive right to call himself Baron This or Earl of That, as the case may be. </para>

                        <para>- It is indeed ancient. I will come to something of a little later date. In 1810, the House of Lords rejected a Bill abolishing punishment by death for stealing goods valued at 5s. In 1810, the value was only 2s. 6d. Such was the value the House of Lords placed upon human life. In 1832, they mutilated the Reform Bill in Committee. People broke all bounds and threw mud at the King in the streets. The London City Council and most of the middle classes stopped payment of taxes. There was a run on the Bank, and £1,800,000 was drawn out in three days. The country was on the brink of open revolution. They refused to open universities to Dissenters. No one but an Anglican was permitted to go to the universities of Oxford or Cambridge. Yet our Government are building up a similar institution by requesting or otherwise that one of its members be made a peer. </para>

                        <para>- The following is a list of some of the actions of the House of Lords :  -  1833.  -  By fierce opposition compelled withdrawal of Bill for Irish national education. 1833-1857.  -  Denied civil and political rights to Jews for quarter of a century. The Commons' Bill seven times rejected by Lords. 1834.  -  Refused to allow more than twenty persons to meet for worship in private house. 1834.  -  Three times rejected the Tithe Abatement Bill. Also rejected Bill for legalizing marriages in dissenting chapels. 1834.  -  Forbade non-conformist ministers to officiate in workhouses; and again threw out Bill for abolishing University tests. 1835.  -  Population of Ireland 8,000,000 - voters, 60,000.

                        <para>- For twenty-eight years I have given my electors the right to recall - me, and it has not occurred once. But these are the people who created me a member, in spite of the mighty daily press. No man has had to fight the press so continually as myself, and if I had not had the platform on which to express myself, I should have had no chance. I have, however, as I say, given my electors the right to recall me on the lodging of a petition signed by ' one over the half of the number of those who voted for me. Will the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister)</inline> do likewise, and trust the people?, If he will, I am sure he will very soon have a petition in his district, even if I had to go and get it myself. Honorable members should consider whether there should be such a difference between the payment of a member and the payment of a Minister. Would we not have more honesty in politics if all were paid the same wage? It is a question whether, if that plan were adopted, all the ear-wigging and begging for votes would not be done away with. The people, if they had the referendum, initiative, and recall, might follow the example of Switzerland, where, however, the salaries are very different from what they are here. If the people outside think that £12 a week is not enough to enable members to live decently with their families, let them he able to say so. As already shown by honorable members who have spoken, there are twenty-two members opposite who are receiving money extra to their salaries. It is a big indictment. </para>

Had the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> but gone to the help of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> when Federation was being inaugurated, we should have had the principle which I advocate embodied in our statute-book. We have it indirectly in our Constitution; but it can be obtained only by the consent of Parliament. What is this Parliament? Only the creature of three years ; and yet it is only by their permission that the people are allowed to vote on any given question. I hope, even at my age, to see the people dominate, if only because they pay us our wages. And I only wish that there was as good a minimum wage paid outside, for instance, to the mothers who are trying to make ends meet under the present adverse circumstances. </para>

I know of nothing more calculated to degrade the Parliament of this country than wild statements of corruption being made, as they, unfortunately, are being made outside, as part of the propaganda of a section of the community. When these charges are made in Parliament, and under circumstances which throw the shadow of suspicion on every honorable member here, particularly on Ministers, he who makes them should be compelled to do so in the most definite way. The honorable member was pleased, in a light and airy way, to make some very indefinite charge against myself in regard to some newspaper which he did not have the courage to name. I should be very much obliged if he would take the manly course of making that charge more definite, so that it may be met. I defy him to bring forward any charge, in relation to any business with which I have been connected, that I am unable to meet. I have every right to ask that he should make such a charge in so definite a way that it may be openly and fairly met. This continual invention of general charges that cannot be met can serve no purpose that any honorable member ought to be associated with.

                        <para>- Passing those matters which are serious enough to have the consideration of the Prime Minister when he returns to this place, I ask - What does the speech of the honorable member amount to?  His  attitude seems to be that somebody in Western Australia introduced a Bill that will have a bad effect, and, therefore, the Minister for Defence ought to be in this Chamber ; that the House of Lords has failed in its duty in some regard, and, therefore, the Minister for Defence ought to be in this Chamber; that people are suffering outside because of the war and the privations dependent on it, and, therefore, the Minister for Defence ought to be in this Chamber, and so on, with not a single word about the motion before us. What is this motion? It has for its object an expression of opinion on the part of the House that the Minister for Defence ought to be in this Chamber - that is the object as stated by the mover, and it is the only matter that we should discuss. I could have understood the honorable member who submitted this motion bringing some of those arguments before the Chamber when it was proposed to establish the important portfolio for repatriation, and add it to those already held in the Senate, for that will be in the not far distant future the biggest spending Department of the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para>The fact that these attacks are being made from within the National party, and are only against those who originally associated with the Labour party, gives them an appearance that, to my mind, is exceedingly deplorable. It is almost as remarkable as the sudden change of opinion on the other side of the House, where honorable members now see in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> all the defects of an absolutely incompetent Minister, though only a few months ago they sounded his praises as the one man who was saving the country. Personally, I am of opinion that this motion should not have been introduced at this time. No steps should be taken in Parliament, or in the country, which may have the effect of dividing those who are seeking to press on with the work of the "war. Everybody knows that this motion has no possible chance of being carried. Its only effect will be to cause dissension in ranks that ought to be united, and weaken the efforts of Ministers in their prosecution of the war. I shall vote against the motion, not only for that . reason, but . because I believe that an unprejudiced reading of the whole of the reports of the Royal Commission show that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has discharged an important and difficult task as well, to say the least, 'as it could have been discharged by any other Minister. I have read with some care the recommendations of this Commission, and with regard to the general principles laid down, they are, I believe, those that should be adopted in the government of this country. However, the Parliament has not seen fit to adopt them up to date. It seems to me that the vitiating principle of the whole of the Commonwealth administration is that this Parliament will not pay the men at the head sufficient to command the services of those of sufficient calibre. The frauds which constitute so great a feature of the reports, and involve a sum of £60,000 or over, were committed by an officer in receipt of £5 or £6 a week. He had the pay of a lieutenant, and yet was given a' responsibility which, in ordinary business, would command a salary of twice the amount. I am not pleading for the officer, but merely pointing out that this is one of the defects in Commonwealth administration. </para>

                        <para>- I wish particularly to dissociate this criticism from the officer; the principle to which I object prevails throughout the Government administration, and not merely in the Defence Department. The Commonwealth Treasury has to deal with finances involving millions of pounds per year, and the business of the Commonwealth in that regard is conducted by an officer receiving 1 about £1,000 a year, or under. When he goes out to discuss the financial affairs of the Commonwealth with the managers of the banks and other institutions he has to deal with, he is meeting men who are paid three and four times as much as he is. </para>

                        <para>- Instead of the Commonwealth Treasury having at its * command an officer of the calibre of the men he has to deal with, he has to go to the experts outside to get advice as to how the Commonwealth side of the finances ought to be conducted. When we come here and criticise the financial affairs of the Commonwealth, we are very often criticising suggestions made by the people who benefit by them, as against the men in the Department who have to do the best they can for the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has been singularly fortunate in obtaining the services of men for much less than they are worth. But in this new Department, where the Minister has been suddenly called upon to establish an organization immensely greater than that of any other Department, the Department has not been able to find at its command men who have been in the service from boyhood, and patriotic enough to stay in a service that does not remunerate them properly ; but it has pursued the same niggardly policy with regard to the payment of the men that it has called to its service. A business man who has a sudden need for a man of extra qualifications, and can give him only a short term of work, offers him a vastly increased salary, in order to tempt him to undertake the work. What has been done in the Defence Department, following the British practice, for which neither the Minister for Defence nor the Ministry as a whole can be held responsible, has been to call upon a soldier who has been sworn in to fight for his country to take on clerical work, to act as' an accountant, or as an inspector of stores, or, as happened in the Randwick Military Hospital, as an expert in everything the hospital buys, without having any experience in any of the avenues over which he is called on to preside. </para>

                        <para>- Gentlemen who have never had the control of more than two men in their lives may well talk about those who have to organize great enterprises as suddenly as the Defence Department has been organized. If they were fair to the men who are doing the work they would readily admit that the task <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> undertook was gigantic, and that he has carried it through with a degree of credit that ought to be acknowledged when deficiencies are being criticised. That is the opinion of the Royal Commission, but when honorable members read the report of that Commission they seem to ignore that part of it. The report is much more severe upon the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth than upon the Minister for Defence. It does not recommend that the business be carried on under present conditions, and blame <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> for not having done his work satisfactorily under those conditions. It not only suggests new schemes for the control of the Department, but says that in order that the work may be properly done it is necessary for the Commonwealth Parliament to alter the laws relating to the audit of its accounts and the control of its Audit Office. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is expected to do these things without these amendments of the law, and may still be asked to do them if Parliament declines to alter the position in which the Auditor-General finds himself. </para>

                        <para>-I think some of the conditions could have been altered. The honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> called attention to the state of affairs in the Pay Office at Sydney, to which I directed attention a year ago. I do not know why the Defence Department continues to make that a military arm of the service. The Minister for Defence may know more about the reasons for that than I do, but the conditions there bear out my statement that at the bottom of this thing is the absolutely inadequate payment of the men who are asked to do the work. I should say, as an outsider, not knowing all the facts, that what is called for at the Pay Office in Sydney is an immediate increase in the payment of the men. The Commission recommends that the whole of the servants of the Defence Department should be under the Department, and not under the Public Service Commissioner. Those men should be made civilian clerks, just as they were some time ago, and they should be paid the same wages, or better, than are paid outside, because they are in temporary employment, and if you want good men to take temporary employment you must offer them some inducement to leave permanent work outside. The Commission say that what is wanted in that office is loyal and willing service and not forced, unwilling service, evidences of which can be seen oh every hand by any one who goes to the Barracks at Paddington. I do not profess to know what is going on in Melbourne; but wherever you find men with grievances that are reasonable, such as men being asked to work, as these men in the pay office in Sydney are asked to work, three or four nights' overtime without payment, and having every time they come back to work at night to pay something out of their own pockets to supplement the amount allowed them for tea money, you cannot expect loyal and efficient service. </para>

                        <para>- They are; but they do not exhibit such a failure on his part as would justify us in altogether ignoring the marvellous .and wonderfully efficient services he rendered to  this country at a time when the great thing was to get the men away at' whatever cost and no matter what stood in the way. I have similar criticisms to offer in almost every Department of the Commonwealth; but I do not want changes in the Ministry. I want changes in the methods if I can get them. The Minister in charge of Defence in particular has had to look to the work that is most urgent to his hand and get that work done. When he undertook the work of organizing the despatch of the troops, he had to let everything else stand aside. We have heard complaints here openly, as well as in private conversation, of the failure of the United States of America to get her men into the firing-line. America has been doing everything in a business-like way, preparing its accountancy and its business methods and getting ready to do things, but it has not done the essential thing, which was to get the men away. </para>

                        <para>- The method adopted in Australia of concentrating the whole effort of the nation on clothing, equipping, and sending the men away when they were most wanted, to the neglect of other things of less importance, was the more statesman-like policy. In our criticisms of the Defence Department we must remember that under the conditions under which the Minister has been working he cannot do all these things in the time at his disposal, and that his duty is to do the more important work and trust to the generosity and fairness of Parliament to recognise the conditions under which he works, and to refrain from a criticism that is not helpful when it goes to the lengths that this amendment would go. In fact, it seems to me grossly unfair, and an exhibition of ingratitude to a man who has given good service to the Commonwealth under conditions of the greatest difficulty during the past three or four years. </para>

                    <para>. - The Prime Minister this afternoon said that the member for South Sydney should say a word on behalf of the industry of manufacturing wool tops in his electorate. I am not personally interested in the manufacture of wool tops, but I am interested in seeing that the industry is kept going. I do not want to see anything done that will injure it, but I am not going to champion it, because I do not know the facts of the case that the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> has brought forward. I do not profess to know anything about the financial arrangements of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes or of the Colonial Combing, Spinning and Weaving Company, but I interested, myself in having the industry established, and I am very pleased that it is established. I believe it is one step towards the complete manufacture in Australia of our wool production. I hope that, whatever inquiries are held, that industry will not suffer by any action taken in this House. I cannot see how the industry can have such a monopoly and, at the same time, pay such poor wages to the employees. I believe these are the worst-paid employees in and around Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- I mention no names. During the last industrial strike, when a dispute took place in the industry, a  notice was posted up in the factory - I do not know who the author was that no man would he re-employed unless he signed an agreement not to belong to any trade union except a union to which, the employer would give his sanction. I cannot stand behind any employer ot any industry that wants to take away the individual liberty of employees to belong to any union they like. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beeby,</inline> Minister for Labour in the State Government, had to interfere to have the case brought before the Court, and the Judge said he never heard ot saw so drastic a regulation posted up in any works. He disallowed it, and the, men went back to work. There is a bitter feeling amongst <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> employees towards <inline font-style="italic">Ihe</inline> firm on account of that notice, and that is one reason why I am not speaking on behalf of Mar. F. W. Hughes or any one else concerned- in the company, because no industry is worth having in our midst that would deprive its employees of their rights as free citizens. At the same time, I do not want to see the industry set on one side. </para>

The present Treasurer was previously in charge of the Department of Works and Railways, when the Finance Committee brought in a report with regard to the more economic working of the Navy Department. In it, they recommended that the Navy Construction Branch should be transferred to the Works Department. That has been done, but there has been no saving effected, because there has been no reduction of staff, "the branch being kept, as hitherto, quite separate . from other similar branches of the Department, and in many instances there has been an increase in pay. The members of the Finance Committee thought that one staff would be sufficient for the public works of this country, but the Navy Construction Branch is installed at the Customs House, Building in Sydney, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swan</inline> in charge of the staff. . At the present time not many public works are being constructed, and there should be some saving. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that. I believe, however, that a change in the administration of the Defence Department would be beneficial, and would stimulate recruiting. Were <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to become ill, or to die, some one else would have to be chosen to fill his place, and I do not see, therefore, that a change could not be made. The Ministry ought not to regard the amendment as a motion of censure. The Committee has a right to express its opinion on a matter like this. After the reports that have been published, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> should have asked to resign from the Cabinet. Had he done so, I believe that the country would have approved of his conduct. A large section of the community has. lost faith in the administration of the Defence Department. To all the complaints that are made, the officials of the Department furnish the stereotyped answer, "We are sorry that, after due consideration, we cannot comply with your request." But there is no investigation of complaints. I cannot get redress for a boy under the age of twenty-one, who, for being absent without leave in France, was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. </para>

                    <para>.- I would not have spoken on this amendment were it not for the fact that the action of the Central Wool Committee in connexion with the wool-top agreement has been again brought forward by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs).</inline> Whilst the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has dealt very exhaustively and completely with the actions of the Central Committee, I think it would he well to supplement his remarks from the point of view of the committee itself. On Friday, when the honorable member for Capricornia again referred to this question, I was ill in bed, and I have not been able to ascertain what he said. I did, however, hear the honorable member's remarks this morning, and, as I understand him, he implies - and apparently the idea finds some favour with members on the Opposition side - that there is something in connexion with the wool-tops agreement made between the Central Wool Committee, on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, and the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company which requires investigation by a Royal Commission. I am no judge of the etiquette which determines whether a question does or does not demand investigation by a Royal Commission, but if any one supports the view that a Royal Commission should inquire into this matter, I should like to ask, in the first place, In regard to whose actions is the inquiry proposed ? Is it suggested that the investigation shall be into the actions of the Central Committee or into the actions of the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes is the managing director? </para>

If any honorable member holds that view, let him come forward now and make some statement to that effect. In January, the honorable member for Capricornia raised this question, and I replied to him, and I was under the impression that I had completely answered every charge which he made at that time. Again the matter has been brought forward, but no direct charge has been made against the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> C. Watson, or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes. There is nothing but suspicion and innuendo. If there is any charge against the Central WoolCommittee,I shall be here to answer it at any time, but until some definite charge is made against the committee, or in regard to its connexion with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes, these innuendoes should cease. </para>

                <para>Mr.JOWETT.- I have stated the reason before. Indeed, it is obvious. At the end of November, 1916, the Imperial Government purchased every pound of wool in Australia, and from that day tb this every pound of wool has been the property of the Imperial Government. The Central Wool Committee was formed as the organization to carry out the administration of that purchase, and from that moment until now we have acted in the matter of sending wool abroad solely under the explicit directions of the Imperial Government. </para>

                        <para>- That is not a question that should be put to me. I am not here to justify or to criticise anything that the Imperial Government has done. I consider that there is no bad feeling between the Japanese and British Governments in regard to . the wool tops question. The Imperial Government came to the conclusion that it was necessary that they should control the whole of the wool supply from Australia. The wool-growers agreed to that proposition without a moment's hesitation. The Imperial Government took that action, not because they wanted to prevent any one of the Allies from getting Australian wool, but because they considered that, in the best interests of the Empire and the Allies, the wool should be rationed out to the various countries requiring it in something like due proportion to their needs. In the exercise of their wisdom or folly - I consider it wisdom - the Imperial Government has said to us, "You shall or you shall not send to Japan so many bales of the wool which we have purchased." That is a complete and satisfactory explanation of any refusal to allow wool to go to Japan. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad the honorable member has asked that question. It is quite true that the Central Wool Committee has been the means of fixing by negotiation the prices which Japan shall pay for wool tops manufactured by the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company and Whiddon Brothers. That price, of course, is very high. But what guided us in fixing that price was this: The Imperial Government having purchased our wool at a certain price, it is under agreement with the wool-growers of Australia that for any wool sold by it to the people of the various Allied countries for civilian purposes, the Government, which owns the wool, shall fix the price by negotiation. If there is any profit on such sales over the purchase price paid to the Australian wool-growers, 50 per cent. of that profit is paid back to us. Much of the wool sold by the Imperial Government to the people of the Allied countries is sold at a very much higher price than is being paid to the Australian wool-growers. We are perfectly content with that arrangement. I consider it quite fair. </para>

                <para>Perhaps honorable members will excuse me if I explain that tops are wool which is half manufactured and ready for spinning, which is the stage preliminary to weaving. To understand the high price fixed by the Central Wool Committee for Australian tops, honorable members should know that in Japan there are firms which spin, and others which spin and weave. Others, again, buy the wool in the raw condition, and themselves card and comb it. Having regard to the fact that the people in Japan who buy the wool in the raw state have to pay 60, 70, and even 80 per cent. more than the price paid to the Australian wool-grower, it would be absurd to allow a man in Japan or any other country who buys tops only, and immediately spins it into yarn, to buy those tops at prices so low that they would leave only an ordinary profit to the top-maker in Australia, who gets his wool at the fixed price of 15½d. If the Australian top-makers had been able to export the tops of Australia at low prices, some one would have had an advantage over the Australian wool-grower of 50 or 60 per cent., and the Japanese spinners who bought those tops would have had an advantage over every other spinner and manufacturer in Japan or elsewhere. Therefore, it was necessary that the price of tops sold in Japan should be fixed by the Central Wool Committee. </para>

                        <para>- That I wish to make clear. As is known to every honorable member, after that purchase had been made by the Imperial Government, no wool, either raw or partly manufactured, could be exported without the consent of the Commonwealth Government. Contracts for making tops entered into by the two firms had expired. They wished to make a new contract. Before they could do that they had to' obtain the consent of the Commonwealth Government to export those tops; and before that consent could be given, the approval of the Central Wool Committee had to be obtained. That was the way we were " approached." It may be that in the hurry of debate I used a word which, if I had thought it would have made such an impression on the mind of the honorable member for Capricornia, I would not have employed. There was nothing illegitimate or underhand in the way the matter came before the Wool Committee. It was an application to allow the export of tops to Japan, and we were the body to whom the Government looked for approval with regard to the contract. </para>

                        <para>- Much has been said about the paid-up capital of the Colonial Wool Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company. When this matter came before the Central Wool Committee, and before we would give approval to the export of tops, we had to' have a say in the contract. We felt it our duty to make the closest possible investigation of the position of this firm. We employed a gentleman whom I consider one of the very ablest accountants in Australia - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allard,</inline> of Sydney, whose reputation stands second to none. </para>

                        <para>- They cannot say anything about anybody in this matter. I hope, before resuming my seat, to remove from the mind of the honorable member for Capricornia the remotest vestige of suspicion. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allard</inline> made an exhaustive investigation into the affairs of the company. It is quite true that it has what honorable members would call a paid-up share capital of, I think, £5,008. But I need not remind honorable members, all of whom have had more or less considerable business experience, that .the paid-up share capital of a company bears no necessary relation to the actual capital belonging to the shareholders in that company. I recall my own early days when, after 'years of hard work in saving money, I was able to commence in a very small way. My paid-up capital was £59, with which I opened a banking account. That was thirty-six years ago. In those days, by the way, a man was not usually allowed to open a banking account unless he had a pretty substantial amount. Suppose I had said, " I will start, with at least £100"; and I had taken several friends in and made (up that paid-up capital to £100, forming myself into a limited ' liability company. Suppose, further, that I had earned £100 during the first year; that would have been 100 per cent. If I had earned £5,000 in five years, what would that have been? Many thousands of successful men have done that. They have started with very small capital; built it up year by year by the exercise of their business faculties, and without having spent all their profits. </para>

                <para>Now, if instead of it being a private concern it had been a public company, they would have been doing just exactly as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes has done. He formed his company with a paid-up capital of £5,000, by the exercise of business ability and brains, and in the face of competition against all the wool buyers in Australia and of the top makers of the world. He built up a great and successful manufacturing industry at Botany. He did not waste his substance.  His  profits were left to the credit of profit and loss. </para>

                        <para>- It is in connexion with this paid-up share capital of £5,000 that all this colossal atmosphere of suspicion has been created. There is nothing improper in a man having a small paid-up share capital, and in having a very large sum of undivided' profit to the credit of his shareholders. That becomes the capital of the shareholders. As a result of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Allard's  exhaustive inquiry the position was shown to be this: There was a paid-up share capital of £5,008. There were, in addition, undistributed profits of £108,000. Those are, obviously, the savings made in the ten or twelve years - or whatever the period was - when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes was enjoying the benefits of the bonus, and, at the same time, competing against the whole world. In addition, there was a sum of £100,000, by which it appears that, in order to cover contingencies, portion of the liquid assets were written down. In reality, there was in undistributed profits £208,000. That means that the shareholders' capital twelve months ago was about £213,000. That is quite irrespective of the fact that the paid-up share capital was only £5,000. There was nothing improper ot illegitimate about it. There may have been something unusual in it. </para>

                        <para>- Some may have been ; some may not have been. When a com-pany requires further capital, and it does not want to increase the number of its shares, perhaps it says, " We must have a debenture issue." This is allocated <inline font-style="italic">pro rat&amp;</inline> according to the number of shares held. No one knows better than the honorable member for Capricornia that debentures are very frequently taken up by shareholders; and, probably, it was the same here. We have now the total of about £400,000 which the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> inquired about. As a matter of fact, it was £391,700. That was the capital - share and debenture - which was sunk in this business when we came to deal with the contract. There was more than that involved. Honorable members have to consider, in addition, the total funds employed by the company in this business. There was their share and debenture capital, amounting to about £400,000. Besides that, they had other debentures due to one of the banks, and very large trade creditors. As a matter of fact, at the end of August last year, the close of the accounting period for this particular contract, they had a capital of £618,000 - the total funds engaged in that business. That is established by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allard.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I thank honorable members very deeply for their kind consideration. The net profits for six months, working three shifts and pushing the machinery to its possible limits, were £96,000, which I -do not consider an undue amount for a working capital of £618,000, on which interest had to be earned. To show how precarious such profits are, I may state that almost immediately after this period a strike took place. Whatever honorable members may think" about that strike, I hope they will not blame the members of the Central Wool Committee for it. As a consequence of the strike, the work was held up. </para>

                        <para>- I was coming to that point, and was going to put it in another way, but in order to give a plain answer now, I may say that the Commonwealth Government got at least £64,000 of that £96,000, and they may get more. I wish we had 10,000 establishments from which the Commonwealth Government could make such profits. </para>

                        <para>- That raises another point, with which I shall not deal just now. I give the honorable member credit for having the most honorable motives in bringing forward this matter. I have to say the same in regard to the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> and others who still believe that a Royal Commission should be appointed, to inquire into this transaction, but I can assure them that they are under the gravest misapprehension with regard to the real facts. The agreement concerning the distribution of the profits provided, first of all, that a licence fee of 50 per cent, of the net profits should be paid to the Commonwealth Government. For the six months that licence fee amounted to £48,000. At the time the agreement was made it was anticipated that the Commonwealth Government would enact a war-time profits tax- the Bill had riot been passed then - and in order to guard against what any one might imagine would be excessive profits, the stipulation was made that in no case should the company retain more than one-third of its total net profits. That is how the Commonwealth Government came to get £64,000. </para>

                        <para>- No. The question has been asked: Has the Commonwealth Government benefited by these profits? There is lying at the Commonwealth Bank to the credit of the Commonwealth Government the sum of £61,000, which has already been paid in cash. In addition, there is a further sum of £59,000, for which the Central Wool Committee hold storage warrants for wool and other products. Considering the enormous liabilities which these wool top manufacturers have had to incur owing to various de- lays, and the colossal purchases of wool and other materials, which it was necessary for them to make in order to carry on their huge operations - the total amount of the contract for the production of wool tops and noils was £621,000, and it was necessary to purchase many months' supply of wool ahead - it was only fair that we should meet the contractors in that regard. Therefore, we have taken from Whiddon Brothers and the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company storage warrants as security for the £51,000 that is to come from them. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Much has been said with regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> W. Hughes' operations in sheep skins and in the meat market. I do not wish to weary the Committee with details, but the people who make wool tops find a great advantage in using wool « pulled from sheep skins instead of ordinary wool, because the wool from sheep skins is not cut. In order to enable him to obtain these sheep skins, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes, a man of very great brain power and business capacity, found it advantageous to commence a large business as a wholesale carcass butcher. Do honorable members know from what quarter the enmity to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes comes, and from what direction the charges against him are made? They come from the carcass butchers, who complain that he undersells them. Because of the tremendous advantage he enjoys in being able to manufacture wool tops out of wool from sheep skins, he is able to go into the market, as they allege, and give a higher price to the growers for live sheep, and to sell meat wholesale to the retail butchers of Melbourne and Sydney at a lower price than that which is charged by those carcass butchers. </para>

I am not here to justify what he has done, but there is no doubt that the man who has created such a concern and carried it on in such a fashion that he can make something by buying sheep because he is able to outbid others, and by selling meat at a lower price than others can, is doing some good for the public generally. </para>

                        <para>- The position was quite a simple one. There were only three firms who could make wool tops, and it was ascertained that one of those - a Sydney firm - did not want this contract. Therefore, there were only two firms in the whole of Australia who were making wool tops for Japan, and who could be concerned in the matter to the slightest degree. In those circumstances it would  have been most childish or futile to advertise the concession. There have been references to the former relations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 3?.</inline> W. Hughes with various people to whom he had offered shares. References have also been made to other matters of that kind. The Central Wool Committee did not sit as an inquisition to inquire into the past history or financial operations of any of the firms with whom we had to have dealings. All we had to consider was the ability of those firms to carry out the contract whch we were asked to approve of. The members of that Wool Committee were honest, capable business men, who investigated the matter thoroughly and completely, and in approving of and practically arranging these contracts for the manufacture of wool tops and their sale to Japan they did a great service, not only to the wool-growers of Australia, but also to the whole of the people of Australia. </para>

I think every honorable member is in agreement with that objective. There has been no attempt, and certainly no intention, to make this debate a personal attack on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> but the action of the Government in treating the amendment as one  of  want of confidence will compel certain honorable members sitting on the Government side to vote against a proposal which they favour - a proposal which is approved by every member of the House - because to vote against it in ordinary circumstances would be to declare that the Minister for Defence should not be in this House. </para>

                        <para>- Very often, and I always found in such cases that it was good advice to choose the lesser evil. But no matter what may be the merits or demerits of any question before the House the one thing which in the minds  of  honorable members on the other side must be avoided at all costs is that the Labour party should obtain possession of the Treasury benches. I would say that even if the amendment had been directed against the Minister for Defence in his administrative capacity, it would have been eminently justified, because the administration of the Defence Department by the present occupant of the office is not satisfactory to the House. No one for a moment disputes the intense industry and close attention to duty exhibited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> He has been Minister for Defence continuously now for eight years. I believe to-day, as I have believed from my first acquaintance with him, that he is a highly conscientious man, who earnestly and zealously tries to do what he believes to be right in the interests of the country. But in saying that I may be allowed to express the opinion that it is possible for a man to attempt to do too much. If I were criticising <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in connexion with the work in the Defence Department I should do so regretfully, because I think that his administrative deficiencies are owing to the fact that he tries to do too much, and has not the capacity to distribute the work of his office. He carries a much heavier load than he should, with the inevitable result that the work is not well done. Honorable members are aware that not long since, when the Labour party were in power, they divided the Defence Department into two Departments, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> became Minister for Defence, while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline> became Minister for the Navy. It is also well known that even then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> attempted to make the Navy Department a subDepartment of the Defence Department. </para>

                    <para>The increasing cost of defence calls for close scrutiny, though it is well to remember that this is materially enlarged by items of official expenditure not allowed for in Lord Kitchener's estimates.

By this reform it is confidently anticipated that material economy and increased efficiency will be secured </para>
                    <para class="block">That was the opinion of the present Minister for the Navy in 1914, and that was the policy he put before the country. But that policy seems to have been quite overlooked when he went out of office, and even since his return to the Government, when he has had an opportunity to put that policy into force in his own Department of the Navy, there has been no indication that it  is still  an article of faith with him. On the contrary, the reform has had to be forced upon the present Government, who have now appointed a business Board. </para>

In the course of his speech last week, and by interjection when the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> was speaking, the right hon or able gentleman suggested that the matters we are discussing now are rather overshadowed by what <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> going on in France. The honorable member for Henty very pertinently replied that what was going on in France at the present time supplied sufficient justification for the proposal he submit! rd to the Committee. The position in France is so grave that none of us can put it out of his mind, day or night. It is the one haunting fear of our lives. It supplies the very reason why we should, more determinedly than ever before, endeavour to secure the utmost efficiency in this vital branch of our operations in Australia. The present </para>

                    <para>Out race has always been characterized by self-control, even in times of the greatest national stress, and I feel that Australians can demonstrate to the other nations of the world that, even in this Empire crisis, we can soberly and dispassionately exercise to the full our capacity for self-government. - </para>
                    <para class="block">I agree with that, and I say that, without minimizing our grave concern about the events transpiring in Europe to-day, I believe we may properly devote ourselves to the consideration of how we may make the defence machine as efficient as possible. </para>
                    <para>I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has been too long at the Defence Department. I believe that he sees everything through military spectacles, and he is largely in the grip of the military machine. If, however, it were suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> should be relieved of his position as a Minister, I do not think the honorable member for Henty would have submitted such a proposition, or, if he had done so, that he would get support for it. The only suggestion is that the Minister for Defence should be in this House, and the honorable member who submitted the amendment was too modest to suggest a possible successor to the present Minister. I make bold to say that the Ministry have greatly increased in their power, and I think considerably in their administrative quality, by the inclusion of. the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> as Assistant Minister for Defence, and I do not know any better man for the position of Minister for Defence. We remember that that honorable gentleman was one of the most severe critics of the ad' ministration of the Department, particularly in regard to the pension scheme; and he could approach the Department of Defence, not from the military standpoint, but from the civilian stand-point. What we require is not that the country should be at the disposal of the military machine, but that the Defence Department should understand that it is at the service of the country - and not that the country is at its service. Unfortunately, the position of Australia to-day is that the military rule the country, in-N stead of the country using the defence machinery for its protection and security. </para>
                    <para>The Minister for the Navy had a very different opinion years ago from that which he has expressed during this debate. It is a delightful experience to hear him express the hope that honorable members will not put any limit whatever on naval expenditure, as the one direction in which we must be generous to the fullest possible extent. That is a most gratifying admission of improvement. </para>

I think that this debate in years to come will be quoted as exhibiting proofs of his conversion. In1909 the Minister for the Navy said - our duty is to offer a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> and give a greater subsidy to the Old Country. We are hearing much about " nailing our colours to the mast." Well, I nail my flag once and for all to an increased subsidy. </para>

                    <para>We should watch very carefully the movement for a development of a purely Australian Navy, to be controlled independently of the British Fleet, in Australian waters, for, apart from the question of the enormous expense involved, and the certain increase of taxation, there was a certain section of this community who encouraged this development, because they hated and decried the British connexion, and cherished the notion that at some distant date the Navy of an Australian Republic would be turned against the British Fleet in Australian waters. </para>

                <para class="block">However, I do not wish to belabour these old ghosts; indeed, I rather rejoice in the conversion of the honorable gentlemen. I give the Minister for the Navy every credit for the fact that he has arrived at a time in his history when he believes in an Australian Navy, and is prepared heartily to support and extend it. The right honorable gentleman has also improved considerably in other directions. In regard to defence generally he has shown a remarkable progress in his political education. He was the one man of all the men in the old Liberal party who denounced most emphatically the compulsory training of our boys for defence purposes. I make bold to say that, whatever faults or shortcomings there may be in the universal system adopted in Australia, it provided us, in the early stages of the war, with a supply of young men who had a sound military training which was eminently useful to them for war purposes. The fact remains that the Minister for the Navy, and honorable members opposite, were at one time particularly prominent in their opposition to t very scheme, whereas they now approve of it. </para>
                <para>There is another point on which the Minister for the Navy and his friends show a remarkable change, on which I desire to congratulate them.  They now talk about a Business Board. A few years ago - a very few years ago - when the Labour party, then in power, started woollen, harness, clothing, and other factories, honorable members now on the Government side were its strongest opponents, whereas now they are enthusiastic supporters of these schemes. Indeed, the Minister for the Navy goes so far as to say that they are the "one bright spot" in the "whole sorry business," and he most approvingly quotes the eulogistic references of the Royal Commission to their success. It is really remarkable that the man who' was  the champion of private enterprise, and denounced anything in the shape of Government enterprise, should now be the one to approve of these industrial ventures. </para>

                        <para>- I hope it is not the respectability which, unfortunately, is too common to-day, that can be put off or put on according to varying circumstances. However, we have the Minister for the Navy, speaking on behalf of the Government, and applauding those very things he previously denounced so vigorously. I am delighted to know that he has got his eyes opened - that the company of the men who have split from the true faith has had that effect on him - and one may hope for greater things in the future. </para>

                <para>The Minister for the Navy suggests that everything will be all right in the future ; that, while it is true extravagance has been rife, and waste unfortunately too common in the Department, all that is now done with. We are told that a Board is to be appointed, and a Council of Defence formed, and that expenditure will be the subject of the closest scrutiny. But what do we find 1 This same Government has issued a regulation, dated 25th October, 1917, in which they deliberately exempt from inquiry by the Committee appointed by this House, to protect the country against waste in the public administration, such important undertakings as naval magazines, oil fuel storage tanks and depots, water supply and water storage, all works and buildings in connexion with submarine bases, torpedo stores and workshops, naval barracks, naval training schools, naval stores, buildings, dry-dock pumping stations, electric-generation stations, dredging of approach channels to Naval Bases, and wireless installations. The only justification for any exemptions in regard to naval or military expenditure is the necessity for preserving secrecy; and no member of this House would object for one moment to matters requiring secret attention being exempted from inquiry by the Public Works Committee. We must lay on the Government certain responsibilities - that is unquestioned -but who can suggest for a moment that it is not necessary to inquire into such works as are exempted by the regulation? The honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> pointed out, in unmistakable and incontrovertible terms, that there is an amount of waste and worse than useless expenditure - expenditure that cannot be justified under any circumstances - along the very lines suggested by the list of exemptions I have read. Yet the Minister for the Navy tells us that it will be all right - that the same officers, same Boards, and same Department are going to have charge. We have no guarantee under any circumstances that the waste will be curtailed in the future any more than in the past. </para>

It is remarkable that there should now be a movement to bring about the change proposed. This opposition to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is merely due to the fact that he happens to have taken up a certain position, and because of a strong stand which he. made quite recently.

While abroad on that occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did not waste any time, but went to Germany, through Russia, and on to Japan, inquiring into the various defence systems so that he might return to Australia with the very best information at his disposal, to enable him to satisfactorily perform his onerous duties in. the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Other important duties allocated to me were those connected with the Contract and Supply Board, which meant dealing with such important questions as the clothing and feeding of our troops, and so on. I ask honorable members to' realize what was the -position when war broke out. Fully half the members on both sides of the House, many of whom are now the strongest critics of the Defence Department, were continually talking about the rash expenditure in connexion with defence, with the result that it was impossible to put into operation the policy outlined by a distinguished officer who visited these shores to formulate our defence scheme, for the simple reason the money was not then available. Consequently, when the war broke out we were not prepared, and no one had any idea that the Defence authorities would be called upon to undertake such huge tasks as have since fallen to that Department. </para>

                <para>From August to December in 1914 - a period of only five months - we fully equipped and organized a force of 52,561, and in order to judge how important was this undertaking, it is merely necessary to . remind' the Committee that when war was declared; the Ministry of the day promised to send to the assistance of Great Britain 20,000 men, and, speaking generally, the  people of Australia marvelled that the Government had given such a big undertaking. But as I have already shown, in, the five months from August to Decern-' ber, we sent abroad no less than 52,561, and no men from any country have ever been so thoroughly equipped. The manner in which they were clothed and otherwise provided for was regarded as unique throughout the whole world, and it was not surprising, therefore, that Australia should have received congratulations not only from persons in Great Britain, but from the United States of America as well. In order to illustrate how the duties and responsibilities have increased since the outbreak of the war, I point out that in  1915 no less than 165,902 men enlisted. But the figures fluctuated. . In July of that year no less than 21,698 enlisted in Victoria alone, while in December of the same year the number from Victoria had fallen' to 1,291. In 1916 the total enlistments reached ,124,352, and in 1917 they came down to 45,101. This remarkable fluctuation naturally complicated the work of the Defence Department, because there was no reason to believe that the enlistments in 1917 would fall so far short of those in 1916. Then when the request came from Great Britain to send more men - I think, speaking from memory, that the request .was for 32,000 in one month, and 16,000 as the monthly quota r thereafter - the Ordnance Department had to make extra provision for equipment. Had the Ordnance Department failed in this respect, the officer in charge of the Department would have been court-martialled for neglect of duty. The Department, however, rose to the occasion, and was prepared to fully equip the additional men, had the referendum been passed. I have yet to learn that there waa any complaint on the ships about the feeding of the men and the manner in which they were clothed in Gallipoli and France. I also remind honorable members that when war was declared, it was difficult to learn whether our men would be sent to Egypt or taken on to England. They were sent to Egypt, and were clothed for that climate. Then, subsequently, when some of them were sent to France, we were able to provide them with suitable clothing for that climate. </para>
                <para>It has been frequently stated in this House that nothing had been done to curb the expenditure of the Department until the position was- forced on the Government; but I point out that when the referendum campaign was initiated, arrangements had then to be made for the equipment and transport of a large number of men, and when the referendum was turned down there was a terrible slump in regard to departmental requirements. We had the clothing all made up and available, but for the moment did not know what to do with it. The Minister for Defence asked me to look into the position, and do my best to reduce the expenditure, keeping in view,  of  course, the efficiency of the Department, and the desirability of avoiding, as far as possible, injustice to any of the workers in the Department., I visited the Clothing Factory to ascertain the position for myself, and I was gratified to find that the system of stocktaking then in force had not been excelled in any part of Australia. The officials had adopted the American system of stocktaking, the stock being placed in bays, so that if there were 10,000 yards of clothing in a particular bay,, and a request come along for a portion of the clothing, that request was noted on a card, and, consequently, the man in charge was practically stocktaking daily, and knew the exact amount of stock in the Factory from day to day. The credit for this system was due. to Brigadier-General Stanley, who, according to some honorable members, did not know his duty, and in justice to him, and also to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mac.guire,</inline> another officer of the Department. I feel it my duty to acquaint the Committee of the facts. At that time I made a request to be furnished with an estimate of the annual saving to be effected by the adoption of certain proposals, including alterations in the pattern of great coats, which meant taking men off hand sewing and putting in machinery, and that the final pressing should be dispensed with. Up to that time they were employing about nineteen hands pressing suits that were going into bales to be sent to France, and the saving effected by the alteration I urged amounted to £39,269 for the year. But we had a good deal of opposition - to our effort to reduce expenditure, and one deputation, consisting  of  both employers and employees, was introduced by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony),</inline> who said - </para>
                <para>A great deal of money has been put into this undertaking by the employers, and a stoppage of the making of soldiers' clothing would  result in very serious financial losses to the employers, while to the employees it would mean that everywhere they would be thrown on an already overcrowded labour market. A good number of the young women engaged in this class of work were dependants of men who have gone to the Front, and they have been compelled to go out and earn wages to assist in maintaining the families of soldiers. It was freely rumoured that on the return of the soldiers wounded from the Front, they were being clothed in uniforms manufactured in Britain. If this were true, the deputation felt that the Government might readily assist all concerned by having this clothing manufactured in Australia and despatched Home for the purpose of clothing our boys there. </para>

Contractors had experienced great trouble in making these girls expert, and now, just as they were able to work well, the contracts were to cease.

                        had evidently considered the economic aspect of the matter; one could not give people employment simply for the purpose of giving them work, and there must be some definite reason for giving that work and spending public money which he, as a Minister and custodian of the resources and finances of the country, had to consider. With respect to the most important question, namely, the manufacture of clothing in the Old Country and the clothing of our men, the deputation probably knew that, as soon as our men arrived in Great Britain, Australia lost control of them altogether, as far as equipment, &amp;c., was concerned. But. the Commonwealth Government made every effort possible to clothe the troops with Australian-made clothing of all kinds. Every endeavour was made to do this; but if a man was wounded at the Front, and was put into hospital in France or in Great Britain, then the British authorities saw that he was properly and adequately clothed when leaving, and we here had no help for that. Each man was given a full equipment, which, after long experience, the authorities assured us should last a certain time under reasonable conditions. Some of our men, who were desirous of appearing in Australian clothes or, perhaps, in a better suit than one that- had been worn for some time, purchased clothing themselves. On the issue the Department worked to, each man should be well clothed. He (the Minister) could not understand why they were poorly clothed, because Brigadier-General Anderson was in London, and had

He could not go on piling up material and incurring expenditure unnecessarily; it would be wasting capital to be stacking up clothing in the stores, and who would pay the interest on that capital but the workers themselves? He wished to say now that there had been no rash expenditure, and he hoped that those present would endeavour to stop the rumour to that effect, which was getting about.

Summing up, I said I would not admit that there was any clothing made in Great Britain, and that, taking . into consideration the amount of material and clothing required for the maximum number of troops, I would not admit that there was an over-supply in Australia, and I informed the members of the deputation that we could not go on making the clothing as they desired.- </para>

I saw a brother of mine who returned to-day, having been three times wounded, while we are fighting here over a paltry matter on which the honorable member can make a name for himself, utterly regardless of what our troops are suffering at the Front or what may become of the Empire. I would like to see the honorable member in the place of the Minister for Defence for a while, and see what he would do there when he realized the responsibility of carrying -on such a great concern. The boots were made after a pattern submitted by the British Government, to be used by the men in Egypt. That pattern was of no use to the men in the trenches in France, with the cold weather prevailing there, and, consequently, fresh boots had to be made. The Commission reported, I understand, that . only about six months ago there were 1,000,000 pairs of boots in stock. I am informed to-day by a return given to me by one of the officers of the Defence Department, that -the estimated boots in stock on the 30th of this month will be only 340,000 pairs. Consequently the great waste has not gone on that honorable members on the other side would have us believe. The Commission also said that a safe value of stock to 'carry would be about £750,000 worth. The recruiting -authorities say we want 4,000 men a month. If we get that number they will take the surplus clothing to equip them up to June next, leaving there only about £750,000 worth of material in stock. </para>

                    <para>. The Treasurer is asking for three months' Supply, and if it had not been for the promise he has made that the Estimates will be discussed before the end of this financial year, I should be very much inclined to oppose anything of the sort. I believe the fault of the past has been that Parliament has. not had proper control of the finances, in recent years, at any rate, and, in fact, has lost altogether any influence it may previously have had in the administration. The practice has been to adjourn Parliament for months at a time. Members have become mere cyphers, not consulted in any matter, or, if consulted, merely as a matter of favour, and not as a matter of right. It is essential that Parliament should be "on tap," so that it may be called together at any time, in order that the advice of members may be taken, and that they may know what is going on. I have been edified - as no doubt other honorable members have been - by the statement which was recently made by the ex-Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> in relation to the purchase of the Commonwealth line of steamers and the confirmation of that statement to a degree by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> It is true that there was a little difference between their statements in regard to the procedure which was adopted. The honorable member for Capricornia says that £3,000,000 was placed at the disposal of the Prime Minister without the consent of the Cabinet. The Prime Minister and his colleagues say that the Cabinet subsequently approved of what was done. That seems to be a most remarkable position. The honorable member for Capricornia laid it down, almost as a virtue, that when he was informed casually by the Acting Prime Minister that the Prime Minister desired £3,000.000 to be placed at his disposal at the Commonwealth Bank in London, he, as a matter of course - having read in history somewhere or other that on one occasion Disraeli had bought some Suez Canal shares - thought the procedure a perfectly correct one, and accordingly gave orders to the Governor of the Bank to place the amount asked for at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> disposal - to do with just what he liked, without the consent either of Parliament or of the Cabinet. Is that sort of conduct going to be repeated? I have been looking at the present Treasurer and asking myself if he would be willing to adopt a similar procedure. </para>

                <para>I believe that this Parliament should be continuously in session for the purpose of dealing with important matters as they arise. In the past, the Government have dealt with everything under the War Precautions Act, and, although that Statute is a necessary one, we must recollect that it was primarily passed to enable the Ministry to deal with  urgent questions, the understanding being that matters which could be dealt with by Parliament should be so dealt with. That is what should have been done. But when a Government have unlimited powers vested in them under the War Precautions Act they are apt to use those powers so unreasonably as to make the Act become a menace to the community. Some of the regulations gazetted under that Statute have been altogether unnecessary, and should have been discussed by Parliament. Grave mistakes have been made which would have been prevented had honorable members been consulted. There are men in this House of great diversity of occupation, and of wide financial and commercial experience, and I believe that if they had been consulted the Government would have avoided many of the mistakes which they have committed, and which have provoked  irritation throughout Australia. By reason of my own knowledge of certain commercial transactions, I believe that I could have prevented the Ministry from committing three great mistakes, which have been, and will continue to be, a con,stant source of irritation. Yet I am asked to come down to this Chamber and support everything that the Government have done, and if I venture to raise my voice, either here or elsewhere, in opposition to them, I am accused of disloyalty to my party. Indeed, I have been asked to resign from the National party though I have done nothing contrary to the pledges which I gave. </para>

It has been suggested that because I have criticised certain actions of the Government, I am. an office-seeker, and that I am imbued with some ulterior motive. Anybody would imagine that there is a certain holiness attached to Ministers, and that nobody should venture to criticise them. If they wish to get the best out of their own supporters they must restrain the press from making insinuations to the detriment of those who dare to criticise their acts. Not only do 1 not seek office, or extra, emoluments, but I am prepared, if necessary, to give up v the emoluments that I now possess.

I have no desire to embarrass the Government, or to put difficulties in their way in respect of matters which I do not regard as fundamental, and consequently I did hot intend to vote for the amendment. But the Government have now said, in effect, that we have no right to move an amendment of this character. They practically affirm that we have no title to express the opinion that the portfolio of Defence should be in this Chamber, and they have chosen to regard the amendment as one of no confidence.

But the severest criticism to which they have been subjected since the initiation of this debate has emanated from their strongest supporter, the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best).</inline> What did he say?

He practically accused the Ministry of a breach of faith with the National party. He said that if the Ministry were beaten in this Chamber, they would be false to their pledges of 5th May last. </para>

                        <para>- Then the honorable member does take up that position. If  the Government, which we think has not been everything which they should have been, were displaced, they would be quite right in breaking every pledge that they have given, because they alone are entitled to say how Australia shall be governed. If that is the. position taken up by the honorable member, it is not one to which the people of Australia will subscribe. What particular thing have the Government done which could not be done by another Ministry ? Do they claim that recruiting would fall off still farther" if they were not upon the Treasury bench? Do they imagine that shipbuilding operations would proceed more slowly, or that any of the other functions of go"vernment would be retarded? </para>

                        <para>- I would like to make some criticism of the administration of the Postmaster-General, but I am afraid that in doing so I might be considered to be dragging into a debate that has risen to the eminence of a no-confidence debate matters that are too small, and also that I might be accused of fathering another motion of no-confidence. In spite of the promise of the Postmaster-General before the adjournment, that not one of the postal facilities enjoyed by the people in the outback districts should be taken from them, in my electorate alone postal facilities have been reduced in, probably, fifty cases. Were. I to say anything about that, perhaps I should be proclaimed a disloyalist, and be told that I had no right thus to stand UP for the interests of my constituents. </para>

                <para>This debate has turned chiefly on the Defence administration, and I say that it is desirable that a fresh brain should be put in charge . of the Defence Department. I think, too, that the portfolio of the Minister for Defence should be held by a member of this Chamber, so that honorable members could get direct replies to their questions instead of being eternally told by an Assistant Minister that he would " consult the Minister for Defence and give an answer later." I do not consider, however, that the suggestion that the portfolio of Defence should be held by a member of the House of Representatives was worthy' of being considered a matter of no-confidence. Still, as Ministers say that they stake their existence as a Government on the fate of the amendment, we cannot help it. I believe that the Minister for Defence has carried out his duties with a considerable amount of ability, and 1 would not like to see him out of the Ministry should it remain in office. Recently, a Commission was appointed to examine the methods of keeping accounts and the administration generally of the Defence Department, and to point out what was wrong there, That Commission, I believe, was not appointed at the volition of the Minister for Defence or of the Government; I understand that Ministers needed a considerable amount of prodding before they would appoint it, though possibly the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> and others could say more about that, because the appointment of the Commission occurred before I entered this Parliament, so that I am not speaking from personal knowledge. However, the Commissioners made their investigation and brought up a report containing certain recommendations. They pointed out where the administration was bad - it is very bad in some places - and how it could be remedied. ' .The Government now say,  ' All the faults and loose places having been pointed out, we have appointed a Business Board to block up holes and to set things straight," and they seem to think that the maladministration, or want of administration, of the past is to be forgotten. Their attitude in the matter resembles that of the manager of a station should he, after having, during a period of three years, lost large numbers of sheep, send a boundary rider to ascer-tain whether the fences were all right, and discover that in many places they were down, and should he then, after sending out others to mend the gaps, declare, " Although I have lost thousands of sheep during the past three years, I am not to be considered blameworthy, because I have wiped out my past misdeeds by mending the fences." Would any station owner give such a manager a clean sheet'-?- Would not an owner want  to know why the manager had not him- self ridden round to see how and where the sheep were getting out? </para>

                <para>The Government does not adequately reply to the criticism that has been passed on its administration when it says that it has adopted the recommendations of the Commission. I and other members think it desirable from every point of view that there should be a change in the head of the Defence Department. At the beginning of the war the Defence Department controlled the Navy, and was charged with the duty of looking after the soldiers who returned to this country. What has stood most in the way of recruiting is the fact that many of those who have come back have not been fairly treated ; and much of the blame for that must be laid at the doors of the Defence Department. Now the Minister for Repatriation is charged with the duty of looking after the returned men. The Defence Department also controls the Director of Munitions, and the importation of a hundred and one articles of commerce. I could say a good deal about that branch of the administration, but I shall refrain from doing so now. Further, it controlled, and still controls, the censorship. A certain amount of censorship is necessary, but I shall cite two instances to show that the censorship has been used, not only to keep news from reaching the enemy, but also for political purposes. Last week we had a debate on the action of the military in seizing in this building certain papers belonging to the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts).</inline> I am not concerned now whether the privilege of members was infringed by that action o£ the military. </para>

                        <para>- The point to which I wish to direct attention in connexion with the matter is this: that the newspapers were not allowed to mention the occurrence at all. That was a wrong use of the censorship by the Minister. Then, last week, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in another place, had declared the policy of the Government, and. it was expected that the Prime Minister would make a similar statement in this Chamber, the newspapers were not allowed to publish <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> speech. What right had the Government to censor the publication of that speech ? By what right do they censor a speech delivered in the Senate? It is a gross misuse of the War Precautions Act, and I cannot, and will not, continue to support an Administration that persists in allowing such actions to be taken. </para>

                <para>There is one other matter to which I desire to refer. It has been said that, at a time of grave crisis such as this, we should not criticise the Government. It is because of this Empire crisis, however, that we desire to do better, and must endeavour to do more than we have to secure more effective administration. There is in this evening's issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> a paragraph stating that the members of the National party were invited this afternoon to attend in the Prime Minister's room, where certain cablegrams dealing with the seriousness of the position were read to us. The paragraph suggests that the Prime Minister called us into his office in order that he might " give a talking " to the naughty boys. I went into that room at the Prime Minister's invitation, and was told that anything said there was to be regarded as confidential. Some one, however, has broken that confidence. I do not know who it is, but when such confidences are betrayed, I feel that I am getting into very strange company, and I am going to be very careful in future as to where I place my confidences. I am not accusing the Prime Minister of disclosing anything said in confidence. I merely say that some one has disclosed information  that he agreed to regard as confidential. At a time of great crisis like the present, when the Empire is fighting with its back to the wall, we ought to have effective administration. Our object should be to bind all sections of the  community  in one complete unity to help to carry on the government of the  country  and to place all its resources at the disposal of the Empire. I strongly resent the insinuation that in criticising the Government at the present time we are in any way disloyal to the Empire or to the policy upon which we were elected on 5th May last. The Government are alone responsible for the situation that has been created. The situation is entirely of their own making. I had no intention of voting against them until they deliberately threw down the gage of battle saying to their supporters, " If you criticise us, or if this Committee declares that the Defence portfolio should be held by a member of this House, then . we are not going to remain in office." I resent such an attitude on the part of the Government, and it is because of it that I intend to vote for the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- The responsibility for the remarks I am about to offer must rest upon the Government. I had no intention of taking part in this debate again after I concluded my speech last week, and should not have done so but for the challenge thrown out by some anonymous member of the Government, to those of us who have the temerity to support the amendment, to state our position in relation to the Ministry. I had thought that I had made my attitude towards the Government perfectly plain; but since they have asked for it, I intend to give them reasons why I -am not prepared to withdraw from the position I took up last week, even if the Government do treat the amendment as a no-confidence motion. The remarks I propose to make are intended to be helpful, and I ask the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> to take notice of that fact. I intend that they shall be helpful to the cause I have at heart; to the cause that requires plain speaking at the' present time - to the honour of Australia and the safety of the Empire - and I care not a tinker's curse whether my speaking in that cause is destructive of the Government at the present time or not. I assert, without hesitation, that the Government have no right .to occupy their present position. They have betrayed the ideals set before the country by the National Federation. They have been false to the promises and the pledges they made to the people who voted for them on 5th May last. The policy they are carrying out is not what Australia and the Empire demand at the present time, and if it is allowed to continue much longer it will bring upon this Parliament and the Government everlasting infamy. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>One argument by which the Government and their supporters endeavour to humbug the country at the present juncture is that solid support is required for the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> because he is going Home to the Imperial Conference. In the first place, I am utterly at a loss to . understand why these conferences, to determine postwar problems, are being held during the course of the war. They are, to my mind, an indication of the most unfortunate and foolish optimism which the Imperial authorities have displayed from the first in relation to the war. They are not only futile, but absolutely mischievous. The resolutions of the Paris Conference, for which, I understand, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth was principally responsible, were about as mischievous to the cause of the Allies as anything that has happened during the war. Those resolutions caused the commercial and industrial classes of Germany to throw themselves into the war with an enthusiasm and a determination to win which has been of the utmost advantage to the military cause in that country. I hope, therefore, that if the proposed Imperial Conference is held, it will be composed of sober-minded and far-seeing statesmen. It is because of that necessity that I object most strongly to Australia being represented at it by the Prime Minister. I believe that there is in Australia an increasing number of people who are adopting the opinion I expressed some time ago, that the Prime Minister's judgment cannot be trusted in matters of statesmanship with reference to the interests and the welfare of Australia and the Empire as a whole. On these grounds, therefore, I would much prefer to see us represented by someone other than the Prime Minister. There are other reasons why he should not go to this Conference. The principal one,, to my mind, is that if he does he will not represent Australia. He will not be able to speak for that portion of the community represented by honorable members on the opposite side. Can he represent the electors who voted for the win-the-war policy on the 5th May last, and who now see themselves betrayed and put to shame by the indifference of the Prime Minister and the Government towards the carrying out of that policy. The only people of Australia whom the Prime Minister will represent will be those who have battled hard to brins Australia to a standstill in connexion with the war. The Prime Minister, perhaps unconsciously, has danced to the piping of those people, and, by his blundering and ineptitude, has reduced Australia practically to a standstill in relation to the one thing needful to-day - the reinforcing of our war-worn men at the Front. Therefore, paradoxical though it may sound, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> if he goes . to London, will represent only our Bolsheviks, our Pacifists, and our Sinn Feiners. And, speaking of Sinn Feiners, I am reminded that the Prime Minister has acquired much glory for his alleged championship of the cause of Protestant loyalty against the gentleman who is regarded as the leader of the Sinn Fein movement in Australia, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mannix.</inline> I say, God help the cause of Protestant loyalty if it has to depend on 'the fighting qualities of the Prime Minister. He makes a great show of fighting, I admit. He throws off his coat, he turns up his sleeves, he spits on his hands, and he makes his blows wildly in the air, prancing around his opponent, but he takes very good care never to come near enough to cause <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mannix</inline> the slightest inconvenience. And this is the kind of thing by which the Prime Minister is trying to win popularity in certain quarters. This is the kind of thing that he and his Government are dependent on for the maintenance of their position in office. The country is sick and tired of these mere pretences. The Government have earned the contempt, not only of their opponents, but even of those who once believed in them, and when the election comes, be it sooner or later, there is no doubt but that the Government, and those who are conniving at their indifference to the issues of the war, will be thrown on the political dustheap. </para>
                <para>This is a Government only by courtesy. It is a mere rabble of utterly incongruous elements thrown promiscuously together for almost' every reason except efficiency, and animated only by one object in common - the maintenance of a dishonorable existence-. To call some of the Ministers commonplace is to pay them a compliment. It is now well enough known in Parliament, if not outside, that there are certain members of this' Ministry who would not be on this side at all at the present time but for the attractions of a portfolio, and who otherwise would be speaking their honest opinions and taking their honest places among members of the Opposition in both Houses of this Parliament. It is one of the ironies of political life that such individuals should get promotion, while men who followed the Prime Minister out of the party for motives of the purest patriotism and disinterestedness - men who have risked everything in the matter of their .political existence - remain still in the rank and file. </para>

We. have a man who stands head' and shoulders' above all others .in Australia as a statesman, as a man of experience and ability. We have seen that man hounded out of the Government, and I say that it is a pity that Australia to-day should be without such a. man in a National Government of any kind. </para>

                <para>While I have no criticism .of a personal nature against those members who were' added to the Government, I am bound to remark, as a matter of unpleasant duty, that, with the exception perhaps of the Minister who has already held office, they have, so far as I am aware, successfully concealed up to the present any qualifications they may possess to hold their positions. We all understand well how appointments to Ministries are made, and one does not need to look very far below the surface to find the reasons in the present instance. At a time like this there should be only one reason, and that, efficiency. The best men should have been chosen for those positions. It is a great pity at any time that such is not the case, but it is a thousand times graver when the safety of Australia is at stake that considerations other than those that are clamant should have a moment's recognition by any Prime Minister. ° The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Massy Greene)</inline> has been Whip of the. party for some considerable time, and usually the Whip's position means, sooner or later, transformation to the Ministry. I have no objection. The honorable member for Richmond has done his work very well; he may be able to carry out his duties as Minister to the entire satisfaction of Parliament. But we shall want something more in the occupant of that position than the usual qualifications of a Whip. As regards the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise),</inline> we all have a recollection of a certain motion which was brought forward in our party. It is no secret; it is public property. ' It was a motion by the honorable member by which the Government were able to crawl back into office - a Government who have now shown that, at any rate, a lack of gratitude is not among their failings. </para>
                <para>I come now to the honorable member for Nepean <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Orchard).</inline> I am quite at a loss ' to account for his being appointed as Minister in Charge of Recruiting. He is a very amiable gentleman indeed, and on one occasion in this House he did very good work ; but I have looked in vain for any reason for placing him in such a responsible charge. </para>

It is distinctly unfortunate that the Minister in Charge of Recruiting should, if he goes on a recruiting platform, at once create the impression in the minds of his audience that he ought to be in khaki himself. The honorable member has ideas in regard to stimulating recruiting. He wants to rouse a fresh war spirit throughout Australia - I am quoting his own words - by having bonfires in school grounds on Anzac Day; and he patronisingly pats Captain Carmichael on the back for his success in recruiting, a success gained by personal example and by simple earnest words, a success, which I make bold to say, will not be achieved by the honorable member who has been appointed Minister in Charge of Recruiting, by means of the "flapdoodle " appeals he is making in the pres3, which we have had from members of the Government for so long that the people take no notice of them whatever. </para>

                <para>This brings me to the very heart and soul of the issue between the Government and myself, and that is the matter of reinforcing our men at the Front. As we all know, the situation in Europe is as grave as it possibly can be; the people of this Empire are on the very edge of a precipice, and the ground is literally crumbling under their feet ; in a few days the situation may be almost desperate ; in a few days practically Australia may be the assured prey of Germany. Yet we have nearly a quarter of million men of military age here in Australia and this Government will not take one effective step by which we may obtain a paltry 5,400 of those men for recruiting .our Army each month. That state of things alone would justify the utmost antagonism of every honest member of this party against the Government continuing ia office. Nothing in the world really matters at the present time but the sending of men to the battle front. The success of the loan, for which the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> rightly takes so much credit, is very material indeed, but a thousandfold more we want men; yet apparently it is the one thing to which this Government will not apply itself. In these circumstances, so long as I am a member of this Parliament, so long will I stop at nothing in regard to a policy that will bring about the necessary change. In desperation the Governor-General has taken a hand. I need not say that in the circumstances a Conference such as he has convened was foredoomed to failure. The reinforcement of our forces i9 a matter on which the Government alone can give an effective lead. It is a duty that the Government must face or stand for ever condemned. If they fail to assume that responsibility' now, I am afraid it will be almost too late for anything to be done in the immediate future. It is the duty of Ministers either to go on or to get out, either to get men by the necessary compulsion - for nothing else will do it- or, if they are afraid to take that step to stand aside and let others, who are free and willing to do it, endeavour to carry out such a policy. The people of Australia recognise the necessity now, and I believe that they would willingly accept the necessary degree of compulsion to give us that 5,400 men per month. The Government say, " We could not get the support of Parliament, anyhow;" but have the Government ever tried to get it? Not once. They will whip up members on this side of the House when their interests are involved, but they throw the whip down when they are asked to use the same influence for the welfare of Australia and the existence of the Empire. Surely it is their duty to try. I believe that now there would be such an overwhelming amount of public support for them that they would carry the venture through successfully. At any rate, this is not a time to truckle with vital matters; it is the time to deal with them. </para>
                <para>I trust that what has been said by me to-night will be taken in the spirit in which it has been offered, namely, as a plain indication that something more must be done by this Government or any other Government than is being done to win the war. Nothing matters to-day but the necessity for reinforcing our men at the Prout, and removing the stain from the honour of Australiathat has been placed upon it by the ineptitude and cowardice of the Government. </para>

For a long time I believed that the policy of conscription was the proper one to adopt, but that matter has been submitted to the country twice, and has been twice rejected. On the 5th May of last year the Government and the National party which supports it said that they would not introduce conscription again except with the consent of the people. The people, having been asked for that consent, have refused it. </para>

                <para class="block">If Ministers were replaced by another team from the party sitting on this side of the House, could they honestly give conscription? Not if they abide by the pledges given in this House. We have promised to accept the will of the people, and that will has been expressed in  a  certain way. When I was sitting  in  Opposition with the old Liberal party, which numbered thirty-two, we urged the Labour Government of the day - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was Prime Minister, but he was away in England at the time - to bring  in  conscription. We even went so far as to say that if they were not prepared to bring in conscription straight away, they might at least take the power to do so at some opportune time. They would not accept that power, but said that they would wait until the Prime Minister came back from England. When he came back it was found that he had been converted, and was strongly in favour of conscription. Unfortunately, when he was on the way out, the Labour organizations of Australia threatened every Labour member of this Parliament with opposition at the next election if they dared to support conscription. Many of those members who were conscriptionists heart and soul by conviction swallowed their convictions to save their political skins. Several of them were unable to do so, and are now no longer members of this Parliament. </para>

Let me say that I think the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> would have done much better if, as he might have done, he had expressed the views which he uttered when moving his amendment, in a speech on the motion to consider Supply. I can quite understand that the honorable member feels that the Minister for Defence ought to be a member of this House. He has not been  a  member of this House  for many years. I think that, before the war, the portfolio should have been transferred to a member of) this House; but the war has now continued for four years, and no one is at present so much in touch with the work of the Defence Department as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> He is a much better Minister for Defence now than he was when, the war started, and it must be borne in mind that many of the matters complained of in the report of the Commission and by members of this House happened years ago ; several have been remedied, and others are now being attended to. The Minister for Defence has had a great deal of work taken off his shoulders and put upon .the shoulders of other members of the Ministry; and, in my view, if the amendment were carried, and a new Minister for Defence were appointed, we should not be likely to get as good results in our conduct of the war as we may expect under existing-conditions. Those are my reasons for declining to support the amendment. I do not know why the Government have regarded it as a motion of want of confidence. When the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> submitted it, ho apparently did not know that such a course would be adopted by the Government.

                <para>The honorable member for Dampier made several very strong statements, but they did not impress me very much. I have been to the Flinders Naval Base, and have seen, the places to which he referred. No doubt there was a great deal of waste there in the past, but that might very well have been the case under any other Minister for Defence. The waste was due, not to the Minister for Defence, but to the men who were intrusted by him to carry out the work. No Minister can lay down a policy and also carry it out by himself. Experts connected with the work of our Naval Forces have made serious mistakes, and a great deal of money has been thrown away, but we cannot blame the Minister for Defence for all that. Every matter to which the honorable member for Dampier referred occurred years ago, and has no bearing upon the present. </para>

                <para>I have heard from many people outside that there was a feeling that the Prime Minister was taking too much into his own hands, with the result that business was congested. We must remember, however, that the Prime Minister is also Attorney-General, and that we have what we have never had before, a War Precautions Act. Nearly every question that arises must, in the first place, go to the Prime Minister in his capacity as head of the Government or Attorney-General,  and when he has had time to sift and analyze them he should be able to decide which Department shall attend to them. </para>
                <para class="block"> That may not have been done to the extent to which, perhaps, it ought to have been, but it supplies one reason, and a good reason, why so much has found its way into his hands, and has had to remain there for some time. Now, however, the Prime Minister has taken steps to get rid of this difficulty, and has appointed four new Honorary Ministers, who will take over much of the business with which he has hitherto had to concern himself. As to these appointments, I have nothing to say against the <inline font-style="italic">personnel,</inline> because I believe  each  honorable member will prove to be a painstaking and industrious Minister. Personally, I am glad to see a little new blood on the Treasury bench, which has been top often, perhaps, occupied by what may be called "old-timers," who have come to this Parliament with great reputations and traditions from the State Legislatures, and have allowed too much of the past to cling to them. However, °we are getting a change now, and a change in the right {direction. I have no desire to see the Ministry too large, because it may be difficult, when the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cook)</inline> return from England, to get rid of all those who have been appointed. I only hope that these appointments will not lead to fresh and unnecessary Departments, though I do not think, there, is any need to worry on that score, because Parliament, if it has the power which it is supposed to have over the purse-strings, ought to be able to avoid any such difficulty. </para>
                <para>I hope the Government are going to push on with measures to assist production in the country. We are financially in a bad way, and our only hope is to stimulate production, especially of primary products. We have heard rumours about price-fixing for meat. When we are at war, or in any abnormal times, there is no objection to the Government taking a hand in order to hold the balance fairly, and see that one section of the community is not unduly preyed upon by another. But there is a danger of going beyond that in the direction of price-fixing. The price of farm produce is subject to the law of supply and demand. The Inter state Commission has been investigating the meat industry, and although they re- . port that there is no ring or trust or unfair means employed to keep up the price, they recommend that the price shall be the export price from Queensland. Now, Queensland can produce beef much cheaper than can any other &gt; State; and while the suggestion of the Inter-State Commission might for a little while lower the price, it would in the end result in raising it. The growers of meat are not making undue or unfair profits, owing to the fact that, with the present scarcity, they have to pay high prices for stock, and the question will arise whether, with prices fixed as proposed, it would be worth while to fatten stock. I do not care how the price might be fixed, a dearth of sup- . ply of fat stock would burst every artificial barrier, and then up- would go the price to the consumer. We are told that in Western Australia meat is cheaper than it is here, but that is due to the fact that, with the lack of shipping, that State cannot export, and she has a small population. The fact is that in Western Australia the supply is greater than the demand, and if the meat could be transported the price would be much higher there to-day. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the question; but if the price is fixed, many men in this community will go broke. Many small graziers and farmers have bought stock at high prices - much of it on bills - and if they have to sell it at a much less price than they gave for it, not only will they go broke, but financial institutions will  also  get a shock. In Tasmania the price of stock has- decreased recently, simply because of the exceeding dry weather. The surface of the ground there is as hard, or was two or three days ago, as it was during the big drought. In Tasmania, we have no. winter feed to speak of, and so far this season we have had no autumn rains to bring along the fodder before winter sets in. Consequently, stock which in ordinary seasons would be snapped up at high prices cannot be sold to-day, because while people may want them, they have no pastures to put them upon, and, as the result of these local conditions, there is a temporary slump in the Tasmanian market. </para>

                        <para>- I hope he will not suffer, because if the primary producers of Australia suffer serious financial losses, the country itself .will be in a very bad way. I know that some people have done exceedingly well in Western Australia, but, as a rule, they have been the large leaseholders, and they have made their money chiefly out of the increases in stock ; these increases have come along in the natural way, and have not involved the outlay of a large amount of capital. There are not so many large leaseholders in some of the other States, notably, in Victoria and Tasmania. It takes a lot of country at the present time to fatten a bullock, and if price-fixing is carried out in an arbitrary manner, without due consideration of all the circumstances of the case, it will do serious harm to the chief source of our public revenue in the near future, and' I shall oppose any. policy of that sort as strongly as I can. I want the Ministry to understand that while I do not mind the Governmenttaking .a hand in a matter like this while things are abnormal, the price-fixing of farmers' commodities not affected by outside conditions would be pushing the policy to absurd lengths. If there are any rings or trusts in operation, I would be with the Government to suppress them, but I cannot support any proposal to carry out this policy blindly. The effect in the shape of high prices would soon be felt by the people in our principal cities, who are howling out to-day for lower- prices. The consumer, because he has to pay a little more for his meat to-day, wants the Government to fix the price. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and the grower who supplies the meat has to pay 100 per cent, more for his stock. I have seen calves six months old sold for £5 a head. I have seen calves ten months old sold up to £8 and £9 a head. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidman,</inline> who in ordinary times has more cattle on his stations than, perhaps, all the growers in Tasmania put together, has actually paid that price for calves in Tasmania.

                        <para>- The Leader of the Opposition has no right to speak like that, because I am not a humble follower of the Government. I am supporting a pledge which I gave to the electors during my last election campaign, and all I can say is that this Government will get my support so long as they adhere to that pledge. If honorable members opposite were on the Treasury bench they would be the humble followers of some outside organization, and would have to adopt a policy, not dictated by the occupants of the Treasury bench, but by an executive sitting in some dark corner of the Trades Hall. That is the state of affairs to which Australia would be reduced if members of the Opposition were on the Ministerial bench. However, I have no intention of turning out the Government in order to bring such a calamity as that upon the country. I urge the Government to press on, and give effect to their policy, which contains many of the things that the people expect to see carried into effect. There is, for instance, the question of shipbuilding, which has hung fire for a longer period, perhaps, than we thought would have been the case; but, after all, there have been many difficulties- in the way, and now a start has been made, I hope the work will be pushed on expeditiously. This is one of the enterprises that ought to be encouraged in Australia, even if it means some sacrifice, for it will not only employ our timbers, but also our steel. We have large deposits of iron in the Commonwealth, and this basic product for many industries should be developed to its fullest extent. - </para>

I understood the Prime Minister to reply that, at the request of the Government of Italy, arrangements .had been made for the return to Italy of those persons in Australia of Italian nationality who were liable for service in the Italian Army. That arrangement, I understand, applies, whether a man is or is not the holder of naturalization papers as a British subject resident in Australia. I have here the naturalization papers of one Italian subject, together with the call issued by the Italian Consul to him and others to report for military service, and warning them that if they do not report they will be treated as deserters.- </para>

And Australian soldiers, who, by the vote of the people are free from conscription,  are being utilized for the purpose of driving others into military service. When we naturalized these men, we promised them they should have all the rights of Australian citizens but this scrap of paper is being torn up, and we are asked to go abroad and fight on account of the tearing up of another scrap of paper. </para>

I appeal to him not to think of himself altogether, but to think of other people. Will the honorable member for Barrier listen to my appeal? </para>

Members of Parliament, being human beings, are subject to the ordinary failings and weaknesses of human nature, and in the heat of debate things are often said, which, on reflection, are regretted by honorable members. For the sake of the reputation of the House, in which we are all equally interested, honorable members must obey the rules of debate, and I therefore now ask the honorable member for Barrier, who has had time for reflection, to withdraw the remark complained of, and to apologize for any offensive expression towards another honorable member that he may have used. </para>

                    <para>. - At this late hour it is not my intention to detain the Committee very long. I have listened very closely to the debate, and to my mind there is only one point for the Committee to decide, and that is whether or not it is desirable that the portfolio of Minister for Defence should be held by a member of this House. That is the only issue before us. I can see no better way of stifling the honest opinion of members than by treating an amendment such as that moved by the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> as a motion of want of confidence. The attitude assumed by the Government is that members on this side of the chamber must not criticise or debate adversely any item placed before them, either as a motion or as a portion of the Estimates. The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> has plainly told members on this side what his attitude is, and what the attitude of others should be, namely, that no matter what the Government pro- . pose, it is our duty to support it. </para>

                        <para>- In that case I have misunderstood the honorable member. However, it is an attitude which I hope this House will never adopt. One of the grave objections many of us have to the practices of the Labour party since I have known it is the fact that whatever decisions on vital issues may be come to in the party room they are binding on members of the party in this Chamber. That is a practice which the Liberal party has been fighting since the inception of Federation, and one which I intend to fight as long as I am a member of this House. </para>

                        <para>- The attitude which I have always taken is that which I am taking to-night - whenever I think a Government is doing anything to which I am conscientiously opposed I shall vote against it. With two exceptions every honorable member who has spoken agrees  that the portfolio of the Minister for Defence should be held by an honorable member of this House, and I cannot understand any man, saying that, though he believes in the principle underlying the amendment, nevertheless, he intends to vote against it. We are told that there must be no criticism of a Minister during war time. Has that applied in Great Britain, France, or America? What about the cases of Lord Fisher, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Carson, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Winston</inline> Churchill, Lord Jellicoe, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> ? There is a strong and growing feeling in the House of Commons against the present Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George. Wherever the House of Commons has deemed that a man has failed, there has been no hesitation about removing him from his office or transferring him to another. </para>

                <para>I do not intend to say one harsh word about the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> It is not necessary to do so. The more we discuss these questions as principles, the better it is for this House. I believe solemnly that at least three-fourths of the members of this House believe that it would have been better from the inception of the war, and that it would be better to-day, if the portfolio of the Minister for Defence could have been in the hands of an honorable member of this Chamber. That is the one issue before the Committee to-night, and the Government have made a mistake in treating the matter as a motion of no confidence. When the amendment was first tabled it was not so treated. There is one universal practice in regard to motions of want of confidence. Whether or not any motion which is tabled is to be treated as a motion of want of confidence is decided immediately. I understand that when the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> was about to move his amendment he notified one of. the Ministers of his intention to do so. The amendment was not then accepted as a motion of want of confidence. In the interests of Australia and of its good government I hope there will be no desire to stifle honest criticism and honest debate by a Government whipping its followers into line on a vote of want of confidence. </para>

                <para>In dealing with the Minister for Defence I have taken what I consider to be the right course. Where I have thought that most atrocious blunders were being committed I have brought them personally under the notice of the Minister, but they were still committed. Let me mention one case in point. When the honorable members for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford),</inline> Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney),</inline> and Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> and I were in Western Australia it came under our notice that thousands of shells were being manufactured out of condemned steel. The steel had been condemned before it went into the Defence Department, and the Department knew it. We did not go to the press nor to the public, nor did we come to this House ; in what we considered the proper way we waited" on the Minister on our return to Melbourne, and placed the matter before him. But they still went on manufacturing shells out of condemned steel, and I believe that in . Sydney and in Perth there are many thousands of shells which have been manufactured out of steel, and no man dare put the smallest charge of powder into them. </para>

What was the feeling from one end of Australia to the other ? No people have gone more earnestly and heartily into Red Cross work than those of the backblocks, in every town, hamlet, and village. In small hamlets, where you cannot see half-a-dozen houses from any one point of view, the women from the bush come in and give their afternoons and evenings at little fairs and other efforts to raise funds; and it must be remembered that, with them, it is not a matter of a 2d. tram to a town hall, but in many instances, a journey of miles through mud and slush. All this work is done at great sacrifice for their loved ones at the Front, and they are quite content to send in cheques for £50, £60, or £100, which are much more to be valued than the cheques for thousands that are gathered in big centres. What are the feelings of these people when they read that thousands and thousands of pounds are being squandered and embezzled in the Department? We know that all this is having a bad effect on recruiting. </para>

                <para class="block">Government a chance to transfer the portfolio to a member of this Chamber, allowing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to take some other office, where, I believe, he could do good, honest, and faithful work. That is the "head and front of the offending of honorable members who support the amendment ; they are simply desirous that, in the interests of Australia, the best shall be got out of the Department. So far as I am concerned, I do not intend to say one harsh word, or offer any severe criticism of the administration of the Department, though God knows there is plenty of room if one chose to do it. It is simply because honorable members are sick and tired to death of hearing the complaints all over Australia, that we ask the Government, in a fit and proper way, to make the transfer; and I appeal to Ministers now to take the matter into their consideration. From one end of Australia to the other, I repeat, there is intense dissatisfaction with the administration in the Defence Department. </para>

                        <para>- As to the interjection, I may say that I have never hesitated to vote against the Government when my conscience so led me, and I hope that that will always be my attitude. I ask the Government whether they, as a Cabinet, think that the men at the Front, and the people of Australia, are getting the service they ought to get for the terrific expenditure by this Department? With one or two exceptions, the strongest condemnation of this Department has come from men who intend to oppose the amendment, and who believe that ; it would be carried at any other time. My own honest belief is that if a ballot were, taken, and the fate of the Government did not depend upon it, three out of every four honorable members in this chamber would vote for a transfer of the portfolio of Defence from the Senate to the House of Representatives. </para>

                <para>Now when we are at war, I think, as I said on a previous motion, there is only one thing that counts in Australia, and that is to fill the shattered ranks of those who are fighting for Australia and the Empire in Flanders. The one great thing before us is to get recruits, and, in my opinion, the serious obstacle to recruiting is found in many of the disclosures in connexion with the administration of the Defence Department. That is my honest conviction, from what I have observed in travelling about a good portion of Australia and my own State. A serious obstacle to recruiting is found in the disclosures of muddling, embezzlement, and robbery. There has been an improvement in one State. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; and if I had my way I would not allow one eligible man to plead to any others to go to the Front. There is no greater mistake or weakness than that of allowing eligible men to tell an audience that it is their duty to go and defend the Empire. The first thing that is said to them, and we have all heard it, is, "What is the matter with your going yourself?" This is an unanswerable argument. An enormous amount of injury is done to recruiting through eligibles appearing on the platform, because it only interferes with the good work being done by others. The right man for recruiting is the returned man, especially one in the position of Captain Carmlchael, who has done his bit, and, perhaps, more than his bit. </para>

                        <para>- " Conspiracy," if you like, between men on this side and men on the other side. So far as I am personally concerned, there is only one word that can be applied to such a suggestion, and we spell it with three letters. But there was an incident that did occur. After speaking on the motion then before the House, I was sitting in my place in this corner, when the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts)</inline> came over near me and said - " The word ' fourteen ' has been mentioned, although I did not hear it. If fourteen of you fellows vote as you think, things might happen." On my word of honour I thought he was speaking to a man behind me, and I took absolutely no* notice. I had not spoken to the honorable member for Cook on the subject before that, nor have I since ; but I will tell you one thing that did happen. I hold entirely different views from those of the honorable member for Cook on the question of the Japanese. In a little room downstairs in which I was, the honorable member, who had been standing at the door, came in, and we were discussing the Japanese question, when some honorable member saw us talking, and thought we were entering into a conspiracy. The worst thing in associating with some " rotters " is that they put everybody down to their own standard. I thought it was a violation of the rights of the House for the military to come here, but I did not speak or vote on the question of privilege, because I did not wish to give the slightest idea that I was in sympathy with what the honorable member for Cook had said in connexion with the Japanese. In travelling to my home, I have seen a Japanese warship outside the Derwent Heads. What for? To take advantage of Tasmania? No, <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> convoy our boys at sea. When we were in the far north of Western Australia we saw two smokestacks of Japanese warships. What were they there for? To take advantage of Australia, and, as some of our friends say, to seize the Northern Territory? No! They were protecting Australia from German raiders which were then out. I only wish to God that some of our white Allies had played the game with Great Britain and Australia as well as the Japanese have played it during this crisis ! </para>

                        <para>- The Japanese have played the game with Australia as fairly as any country could play it with another in its time of great trouble. It was this matter that I was discussing with the honorable member for Cook on his return from Adelaide, and somebody, seeing us together, thought that we were entering into a conspiracy affecting the fate of the Government. I knew nothing of the proposed amendment until about twenty minutes to 3 on the afternoon on which it was moved. </para>

The Government have created a Board which is one of the most important bodies in Australia-, for in its hands they are placing the control of both the overseas and Inter-State shipping. Who constitute the Board? The Comptroller of Shipping, Admiral Clarkson, is chairman, and the other six members are managers of existing shipping companies. In this matter I am speaking on behalf of the people of Tasmania particularly, and I ask. honorable members to realize that the trade between that island State and the mainland is the very heart's blood of the Tasmanian community. No Board should have sole control of the allotment, freighting, and operation of all the Australian shipping, with full power under the War Precautions Act, without the public being represented on the Board. </para>

But the idea of his representing the people of Western Australia, Tasmania, and Queensland on that Shipping Board is the height of absurdity. At this time, when shipping is so limited, and when every ounce of tonnage should be conserved, the Government are not giving a square deal to the people of Australia when they create a Board to control the shipping and deal with all the sea-borne trade of Australia, without giving the public any representation. </para>

                        - Something appeared in the press this afternoon as to an interview that took place between the Prime Minister
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline>
                        myself, and a number of others. I understood that what transpired there was to be regarded as confidential. I am sorry that anything has got into the papers, but the Prime Minister gave me his personal assurance that he did not communicate anything to the press. I accept that assurance. When I moved this amendment I had not the slightest intention of tabling a motion of want of confidence in the Government, and I regret that the Government took it as such. After the attitude of the Government on Friday, when they refused to answer any questions, and took up the serious position they did, a change must have come over them when to-day they proceeded to answer questions in the usual way, as if this matter was not of the gigantic importance that was given to it on Friday. A number of speeches that have been delivered, from this side of the House in particular, have indicated that a very large number of members view matters exactly as I do, although they think it would be inadvisable to place the Government in an awkward position at the present time. I personally feel that, having taken a stand on the matter, and the amendment that I moved without any intention to embarrass the Government being my honest conviction, I must abide by that decision whatever the consequences may be. I regret that the Government did not see their way to allow the amendment to go, as others of a similar nature have been allowed to go, without being regarded as imperilling the life of the Administration. They know there is no danger of the vote going against them, and with that knowledge, as they will have the numbers to secure their

                        <inline font-style="italic">propre</inline>
                        and to retain their position as a Government, although I intend to vote for the amendment I have moved, I will ask them to consider seriously, if not the speeches of the members on this side who are prepared to vote for the amendment, at least the opinions of the other members on this side who have expressed the views that I hold but who do not intend - to press those opinions to the point of accepting the responsibility of voting for a motion of want of .'confidence. I trust that the Minister for External Affairs
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline>
                        will bear that request in mind. It is uttered in the most friendly spirit, for I feel that, if something is done to .ameliorate the condition that has occupied the Committee for three nights now more harmony will be likely to prevail than has been the case in the past.

                    <para>- I feel rather surprised at the method in which the question was going to be put just now. I do not know whether honorable members are aware that when this vote is granted it will depend entirely on the Government whether Parliament meets again until the end of the financial year. A very strong expression of opinion was voiced a little tune ago when we demanded that more control of the finances should be insisted upon by this Parliament. We are now passing Supply to the Government, which will enable them to do exactly as they like, and spend what money they like without consulting Parliament in any way right up to the end of the financial year. That is not proper parliamentary procedure. My opinion is that in the future when the Government come here for Supply', unless special reasons can be shown for it, no Supply for a longer period than one month should be granted. </para>

                        <para>- Reading the papers for the past few weeks one cannot help realizing the awful position we are in to-day. I felt, and still feel, that this Parliament . being called together should concentrate all its energies on one purpose only - the vigorous prosecution of the war. We may differ as to how best it can be done, but those differences do not matter much. Questions have arisen here to-night about various matters of policy which are very small in comparison with the one great  object  we should have in view. We must realize the meaning of the message that Major-General Haig sent out to the men at the Front, and remember that we have over 100,000 of our boys in Flanders. God knows what is happening to them, and here we might as well have been to a picture show or some comic opera, by the way things have been going on in* this Committee to-night, and even day after day before. There is something wrong here. We have not realized, and we ought to .be compelled' to. realize, the gravity of the danger. Goodness knows what the sacrifices are of our people over there, and of our Allies. When I make my protest here it is not because I want to fall out with the Nationalist party. All honorable members on this side know how strong are my opinions against the policy of the Labour party. Nobody is more emphatic than i am on that matter. But I insist - and I want honorable members here to insist - that no matter what the sacrifice is, every one of us should be prepared to make any sacrifice, no matter how great, so that we can do all that is possible for those who have gone -away to fight, not only for our welfare, but for the civilization of the world. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the Press Conference has been arranged for a good end. But the articles and comments published just after the referendum had but one end in view; yet now that certain members have taken action to secure that end, they are written of in the newspapers as conspirators. Not one of the members of the Nationalist party who supports the amendment desires a portfolio, and my object is not to hurt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> whose abilities would entitle him to a place in any Nationalist Government. But. his administration shows inherent weakness, which makes it impossible for him to administer the Defence Department properly. The other evening, when I had not time to finish my remarks, I referred to what were justly termed ancient matters. My complaint against the Minister is that he allows political influence to operate in his Department. The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> said tonight that ' whenever he made a representation to the Department he got things rectified. So do I. But it should not be that a man who can get a member to push his claim is attended to and another man neglected. </para>

Now we have a Minister for Repatriation, and I am hopeful. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has advanced the excuse that the faults found with his administration by a Royal Commission are due to the fact that incompetent men were forced on him under the wretched system of preference to unionists. That system ought not to stand far a day, no matter what promises the Government may have made. No system should be tolerated which forces a Government to accept the service of incompetents. i   believe  that had Ministers, kept their word, and allowed a new Administration to be formed after the referendum, we should have got active assistance from the members of the Labour party. </para>

                        <para>- There are members of the old Labour party in whom I have more confidence than I have in some of the members of my own section of the Nationalist party. I would take the word of the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford)</inline> as soon as that of any man in this Parliament. I have the most absolute confidence, too, in the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> and other honorable members. i have no feeling against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> but I know that he has not sufficient strength of character to properly control the officers of the Defence Department. That is shown by the complaints that are made day after day by returned men. A little while ago I mentioned that, according to an official statement sent to me from Sydney, there are 2,500 eligibles in the Defence Department. Ministers go about the country telling .people how to do their duty, and they neglect to do their own duty. Is there one Department of Government that has said, " Eligibles not accepted"?. The Railways Department of Victoria is the worst offender in the matter of accepting eligibles. I am not now advocating the dismissal of eligibles, but I say that they should not be appointed to Government positions. Our various Governments have helped the cold-footer too much. I should have liked to see a new Government formed, so that we might have obtained the assistance of both sides in another recruiting campaign. Had that failed, we might have gone to the country on the big question of conscription. The position at the Front is so had that I feel sure that members opposite would have given us their help in recruiting were there a Ministry in which they had confidence. Then, had our appeal failed, we could have gone to the . country and asked for the power which every one who reads the war news of to-day must know is needed in the interests of the country and the Empire. I am thoroughly dissatisfied with the present Administration, and defy members to point to any one thing that the Government has done towards winning the war. </para>

                    <para>.A matter upon which every honorable member can congratulate the Government is the appointment of the honorable member for Nepean <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Orchard)</inline> as Minister in charge of recruiting. I regret that some honorable members have seen fit to criticise the appointment. It matters not how much we may criticise the work of  any other Minister, the work of that Minister is not affected; but, unless we are whole-heartedly behind the Minister in charge of recruiting, his work cannot succeed. Judging by the tone of the debate, the one thing which we as members of the Federal Parliament are out to secure is recruits in sufficient numbers, arid I appeal to honorable members, and through them to the citizens of Australia, to give the honorable member for Nepean , a chance to do his work, and to do all they can to assist him in getting them. </para>

                <para>It is only right that we should pay a tribute to the yeoman service that the  Hon.  Donald Mackinnon has rendered to the country in an honorary capacity. I understand that the appointment of a Minister to take charge of recruiting is not to be considered as any reflection upon the work performed by him, but that, on the other hand, it is to be regarded more as strengthening his hand. If there was one weakness about the appointment of a Director of Recruiting, it was the fact that he did not have the necessary power to see that the things which he thought should be carried out were done. He  could say that certain things required to be done, but he was thwarted right and left. Many honorable members have given reasons why recruiting has failed. I am positive that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackinnon</inline> has been well aware of those reasons, but it has not been in his power to alter things. It will be within the power of the honorable member for Nepean to alter things. He has but to say, and the thing is done. Therefore let us get behind him, and see whether or not we can help him. I know that the honorable member's heart is in the work of recruiting. Let us put our hearts into it, and let us place whatever powers we have at his disposal. </para>
                <para>During the past three or four years, many young men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five years have left Australia in order to participate in active service abroad, but under our Defence Act they are liable to training in our Citizen Forces on their return. It .would be a just recognition of what they have done for us if the Defence Department could relieve those men who have been serving abroad for a definite period from the necessity of participating in the training undergone by members of the Citizen Forces. </para>

I pledged, myself to the electors to support the National Government loyally, and I do not intend at this juncture, when we are face to face with the greatest crisis "that I suppose the Empire has ever had to meet, to do anything that would convey to our 'lads at the Front that we were fighting one another in a general election instead of standing unitedly behind them. It is surprising to me that honorable members  opposite should at this hour come to the conclusion that it is necessary to have the Minister for Defence in this House. They were in power for three long years, and during that time no such suggestion was made; on the contrary, they voted in Caucus, without a -single exception, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> should continue as Minister for Defence. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking about a Caucus of all Australia. We went before the electors with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> as Minister for Defence, and we were returned by an overwhelming majority, showing that the people were satisfied, so far as he was concerned, with all his shortcomings. None of us is satisfied, and it is not natural that we should be, with the state of affairs in the Defence Department; and it is much to be regretted that the Opposition did not act on the advice given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> when the war broke out. ' That honorable gentleman advocated at every opportunity that the Department should be divided into two branches, one purely military, and the other purely concerned with the business side. </para>

                        <para>- Simply because an election took place, and there was a change of Government shortly after the war broke out. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> could realize the enormous expenditure that would have to be met, but honorable members opposite would not accept his views in regard to the Department.. When this National Government came into power the first thing they did was to appoint a Royal Commission, and on the report of that Commission they have appointed three business experts . to control the purely business side of Defence administration. This shows that the National Government are honest, and not afraid of investigation; and yet they are condemned because of their action in this regard. The Royal Commission was appointed for the very purpose of showing where we were wrong, and the position has been remedied to the extent I have indicated. It would be just as absurd to put a General in charge of the Commonwealth Bank as to put one in charge of the business side of our biggest spending Department. Do honorable members realize that the Defence Department spends about £80,000,000 a year, or twice the aggregate capital of all the banks in Australia? </para>

                <para>For my part, I propose to support the Government on the present occasion. I am determined to give the innovations they have introduced a trial, and to observe very closely how the business is conducted by the experts appointed. This grave juncture in the Empire affairs is not an opportune time to make the change proposed. </para>

                    <para>.At this late hour I am not going to take up much time, but I desire to say a word or two, as, I suppose, I occupy rather a peculiar position in being, perhaps, the only anti-conscriptionist on this side of the House. In my opinion the Government have shown a great deal of wisdom in putting this question to the test just now, at this critical period of our history. The British Empire trembles in its foundations, and the whole world is, as it were, in the throes of a death struggle;  and it does seem rather flimsy and. inconsequent for us to be engaged in a discussion of this kind, showing, as it undoubtedly does, a certain amount <inline font-style="italic">at</inline> disunion and disruption in the great National party, which was elected on the 5th May to do all that is humanly possible, within certain well-defined limits, to successfully carry on this great war. The Government are well advised in the action they are now taking because of the very delicate arrangements that led up to the formation of the National party, and to the conditions under which it was returned to power. The conditions of the agreements- for it really was an agreement - were distinctly stated and unquestioned at the time, and they were afterwards enunciated in the Prime Minister's policy speech. This party went to the country, not as a conscriptionist party, but as one pledged to respect the will of the people with the proviso - with which I, and most of the Nationalists of New South Wales, disagreed - that, in the event of the nation's safety demanding it, the question would again be submitted to the people. On that understanding, this party was accepted by the people, and the majority of , the party, I believe, are honestly endeavouring to maintain that compact, notwithstanding that circumstances are every day developing to test their loyalty to the greatest possible extent. </para>

                <para>To make the position clear, I should like to define the exact difference, as I apprehend it, between the Liberal conscriptionists in this party, and the Labour conscriptionists amongst us; and if I am making a mistake, it will be a surprise to me. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has stated over and over again that conscription is a people's question, and the people must decide it; and I believe he holds that faith to-day. If he does not, he had no justification for submitting the second referendum. As a Labour man, the right honorable gentleman had no option in regard to the first referendum, without being a traitor to his party, which believes in the right of the majority to rule. The Liberal conscriptionists, on the contrary - and I believe they hold this view in common with professed Liberalism all over the world - believe that it is contrary to the true principles of Democracy, as they interpret it, for the people to have any say on the subject. Here there is a clear line of cleavage, and unless the Labour, men in the National party are not as truly Labour men as ever they were, and are false to their principles, they will not adopt any policy that will outrage those principles. While I believe that those gentlemen of the Liberal party, who are now incorporated in the National party, still think it was folly, or, as a leading member put it, was " muddling our man power,'' to give the people a say, the majority are loyally standing by the compact they made. It is more than a coincidence that those who have indicted the Government under this amendment are the men who, when the tension is so great, think all party compact ought to be swept away, and that what they hold alone to be effective should be adopted - that they who have declared they made no pledge to the electors to support anything but conscription, now say that their sole reason for proposing to break the solidarity of this party, for that is what it means, is that they  are doubtful as to the justice or propriety of having the Minister for Defence in the Senate. I am not going to say anything about what happens elsewhere; but has any effort been made on big, broad principles, to indict the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> ? The fact is that those gentlemen, carried away by their ardent patriotism, are now testing this party to see how far they may go, and whether it is possible to bring about a diversion that may give an opportunity to attain that which they  hold to be necessary. Have we not evidence of the fact that since the 5th May, when we were elected by a' huge majority, a section on this side has all the time had at heart the idea that the party could be made to boldly declare in some way for conscription. </para>

                        <para>- We were told at Bendigo that the Government could not, or would not, carry on unless conscription was carried. That was a threat, and no one knows it better than the man who made it. The Prime Minister's subjects were in insurrection weeks before he declared his intention to hold the second referendum. When the Russians fell out of the fight, and the greatest disaster in the history of the war  befel  the Italians, these gentlemen, under the able leader who is no longer a member of this House, began their conscription propaganda, and it is my honest opinion that if the Prime Minister had called the National party together, they would have challenged with some hope of success his right to occupy his position, because he did not declare in the face of the world's disaster for the one thing which they thought was worthy of consideration in such a crisis - conscription. The Prime Minister used the War Precautions Act in order to bring about the second referendum. He did not dare, in my opinion, to call Parliament together, and those honorable members, like Rachel, refused to be comforted, because they could not get a promise from the man whom they considered too oily, because he was too clever for them, and because he insisted on the right of the people to govern, and they would have disrupted the National party in the referendum campaign had not the Prime Minister given his Bendigo pledge to placate them. All would have been well if conscription had been carried, but it was defeated by a greater majority than at the first referendum. But these honorable gentlemen have never ceased to pursue their policy in the face of all difficulties. At the present time, when the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cook)</inline> are about to leave Australia to represent the country at the Imperial Conference, the Government are wise to ask the House to let them know how they stand. I am prepared to fight conscription at all times, and I left the Labour party because, in a moment of panic, the movement outside refused to men inside that freedom of opinion for which the broad principles of the party platform provided, and I am prepared to leave the National party if it becomes a conscriptionist party. But the Government are right in asking in Parliament whether the National party is to fight for conscription now, against our pledges on 5th May. If it is, let us ask the country to return a conscriptionist Parliament. Those gentlemen who are so enthusiastic for conscription think that, perhaps, in the present war crisis the people will reverse their previous decision, and give them a majority. Most of the members of this party, however, know that that is not so. Therefore, the vote to-night will serve a useful purpose, for the Government will know whether they have in the? Chamber a majority who will stand behind them, or whether our delegates to the Imperial Conference 1 are to run the risk of being sunk by something more than a German torpedo. Are we men or creeping things? If it is right in this hour of national danger to have conscription, let us go to the country and get the people's mandate. I am sure the Prime Minister would agree to that if there was a chance of winning, but I believe that every time we ask the people's opinion on that question we shall get a more emphatic negative answer. Therefore, to raise the question now when an endeavour is being made to get more recruits would be a most disastrous proceeding. One honorable member found fault with the Prime Minister because he did not intern people in high places who did not see eye to eye with him in regard to the conscription question. When i heard that a huge meeting of the very cream of loyalists in this country had been held to denounce " the disloyalists " and to further recruiting, I thought .that at least a battalion of men would have resulted  from that gathering. But next evening I was astonished to read that only twenty-five men had enlisted for the previous twenty-four hours in the whole of the State of Victoria. If we get that result from the cream of loyalty in Australia, what can we expect to get from the skim milk of Australian Democracy? </para>

                <para>We must give greater earnest of our sincerity in the way of sacrifice. Let us reduce by 50 per cent, the salary of every man in this Parliament. Let us see that the people who are making huge profits by exploiting the public, and taking food out  of the stomachs of the people, are put in their place. I suggested on a previous occasion that 10 per cent, of everybody's wealth over £2,000 should be absolutely ear-marked, not necessarily liquidated at once, in order to make partners in the wealth of the country to the extent of 10 per cent, of those men who have gone overseas. The work and example that would conduce to more vigorous recruiting is being neglected. Threats and foolish taunts are being levelled at people who believe that conscription is a principle inimical to a free people, and, therefore, unacceptable to the Australian Democracy, and one would think that the anti- conscriptionists are the only " cold-footers " in the country. The " coldfooters" are represented on every side. Selfishness stalks through the land. Let us recognise that those who do not believe in conscription are as loyal as are those who do, and that it would be a sorry day for this country if only out of the conscriptionist party the blood and sacrifice in this war had come. Tens of thousands of men volunteered for the Front so that the curse of conscription should not be put on the land of their birth. People who have sent five sons to the Front are prepared to perish rather than see conscription instituted in Australia. They may be wrong. I could give good reasons for the faith that is in me, but I have always respected the belief of other people. Every man in the Labour party knows that on the 24th August, 1916, in the Caucus room, I said that I would not accept a seat, much less a nomination, from, a party that would withhold from any man the right to think and act according to his own conscience. The majority of the Labour voters believed as I did then, and they do so now. </para>
                <para>The vote to-night should at least show the discontented members of the National party just exactly where they stand, and it will disclose to the Government how many members in the party, rightly or wrongly, intend to maintain the honorable compact made with the electors on 5th May. If the majority of us are not prepared to respect that compact, let us face the electors, and, if necessary, go down fighting like honest men. But do not let us adopt a system of pin-pricking that encourages disloyalty inside the party, and will bring about unrest, and stultify and render negative every effort to raise further reinforcements. The conscription issue must be put aside finally, and those men who are for ever turning towards this Mecca of their hopes - I honour them for the steadfastness with which they hold their view - are doing the very worst thing for the object which we all have in view, although our methods may differ, namely, to bring about the best possible effort on the part of Australia to assist in winning the war. </para>

                    <para>. - For two days I have listened to this debate. Whilst it has been contended' that the object of the mover and sup porters of the amendment was only to direct the attention of the Committee and the public to the necessity for the Defence Department being more efficiently con- ' trolled, it must be admitted that a general indictment has been levelled against the Government by a number of the speakers. I believe that the amendment is quite legitimate. Every member on this side of the House, at any rate, has absolute freedom to discuss and criticise the Government if he so desires. But it is also within the province of the Government to esk the House at any time to indicate what support the Ministry may expect to receive. I can sympathize with a number of speakers who have joined with what has been termed by the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> repeating a statement made in the press, " the disgruntled party." But I do not think there is one amongst the members who have criticised the Government and the administration of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> as Minister for Defence, but would accept a position in the , Ministry to-day. </para>

I repeat that, whilst it is within the province of members to criticise the Government, Ministers are also within their rights in asking the House at any time to declare itself for or against them. Personally, I am perfectly free. No man- or Government has any right to demand my vote other than on a question which affects the fate of the Empire. If any further proof of my disinterestedness is required, I would inform honorable members that for me the glamour of politics has long vanished. I have been in politics for fourteen years, and I am beginning to understand the stigma that attaches to the word politician in some parts of the world. </para>

                <para>I listened to-night to speakers endeavouring to make themselves believe that if another Government were drawn from the members of the National party  they would receive the whole-hearted support of the majority of members opposite in a recruiting policy. Let not honorable members deceive themselves upon that point. I have heard honorable members on both sides of the chamber saying, in effect, that because the Hughes Government are in power they decline to assist the Empire. But I believe that if any other Government were in power those same honorable members would discover some other reason for declining to do their fair share of the work of recruiting. Honorable members on this side of the House forget that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> was indicted to some extent at a meeting of the National party. For a considerable number of years he has been in different Governments, and each time he has been appointed to the position of Minister for Defence. He was criticised at a meeting of the National, party, and, after he had replied, I heard no more criticism at that meeting. Then the criticism is rehashed here. I have known the Minister for Defence for a number of years, and I dp not think there is another man in this House who would do better under the trying conditions be has experienced during the last three and a half years. As a matter of fact, honorable members on the other side who are so ready to join in the condemnation of this gentleman now were the first "for a considerable number of years to defend him as the ideal Minister for Defence when attacked by members of the old Liberal party. </para>
                <para>Much has been made of the old Bendigo pledge, but no attempt has ever been made to throw the responsibility for the subsequent actions of the Government on the proper shoulders. For, whatever <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> did, the members of this party are responsible. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> placed himself in the hands of this party, and I have never heard him complain since when criticisms have been levelled against him, not only by those outside, who do not understand the position, but by members who do understand it fully. I am sure that the man who will regret this debate more than any other  is the member who to-night made a speech which seemed to be the unalloyed essence of spleen. He found not one virtue in any member of this House, or in any member of the Ministry, and II feel sure that, on calm consideration, he will be sorry indeed for his utterance. He -achieved no object, and from the beginning to the end of his speech, I am sorry to say, he led us to believe there was not one redeeming feature about any member of the Government, even the new members who have been appointed. </para>
                <para>At the 'beginning of the debate, the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> said he wanted to draw the attention of members to something more important than even the finances of the Commonwealth, and that was the question of recruiting. He referred to the disabilities under which large numbers of unions and members of unions were labouring at the present time. He and the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> pointed out that quite a number of members of unions in Newcastle and other districts were suffering through inability to secure work. I join with the honorable member for Hunter, and would willingly allow these unions to re-register, because I believe that the lesson has been taught to them that they cannot take the control of this country in their own hands. The wharf labourers are practically in the same position. I understand that employers of labour in various parts of Australia are dismissing men and women simply because they are unionists. From their own point of view this is an absolutely short-sighted policy, because the man who imagines that he can stem the tide of unionism in this country is a very foolish individual. Instead of helping the position to-day by putting the knife or " putting the boot " into these people when they have them down, they are making it worse from the stand-point of the national issue that is before us so prominently. </para>

As a matter of fact, there would be no virtue in it, so far as I am concerned, even if I had heard of it. But I have been endeavouring to find some solution of the trouble. I have been trying to ascertain what is the trouble with the Labour party in regard to recruiting. I cannot accept as a true-blue loyalist any man who, at this period, when we are right on the edge of a precipice, and all our democratic institutions may be set at naught, says, " If you put <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> out of the way, we will help." I am asking no one to help to fight for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> or to fight for this or that Government. If my occupancy of my present seat is in the way, it would be no sacrifice for me to get out. </para>

The unfortunate part of it is, and this explains the position of the party opposite to-day, that the political leaders are not actually leading the party. I do not say that offensively, because I have had experience of the party, and know that gradually the extremists, who have no sympathy for the real Labour movement, have been getting control of the multitude between themselves and the political leaders.

But if their leaders simply sit back and make no endeavour to fight that extreme movement, they cannot expect other than that the vast number of the workers will be lukewarm on the question of this war. I am satisfied that the Labour leaders can defeat those I call the Bolsheviks at the other extreme. Surely it is worth an effort. Surely this country is worth even putting up with a Government that honorable members opposite do not believe in. What would be the position tomorrow if, with a Labour Government in power, we on this' side said that, because of that fact, we were not going to do any more? The man who says " I will not do any more," because of some paltry reason, is to me a traitor to his country. The man who is fit and eligible for service is either intentionally or otherwise a traitor to his country if he refuses to give that service. </para>

                <para>I ask honorable members whether it would be worth while for them to gain the whole political power if the country were to be humiliated by a German victory? The duty rests on Ministers, as well as on every other section of the community, to endeavour to create an atmosphere in which the best results may be obtained. I ask them to give more attention to the prevention of profiteering. Recently, I directed attention to the figures of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> regarding the increase in the price of forty-six articles of groceries since the beginning of the war. This increase varied from 36 per cent. in Tasmania, and a little less in the other eastern States, to 8.3 percent, in Western Australia. I asked what explanation could be given of the difference, and it was said that an explanation could not be given, but that it must be remembered that, in the eastern States, prices had been gradually creeping up to the level of prices in the West. A more stupid explanation could not have been suggested. It is admitted that, before the war, prices were higher in the West than in the eastern States. That has been recognised by the Arbitration Court, and by the Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner. </para>

                        <para>- It is difficult to make such a comparison. The difference is not so. great as the honorable member says, though it may exist in certain lines. If there be anything in the explanation I have referred to, it shows that the business people of the West have been patriotic enough not to advance their prices materially during the war. The people of Western Australia have been patriotic beyond those of any other part of the Commonwealth. That State has raised the largest number of recruits in proportion to population, and, by overwhelming majorities, has voted to send every eligible necessary to the war. And now it would seem that the business people have been unwilling to take advantage of war conditions to increase prices. It is useless to make the excuse that commodities are cheaper here now than in any other country that has taken part in the war. I can understand big increases in prices of imported goods, but there are many locally-manufactured articles, the price of which has increased enormously. I ask honorable members who are interested in their domestic expenditure how it is possible for working men to live in Victoria on 9s. or 10s. a day when beef is ls. 4d. a lb. - I have been told by an honorable member of the Opposition that he has paid as much as ls. 6d. a lb. for it. </para>

                    <para>. - Remembering the alarming cables that hourly come to hand showing how the tide of battle is going against us, I wonder whether our minds are in proper focus when we spend days in settling a squabble between two sections of the Nationalist party. When to-night a member dealt with the subject of conscription for national service, I was struck with the reception that he received. A short time ago an overwhelming majority of the people of Australia - nine-tenths of them, according to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> - believed in conscription. No doubt the electors have turned against it, but I was surprised to hear the honorable member lectured because he continued to breathe his faith in conscription. The Mother Country has grasped the nettle, notwithstanding the trouble that threatens in one part of the United Kingdom, and is conscripting for war service in England, Ireland, and Scotland, men up to the age of 55 years. I do not think that the putting forward of conscription here is expedient now, but the moral courage of members in regard to the matter is waning. A speech on conscription would have been applauded from one end of the country to the other twelve months ago, but to-night, when a member spoke in favour of conscription, he was looked upon as being out of line with the party which went to the country on an unadulterated policy of conscription. </para>

                        <para>- I heard what the honorable member said, and have no objection to his expressing his opinions, but his position is more anomalous than that ' of the member to whom I have been referring. I regret that the last few days have not been spent by members on both sides in an earnest endeavour, in these hours before the crisis, to come together in the national interest. I should not like to be the Prime Minister, to go Home and sit at the Council table with representatives of other parts of the Empire, of the people of England, Ireland, and Scotland in the Old Land, and of Canada and New Zealand among the Dominions who are conscripted, while the people of Australia are not conscripted. That is my faith, and I stand for it in season or out of season. I admit that Australia has not .seen fit to adopt conscription for the time being, but if its adoption could save Australia or the Empire I would not care a rap for all the political parties in the world, if my vote would bring it about I would give it in that direction to-night. </para>

                <para>With regard to the amendment, I am not very much concerned. I was one of those who voted that the honorable member for Bendigo should accept a commission to continue to govern the affairs of Australia, and it is the duty of honorable members who voted as I did on that occasion to stand behind the Government in their war policy and give them generous support. I do not say that many things are not what I should desire them to be, and I should like to speak upon the use of the War Precautions Act and upon certain administrative acts. I would do so if the times were normal, but the times are not normal. We have more important matters to consider than the question of whether, in this grave hour, it is expedient or otherwise for the. Defence portfolio to be held in this Chamber. However, I join in the protest against placing too many restrictions upon honorable members. This is not a matter that should have been made vital to the life of the Government. A principle of the Liberal party, upon which we have always stood in the past, is that members of the party should have the fullest freedom to discuss matters.. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that the circumstances are different. I think that the freedom to which we have always been accustomed in the Liberal party should be continued. If we permit it to be whittled away the effect will be to transfer debates on vital matters to another place. Decisions on vital matters should not be arrived at in another place. This is the House in which legislation should be shaped. The practice of the Liberal party has been to have our chats and not to tie the hands of honorable members by resolutions or by any other method. It has also been our practice to have vital matters discussed in this Chamber as freely as possible. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> has dealt with the control of oversea and coastal shipping, and has made a very excellent suggestion, by which I hope the Government will profit, namely, that this House or primary producers should have some substantial representation upon the Shipping Board, particularly in regard to oversea' shipping. It is the producers' wool, beef, mutton, dairy produce, and base metals that are carried overseas. I know the restrictions on shipping at the present time, but there is great opportunity for allotting shipping space so as to give preference to certain commodities. Those who understand shipping matters know that very often space is available at the eleventh hour. If a boat is not filled up there is a sudden announcement that space is available, and there is a rush for that space. But those who have the advantage of a close and intimate knowledge of the matter are more likely to secure space than are the community generally. It would allay any feeling of distrust, if not of discontent, that may exist, if the producing interests were given representation on the Shipping Board, and it might lead to a more equitable allotment of space. I know that space is allotted by arrangement with the Imperial Government, but I also know that these things can be varied by those who control matters at the eleventh hour when the ship is about to sail. I hope that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jensen)</inline> will take particular notice of this point. </para>
                <para>In the temporary State control of commodities in the Pools there has been too great a tendency to exclude primary producers from representation. It has caused a great deal of concern in connexion with the Wheat Pool. There is a growing feeling that the interests of the producers are not sufficiently represented on the various Boards. The disposal of the wool clip has been admirably handled so far as the representations of the growers is concerned, and there is now an opportunity for the Government to extend the principle in other directions. It is also recognised that in  a  great primary producers' country such as Australia is, there is not a sufficiently substantial representation of the primary industries in the Commonwealth Government. The matter has recently been rectified to some extent, I am pleased to say, but it would tend to create a better feeling right throughout the country if closer attention were paid to the composition of the Pools, and if more direct representation were given to the producers on them.  </para>
                <para>I do not pretend to be in a position to judge rightly the merits or otherwise of the wool tops contract; but I maintain that it is a dangerous policy to pick out any persons in trade and give them an advantage over their competitors. </para>

                        <para>- It has been done in the case of the Pools. In the matter of chartering vessels, two firms are picked out, to the entire exclusion of their trade competitors. I have nothing in the world against those firms. I have had business relations with one of them, Elder' Smith and Company, and I can say that there is no more honorable firm in the Commonwealth; but it is the principle of the thing to which I object. If we pick out particular firms and elevate them 'over the heads of their trade competitors, it gives them an undue advantage. In the case of the wool tops contract, an arrangement was entered into which placed the principal in one of the firms concerned in a far better trading position with regard to the purchase of stock than any of his competitors occupied. The honorable member for Grampians- <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> has referred to the humanitarian instincts of this gentleman; but with a great big margin up his sleeve to beat his trade competitors he was able to go into the stock market, and overbid them for stock, by reason of the fact that he had contracts for utilizing the wool on the sheep's backs. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that hp was. The honorable member for Grampians, has pointed out that the alternative to the wool tops contract was the closing down of these establishments; but we know that the- Government had another alternative. Australia has missed the bus for years. There is nothing to prevent us from half manufacturing our wool by converting it into wool tops; but at present a great industry is going to waste. If from the contracts of this firm it was possible to make, in  twelve months, the profit announced today, we are losing an opportunity of affording considerable employment, and placing Australia in a dominating position in this regard, by so handling all our wool. I suggest to the honorable member for Grampians that, in war time, there is nothing to prevent the Government taking over the business at fixed rates of profit from the gentleman who has been alluded to in the chamber to-day. I object from another point of view to the profits on wool going elsewhere than into the Pool. What right has the Government, who are the trustees and bailees for the growers, to enter into a contract and secure for the Consolidated Revenue a profit of some £64,000 ? </para>

                        <para>- That is a stupid kind of statement to make - one I would expect from a man prepared to ratify any contract. The wool -growers are quite prepared to take their share of the burden in the shape of taxation or otherwise. The Prime Minister has made an arrangement by which half the profit, over and above ls. 3½d., on the surplus wool sold in other parts of the world shall come back to Australia; yet the profit on the wool that is sold to the manufacturer of wool tops here for sale abroad at a lower price than it can be got abroad, will not go back into the Pool, but into the Consolidated Revenue. That principle I regard as wrong. The surplus wool sold abroad over and above the requirements of the Army, Navy, and nursing staffs is sold on Imperial and Australian account,' and half the profits come back to Australia. What right have the Government to take any portion of the proceeds of the wool we sell here to manufacturers of wool tops? </para>

' We give it to the Australian manufacturer a little under its value, but the Home manufacturer has to buy it in the open market I come back to the point I wish to emphasize, namely, that it is a distinct departure on the part of the Commonwealth Government to enter into a private contract for its benefit instead of that of the growers in respect of wool lodged in the Wool Pool for sale, and in respect of which we have allowed, and quite rightly, certain contracts to be carried out for Japan.

                        <para>- It is the clearest admission that this wool valued under war conditions afforded too substantial a profit, and, no doubt, as a result of negotiations with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes, an arrangement was entered into by which half should come back to the Commonwealth. Under the War-time Profits Act, half would have come back to the Government, in any case, in the first year, and 75 per cent. in the second year as wartime profits. If this wool legitimately belongs to anybody it belongs to the Pool, and if the Government does anything in respect of it, and earns a profit, that profit belongs to the Pool. That is the principle adopted in regard to the other Pools, and the present arrangement of the Government is a departure. The Government would be well advised in reviewing the position, and providing that if a profit is made over and above the amount I refer to, it should go into the Pool, and not into the Consolidated Revenue. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a general impression that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cook)</inline> propose to leave shortly for London to attend an Imperial Conference. I wish to know if the report is correct that an invitation has been sent to the Government to send representatives to such a Conference. If so, have the Government any information to give to honorable members as to the purposes of the Conference, and the subjects to be discussed? Are Ministers to be given an opportunity to discuss any matters that may arise at the Conference with the members of this Parliament, because I think it is most important not only that Parliament should know what Ministers intend to do, but also that Ministers should know the feeling of Parliament in regard to various matters. Already objection has been taken to the claim of the Prime Minister to represent the people of Australia at such an important gathering as an Imperial Conference. We must admit that the fact of his being Prime Minister, rightly or wrongly, entitles him to be the representative of Australia, but it must be distinctly understood that he and the Ministerfor the Navy can speak at that Conference only as representing a section, and, in some respects, a very small section, of the people of Australia. Is the Conference to determine, for instance, the future of Australia, so far as we can forecast it, and our connexions with the Mother Country, or the adding of territory to or taking it from the Commonwealth? </para>

We are somewhat in the dark as to whether Ministers are actually going to London. On some days we are told that there is no prospect of their going, and on other days we are told that they are likely to go at any time.

I am in receipt of quite a number of communications in relation to the matter of price-fixing, the control of exports, and similar matters that are acting detrimentally to the interests of Australia, and are seriously interfering with businesses that have been built up. These restrictions make it almost impossible for some manufacturers to carry on, and in some instances they have been compelled to consider whether it would not be better to close up their businesses rather than endure the ills caused by the price-fixing authorities. </para>

For instance, the office of the Irish Association has been raided, and books and papers and private personal correspondence have been seized. This sort of thing is going too far ; and, so far from promoting that harmony which we all admit, is so essential to the conduct of affairs at the present time, is causing a considerable amount of irritation. I promise hour- able members full details of this matter on another occasion. </para>
                <para>Further evidence has reached me of a press censorship of a more severe kind than any recorded yet, even during the previous worst period of the censorship. Articles that have appeared in a number of daily and weekly newspapers without challenge are being refused publication in other papers, and it is an unfortunate fact that it is always the Labour papers that are singled out for this interference. I promise honorable members definite and specific details of these matters at a later date. These actions are destructive of harmony, and I am anxious to remove all such causes of irritation so long as there are reasonable grounds for their removal. </para>

Certainly the . correspondence reaching me indicates that Australian soldiers are being sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for apparently trivial offences. </para>

The Government regard the Recruiting Conference taking place at' Government House as of even greater importance than the proceedings of this House at the present time. Very important deliberations have taken place there already, and I am hopeful that great public good will result from the gathering. I am sure honorable members will wish that every possible consideration should be given to the questions being dealt with there, in the sincere hope that we may have a better spirit prevailing in the community, and greater harmony and unity in our midst. </para>
