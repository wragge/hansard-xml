                            Manifold has issued notices to his tenants on Danedite  Estate giving them till' Friday to consider  whether they will purchase their farms. If they do not want to purchase, the farms will be put up to auction. The leases, provide that tenants must pav all land taxes, but this provision is superseded by the new land; tax, which makes the owner liable. The leases of several tenants do not expire for some years, but they have been informed that the leases have been rendered negligible by the new Act.

                    <para>.- I feel that this amendment will appeal to many honorable members, because I take it that the object of this measure is to tax the land increment. There can be no increment on the money which was first paid for the land - if there is, it is, or should be, in the coffers of the State. I propose to exempt the amount which was actually paid, whether it was 2s. or£3 per acre, because it would be unfair to adopt a fixed amount. If my amendment is not agreed to a hardship will be inflicted on persons who purchased, at a price, poor land which has not increased in value to any great extent. In fact, there are any number of cases where adjoining land of similar quality has been leased. I claim that my  amendment, if made, will help a freeholder who has poor land, as against a leaseholder who holds tracts of equal, perhaps better, quality at a nominal rate. I know of instances where land which was purchased years ago "is not worth the purchase money, including the value of the improvements, so that there can be no hardship in what I propose. In regard to the exemption of the money first paid for town lots, the amount would be so trivial that it is hardly worth consideration. But in the case of country lands it is worth consideration. Whereas on town blocks, perhaps, it would not amount to a few shillings, on country land it would amount to so much per acre. In many instances the money which was paid by the early settlers has gone to the improvement of towns, the building of roads round cities, and the improvement of public parks and recreation reserves, and all that sort of thing. After thirty or forty years of settlement, roads have not even been formed through the properties, so that the settlers have received very little in return for the money which they paid for the fee-simple of their lands. I claim that, in accepting my proposal, the Government would only be treating those persons with fairness. There is another phase of this subject which should be considered, because the time will come when the ,£5,000 exemption will be lowered. It would not come with a very good grace to make this proposal when we were asked to lower the exemption. It is better to lay the foundation now, so that in after years the principle can apply with fairness to smaller areas. I think honorable mem.1,rs will see that the wrong which would otherwise be done to persons in (he back blocks, who have paid even more than- their land was worth, would lie to some extent averted by what I propose. In fact, when the money was taken from these persons, many others considered that they had. paid too much for their lands, and many of them did. I think that if the actual amount which was paid for the land were exempted from the tax, <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> exemption would be well received throughout Australia, and persons would look upon this Parliament as trying to act fairly, instead of penalizing them. There is no doubt that many honorable members on the Ministerial side will see the fairness of my proposition. Let us look at the increment on the money paid for the land. </para>

                <para class="block">The value of  ,£20,000,  paid in twenty annual instalments, would, at 5 per cent., be over  ,£200,000.  No doubt the buyers have had the use of the land in the meantime, but the Government have had the use of the money, so that it is really fair not to tax men on the money which was paid. I hope that the Minister will agree to amend this portion of the clause in the manner I propose. </para>

                    <para>. - This amendment te exempt the price paid to the Crown is not one which can be accepted by the Government. The argument which is mostly used, in the press and elsewhere, in favour of the acceptance of this principle presumes that the justification, ethical and economic, for the tax is the right of the community to the unearned increment, and that as the Crown has been paid for the land it has no right to demand the amount again. If this tax were based on that, the argument would have weight, but its justification is not dependent upon the right of the people to the unearned increment. No graduated land tax can be, because the unearned increment is, so to speak, the layer of value which is added to all lands uniformly - that is, uniformly so far as the size of the holding is concerned. Quite irrespective of whether a man owns  £100  or  £100,000'.  worth of land, the unearned increment attaches to every pound's worth of value uniformly. But the principle of this Bill is quite opposed to that. It does not take off or attempt to take off a uniform skiming of value, but it becomes more intense in the ratio of the aggregation of the individual holdings. The principle underlying the Bill, therefore, is not the right of the people to the unearned increment, although that, of course, is clearly established, but the right of the people to have access to the land itself and the danger to the community of allowing large aggregations of land in the hands of individuals. It is quite immaterial whether a man bought his land from the Crown or from somebody else, whether he paid  £1  or  £100,000  an acre, the fact remains that if one man owned this country he would have the right to determine the conditions under which the whole community could live. It is for that reason that a graduated land tax is finding favour in countries where the aggregation of lands in the hands of private individuals is becoming greater as time goes on. A uniform land tax is an attempt to take back by the community a value which it gives to land, but a graduated land tax is an attempt to effect a more even distribution of land. The two things are fundamentally distinct. Therefore this amendment which aims at exempting the price paid to the Crown cannot be accepted. Looking at the proposal from another stand-point, let us see where it takes us. Such a proposal has never been accepted by any Legislature that has attempted a graduated land tax, or, so far as I am aware, any other kind of land taxation. It certainly has not been accepted in New Zealand or Victoria. If it were adopted by us, clearly its effect would be practically to exempt from taxation great pastoral properties, and the exemption would be the greatest where the value of the land per acre was the least. There are many cases where the value of the land to-day is probably not more than was paid for it to the Crown, so that in such instances the whole of the value, under this amendment, would be exempt. We should thus have large pastoral holdings, owned by .some of the wealthiest men and institutions in Australia, wholly exempt from the operation of this tax. Although . we have heard lately a very melancholy wail from the poor land-owners of this country, I venture to say that a man who has 100,000 acres of land worth <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> an acre could scarcely come with reason to this Legislature and ask to be treated differently from the poor workman who receives <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 2s. per week, and who is taxed through the Customs to the last penny. Some of these men, if they have 100,000 acres, want 150,000 acres; if they have 150,000 acres they want 200,000 acres. Even if they had 1,000,000 acres they would not feel that they had enough. We are asked to exempt from taxation the price that they have paid to the Crown. Presumably, they purchased the land because it was a good bargain, and in very many cases the transactions have proved the best that they have ever made for themselves, and the very worst for the community. The Victorian Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> pointed out in the State Legislative Assembly that the whole of the alienated lands in Australia had been sold at a price which was to-day less than the value of the lands in Victoria. That is to say, the unearned increment has so increased the value of the alienated lands of Victoria that it exceeds to-day the price actually paid for the whole of the alienated lands of the Commonwealth. As I mentioned last Friday, in Sydney alone during the last six years there has been added to the value of the land no less than £6,000,000. Not a railway or improvement is made or even contemplated that does not add to the value of the land. People hold on to it, and reap the benefit of the efforts and expenditure of the community. Every pound that is borrowed - and the country seems to be always borrowing - adds to the value of the land, yet these large land-owners ask that they shall be exempt from taxation. The adoption of such a proposal would be unfair to the community, and unfair to the rest of the land-owners of Australia. If I have bought a piece of land from Jones, I have as much right to be considered as has a man who has bought direct from the Crown. If I am buying .£5,000 worth of city land, I have as much right to be considered as if I had purchased 5,000 acres in the country at <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> an acre. The amendment cannot be accepted. It is not based upon any sound economic or ethical principle; it is discordant with the principles of the Bill, and its acceptance would not be fair either to the general community or to the rest of the landlords of Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- The Attorney-General has stated that the amendment moved by the honorable member for Fremantle is without precedent; that the primary purpose of this tax is to burst up large estates ; that it is the duty of the people to take back to themselves some of the unearned increment that they have given to the land ; and that this is a taxation measure. In the <inline font-style="italic">Nineteenth Century</inline> for September, 1909, there appeared an article by <inline font-weight="bold">.Mr. Alfred</inline> Mond, in which it was pointed out. that the' betterment principle, which is only another form of taxing the unearned increment, has been in operation in France since 1679, when an ordinance, providing for the taxation of land, increased in value by public improvements, was issued by Colbert. Article 30, of a law passed in 1807, under the inspiration of Napoleon, provides that- </para>

                <para class="block">According to this article, in 200 municipalities in the German Empire, the tax is levied on the increment of the land - or in other words, the amount paid for the land, either to the Crown or to an individual, is deducted. That is a sound principle, and its operation is rapidly increasing in Germany. The writer predicts that the whole basis of the taxation of land in Germany, which has the most scientific form of taxation in the world, will be on the increment value, after deducting, the full amount paid to the Crown, or to the individual from whom the land has been purchased. That system is in operation in France, and the writer of this article states that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. LloydGeorge</inline> also embodied in his taxation proposals more or less the same principle of taxation on the increment of the land. Thus the amendment embodies a principle' that is by no means new. Whatever arguments might be advanced in favour of taxing land acquired under the feudal system in England, or in European principalities, on the plea that it was never legitimately purchased from the Crown, they cannot be applied to the lands of Australia, the whole of which have been legitimately purchased. </para>

                        <para>- The money was legitimately paid. If the Government wish to impose a tax on wealth, they should adopt some other method than that proposed in the Bill. If this is to be a tax on the unearned increment of land - and the burden of the argument put before the people at the last general election was that it was the duty of the Government to tax that value which had been given to the land by the operations and activities of the community - then this amendment should be accepted. It will not mete out full justice, but it will, at least, do an act of tardy justice by exempting from taxation that amount which has been paid to the Crown for the purchase of land, and which has been applied to the construction of public works, which have benefited * the whole community. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems to me that members of the Opposition overlook the fact that due allowance is already made in the Bill for the amount which was originally paid for land "by reason of the fast that it is not proposed that we shall appropriate all interest on its community-created value. As a matter of fact, we shall not appropriate even one-half that interest unless the land be worth £80,000. It must be apparent to everybody that half of the economic rent which will not be touched under this measure, will more than set off the amount which was originally paid for the land, which in most instances was only £1 per acre. I contend that the community has an absolute right to the community-created values. </para>

                        <para>- Even the original value of land must have been a community-created value. W;hy did men pay £i per acre for their land? Simply because of the inhabitants who were here. Ample allowance is made in this Bill for the money which was originally paid for the purchase of land. The honorable member for Fawkner has pointed out that a financial institution may hold a mortgage over land to the extent of half its value. But I would remind him that any man who holds decent land makes a good deal more than 5 per cent, out of it. As a matter of fact, he should be making 100 per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - At first sight the amendment appears to be based upon a fair principle, but in reality, there is room for considerable doubt on the point. Judge Blackstone, in his <inline font-style="italic">Commentaries on English Law,</inline> points out that an estate which is held in fee-simple is really an estate which is held in tenancy at the will of the Crown - that the Crown is the ultimate owner of all land. In other words, when it sells land the Crown does not part with its right to tax that land up to the last pennyworth of its value. Now, let me take the case of a municipal council. I happen to know an instance in which a municipality proposes to sell certain lands which are in its possession, and upon which a town hall was built some years ago. That building is no longer adequate for the purpose for which it was originally erected, and IKe council has purchased some more land upon which it proposes to erect a more suitable building. If the principle which is embodied in this amendment is recognised in the case of Crown lands, it must also be recognised in the case of municipal lands. But would anybody contend for a moment that the sale of the land upon which the building to which I have referred now stands, ought to exempt the purchaser from municipal taxation? </para>

                        <para>- The destination of the purchase money makes no difference whatever to the principle involved. The principle remains the same, irrespective of whether that money finds its way into the Treasury or into the pockets of private individuals. And the purchaser from the Crown has not only the land for his use and profit, but all the advantages of railway construction, protection of his life and property, road and bridge construction, but many other advantages also beyond the power of a municipality to confer. The Crown does not part with its right to tax land whenever the public needs demand it. So that whatever we may think of the constitutionality or otherwise' of this Bill, there are certain fundamental principles which we must recognise, because failure to do so may land us into many, serious difficulties in the future. Whether it is expedient or not to exempt the amount originally paid, is a point I am not discussing, and the whole point is whether it is right or just to do so. </para>

                    <para>.- In addition to the points which were made by the honorable member for Macquarie, I wish to remind the Committee that a very considerable return has been derived from the State by those who have purchased land. Undoubtedly the money which they paid in the first instance was a source of revenue to the Government. But it was expended in providing public utilities in the form of railways, &amp;c. So that the purchasers have already had a very considerable return. </para>

                        <para>- Just so. But I would point out to the honorable member that there are cases in which the construction of railways has had the effect of enhancing the value of land by ,£2 per acre. In submitting his amendment, the honorable member for Fremantle did not mention quite a number of factors which are worthy of consideration. We all know that some persons have purchased from the Government land at ,£1 per acre which was worth £4 per acre, whilst others have paid _£i per acre for land which was not worth 5s. per acre. But these are extreme cases. When the honorable member for Fremantle reminded us that it was not worth our while to consider city lands, it . at once occurred to me that a block between Elizabeth-street and Swanston-street, which was originally sold for ,£3,000, was valued fifty years afterwards at £19,000,000. In the Western District of Victoria, large estates were purchased for which .£5, ,£6, and ,£7 per acre was paid. </para>

                        <para>- But it was never intended that its present holders should get that land. They secured it by means of dummying under the Act of 1863. It was deliberately cut up into blocks for farmers. The largest area of the blocks was 640 acres, and they were smaller according to quality. The farmers did not procure a bit of that land. It was all secured by the original squatter - the man who held previously under lease - although it was never the intention that he should secure it. In some cases the average that he paid for areas of something like 170,000 acres was just a few pence under '£2 an acre. The honorable member quotes cases of land sold at  ;£i  an acre, which is perhaps worth less now j but he does not quote the cases I am speaking of. The honorable member is probably unaware of them, but if he wants to ascertain some of the facts he win find them in the very interesting <inline font-style="italic">History of Land Tenure in Victoria,</inline> written by the honorable member for Bendigo. He will see there that men secured areas of 25,000 acres, 11,000 acres, and so on. The very principle of this Bill is to make it unprofitable for the big holders to continue to hold that agricultural land which is now being used for grazing. Before we could adopt the honorable member's proposal we should have to reconstruct the measure, and put it on an altogether different basis. If we carry out the principles that the Government have adopted, and wish to strike a "straight-out blow at the big estates, and make it unprofitable to hold them, the amendment cannot be accepted, because it would release from any sort of tax that would have any effect upon them some of the very estates that it is most desirable should be restored to the uses which the Government of Victoria originally had in view when they framed a Bill to cut them up. That purpose was. defeated by systems which I do not want to dwell upon now, but they were aided very much in the drafting of the measure by a little word slipping in at the instance of their friends in the Victorian Legislative Council, and opening the door practically for dummying. The honorable member now proposes that those people should be allowed exemption on the money that they paid ; but that would defeat the whole purpose of the Bill. </para>

                <para>There is such a wide difference between the different cases that the honorable member's proposal could not be applied with any fairness. I admit that, on the first look at it, there appears an element of fairness about the proposition, but when one goes into it in detail, he realizes that the circumstances and conditions are so varied that the principle cannot be applied without raising many other difficulties. To my mind the Bill all through aims at putting a stop to the accumulation of large estates by making it unprofitable to hold them when they exceed a certain area. There is also the big exemption of  £5,000  worth of unimproved value. All these things have to be recognised. We could make allowances in different ways if the Bill was entirely different. If, for instance, the Bill was purely a taxation Bill without any exemption, these points might be considered; but, viewing the. principle which the measure has been framed to accomplish, I do not see how it is possible for the Government to accept the amendment. They have already stated that they cannot accept it, and I think they are doing right. </para>

                    <para>. - I was surprised to hear the honorable member for Macquarie talk about the wonderful returns from land. I lived for  many years in the Ballarat district, where the best potato-growing land is to be found. Many of the farmers there would be very pleased to get anything like the returns mentioned by the honorable member. The holdings there are not big. They run from  20  to  300  acres,, the latter being a very big property in that district, and the farmers do very well if they get more than  5  per cent, 'on the present value of the land. There is very little land in Victoria, that will pay more than  5  or  6  per cent, on' its present value. It is very good land, indeed, that will return foi wheat an average of  30s.  an acre, year iii and year out. By very intense cultivation, in the case of a man working a market garden near a city with his own family, a return of  £30  an acre may be got, but you cannot make farming land pay if you have to cart your produce any distance. If you are further than sixteen miles at the outside from the railway, farming will not pay. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think a man could get  £30  an acre regularly off land, nor do I think any of such land is worth  £600  per acre. There may be an exceptional case where a man is growing some special class of fruit, or tomatoes, or asparagus, or, perhaps, flower seed. From an exceptional block you may get a fairly big return in those ways, but I am satisfied that no man can get  £30  an acre per annum off land by farming. </para>

                        <para>- But not year in and year out. I have known times when onions have not paid for digging, and have seen in the Ballarat district thousands of tons of potatoes that it did not pay to dig out of the ground. It is not fair to quote exceptional cases as giving the average over a long term of years. If any man gets a return of  6  per cent, off his land year in and year out, he is very lucky. 'The honorable member for Darling told the Committee just now that a block of land in Melbourne, sold in  1837  for  ,£3,000,  is now worth  £19,000,000.  What is this tax going to realize if one block of land in the city of Melbourne is worth  £1.9,000,000?  Assuming that half of that is the unimproved value, what an enormous return the Government will get. The tax, instead of bringing in  £1,000,000  per annum, will bring in nearer  £10.000,000  at that rate. I do not know whether the honorable member's figures are correct, but it was rather an eye-opener to me to hear there were blocks worth such an enormous sum. During the whole of this debate the members on the Government side have been preaching that they want to do justice and give fair play. The lands in the western district of New South Wales cannot pay interest if there is a mortgage on them, and also pay the land tax, and give the owner anything. The owner is going to be absolutely starved out. I am not interested in any way in that land myself. I saw a balance-sheet yesterday of a syndicate of Victorian people, who had invested money in New South Wales, and who held their interest in small snares. They had bought a property with the idea of subdividing, but it is too far away from a railway, and therefore it has to be carried on as a grazing proposition. They put  £72,000  into it, and they owe  £80,600,  the balance of the purchase money. They have worked that property for three years ; and the balance-sheet for last year shows, after paying interest and rates and cost of management, a return of £49- </para>

                        <para>- This season is a bad one for them. They have had no rain there for seven weeks, and that has affected them very seriously. The Attorney-General said that men in acquiring land had, in many cases, bitten off more than they could chew. That remark might be applied to almost everybody in this country. All men who go on the land, and especially the farmers, rely on their own labour, and the labour of their family, and the returns from the land, to pay off their debt. Many a man in Victoria who has had four or five good seasons is well off. There was an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Lone Hand</inline> the other day, showing how a man made £^8,000 out of .£75. I read that article carefully, and know that such things do happen in the mallee country ; but the man took the risk. Was he not a bold man, and is not that the class of man that makes a country like Australia? The Attorney-General says that he has no consideration for the man who is game to take the risk, because he has bitten off more than he can chew. How are men to get on if they do not sometimes take a good bite? It is the perseverance and pluck of those men, with the assistance of the monetary institutions, that has helped to make this country, and I do not think we ought to drive them off the land. I believe the great majority of the members of this House know that, in the western part of New South Wales, without close railway communication, and without water conservation, it is absolutely impossible to settle small men on the land. If you cut that land up into blocks of 2,000 or 3,000 acres, there will not be a man on it in the next five years. The same thing was done near Hay, in the northern part of the Riverina. The land was cut up for closer settlement into blocks of from 2,400 to 3,000 acres, but I do not believe 1 per cent., or even \ per cent., of the settlers are left there now. They struck three or four bad years, and were all starved out. The only chance these men have is where they get near railways and water. If you put them on to the back country and starve them out, you will ruin them, and make it necessary for them to start life afresh. That is no good to the country. If you cut up these grazing properties before the proper time comes, you will do no good. But in the eyes of honorable members opposite it is a sin for a man to own land at all. </para>

                        <para>- The statement is not absurd. I have heard it shouted from the Ministerial corner time after time. I have heard it shouted from the public platform. I know that it is absolutely true that some honorable members regard it as a crime to own land in Australia. Under this Bill the man who lends his money on the security of land - the mortgagee - will be on top. He will get the benefit. But the man who is living in the country and working hard to produce for export and pay the interest on our national debt will be squeezed and ruined. He will be driven off the land. I am quite certain that the proposal of the honorable member for Fremantle is fair and just. The people who originally purchased land, and who have reaped the benefit of its subsequent rise in value, will not be made to suffer. We are going to punish -those who have purchased land from them. </para>

                        <para>- No, he has made his profit, and the people who bought it will, under this tax, lose all that they have paid. Of course, they did not know that the tax was going to be imposed. They did not expect to be treated in this unfair way. They have not been dishonest. Yet they are to suffer. The Crown received its money from the original purchaser and expended it. Who benefited chiefly from that expenditure? Honorable members opposite are always talking about the way in which land-owners have benefited from the increment of value. But has not the greater part of the money been spent at the seaboard ? Has not any country representative experienced the greatest difficulty in securing the expenditure of a few pounds in his electorate? The expenditure has principally been in the centres of population. In our large cities we have our splendid streets, our convenient railways, our palatial post-offices and public buildings, whilst the country districts have been comparatively neglected. It will be just the same at Yass-Canberra when the Federal Capital is established. We shall have our magnificent buildings there, and the people of the country will have to be taxed to pay for them. The Prime Minister has said that the Government are willing to listen to reason. I have heard the Attorney-General say the same thing. But when a reasonable proposition is made from this side of the House it is scouted, and we are informed that the Government cannot accept it. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that it will serve any very useful purpose to prolong the debate. Honorable members opposite have proclaimed that they are willing to listen to reason, and that their principal object is to do justice: but they will not listen to arguments on the ground of justice from this side of the House. In listening to this debate one cannot but be struck by the fact that it is not land taxation, but land settlement, that is aimed at. There seems to be a desire to make restitution, to- give back to the people that which - so they say - has been improperly taken from them. In fact, there is a crusade against the ownership of land, and therefore a proposition such as we are now considering which would be of very much value to a large number of people, especially in the drier parts of the Commonwealth, does not receive any real consideration. Of course, I am well aware that in the older parts of the country the proposal of the honorable member for Fremantle would not have very much effect. In the early days lands were acquired from the Crown at rates which were not very high, and values have very much increased since then. But in the drier parts of Australia - in the Riverina, in western Queensland, and in western New South Wales - the amendment would confer a great advantage. And, after all, it does seem reasonable and fair that we should not tax that amount which the Crown has been paid. There are other cases of hardship that will occur unless the amendment be adopted. One to which I should like to refer is the case of the Midland Railway Company, which constructed in Western Australia 300 miles of railway without receiving any cash. It was paid on the land grant principle. The company received 3,000,000 acres of land, and has sold only 1,000,000 acres. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member's mind is warped in many directions. However, the point I wish to make is this : I do not say that people should be at liberty to come to Australia, acquire land, and escape taxation altogether. But when a company takes land in payment for doing a great work for a State, and a heavy penal tax is placed upon it afterwards, it amounts almost to confiscation. At all events, some time should be given to the company to unload. It seems unfair for the Government to say to them, " We will put a tax of £20,000 or £30,000 a year on you." The company is trying its best to unload. Whatever may have been said about them in the past, they have been doing their best in recent years. I am informed that they have 200,000 acres of land surveyed, subdivided, and ready for occupation, but they cannot- get people to take it. The company has had a troublesome career. It is not very popular on account of the great quantity of land which it holds. Years ago it was in financial difficulties, and the State had to come to its rescue on one occasion to the extent of £500,000, which amount is being paid off gradually. A tax of £20,000 or £30,000 a year would be a very heavy burden, and it is only reasonable that time to unload should be given. If, however, the Government are not willing to accept the amendment of the honorable member for Fremantle, it is of no use for me to move a further amendment with a view of meeting this case. Nevertheless, I think that the tax is unduly heavy, and some means should be found of making it less burdensome. The tax is going to produce a very much larger amount of revenue than has been estimated. So much, I think, is certain. I should say that the yield will be at least twice or thrice the amount of the estimate. Unless the Government wish to dispossess people or unduly injure them, some alteration should be made,. if not in the direction suggested by the honorable member for Fremantle, then "in some other direction. Every one has come to the conclusion that this is a very drastic proposal. But unless the Government take a different view to that which they have enunciated, it is useless to labour the question. Therefore, I shall do no more than call the attention of the Attorney-General to it. </para>

                    (Coolgardie) [TT.58I.- I regret having missed the Attorney-General's explanation of his opposition to the amendment of the honorable member for Fremantle. The only present clue to the Government attitude is that afforded by the speech of the honorable member for Darling, but he gives no reason that appeals to me for rejecting the amendment.  His  speech showed no justification whatever for taxing the value for . which the owners originally paid cash to -the Crown. The honorable member said something about people having obtained land for less than the market value at the time of the purchase; and also pointed out that much of that land has since increased largely in value. That may be so. It is that value - the unearned increment - the community-created value - that we are going to tax by this Bill, and I go as far as he does in appropriating that increment for the community. But I see nothing in the amendment of the honorable member for Fremantle that is not strictly iri accordance with justice. If a land-owner had invested his money in Government debentures, instead of purchasing landed property, I presume that no one would sanction a proposal to tax him on his investment. That being so, I am unable to see the justification for a tax on the amount which the Crown originally obtained for land. That outlay ought to be as free, in a taxation measure of this kind, as any of the improvements which the owner's capital has placed upon the- land, and which improvements this Bill exempts from taxation. The permanency of any law depends on its abstract and intrinsic justice; and if, by the refusal of a rational and fair amendment like this, we impose on the people a measure which flouts that inherent sense of justice which exists in every community, this measure will have a very short life. The first opportunity the people obtain they will sweep it away, and replace it, perhaps, with something which errs in a contrary direction. When the right honorable member for Swan was speaking I made a harmless interjection, which, however, seemed to excite him very much. The honorable member was referring to what has long been a curse to the people of Western Australia, namely, the monopoly of a vast tract of country by a foreign syndicate, which has kept back development by mismanagement of their privately-owned railway. What I said was that I thought it a pity that the land held by this company had not been taxed long ago, so that they should have been compelled to, as they have done since, throw open the land for settlement, and run their railway to the advantage and benefit of the settlers. I regret that the right honorable member should think I have a dishonest mind, simply because I made such a suggestion.

                    <para>- I do not wish to refer further to the episode, though it is strictly in order for me to correct any misapprehension by way of a personal explanation. I hope the Attorney-General is not going to be adamant in regard to this amendment. If there be any justification for his refusal to accept the amendment, I, as one who wishes to do the fair thing between those who have land and those who have not, would be glad to hear it. I remind the Attorney -General again that the object of the Bill is to throw open lands for settlement, and not merely to raise revenue. I remind him also that that is the policy of the party of which he is a member, and that when a land-tax scheme was adopted at the Brisbane Conference in  1908,  at which I was present, not a word was said about taxing the value represented by the amount originally paid to the Crown. There never was, in any man's mind at that Conference, any idea that such a proposal would ever be made to Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- That may be, but I am not going into these refinements. I point out that a large section of the Labour party oppose all exemptions in land taxation, and that, in Western Australia, Labour Conferences have repeatedly pronounced against exemptions. The amendment of the honorable member for Fremantle is strictly and absolutely just, and ought to be adopted if we mean to adhere to the original purposes of this measure, which are solely to promote settlement and appropriate the unearned increment for the community. </para>

                    <para>.- It is somewhat difficult to find out what is really in the mind of the Attorney-General. At one time we were led to believe that this was a measure for bursting up large estates, at another time, that it was for the purposes of revenue, and to-day the proposal is based on some other more abstract ground. Whatever is in the honorable gentleman's mind, I am certain that what was in the mind of a great number of honorable members opposite, and of the public, was that we were going to tax, not so much the unimproved value as the unearned increment. If that be admitted, as it ought to be, between man and man, we shall arrive at what the mandate really was. Australians are a fair-minded people, and do not desire to tax a man who in the way-back districts is making nothing to speak of out of his land. There is no wish to tax people who hold land in the Western Riverina, and who are actually prepared to sell for less than they originally paid ; a bursting-up tax in regard to such holders was never contemplated. The honorable member for Lang said that, of course, all kinds of property, or, at any rate, all kinds of land are subject to taxation, and to ordinary taxation no one objects. But when an avowedly bursting-up tax is imposed on people who cannot burst up their estates, because no one will take up small areas away from railways and settlement, we see that great injustice must be done. We have had difficulty in bringing names before honorable members, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alexander</inline> T. Creswick, of Western Riverina, published a letter in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the  24th  September, putting the position very plainly; and I should like honorable members to hear what he says in regard to land there which has not at all increased in value. Mr. Creswick said - </para>

                        <para>- But what if the value does not reach the price originally paid? If the Crown possesses the £1 per acre which was paid, and the land is now only worth 8s. 6d., as was the case with land sold only the other day, is the proposed tax fair? Such a man cannot burst up his estate, and must be simply ruined. The argument is that if a man does not like to pay the tax he "may sell his land, but, as I have pointed out, these people cannot sell. </para>

                    <para>Now, with regard to the injustice of the proposed tax. The Government of New South Wales sold this land at from 20s. to 25s. an acre to raise revenue for expenditure upon public works, &amp;c. At the same time the Crown also raised money upon its debentures. The bulk of the money to pay for these lands was borrowed from insurance societies and English investors, on the reckoning that an acre of land bought from the Crown for 20s. was worth the money and should show a rental value of at any rate  4  per cent. Now the federal Government pro pose to tax the purchaser of that land (who cannot get what he originally paid for it)  23  per cent, on the capital invested, so that the return of the money so invested i; Only  1^  per cent., instead of  4  per cent. </para>

                        <para>- In all cases; yet when a man has to work his land, which he has. bought, he is called upon to pay this heavy bursting-up tax. Land-owners do not desire to escape taxation altogether, not even these poor, wretched people who have made bad bargains; and it would be some concession, at any rate, if the Government would impose a flat rate of id. in the <inline font-style="italic">£i.</inline> I do not think that in a private transaction any honorable member would take such a course as the Government propose; and there would seem to be one set of morals for private business, and another for public business. In his private capacity, no honorable member would take a man's sovereign for something, and then, if he had the power, take from him half what he had sold for the sovereign. That, however, will be the effect of this measure, and there will be no escape from it for the people to whom I am referring. The Attorney-General said that there was no similar exemption in a land tax law in any part of the world. The answer to that  is  that there is not in any other part of the. world a state of affairs similar to that existing in Australia, where the Governments of the different States have disposed of the land, and have received over £113,000,000 for it. In New Zealand a great deal of the land was bought from the Maoris, and only a comparatively small area was sold by the Government. I have been unable to find the exact amount received by the Government of New Zealand from the sale of land. But in the Commonwealth every single acre of freehold has been sold and paid for in cash. No similar state of things exists in any other part of the world. People situated as are those to whom I have referred will be unable to escape this imposition by selling their land, because it is not wanted in such districts, except in large areas. The position of these land-owners will be a very hard one under this Bill, and might be met to some extent by the amendment; or if the Government would be content with a flat rate of id. in the <inline font-style="italic">j£i,</inline> that would give great relief to these men. I cannot help thinking that they must be ruined under this measure. </para>

                        <para>- I do not deny that the matter is very important, but I trust the Committee will make some progress. We must dispose of the amendments one by one, and we have a sheaf of them yet to deal with. The position put by the honorable member for Fawkner is substantially that put by the honorable member for Fremantle and other honorable members opposite. It amounts practically to this : That the State having taken the money of the individual has no right to call upon him further to make a contribution in respect of that which he has already bought and paid for. </para>

                        <para>- That is the basis of the argument. Let us see how it conforms to the practice adopted in everyday life. A man making an ordinary purchase is able to put the article purchased to a very limited number of uses, whilst the purchaser of land secures with it an undiminishing use. A man who purchased land twenty years ago for £1 an acre has been able to use it for twenty years, and is still able to use it for an unlimited number of years. If a man bought a horse twenty years ago, by this time the animal would be of little or no use. But land purchased twenty, thirty, or forty years ago is not only of use for an indefinite term, but has increased in value sometimes a hundredfold. The suggestion of honorable members opposite is that the price paid for it twenty, thirty, or forty years ago should be regarded as a perpetual set-off to any claim by the community. It is forgotten that the community at the time the land was sold had the right to sell for the time they lived, and no longer. I fail utterly to see how it can be logically contended that those who bought land thirty or forty years ago, and paid for it to those who are dead and gone, owe nothing to the present generation who have received nothing for the land. </para>

                        <para>-  The descendants of the man who bought land forty years agc still have the use of it, and while it might be perfectly fair to exempt those who bought their land during the present generation, it cannot be said to be fair to exempt the value paid for land twenty or fifty years ago. There is neither justice, sense, nor equality of incidence in such a contention. As to the right  of the community to tax land irrespective of whether the holder has paid for it or not, I remind  the Committee that it is acknowledged that the community has a right to tax. It may tax, in whatever way it pleases, a man's ' income, whether he has earned it or not, and it is a fact that the tax upon unearned incomes is at a higher rate than upon those which are earned. It may tax his land, or it may tax his property generally. There is a positive recognition of the principle that no matter how a man gets a thing, whether by his own labour, or in some other way, the fact that he has it is a sufficient justification for the community to tax it. The basic principle of taxation after all is that people should pay according to their ability. There is nothing wrong about that. What canon of justice is violated by the acceptance of this principle ? The honorable member for Coolgardie spoke of this measure as being based on injustice, and as a' class tax. That might be a perfectly proper thing for the honorable member for Fawkner to say, but it is not a proper thing for the honorable member for Coolgardie to say, who, as a member of this party, was returned to this House as a supporter of this very tax, set forth not in a general sort of way, but as a panacea for a number of evils which every member of this party declares this country to be suffering from. When the honorable gentleman says that the  .£5,000  exemption makes this a class tax he fails to understand the principle on which this party deliberately adopted this proposal, and the reason why we advocated  a .£5  ' 000 exemption rather than no exemption at all. He further fails to remember that the Bill now before the Committee is in every essential particular precisely the same as the Bill laid on the table of this House by the first Fisher Government, of which he was a member. Whatever may be properly said by honorable members returned to this Parliament pledged to oppose this measure, it does not lie in the mouth of those returned to support it to dissent from the basic principle on which it rests. The  ,£5,000  exemption is certainly one of the principles upon which this party was returned to power. No honorable member opposite will deny that for a moment. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Parkes will not deny that the  £5,000  exemption was put clearly before the people. We may differ as to how much further our mandate went, but as to the proposal that there should be an exemption of  £5,000  in value, there can be no question that we have a mandate on that point from the people. In this Bill w.e have endeavoured to give effect to the principles we set before the electors. The honorable member for Coolgardie has said that we made no mention of taxing the value paid for land, but that was naturally taken for granted. We have a right to say that, because in every other Act, including the Western Australian Act relating to the taxation of land values, the amount paid to the Crown for the land is not exempt from taxation. Since it is clearly the general and uniform practice in New Zealand, New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, and South Australia, where land taxation has been imposed, not to exempt the value paid to the Crown for land, it rests with the honorable member for Coolgardie to show that the people were led to believe that the Federal tax would differ fundamentally from the State land taxes in this particular, and that there is some violation of justice and some departure from the clear mandate of the people in the proposal made in this Bill. <inline font-style="italic">~l</inline> submit that his position is quite untenable. The amount paid to the Crown is taxed in every tax, State and municipal. If there is a violation of justice by the Bill, there is also a similar violation by the Acts of Western Australia, South Australia, and New South Wales. </para>

                    <para>.- The Prime Minister and the Attorney-General would have us believe that the Government does not wish to inflict injustice or undue hardship on any land-holder in Australia. But unless some such amendment as has been proposed is made, great injustice will be done to a good many persons. It is nonsense to say that the measure is in strict conformity with the policy advocated by the Labour party at the elections. According to the Attorney-General, the object of the Bill is to tax community-given value, or unearned increment, the value given to the land by the energy of the community. The price originally paid to the Crown for the land cannot be regarded as unearned increment. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of the effect of the Bill on the whole of Australia. There are not many persons in the Wilmot division who hold land whose unimproved value is more than  £5,000,  it being one of the best examples of a closely settled district in Australia, though many of the farmers there, having mortgages, desire cheap money, and the Bill will make it more difficult to get money cheaply. The honorable member must be aware that western Riverina contains many large holdings bought from the Crown, and heavily mortgaged, and that their owners will be ruined if the Bill is passed as it stands, because their returns will not enable them to pay interest on their mortgages and a tax on the unimproved value of the land, including the price at which they bought from the Crown. In that district estates are being offered to-day with all their improvements for the price paid to the Crown for the land in its unimproved state. Mortgagees are offering the land to-day in the open market, and cannot get £1 an acre for it. There must be persons similarly situated in the other States. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to exempt any company or person, but I wish to prevent injustice. Honorable members opposite seem to think that because a man holds a large area of land he must be wealthy, and must be preventing settlement; hut in western Riverina there are many holdings on which closer settlement would be impossible, and if the present owners were dispossessed, the land would fall out of use. It now produces a certain quantity of wool, but were it to fall out of use our wool clip would be less, and wool still represents a very large part of the wealth annually produced in Australia. The people who are struggling on this land to-day are using it to the best advantage, considering its conditions. They are some of the most capable managers of grazing areas that we have. If the land could be put to better use, or sold to advantage, they -would not continue to use it only for grazing. Is it likely that they would stand in the way of bettering themselves? In Tasmania there has been a great outcry against certain owners for not selling their land, but I know that they would gladly sell at reasonable prices, if they could get them. Many of the Riverina land-owners cannot get even what they originally paid to the Crown. </para>

                <para class="block">He told us that had the present generation received the money paid to the Crown, it might be equitable "to exempt the holders from taxation in respect of the sums so paid, but that the land having been bought by a generation which has passed away, no such exemption can be allowed. In other words, he would exempt payments for land made by a man three years ago, but would not make an exemption in respect of payments for land made by his father. He reminded us that land has an undiminishing use, but forgot to add that so has Government stock, and so has every other form of investment in which the original purchase money or its equivalent value remains intact. If, forty years ago, one man had paid £1,000 for land, and another the same sum for Government stock, while the first would have had the continuous use of his land ever since, the other would have been in the regular receipt of interest from his investment. </para>

                        <para>- I am not objecting to the taxation of the unearned increment; I am speaking of the taxation of the sums paid to the Crown for the purchase of land. The honorable member will see that we are now singling out for special taxation the money originally invested in land, while allowing the money originally invested in Government stock to go scot free. That seems to me an utterly indefensible proceeding. It is absurd for any one who knows the history of Australia to say that because the generation which has gone received the money paid to the Crown for the land, this generation does not benefit by it. To what purpose has the land revenue of the States been applied? Has it not been devoted to the construction of railways, the building of bridges, the making of roads, and the carrying out of other public works, whereby the present generation benefits? It is nonsense for the Attorney-General to contend that this generation has received no benefit from the expenditure of the money which was received during the time of a former generation ! The bulk of this money has been expended on what may be called national improvements. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing of the kind. I am adhering to the proper principle; that is the taxation of the community-created value. I do oppose taxation of the money which owners honestly paid to the Government, and which, had it been invested in Government stock, or anything else, would be free from taxation under this measure. The honorable gentleman undertook to inform me as to the proper interpretation of the Labour platform, but I decline to accept him as the sole interpreter of it. He may be very astute, but I was present at the Brisbane Labour Conference, and know what was in the minds of its members a little better than he does, since he was not there. He complained that the Bill is identical with that of the Fisher Government, of which I was a member. We certainly have here the skeleton of the measure brought down by the Government, but we have also sheaves of this Government's amendments which leave little resemblance between the two Bills. And let me remind him that the basic principles of the measure brought in by the Government of which I was a member, are set out clearly in a memorandum attached to the Bill itself. This memorandum shows that the Bill was designed to burst up land monopoly, to promote settlement, and to obtain for the community some of the land values created by communal expenditure. It contains no hint or suggestion of a proposal to tax the value represented by the purchase money paid to the Crown by the possessors of land. The Attorney-General now tells us that the taxation of the amount paid to the Crown was to be taken for granted. I for one never took such an unfair proposal for granted; and I say now that nobody, on reading the Bill or the memorandum, would ever suspect that the amount which had been paid to the Government honestly by the owners of land was ever likely to be taxed. The Attorney-General further attempts to justify his attitude by pointing to the fact that in land taxation by the States no exemption is allowed for the purchase money paid to the Crown. He instanced several States, among them Western Australia, where no exemption of this sort exists. Even if that be correct, it does not bear on this measure. This Bill is one to tax community -created values and to dislodge the land monopolist. </para>

                <para>The State taxation measures which he cited had a totally different design. Their object was to raise funds to meet the ordinary expenses of government; and their Parliaments recognised that land, like other forms of property, should bear its legitimate share of general taxation. There is, therefore, no precedent in State enactments or policy to justify the Attorney-General's contention. He can scarcely have overlooked the essential distinction between the two cases. He must know that, whereas we are taxing the community-created value, the Governments of the States tax land for the purpose of getting revenue to defray the cost of administration - a totally different thing. If he is aware of this fact, and desires to conceal it, then his action is pitiable. It looks like a deliberate attempt to misstate the case in order to mislead the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the common knowledge of the Committee will enable members to decide between my assertion and the apparent denial of the Attorney-General. The State Governments do not tax land to get in the accrued value, but to raise revenue, just the same as they do by taxing other forms of property. That is the difference, and an important one it is, which the Attorney-General ignored. He also stated that persons are expected to pay taxes according to their ability. Of course, that is perfectly correct in a general way, and it would be proper in the case of an income tax. But this Bill does not involve the payment of tax according to ability, but rather the payment of tax according to the amount of property the value of which was created by the community. The honorable gentleman also said that it was not proper for me, as a member of the Labour party, to say that this measure is not in accordance with that view - that it would be a proper statement for the honorable member for Fawkner to make, but coming from a member in my position it  is little short of flat blasphemy. I do not know by what warrant the Attorney-General sets himself up as a judge of my conduct. I decline his arbitrament, and shall exercise my rights here irrespective of his opinion. I wish to see land taxation fixed on equity ; and if we are to have an enduring law, it must be based on just foundations. I see nothing improper in that contention. Probably the Attorney-General desires the Bill to go down to posterity as one of the monuments of his great wisdom and constructive statesmanship. If so, he will be solicitous that the Bill does not violate the principles of natural justice, and that it is in accordance with the dictates of fair play and common sense. And in that regard I think it is very proper for a member of the House, charged with responsibility to the whole nation as well as to his constituents, to say that he hopes the measure will ultimately be fashioned so as not to inflict injustice or hardship on anybody. My reference to the  £5,000  exemption was made in consequence of an interjection by the honorable member for Macquarie. I recognise that the exemption is provided for in the programme of our party, and have no wish to disturb it. But surely it is not heresy for me to say that as the exemption had my strong opposition when it was being ' placed in the platform, I am sorry it is there; and that its being there leaves this Bill open to the charge of being a class measure. It is not logical, however far it may be defensible on the ground that we should not at the present stage of affairs include in it persons who have only a small interest in land. Our object is to break up large country estates which are suitable for agriculture, and by discouraging these aggregations of land to promote closer settlement, and add to the population of this country so that it may be properly defended. There is not one syllable of my previous remarks which I propose to withdraw. or to qualify in the slightest degree. I regret that the Attorney-General has not better reasons than those which he cited in the beginning of his speech for his opposition to the amendment. I think that if he is prepared to admit, as he did, that allowance ought to be made for money paid three or four years ago, the benefit of which is enjoyed by this generation, he has no warrant for refusing to make allowance for money honestly paid to the Crown by the predecessors of this generation, seeing that the latter are also sharing in the benefits brought about by the expenditure of this public money. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the Committee is indebted to the honorable member for Coolgardie for his valuable and interesting contribution .to this discussion from the Labour stand-point. If the Attorney-General's argument be correct, it amounts to a claim on the part of the Commonwealth Government not merely to tax the annual value of a freehold estate, but to tax the capital value, and if necessary to tax it out of existence. It practically amounts to a claim of right to repudiate a contract between the Crown and a freeholder. There is no reasonable land taxer but would agree that -it is the right of this Parliament, as representing the people, to tax 'land values based upon earning capacity, but to claim the right to tax the capital value really amounts to a claim to assert the right of confiscation and repudiation. The amendment is based on equity. </para>

                        <para>- I know of no similar legislation in Victoria, and certainly no similar drastic legislation in any State, and probably it is the severity of these taxation proposals which have drawn attention to the extraordinary claim to tax out of existence the land values which were honestly sold by the Crown to the freeholders. I understand that whilst I was temporarily out of the chamber the honorable member for Darling quoted a passage from a pamphlet on the land question, which I wrote some years ago, and pointed out that in some cases, no doubt, the settlers and squatters in those days acquired the land by means of violations of the law, in the shape of dummyism, or something of that kind. He has also stated that in some cases they bought the land, not merely at the ordinary upset price of £1 per acre, but at the exaggerated value of £2 per acre, and that if the proposed exemption were allowed, those estates would escape taxation under the Bill. There can be no doubt that large areas of land in Victoria and other States were acquired by means of dummying and other illegalities. If the Parliaments of those days had been in a position to examine the transactions it would have been right and just on their part to pass laws superseding titles which had been dishonestly acquired. But I would point out that the titles were acquired many years ago; and that many of the dummymongers have passed away. </para>

                        <para>- In many cases the estates of the dummymongers have passed into other hands; have, indeed, been subdivided beyond recognition and the law of restoration. All that this Parliament can deal with is the state of things which it finds established by the law. I submit that we would not be justified in entering upon a policy of revenge or a policy of confiscation and repudiation merely because wrong acts were done very many years ago. I think that the testimony of the honorable member for Coolgardie is very valuable, as showing the original intention of the Federal land tax proposals. We are all aware that the argument used during the Federal campaign was that the basic principle of a Federal land tax was to tax the betterment value acquired from the development and progress of the State, but it was never suggested that the Federal law should tax the improved value added by the owner, or the capital value for which the owner or his predecessors in title had honestly paid the Crown. With reference to the argument that many of these estates would escape taxation if we gave credit for the upset price paid to the Crown, I may say that it told with me at first, and I was inclined to give considerable weight to it, but other statements have been made to the Committee. Although in many cases some estates would escape taxation under the measure because of the honest increment in their value, still if it be a fact that estates, sold at an upset price of, say, 10s. or 15s., or £1 per acre twenty or thirty years ago, have not increased in value, why should they be made the subject of this drastic legislation ? Does it not show that the estates have not enriched the owners by any increased value? </para>

Nothing was said about taxing the capital value of land for which the Crown had been paid, and I submit that a tax on the capital value for which the Crown has been paid, although in form a tax, would amount to a penalty which, if persisted in, might result in the complete effacement of the original value. </para>

                        <para>- I take exception ro both the amount and the principle so far as this Parliament is concerned. The argument that by excepting the Crown-paid value we should leave very little on which the tax could operate has not sufficient in it to warrant opposition to the amendment. Even if the Crown-paid value be excepted, there will still be an immense area of publicly added taxable value on which the tax will operate. </para>

                        <para>- I have no particular figures, but, generally speaking, there has been an increase in value on the price originally paid to the Crown. In some parts of Australia there may be estates which have not increased on their original capital upset price ; but if any landed estates have had no public betterment value since being purchased from the Crown, we have proof of one of three things : In the first place, it may prove that the original upset price was too high, and that there has been no increment because of the anticipated payment of too much value. Secondly, it may be that the land, because of its situation or poverty, is not capable of any increased value; and, thirdly, it may be that the owner has had only a limited use of the land. We may fairly draw the conclusion that if, at the present time in Australia, with all its progressive tendencies, there is a landed estate which has not increased in value since it was originally purchased from the Crown, at probably £1 per acre, there must be something inherent in its situation or potency that renders it incapable of increasing in value - that there is a limit to its possible use, and that this tax should not operate upon land of that peculiar and poverty-stricken character. I suppose that it is not desired even by the most enthusiastic advocates of this progressive graduated land tax that large aggregations in country districts which are incapable of being put to any use save pastoral occupation should be burst up. Of what use would it be to impose a penal tax on some of the remote, poor lands of Riverina or Central Australia, which would be useless if held in small isolated blocks? </para>

                        <para>- This tax will be imposed, not upon the productiveness of the land, but upon its abstract capital value. Let me point out to the Attorney-General the dilemma in which one of his arguments must place him. He said that the exception proposed by the honorable member for Fremantle was inconsistent with the basic principle of this Bill, namely, the imposition of a progressive land tax for breaking up large holdings. </para>

He said that unless we taxed the capital value paid to the Crown we could not burst up or prevent the accumulation of large estates. If that is the object of the Bill, then the Government are endeavouring, by a side wind, to do by means of Federal legislation that which can be done constitutionally only by State legislation. The honorable gentleman would not dare to state any such intention in the preamble to the Bill. If he did, it would be a proclamation on the face of it that it was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the Federal powers. </para>

                        <para>- On the "whole, I think that there are strong reasons, founded on natural justice, for the proposed exception. With the general proposition that Parliament has a right to tax values added to land by the general progress of the community, no reasonable politician will disagree. The only point made by those on this side of the Committee who favour that principle is that it ought to be left to State legislation. The honorable member for Fremantle has made out a strong case, and if the amendment be adopted it will not be inconsistent with the basic principle of this Bill - the taxation of community-added value, or, better value added by the community. </para>

                    <para>. - I see no valid reason for accepting this amendment. The honorable member for Lang pointed out this morning that the British Government had not conceded to landlords any right to exemption from taxation, and I fail to see why we should do so. The honorable member for Wimmera referred to taxation in Germany, and said that in that country the unearned increment was taxed for municipal purposes. So far as the exemption is concerned, that is the only instance that has come under my notice of the adoption of such a practice. Many English municipalities impose taxation ranging from 4s. to over 10s. in the £1, and yet the British Government reserve the right to tax income from land over and above that taxation. I failed to understand the argument advanced by the honorable member for Coolgardie, when he said that he was not really in favour of an exemption of  £5,000,  but approved of this amendment. This amendment, if it means anything, means an additional exemption, and I cannot square the two arguments. </para>

If in other cases the tax has the effect of bursting up large estates, it will therefore carry out the double object which we told the electors we had in view. We went to the country pledged to an exemption of £5,000, but this amendment means an additional exemption. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Nepean was somewhat unfortunate in comparing Australian conditions with those of England as regards land. In England, there is no such thing as an absolute ownership of land; it is all held there under an old feudal system, by which the rights of the Crown to obtain practically the whole economic value have been preserved for all time. It is not so very long ago, comparatively speaking, that practically all the taxation of that country was raised from land. Under the domination of certain influences that taxation was gradually taken off the land and put on the shoulders of the people as a whole, but those conditions do not apply to Australia. Here, rightly or wrongly, the land is parted with absolutely by the Crown. It may also be said that it is parted with absolutely at pretty well its market value. So far as the greater part of the lands of Australia are concerned, and having regard to the time at which they were taken over, the price put by the Crown on them represented approximately as much as they were likely to bring. In Western Australia the Crown is increasing the value of its lands according as the demand goes, and is very careful to keep it as near as possible to the present requirements of settlement. The Attorney-General would be doing his own cause and party a good service if he simply sat tight and allowed .his battalions to speak by means of their voting, because the last time I heard him refer to the amendment of the honorable member for Fremantle I felt almost under compulsion to reply to what he said. He indicated that the honorable member for Fremantle practically contended in his amendment that once land was parted with by the State the State was not entitled to place any further charges upon it. Nothing could be further from the real contention of the honorable member for Fremantle. It was quite a simple matter for the Attorney-General, having stated the position to suit himself, to proceed to demolish it. The honorable member for Fremantle does not contend that the State has no right to whatever increment may be added to the land subsequently. He merely contends that the price originally paid for the land shall not be regarded as portion of that unearned increment. If the Government are contending for the taxation of the unearned increment, I fail to see how they can, consistently with their own principles and position, refuse to accept the amendment of the honorable member for Fremantle. It will come upon the farming community as somewhat of a shock to learn from the speeches of honorable members on the other side that, apparently, the one form of unearned increment which the Labour party, in this Parliament, at any rate, have any regard for taxing is the unearned increment on land. Undoubtedly, as this principle is extended, and the limit of .£5,000 becomes reduced, as must inevitably happen, those people who are being protected by the exemption will no longer have that advantage. They will begin to realize before very long that the unearned increment, added to their smaller holdings, will be part and parcel of the plan of taxation that is now being adopted in the case of the larger estates. I think that if investigation were made of some of the speeches of the Attorney-General, not perhaps in this House, " but in connexion with debates in which he has taken part in the past, there would be found in his own language the best possible refutation of the contention that we have a right to the unearned increment on land, but not on any other form of wealth. Every individual member of a civilized community obtains, either to his labour or to his capital, the unearned increment added by the general operations of the whole community, and I fail to see, therefore, why the man on the land should be selected as the object of a tax of this kind while the unearned increment in other respects escapes altogether. If the Government had been in earnest in the desire to obtain a percentage of the unearned increment created by this community, they should have applied another kind of tax altogether. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the Attorney-General will not relax in the least his opposition to the amendment. We ought to keep the Bill as it is now. I am surprised to hear the honorable member for Coolgardie trying to persuade the Committee that the Federal Parliament is not endeavouring to raise revenue by means of this tax, although the State Governments do apply land taxes for purely revenue purposes. The principle of this tax is to raise revenue. I distinctly stated that what commended this tax largely to me, amongst other very beneficial effects, was that it would raise a considerable amount of income for purposes of defence, and other necessary works. I therefore say it is to a great extent a revenue Bill. The amendment is dressed up in such a way that at first sight it bears the stamp of equity, but it is not so when you come to analyze it. What will be its effect? How is it to be carried out? The blocks of land that were paid for to the State originally have, in many cases, been split up in a great many ways. Some of them have been absorbed into larger estates. The question as to any particular area of land is, what did the Crown actually receive for it ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not see that it can. Take a block that was sold in Melbourne for £46, and that has since been subdivided in such a way that the original frontage is not in the hands of the present owner. There would be trouble between the Commissioner and the present owner as soon as an attempt was made to fix what the Crown originally got for his holding. Endless difficulties would arise, and such an army of officials and such a large amount of inquiry would be required that it would kill the Bill for any practical purpose. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members say that many of these people have paid £1 an acre for the land. That is hardly a fair way to put it, and I . should not be prepared to give a man an exemption at the rate of £1 an acre, even if the amendment were carried. The Crown in many cases parted with the land nominally at <inline font-style="italic">j£i</inline> an acre, but those who bought it had twenty years' time in which to pay the purchase money. That is practically the same as selling the land at 12s. dd. an acre spot cash. It would therefore not be fair to allow an exemption at the rate of £1 an acre for land purchased under the category of first-class land at a nominal price of £1 an acre, as was the case in Victoria. I agree with the Attorney-General that the money that has been received for the lands of Australia has been re-expended by the States, and that a great majority of the present enhanced values are partly due to that expenditure. The money passed into the Treasury and passed out again for the construction of railways and other works to still further enhance the value of the land. The money was simply transferred to the Treasury, and the value went back to the land, and is still there. The Bill is perfectly fair, but if amendments of this character are inserted it will break down of its own weight. It will be impracticable to put it into active operation, and I believe that that is the object of the Opposition in introducing these specious amendments. </para>

                        <para>- I am willing to put it that way. I believe that what I have stated is the impression which the country as a whole gained, but to-day we are informed that that is not the principle of the Bill at all. It is not a mere " skimming," as the Attorney-General put it, of the community-added value of the land; the principle that underlies the Bill is that of preventing any man in Australia holding more than a certain quantity of land. The amendment of the honorable member for Fremantle - I had already given notice of a similar amendment, which will not, of course, now be moved - is designed to provide that so much of the unimproved value for which the Crown has received full satisfaction should not be taxed. One of the great objections to the tax is its uniform action from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. It falls on land which is eminently suitable for closer settlement, and for the taxation of which there might be some justification, though I am not attempting to justify it. But the penal clauses also apply in the case of land which is in no way suitable for this purpose, for which the Crown has already received full cash value, and which has had no added value given to it since it was sold. No argument has yet been submitted showing that taxation should be imposed on land which is not suitable for closer settlement and which can only be profitably held and worked in large areas. If any honorable member opposite can show any justification for applying the penal clauses to land of that description I am willing to hear him, but I have heard no such argument adduced throughout the whole of the debate. When honorable members have an opportunity to exempt this class of land they should seize it and prevent the penal clauses being applied. If, as it is contended, this tax is also for revenue purposes, surely there are ways and means whereby such land as I have indicated, and city lands, could be taxed on a flat rate, and the penal clauses reserved for the case of lands suitable for closer settlement. I see no reason why that should not be done if it is desired to carry out the mandate which honorable members opposite claim they have from the country. The Government might, at all events, make an honest attempt to exclude these two classes of land. </para>

The land sold in the early days was always the most improved areas in leaseholds, the improvements consisting of houses and outbuildings, fencing, dam making, and so forth; this land was sold by auction, always at high prices, and in some cases at much over the value. At the present day it is almost impossible to say what was the unimproved value. The honorable member for Darling must recollect that when these lands were first put up to auction there were very few farmers in Australia, and that, at any rate, they were not expected to buy land. The sales were with a view to getting money out of the squatters ; the people generally did not know the value of the land, and only men with money could buy. The only person who profited was the " land shark," who always " stood in " to make money. I quite agree with the statement that many of the old' land-owners paid a great deal more for their holdings than they would be able to get for them to-day ; and many of them absolutely ruined themselves through buying at high prices. The money thus raised was spent on the country, and if the expenditure was not wise, it should have been. At the present time, in many cases there is not the slightest indication of the improvements that were made on the land in the very early days. In my own district, for instance, drainage has greatly enhanced land values, though for years and years afterwards the land was too sour for profitable use, and the interest on the purchase was lost during that time. As I say, it is simply ridiculous to suppose that we can now form any idea of the real unimproved value. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; and I think the only fair basis for arriving at the unimproved value is that presented in the amendment, though even that would not, I think, afford much relief. I was rather surprised to hear an honorable member talking about outside lands being productive to the extent of  £30  an acre, because only in very few places can land of. that character be found. The honorable member for Balaclava instanced land at Ballarat, Warrnambool, and other places in Victoria, and I may point to lands at Mount Gambier, and elsewhere, in the south-east portion of South Australia, where such a value per acre might be produced. </para>

                        <para>- That may be; but I was going to point out that it is only now and then that such high production is achieved. After land has been ploughed and produced, perhaps, <inline font-style="italic">£30</inline> an acre, it has to be sown with grass at a cost of at least £1 per acre, and thus left for some years, when again high production may be obtained. I mention this to show that the condition of the land is constantly changing, so that, I suppose, only once in five years or so can these very large crops be grown. My own opinion is, so varying are the conditions, that every part -of the country ought to be regarded differently for the purposes of a measure of this kind. We were told by another honorable member that much of the land was originally sold on credit ; but, as a matter of fact, in the early history of Australia every acre was sold for spot cash ; the price was £1 an acre, and if a man had no money he could get no land. Twenty years after the original sale, £1 an acre was the minimum upset price; and the facts all show that the land-holder is always the one to be penalized. The Government of a State, after selling land at £1 an acre, have sold similar land at 2s. &lt;5d. an acre, thus placing the old land purchasers at a disadvantage of i/s. 6d. Financial institutions, which have advanced money on values on the basis of .£1 an acre, have found the selling (price reduced to 5s. or 2s. 6d ; and to these and similar troubles the land-owners all over Australia have ever been subjected. We know that in the old days the Government used to take from the squatters the "best of the country, with the object of selling it. I recollect well the story of one man riding up to another man's station in South Australia and inviting his neighbour to come and look at his lovely crop of wheat; but the neighbour told him that that crop of wheat would mean the loss of the land. </para>

                        <para>- I am talking about the unimproved value of land. The old owners of land improved their holdings, which were then seized by the Government, and sold at big prices, forcing the pioneers to also pay similar prices if they desired to retain their areas. This Bill is another blow at the landholders of Australia, and every such blow is at development. I hope that this great Federal Parliament will turn their attention to the development of the country, and leave the poor land-owners alone. </para>

                    <para>- - I have been in the chamber only a few minutes, but I have made myself acquainted with the terms of the amendment, which, in my opinion, would practically take away the taxable value of a great part of the land of the country. It would be quite impossible for the Government to accept such a proposal, though I think it a great pity that the taxation has one general effect all over the Commonwealth. Some parts of Australia are much more valuable for agriculture than others, and districts possessing a good rainfall should have been declared agricultural areas. To tax all the land in Australia as if it were of one quality, and had the same rainfall, and were equally suitable for agriculture, is a mistake. The proposal of the honorable member for Fremantle verges on the absurd. In years past land was occasionally sold for a keg of rum. We exempt unimproved values below £5,000, and that surely is a sufficient exemption; it will relieve the most deserving men in the community. I hope that before the Bill is finally disposed of we shall be able to consider the possibility of declaring certain districts to be suitable for agriculture; to treat all alike is bad in principle. I know that it is thought that we cannot discriminate, but it may be possible to get over* that difficulty in some way. If it cannot be got over, there will be great trouble in the future. </para>

                    <para>. The honorable member has not dealt with an objection which I have already raised in regard to the like amendment which was carried in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> It is common in Victoria, and, I think, in other parts of Australia, to subdivide land by leasing it with the right to purchase. This is advantageous both to land-owners and to men without capital to buy land, who are glad to acquire leases and thus earn the capital necessary to purchase freeholds. But under the proposal of the Attorney-General, a land-owner in considering whether he should subdivide on lease with the option of purchase would say, " If I do not do this, I shall be able to deduct the whole value of the improvements on the land, with their mutual benefit to one another, but if I subdivide in leases, the reductions which I can make will be less, and the amount of tax which I shall have to pay will be more.". Where there is separate occupation of parcels of land, the improvements on them are of less value in the aggregate than where the land is all in the hands of one owner. It necessarily follows, therefore, that as soon as a man , puts tenants on his land he at once increases the taxation payable. This is a question upon which I should like to hear the Attorney-General's views. </para>

                        <para>- But, in the opinion of the Government, we have not done wrong. I had the honour to point out to the Committee last evening that it was necessary -that each parcel of land should be dealt with separately in order that all landowners should be treated exactly alike.  I  pointed out that we might distinguish clearly those improvements which add to the unimproved value of a particular block from those which were on that block, and were to be distinguished from the unimproved value, and that that could be done only by treating each block or parcel separately. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that the land on the south side of Bourke-street, from Spring-street to Elizabeth-street, is held in fifty blocks, each worth £10,000, and that the land on the north side is held by one owner, and is worth £500,000. It is perfectly clear that the aggregate unimproved value of the blocks on the south side would be greater than the aggregate unimproved value of the one block on the north side, because there would be deducted from the one block all the improvements that were upon the whole of it, whereas there would be deducted from each of the fifty blocks on the south side only the improvements on that particular block. Now, as the improved value of any one piece of land is the result of improvements made on all "other lands, it follows quite naturally that the amount to be deducted in the one case would be very much less than the amount to be deducted in the other. The principle is perfectly sound. </para>

                    <para>.- I am afraid that I am not quite clear as to the answer which the Attorney-General has given to the position stated by the honorable member for Flinders. The honorable member referred to the subdivision of country properties, whereas the Minister" told us what would be the effect of the Bill on town properties that had already been subdivided. I am assured by representatives of country constituencies that this method of leasing land, with the option of purchase, is, in certain cases, the only means of bringing about subdivisions. </para>

The fact that few of us know very much concerning it is an additional reason why information should be given to the Committee. The honorable member for Flinders urged that the system to which he referred is much in vogue in Victoria and other States, and that it leads to the passing of land from one owner into the hands of many. If I understood the Attorney-General last night, that is the "principle" of this Bill, and I wish to know how the principle will be affected by the position cited by the honorable member for Flinders with regard to country lands. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member perhaps does not realize the importance of this basis of assessment in such a case as I have cited, or in the case of a subdivision. Let us suppose that a man sub divides a large block, not by selling it, but by leasing it in various holdings. The question then arises, how is he to be assessed - on the value of the whole land, less all the improvements on all the land, or upon the value of each allotment, less the improvements on each allotment? The difference is perfectly clear. Let us take the block on which the White Hart Hotel is built. </para>

                        <para>- An inn is a good place from which to start, but, in any event, the principle is the same, whether we deal with country or town lands. The honorable member shakes his head. No doubt the whole synthetic philosophy of Spencer would have been utterly crushed if he had seen that shake of the head, but still the fact remains as I have stated. In the case of the White Hart Hotel we should have to get at the site value, whatever it is, because that is what we are going to tax. The owner would have a right to deduct from the site value all the improvements upon it. Now the site value has been added to by the improvements made, say, by the owners of the Grand Hotel on the adjacent land, by this building of Parliament House, and by all the surrounding buildings, if they are good. The particular site value of a piece of land is increased by the improvements placed on adjacent pieces of land. The site value, or what we call the unimproved value, is nothing more than the value of the sum total of the whole of the improvements made by the community, including, of course, public utilities, such as roads, water, light, and traction. If we take this particular case, and suppose that one man owns the Grand Hotel, the White Hart Hotel, and other adjacent buildings, it is perfectly clear that in assessing the whole block we should not be able to take from each that value that had been added to it by the improvements on each neighbouring block. We should be able to take from the whole only that value which had been added to it by the buildings and improvements outside it. Therefore it is very much to the interests of the large land-owner that he should be assessed on the whole block. For. the sake of argument, let us take a case where a man holding a large station property has cut it up and leased it to forty different tenant farmers. The value of each farm, apart from its productivity, - speaking of it as a site value - lies in the fact that there are improvements on adjacent ground, and that there does attach to each block, although, I admit, not to the same degree as in the case of a town property, a value other than the value which is attached to the particular block under consideration. And if no value has been added to each farm by improvements or any other means, then there can be no difference in the methods of assessment. Therefore, when each particular block is taken by itself, there is less to deduct - there is more unimproved value than there would be if we took a number of blocks added together. </para>

                        <para>- We are dealing, not with municipal rates, but with the effect upon the tax proposed to be imposed. I do not think there can be any doubt that when a particular area is reduced to one hundred holdings, by taxing each block separately a bigger unimproved value is obtained from the general congestion of population and improvements than would be secured if we simply taxed the one owner who had subdivided. If we are to adhere to the strict reading of the Bill, then we may be right in adopting that principle, but from the point of view of expediency it is wrong, because by following it we shall really take away an inducement to subdivide, since the moment an owner began to subdivide his property he would have to pay more taxation. Considering there are few cases of the kind, I prefer that we should not adhere to the strict theory of unimproved value, but that we should allow in these cases the tax to fall on the lower value. I have before me a letter, referring to a case in South Australia, where, by such a subdivision as that indicated, 129 persons have been placed upon land on which previously only two or three resided. They are all lessees, and they are thriving. It is mere pedantry, for the sake of a few more pounds in taxation, to insist on the owner, in a case where there is no true unearned increment, paying the full rate. My impression is that the reason this amendment is introduced is because it has been decided in New South Wales that it is the true principle of taxation under the New South Wales Act. There was a case in the Cooper Estate that went before the Court. Subdivision had taken place, and it was doubtful whether the owner should be taxed allowing him for all the improvements, including roads and houses, or taxed for each block separately. There was a division of opinion upon the point, and the New South Wales Court decided that each block should be taxed separately. We are not obliged to follow that course, and I think, as a matter of expediency, we ought not. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not follow the reasoning of the Attorney-General when he says that the character of the improvements upon a block gives an added site value to the adjoining block. If that be so, how comes it that the site on which the White Hart Hotel stands, in Spring-street, is worth only, say, one-half, of the site value of a block in Swanston-street? It is not the character of the building at all. There may be a worse building and less improvements on the site in Swanston-street. </para>

He is perfectly right, but I contend that the man is entitled to an exemption under the Bill for all that improvement. I should think it would depend on whether he had provided those facilities himself, or whether the State provided' them. </para>

                        <para>- How can it be a community-created value, since it arises from nothing but what the individual has done himself in making the road or breaking up the block ?  The value is the same in each case, until the man himself decides to break it up. The moment he breaks it up, and provides facilities, people want to go there to build, and so the increment goes on, but the increment is of the man's own creation. It is an increment of improvement pure and simple on the whole  block,  and there is no community-created value in it. Before there could be any community-created value, the State must have purchased from the individual the land over which the roads are made, and spent State money on them, but so long as the man divides his own private estate, and, by providing greater facilities for people to go there, increments the value of his estate, it seems to me that it belongs to him just as much as it did before. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; but on the other hand, if it were not subdivided, it might not be worth anything, even if there were 1,000,000 people round it. It is availability and accessibility to the people that create the value for business and .other sites. In this case, the value is created by the man himself on his own private estate. It is a different thing where the State resumes land and makes roads through it.  I  admit that, then, whatever the State does in providing facilities creates an increment in the value of the sites; but my point is that in these blocks the increment in value belongs to the man, since he himself has created it by providing facilities for access to the blocks. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Angas stated that the principle of the amendment is perfectly correct, but the honorable member for Parramatta does not agree to the application of it, although he sees the difference in the two methods of assessment. The only difference he has is as to whether, where a man owns a block upon which there are many parcels or divisions, the benefit of each of the improvements on all the blocks other than on his own particular parcel should go to him, or whether he should be treated as if he were the owner of only that one parcel. The honorable and learned member for Flinders said he thought that this amendment would not help subdivision, or, in effect, that to treat the man who had a big block differently from a number of persons who owned separate portions of the block, did not make for subdivision. But it does. In the list of amendments to be moved by the Government the honorable member will find that in sub-clause 3 a parcel is defined so that every part of a holding which' is separately held by any occupier, tenant, lessee, or owner shall be deemed to be a separate parcel. That means that if  a  man subdivides, as we want subdivision, that is, if he parts with the fee-simple, or leases for a term of years in such a way that the lessee has a taxable interest, then he does get a distinct benefit from the subdivision, and only fails to get a benefit from the subdivision when he does not subdivide. What we desire is not to create an increased number of tenants, but an in: creased number of land-holders. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable member, and under the Bill it is provided that if a transfer is accompanied by only 15 per cent, of the purchase-money or even by less than 15 per cent., if the Commissioner is satisfied that the transfer is <inline font-style="italic">bond fide,</inline> it is a division within the meaning of the Act, and exempts both the transferor and the transferee. </para>

                        <para>- Where there is no immediate transfer, naturally this proposal will not prevent subdivision, but the honorable member spoke of it as preventing subdivision. On the contrary, it is a direct incentive to subdivision. The more the owner subdivides the smaller his tax becomes, not merely (actually and in the aggregate, but also proportionately on each block he retains. The point, then, is whether the man has a right to exemption for these improvements. I submit that he has not. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think the Attorney-General has quite grasped the meaning of the speech of the honorable member for Flinders. I know of numerous cases where the tenant or share farmer has become the owner. In the Hopetoun and Sealake districts of the Mallee over 500 men are now owners of the land, who started there with scarcely a shilling. They own their properties now, but they would have had no chance of becoming land-holders had it not been for the leasing or share system. On the Nerrin estate, near Streatham, belonging to the trustees of the late J. Macpherson, the land has been dealt with in much the same way. One farmer who came down from the Mallee in 1904, after being starved out of his other place by bad seasons, and having only his team of horses and his implements, took up 640 acres on the share system on that estate, with the right of purchase. He told me recently that out of his first crop he was enabled to pay his deposit on the land, and now had the land free of debt. That was in six years, and I believe the land is worth <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> an acre. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The Attorney-General's amendment is all right as regards town properties. I see nothing unfair in it in that regard, but it is different when you come to country properties and improvements. Suppose a man has 5, 000 acres of land which is valued as a whole. Take the value of the improvements off, and the balance represents the unimproved value. If, however, he lets that land in ten farms of 500 acres each. he will be allowed only for his improvements on the one block on which he dwells himself. For each of the other nine blocks that he has let he gets no exemption, because there are on them no improvements worth speaking of. Therefore, the whole of his allowance for improvements will be on what may be called the homestead block. What inducement is there to a man to let his land to tenant farmers with the option of purchase if he is going to be taxed at a higher scale that if he retains it all himself? That is the whole point of the honorable member for Flinders. The Attorney-General says that if these men put down 15 per cent, they can become owners. I have some properties, and some very good men working for me, and I have said to them, " As soon as you save .£100, and buy plant, I shall give you 100 acres without any deposit." If these men had to pay me <inline font-style="italic">£</inline> 100 or ^£150 as a deposit, they would not have any money with which to buy their working plant, whereas, under such terms as I offer they can set to work, and out of their first crop provide the deposit. There ought not to be any compulsory percentage so long as the transaction is <inline font-style="italic">bond fide.</inline> Of course, if there is dummying or fraud, let the offenders be punished ; but people who are acting <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> ought to be encouraged. The allowance for improvements should extend over the whole block, * whether it be leased or" not, because, otherwise settlement to a great extent will be prevented. So long as the tax is paid over the whole 5,000 acres, the Government will not lose anything; they will receive exactly the same tax whether one man or ten men occupy the land. On the other hand, if this increased tax be put on the owner, he will take care not to settle people. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Balaclava has been dealing with a matter which more properly falls under a later clause. Any transfer which the Commissioner is satisfied is <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> is a subdivision which will relieve both the vendor and the buyer from the tax, unless, of course, the value be ,£5,000, and over, in which case the buyer pays the tax. There can be no possible question as to the effect of this clause. The honorable member for Balaclava says he has offered to put men on the land so long as they put down £100 to show their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides.</inline></para>

I am not going to bother about people who do not exercise their option ; but if a lessee does so, and pays ever so little down to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, both he and the former lessor escape the tax. At the present time, settlers must effectively occupy the land, and fulfil certain conditions. The honorable member for Bendigo, a little while ago, spoke of dummying; but that offence was rampant at one time. Are we to allow make-believe transfer to take the place of <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> subdivision ? Under the Bill, the subdivision must be such as to satisfy the Commissioner; and we do not desire lessees afraid to exercise their option, but men prepared to. go on the soil, and to occupy it. </para>

                    <para>.- If the Attorney-General is anxious to encourage the class of settlement that he says this clause is designed to promote, he will provide something in the place of the transfer in respect to tenants. Throughout the mallee country, a large proportion of the people have gone on to the land under an arrangement with the landlord, with an accompanying agreement giving the option of purchase. The honorable member for Flinders, in the first instance, raised this question in order that no impediment should be placed in the way of tenants becoming proprietors of the land they are cultivating. </para>

                        <para>- The period might be anything from two to five years; but under the Victorian Act the lease was regarded as equivalent to a transfer for the purpose of separate occupation; the moment the lessee obtained the right of purchase at a fixed rate he was regarded by the Crown as to all intents and purposes the owner of the land ; and in the. course of five years he could select as a freeholder. I shall not discuss the question of city properties, because I believe there is a certain amount of justice in the contention of the Attorney-General that every piece of city property, in relation to improvements, should be assessed separately. In the case of large estates, however, some such amendment as I have suggested should be made, so as to enable the cultivator to secure enough money to pay the first deposit. That is what we are aiming at, and it can be accomplished by placing no bar or impediment between the present owner of the land and the future lessees and proprietors. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the Attorney-General will disabuse his mind of any idea that we on this side are actuated by a spirit of factious opposition, or with any desire to raise quibbles. What we are discussing now is the very heart of the Bill, the object of which is to secure subdivision. The Attorney-General is prepared to allow transfer in the case of an absolute purchase, when 15 per cent., at least, of the purchase money has been paid, the balance to be provided at reasonable periods. There is another way, however, by which a chance may be given to the poorest man. When this Bill becomes law a great many of the biggest estates in the Commonwealth cannot continue to exist and to pay the tax ; and, therefore, the owner will at once look around to discover the best means of disposing of them, or, at least, of a large portion. </para>

                        <para>- It is an absolute fact ; we all admit on this side that, with such a big impost, there is going to be subdivision. But the Attorney-General by his proposal is placing a bar in the way of that object. The honorable gentleman proposes the one method of immediate sale, but there is the other method, which will be largely availed of, namely, the leasing of the land with the absolute right of purchase in a given time. I ask the Government to protect themselves in every respect, and not to fix the period at snore than six years, having satisfied themselves that there is a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> registered agreement to lease at a reasonable rental, with the right of purchase, not at a fictitious value, but at a value which will satisfy the "Commissioner. The Government, if they believe in encouraging subdivision, ought to impose the most favorable conditions ; and the suggestion made on this side will assist the very poorest of industrious men who desire to go on the land. To require a deposit of 15 per cent, would deprive such men of the money necessary to buy plant and stock; and we desire to assist those who, with little or no cash, may have strong muscle, and, possibly, a useful family of boys. In nine cases out of ten, suitable men would be able to exercise their right of purchase at the end of six years. To encourage the holders of big estates to subdivide, we should bring estates such as I have referred to under the most favorable conditions. </para>

                    <para>.- I understand that it is intended to bring the Bill into line with the decision in the case of the <inline font-style="italic">New South Wales Commissioner of Taxes</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Cooper,</inline> of which I do not understand the justice. It was there held that a proprietor who had cut up his land, separating it into parcels divided by roads, was taxable on the added value resulting from the subdivision. The value of the land had increased, not in virtue of public betterment or unearned increment; but merely by the action of the owner in dedicating part of his land to the public for loads. The contention of the honorable member for Flinders is that we should make such exceptions as will promote subdivision in accordance with the policy of the measure. If a man divides his land into parcels by making roads through it, we should not tax him on the increased value which thereby results. </para>

                    COOK (Parramatta) {4.20]. - It seems to me that the proposal before us takes away the incentive to subdivide. In the case just referred to by the honorable member for Bendigo, the result of the subdivision was to increase the value of the property from £80,000 to £240,000. It might happen that a man possessing a block worth £50,000 might subdivide it by making roads through it, and thus eventually increase its value to £150,000. If the land were subdivided into thirty blocks, all of which were sold, the original owner would have no tax to pay ; but he might be able to sell only ten blocks before the increment increased, in which case he would have twenty blocks on his hands, and his taxation would be increased from £440 to £1,593.

                    <para>.- I understand from the definition of " parcel " that if any part of a holding is occupied separately at the time of an assessment, it must be separately assessed. Now, it is a common thing in the country for a land-owner to let one or more paddocks for several months. He has never had these paddocks measured, and, consequently, does not know whether they contain 50 or 55 acres, 100 or 120 acres. Consequently, it will be impossible for him to correctly describe them separately for the purposes of assessment. </para>

                    <para>.- We have already provided that in the case of an absentee the taxable value is the total sum of the unimproved value of each parcel of land owned by him. Now we are enacting that every part of a holding separately held by any occupier, tenant, or owner shall be deemed a separate parcel. It is not defining what parcels are, but saying that certain holdings shall be deemed parcels. There may be " parcels " other than these holdings. A man might cut up a large estate into, say, eighty allotments, ten of which he might sell. The others would be marked out on the plans as separate parcels of land, but would they be regarded as separate parcels, or as one parcel? Then, again, it is not uncommon in a country district for a man to permit his neighbours to make a road of access through his property, which may not benefit him, and really divides his holding into two parcels ; would that increase his taxation? </para>

                        <para>- No; what I said was that this clause, without limiting the ordinary meaning of " parcels," defines what a parcel is for the purposes of this measure. I take it to be perfectly clear that when for the purposes of any Act a term is defined and the general meaning of the term is inconsistent with that special definition, then the special definition must prevail. If a block were cut in two merely by the running of a road through it, it is clear that it would be one parcel although cut into two parts. In the case of the particular block to which the honorable member for Richmond has referred, it does not matter whether it is or is not usually described as a parcel. For the purposes of this Bill it will be a parcel whether it is, in fact, made up of several parcels or whether there is one deed or many conveying the whole. </para>

                    <para>.- I have in mind a parcel of land which care easily be described for the purposes of assessment. As the owner of that parcel, however, I have leased for a term of six months a portion consisting of 50 acres or thereabouts in the centre of it. I cannot say what is the exact area leased, because I have never surveyed it; but if on the 1st July the tenancy is in force, I understand that under this definition the area so leased will be a parcel separately held. I desire to know how I, as the owner of the whole block, am to describe for the purposes of assessment that separate holding within it? </para>

                    <para>. - The answer is perfectly simple. The honorable member would not describe it at all, for the good and sufficient reason that it is inconceivable that a six months' lease in respect of 50 acres of land could be a taxable interest within the meaning of this Bill. The interest would be a negligible one. If the honorable member had built 100 houses on a suburban block, he would not have to describe the size of each allotment. All that the Commissioner would desire to know would be the value of the block and how that value had been arrived at. The area of 50 acres which the honorable member referred to would not appear in the assessment. </para>

The Attorney-General said that if a man did not sell all the blocks in a subdivision that he had made, his holding would still be regarded as one block. That subdivision might ultimately increase the value three times over, and according to <inline font-style="italic">Cooper's</inline> case the owner would find that he had to pay three times more tax than he had to pay before. </para>

                        <para>- At a sacrifice. The honorable member knows that subdivisions sometimes take years to get off. The case that I put was one in which the increment, as the result of subdivision, was threefold. What man is going to sub divide his land when he may find himself taxed on the increment which has been added to land of which he is unable to dispose? I pointed to" a case in which an estate valued at £50,000 had, by subdivision, incremented to £150,000. The owner might be able to dispose of only one-third of the land before the increment increased, so that taxation payable by him would be three times as much' as he had to pay on the original holding. That is the case I put, and I contend that under this proposal the honorable gentleman is going to defeat the very object of his Bill, which is to induce subdivision. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has just cited such a case. He spoke of the case of an estate valued at £50,000 being subdivided, with the result that its value is increased threefold, and the owner receives for one-third of it as much as the whole was worth prior to subdivision. The honorable member says that that is the sort of thing that discourages subdivision. I wish I could secure such a chance. I  know of nothing more calculated to encourage a man to subdivide his estate than the prospect of his getting as much for one-third of it as the whole is worth. What is more to the point is that the honorable member says that the remaining two-thirds would be worth as much per foot as the one-third which had been sold, so that the owner would get £3 for every £1, and all that he would be asked to pay by way of penalty, at the outside would be the added amount of taxation on the two-thirds which he could not sell. He would already have in his breeches' pocket as much money as the whole of his estate was worth before subdivision, and two-thirds of the estate would still be in his possession to sell at the same profit. It is this diabolical amendment of the Government that proposes to enable the landlords of this country to recoup themselves in this princely and extravagant fashion at the community's expense which is denounced as a foe to subdivision. No finer testimonial was ever given by any Opposition to a. measure put forward by a Government. </para>

                        <para>- Let us say that the objects are taxation and the bursting up of estates. I have heard very little about taxation from honorable members opposite until now. The main objective has been closer settlement. If closer settlement is desired, we should give every inducement to people to subdivide their estates as quickly as possible, and if the Bill did not come into force for a reasonable time, it would give those who have large estates an opportunity to subdivide and promote closer settlement. The only objection, therefore, to the amendment is from the revenue point of view. I do not speak with absolute knowledge, but I think it is very unusual for taxation Bills to be retrospective. All sorts of interests are involved when you go back from the time at which you are legislating. We certainly should not go back to the  1st  of July, seeing that the Bill was not introduced until long after that date, and, I suppose, will not be passed until some time in October. If we make the present holders pay the tax for the current year, there will be no inducement to them to subdivide their lands until towards the time when the tax becomes due again next year. If it were known that the tax would not be imposed if the lands were subdivided quickly, it would be a great incentive to people to subdivide. The purchaser, of course, would know that he would have to pay the tax if the unimproved value was over £5,000. There is no doubt that the main reason for the introduction of the measure is to burst up large estates and give facilities for the closer occupation of land. I understand from honorable members opposite that if they could by one stroke take away all the revenue out of this Bill, and have closer settlement, they would feel that they had achieved their object. I heard one honorable member say that if they had not settled the land difficulty and brought about closer settlement within three years their work would have been a failure. Of course, this Bill is ostensibly a Tax Bill. There is nothing about closer settlement in it, for the very good reason that it is an attempt to invade an arena that does not belong to us. It is not possible to put in the Bill a statement that it is intended to deal with land settlement or land occupation. Even if it were only a revenue Bill there would be no justification for making it retrospective. The result of my amendment, if carried, would be that only half the year's tax would be collected. </para>

                    <para>. - The object of the amendment, according to the right honorable member's own statement, is to enable land-owners to make what dispositions they may wish during the next few months, and allow their liability to begin only on the first day of the new year, A new clause which the Government propose to introduce in effect gives land-owners three months' grace. It provides that anybody who has sold his land up to the 30th day of September shall not be assessed for this year, notwithstanding that on the 30th day of June he was liable under the Bill. Consequently, practically what the right honorable member desires is provided for by the Government, because a person who has <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> disposed of his estate up to the 30th day of September will not be liable for assessment for the current year. In the circumstances, the right honorable member might not press the amendment, as the Government cannot accept it, and their own amendment does, in essentials, what he wishes to do. </para>

                        <para>- That is not retrospective taxation, but merely providing for a basis ; while here it is proposed to tax a man on land he held. The object of the Bill is to effect the subdivision of estates, and an owner ought to be given the chance to subdivide so as to escape the burden of taxation. The hope that has been expressed all through is not that land-holders will pay this heavy taxation, but that they will subdivide their lands so as to promote greater settlement. We are told that the taxation is only incidental. </para>

                    <para>.- What was done in South Australia might in one sense be termed retrospective ; that is, the tax was imposed as from the  1st  January, as the honorable member for Swan now suggests, of the next ensuing year, but it was collected at the full rate of a whole year. Taxpayers, however, did not get the advantage of half-a-year, owing to the fact that, though the next time the tax became due was in the succeeding January, it was paid for the financial year ending in June. Perhaps the honorable member for Swan had in view the making of the financial year, for the purposes of this Bill, from January to January. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment will do something, but not exactly what has been slated. As the honorable member for Darling Downs has suggested, the Bill is in one sense retrospective - in other words, we are taxing men who are not owners of the land at the time of the passing of the Bill. Can we legally do this? I draw attention to this only as a matter of drafting for the consideration of the Attorney-General. By way of illustration, I point out that clause 9 imposes a tax on land owned by the taxpayer, and <inline font-style="italic">prima facie,</inline> that means land owned on the date when this Bill comes into force, because taxation must not be assumed to be retrospective unless there are clear words to that respect. Then we have the clause before us which speaks of land owned on the  30th  June, and also clause  14  to a similar effect. Who Is the taxpayer ? The man whom we can tax ; and I do not think the Court would hold that we could tax a man who did not own the land at that date. </para>

The effect of the amendment seems to be that the full results of the tax will be gained throughout the year, except so far as subdivision takes place up to the  1st  January. </para>

                    <para>. - Seeing that the object of the measure is to burst up large estates, and to bring about closer settlement; the Government, with a view to inducing subdivision, should not curtail the period within which advantage may be taken of the concession provided for in the amendment just moved by the Attorney-General. It must be remembered that the Bill was not introduced until after the beginning of the financial year, and that we are now within two days of the 30th September, so that this concession cannot become known, and cannot be taken advantage of, unless the date is extended. Nothing will be lost by extending the period during which it will be available, except a slight amount of revenue. We hear on all sides that subdivision is necessary, but why offer an inducement to subdivide which is to have effect only until the 30th of this month, so that it will expire before it can become known? I should like the opportunity to take advantage of the provision to be extended to the end of: the financial year; but in any case it should be extended until the end of the calendar year. I, therefore, move - </para>

                    <para>.- The Attorney-General is to be congratulated upon the proposition now before the Committee, but the time within which the concession offered may be taken advantage of should be extended as suggested by the honorable member for Swan. . If the concession expires on the 30th September - that is, two days hence - land-owners will not know of it, and will not, in any case, be able to take advantage of it. There may be a slight loss of revenue if the time is extended, but, as the desire of the Government is to encourage subdivision, it should not spoil the effect of the proposal now under discussion by making it impossible for land-owners to take advantage of it. I hope that the extension of time proposed will be agreed to. </para>

                    <para>. - Assuming that the Government adopt the principle suggested by the honorable member for Balaclava, it can be embodied in the Bill by the addition of the words at the end of the clause, " For the purposes of this section 'sale' includes 'partition.'" I agree with the merits of the proposition, but wish now to point out how the drafting of this provision will work. The Attorney-General said that a man might sell portion of his land, and it seems to me that, so far as subdivisions and sales are concerned, this is a very fair provision, because, in respect of the portions sold, the tax will be imposed on the lower rate. As regards the part not sold, however, the effect of the drafting is, I believe, that the owner will pay on the rate determined by the whole area. He will not pay the sum total of the tax over the whole area, but a rate to be determined by that on the whole area. </para>

                    <para>. - The reason is that it would mean a distinct and very valuable concession, and one that, in its practical operation, would have obvious limitations. The Commissioner will have to be satisfied that a sale is <inline font-style="italic">bond fide,</inline> and I am afraid that if this period were extended so as to take in the whole of the year, so many applications would be made under this provision that, although I look at the matter from an entirely philosophical stand-point, the Treasurer could not afford to do so. It would be impossible to determine the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of every sale if the whole nation, so to speak, applied for a remission of taxation under this proviso. I take it that we have allowed for a fair and reasonable period. In another part of the Bill we deal specially with leases, mortgages, and marriage settlements, and I think that, in the circumstances, we cannot go any further. </para>

                    <para>.- Perhaps the best course to pursue would be to determine that this clause shall cease to operate on the day on which this Bill becomes law. The Bill may become law at any time within the next month or two, and the course I have suggested seems an easier way of dealing with the matter than would be the fixing of any special date. I can see some reason for fixing upon the 30th June as the date of ownership, so that the tax may be collected .in respect of this year; but in the amendment now before us the Minister is making a concession in order to prevent hardships occurring to persons who <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> wish to divide their land and so- carry out what I conceive to be the first principle of the Act. People should be given every opportunity  to <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> divide their land up to the date on which the Bill becomes law. The moment the Governor-General's assent is given to this measure it will become law, and then the general provisions of the Act may very well apply to all classes of property. </para>

                    <para>.- In view of the statement made by the Attorney-General that he will amend the clause when the Bill is recommitted, I suggest to him the substitution for the words " at noon on ' ' the  30th  day of June, the words  ' at the close of business" on the  30th  day of June. A practical authority who has had a good deal to do with land taxation matters states that the words to which I take exception will probably lead to trouble, and he suggests the amendment indicated. Although this clause has been adopted from the New Zealand Act, I am assured that in practical operation the fixing of ownership as at noon on the  30th  day of June will make for trouble. In any case, it will involve the Commissioner possibly in some complications regarding time, and as it is now too late for me to move an amendment, I suggest to the Government that when the Bill is recommitted they should consider the advisableness of making this alteration. </para>

                        <para>- The Commissioner must guard against that sort of thing. It seems to me that although the Attorney-General said yesterday that the object of this Bill was to bring about the subdivision of land, he is afraid that if we extend the date in the proviso to the  31st  December too many subdivisions will take place. I fail to see why any date should be named. If a person honestly subdivides his property and portion of it is purchased by others, why should not the amount of his taxation be reduced and be chargeable proportionately to the new owners? </para>

                        <para>- If I have a large estate and find that I must either reduce it or pay this tax, why should I be discouraged when I propose to subdivide it? The object of the Government, I understand, is to compel the owner of a large estate, not to pay this tax, but to subdivide his property. </para>

                    <para>. - The words the honorable member proposes to strike out are very necessary. Yesterday, we discussed for hours the insertion of words to make the purpose of a clause quite clear. These words make the purpose of this clause quite clear, but apparently the honorable member does not desire that. The sale has to be <inline font-style="italic">bond fide,</inline> but for what purpose? It must not be for the purpose of evading the Act. There can be no possible objection to retaining the words. The honorable member ought to give a concrete illustration showing how their retention would be harmful. If he could do that, I should be glad to strike them out, but he must provide us with a case. The sale must be <inline font-style="italic">bond fide,</inline> and not to evade the purpose of the Bill, which is to tax a big holding at a higher rate than a small holding. If the subdivision is to evade the tax, and not for the purpose of a <inline font-style="italic">bonâ fide</inline> subdivision, the owner ought not to get the advantage of it. </para>

The words seem to be surplusage, and as we are trusting absolutely to the , discretion of a Commissioner, whose <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> is to be final, it might be safer to leave them out.

                    <para>.- I do not think it matters much whether we keep the words in or leave them out. The Privy Council decided, in Sims' case - a South Australian case - that where a man makes a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> arrangement with his family for the purpose of escaping the liability for the tax, it is not an evasion of the tax, but a perfectly legitimate operation. In South Australia, two Judges held otherwise, and the case went to the Privy Council, which sustained the judgment of the Chief Justice of South Australia, as I think is invariably the case. As this proviso only applies until  30th  September, I do not think it matters whether we keep the words in or not. I can quite appreciate the anxiety of the honorable member for Moreton that no injustice should be done, but I do not think we can conceive of any case in Australia of an estate having been sold now with a view to repurchase after the  30th  September. In any case, the proviso applies only to this year. If it were an annual thing, the words would be clearly necessary, because there might be a sale at the end of the year with a view to repurchase after the  30th  June, thus enabling the owners to escape the incidence of the higher rate. The word "evade " would be applicable in such case; but, this being a saving provision, I do not see that it matters whether the words are kept in or not. </para>

                        <para>- The Commissioner will put his own construction on the words without any regard as to how we intended them to apply. He may say that a sale effected after the 30th June has been with the object of evading the provisions of the Bill, and he will throw the onus of proof on the owner. If the Commissioner is satisfied that a sale is <inline font-style="italic">bond fide,</inline> that should be quite sufficient for the Government; and the deletion of the words would be a safeguard against misunderstanding. I do not desire to cross swords with the Attorney-General on the matter ; but I am asking for an amendment which cannot prove detrimental to the Bill and which will make the clause very much clearer. </para>

                    <para>.- Does the Attorney-General attach any great importance to the words" ending on the thirtieth day of June " ? I happen to know of some <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> sales made prior to that date, but they will hardly be regarded as sales under the Bill, seeing that the 15 per cent. provided for in clause 32 was not made. It is very customary to pay a small deposit, and, though the sale actually dates from that time, delivery does not take place until later, in order to allow time to get rid of the stock and so forth. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. As to what the honorable member for Angas has said, I think that " public authority " will cover a trust formed for carrying on tramways, as in Adelaide. The words clearly cover the Harbor Trust of New South Wales, the Metropolitan Board of Works of Melbourne, the Water and Sewerage Board in Sydney, and all municipal bodies. If we were to insert the word " Trust," does the honorable member for Angas think that the provision would be made any clearer, as applying to the Tramway Trust in Adelaide ? I am perfectly willing to insert the word ; but I think the Trust is covered by the clause. </para>

                        <para>- Section  114  of the Constitution provides that the Commonwealth shall not impose a tax on property of any kind belonging to a State, and that provision includes municipalities. A State cannot delegate to a subordinate body any powers it does not possess itself - it cannot delegate any authority excepting by virtue of the authority possessed by itself. Anything that a municipality does directly, or indirectly, and anything that a State does, directly or indirectly, must be done by virtue of its public authority; and, therefore, I take it that if we did not insert any words in the Bill, we could not tax a municipality as a corporate entity, or any of its subordinate bodies, such as Boards or Trusts. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that we need trouble about the position of tramway companies, but  I  should like to point out that, in our dry districts, a number of water trusts, created by Act of Parliament, own water channels and adjoining land. There is such a trust at Ballarat. I am not sure that such  a  trust could be called either a municipal, local, or public authority, so I ask the Attorney-General to consider their position, and, if he does not think that they are covered by the paragraph, to recommit the clause. </para>

                    <para>. - In my opinion, the meaning of the paragraph is perfectly clear. If an honorable member wishes to know whether any particular body is or is not covered, he has only to ask himself whether it is a public authority. Is there, outside the Broken Hill Company, any private authority supplying water in Australia? Whether the authorities controlling a water supply are termed a board or a trust, they are exempt from taxation. The provision has been inserted merely to make the intention of the measure clearer, but I doubt whether, even without it, the bodies referred to could be taxed. </para>

                    <para>.- This is a fitting time to determine whether the property of mutual building societies should be exempt from taxation. These societies are registered under State laws, and are kindred to friendly societies, about the desirability of whose exemption there will be hardly any doubt. They are established to encourage thrift, and to assist the working classes in obtaining homes of their own. They do not declare dividends, but under the amendment as it stands their property would be liable to taxation at a high" rate. When they make advances, they are registered as the absolute proprietors of the securities. A man who borrows from one of these societies to purchase a freehold allows it to register the property in its name, his only title being a deed of defeasance. These societies will, I think, unless specially protected, be liable to taxation on the aggregation of the properties which they hold in trust for various borrowers ; but that is scarcely the desire of the Government. The tax would fall on the thrifty, and could have no effect in bursting up large estates. </para>

                        <para>. - With the object that the honorable member for Herbert has in view, I am entirely in sympathy ; but am not quite clear as to the extent to which the amendment would go. The honorable member has omitted from the amendment of which he originally gave notice the words, " and from the operations of which no individual or company derives profit." With those words, its application was clear ; but, as it stands, I do not think that it is. In clause 37, we provide that members of a mutual life assurance society shall be separately assessed, and the mutual principle, I understand, in its application to a life assurance company means that the profits are divided amongst the individual members of it. Starr-Bowkett societies, which my honorable friend has in mind, are admirable institutions; but they are subject to some practical disabilities. As some honorable members seem to be busily engaged in explaining something to each other, it appears to be useless to explain to the Committee the position that the Government take up. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps it is because the honorable member does not care to listen to our dulcet tones. If we are to exempt building societies carried on under cooperative principles, why should we not exempt all co-operative societies? I am personally interested in a co-operative society, but do not desire, at all events at present, that such societies shall be exempt. If the enterprise and industry displayed by a man in becoming a member of a building society are to be recognised by exemption from this tax, then it seems to me to be a very small addition to the principle to exempt all co-operative societies. I fail to see why only co-operative societies relating to the building trade should be exempt when the same principle is followed in connexion with all co-operative concerns. At present the amendment appears to me altogether too wide, and possibly the honorable member for Herbert does not care to explain its far-reaching effects. Since we are completely in the dark as to what is intended, we may reasonably term the amendment dangerous until some further explanation is made. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the honorable member for Herbert will press his amendment. We are told that the New Zealand Act is an excellent model, and that we should follow it. Under that Act all land held by any building society duly registered under any Act relating to building societies is exempt, and it is declared that the annual or other dividends or profits paid or credited to any member or shareholder of any such society shall be deemed to be part of his income, and be taxable accordingly. Building societies which are carrying on operations in Australia are subject, in some cases, either to the dividend duty tax or income tax. The exemption proposed by the honorable member for Herbert and the honorable member for Bendigo embodies exactly what is done in New Zealand. It is a fair and reasonable exemption to make on its merits, because building societies are co-operative companies. </para>

                        <para>- The properties which they technically own may be held to be their property, and subject to taxation. This is a class of investment and organization that we do not want to tax. The honorable member for Herbert knows that on the Darling Downs large numbers of people have been able to get their homes through the agency of these purely cooperative building societies, who, without them, would not have been able to get their own homes at all. The real object of the Bill, as the honorable member for Coolgardie put it, is to tax land so as to enable people to become owners of their own homes. If the Government include, as the subjects of taxation, the very institutions which enable people to get their own homes, they will cut right across the very principle of their own legislation. This matter is important, because in a case decided in New South Wales - <inline font-style="italic">The Commissioners of Taxation</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">St. Joseph's Investment and Building Society</inline> - it was held that the respondent society were the mortgagees in possession of a large number of parcels of land which had been mortgaged to them by different mortgagors, and that the society, being mortgagee in possession, and not a bare trustee of different estates, was entitled to only one deduction on the aggregate value of all the parcels of land. The building societies should be entirely exempt from the provisions of this Bill. No advantage is to be gained, and no big estates will be burst up, by taxing them. On the contrary, the Commonwealth will be taking revenue from the very contributions paid to the societies which enable people to get their own homes. They are the small investors, who should be helped, and not discouraged. I can understand the Attorney-General saying that he does not know how far the proposed amendment will go, but if the words were put in it would be easy to recommit the Bill, and technically define them. None of us want to put in words that will leave the measure too open. We want to keep companies that are not <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> out of it. I hope the Attorney-General will see his way to grant the exemption asked for. </para>

                    <para>. - The object of the Government is to make the exemptions cover every case that ought properly to be exempted. There are building societies and similar institutions that ought not to come under the operation of the Bill, but the question is to what extent the amendment will open the door to others. The honorable member for Melbourne has given notice of an amendment to tax building societies generally to the extent of only half the amount. On the face of it, that is a proposition to which we could not readily assent. On the whole, I think it is far better to exempt them altogether, or to tax them. With regard to societies that are mutual in their nature, like a mutual life association, we have provided, without exempting them in set terms, that each person shall be assessed separately, the practical effect, of course, being that they are exempt. Whether it would be advisable to include all other mutual societies carrying on business on a mutual basis in the same or a similar class, is a matter which I should like to have an opportunity of considering. I should be glad if the honorable member will give me an opportunity to look into the matter, with a view to putting all building and other societies conducted on a mutual principle, on the same footing, where it can be safely done without jeopardizing the interests of the Bill. The matter ought to be looked into. I say candidly that the intention of the Government is not to tax any interest which makes for thrift and for the better distribution of land. It is, in fact, the very contrary. At the same time, there are some of these StarrBowkett societies promoted for various purposes, such as providing a manager with a billet, or giving work to conveyancers, and so on; but, generally speaking, I think it is entirely desirable to exempt building societies. I shall be glad if the honorable member will withdraw the amendment, and allow us to deal with .the matter generally on the recommittal of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - The Committee would be saved a great deal of time if we could, at this early stage, make a distinction. The Attorney-General now says that the Government are prepared to wholly admit the desirability of encouraging thrift through genuine mutual co-operative organizations. The difficulty, as he has pointed out, is that many of these organizations or associations are started with a mutual principle, but also with another principle present, by which profits are derived from them by individuals. I could name insurance companies which have the word "mutual " in their title, but from which certain men are receiving large profits. The word " mutual" may be used as an attraction to the public to operate through these organizations, although I do not say it is so. I have every sympathy with the thrift side of these organizations, and with every association that is formed to enable people of small means to help one another by cooperative methods, in the form of friendly societies, insurance companies, or building societies, towards a little saving of their means or earnings ; but I should be against including any organizations in the exemption which have underneath them a profit being drawn by promoters or proprietors. The amendment which the honorable member for Herbert proposed contained, in its first form, but not in its ultimate form, words which saved the situation in that regard, because it provided that no profits should be derived by individuals promoting the organization. The Committee seems to he of one mind on the whole question, and it simply remains for the Attorney-General to shape a provision, either by additions to clause  37,  or by another clause, by which all mutual associations shall be absolved from the tax, provided there are no profits being derived. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily. I can tell the honorable member of many companies which are quite free from any but mutual profits, and of one, at least, very large insurance company in Australia which is supposed to be conducted on mutual principles, but from which very large dividends are being paid to the originators in the form of a commission on the management. If the honorable member looks into some of the great American organizations for insurance purposes, he will find that there are what are called founders' shares, by which immense profits have been derived by these so-called mutual societies for individuals, who have grown extremely rich by using the innocent and alluring word " mutual " for the purpose of drawing the public in. The Attorney-General could save a lot of time and discussion if he undertook to frame a clause which would recognise the merits of the purely mutual form of association, and exclude the other kind which I have mentioned. </para>

                    <para>.- I have no objection to adopting the suggestion of the Attorney-General. In moving the amendment I had my mind specially directed to Starr-Bowkett societies, and no others. I did not include the societies referred to by the honorable member for Darling Downs. I know of them, and have been a shareholder myself, but they are of such a character that individuals do derive a profit. In StarrBowkett societies there is no profit for any individual, nor for .the society as a society. There are no actual profits other than what may be derived from fines or sales of books of rules, and so on. This goes for managerial expenses, and the secretary is the only one who has anything out of it. That cannot be said to be a profit. </para>

                        <para>- I am going further, and saying that bonuses might be honestly declared to be profits under the Bill. In the Starr-Bowkett societies, however, there are no profits, but all the money advanced is without interest; so that we may say there are benefits without profits. However, I now ask leave to withdraw the amendment, on receiving an undertaking that the Attorney-General will look into the whole matter, and, if possible, draft an amendment to meet the case. </para>

I shall not debate the last-mentioned matter now, but merely refer the Attorney-General to a recent .book on rating, in which the word " solely " is said to, in nine cases out of ten, destroy the object of Parliament. The amendment which I now propose will bring within the exemptions institutions which are charitable, but which are not public in the sense of being controlled or supported by the State. I have in my mind various benevolent institutions, some under religious bodies, for the purpose of helping the weak and unfortunate, and finding new ways of life for them. If the word " public" be retained, these societies will be excluded from the exemptions ; and I am sure every honorable member wishes that those legitimate efforts of benevolent people, and the public through their subscriptions, shall receive the same recognition as institutions that have to rely on the State for what should come from benevolence. </para>

The only difference is that the proposed new sub-clause has relation, not so much to the lands, although it does relate to them, as to the proceeds. So far as the land itself is concerned on which charitable or educational institutions are erected, it is exempt. </para>

An institution may own land other than the land on which the institution itself is erected. It may use the proceeds of these lands for other than pecuniary profits, and they will be exempted from taxation if the institution falls under the heading of a public educational or a public charitable institution. </para>

                    <para>.- Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> of the clause exempts the sites of all charitable institutions, whether public or not. The question raised by the amendment is whether the lands held by an educational or charitable institution apart from the site on which its buildings are erected shall be exempted from taxation. I think that we may well pause before determining to exempt such lands held by charitable institutions. In some cases, they are lands with which the institutions have been endowed, but in other cases they have been purchased with funds which have been collected, and it is doubtful whether the purposes of charity would not have been better served by expending the money directly in charitable relief than by investing it, to dole out the annual revenue. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. It must not be forgotten that we have heard of charitable institutions the major portion of whose revenues go to meet the expenses of management, only small sums being available for charitable relief. It is questionable whether the lands held by such societies, apart from the sites on which their buildings are erected, should be exempted from taxation. The honorable member for Angas desires to strike out the word " public " everywhere in relation to educational institutions, and I hope that that will be done. The words " and not for pecuniary profit " are a sufficient safeguard. There are large numbers of educational institutions endowed with lands the proceeds of which are devoted solely to educational purposes, and we, on this side, should be the last to prevent education being as free, full, and complete as it is possible to conceive. If the word " public " is used before "educational institutions" there will be grave doubt as to whether the lands of certain institutions that have been endowed will be exempt from taxation, because those institutions charge fees to students, though both the proceeds of their lands and the fees are used solely for educational purposes, no person receiving any profit from them. Some institutions may hold land whose unimproved value is thousands of pounds. In some cases specific pieces of land have been given in trust for scholarship purposes. No one would desire that such lands should be taxed. While I agree with the honorable member for Angas that the word " public " should not Be used before the word "educational," I should like, for the reasons I Have mentioned, to hear further argument before striking out the word "public" before the word "charitable:" </para>

                    <para>. - In my opinion, the words " and not for pecuniary profit " should be struck out. Institutions like the Wesley College, the Church of England Grammar School, the Presbyterian Ladies' College, the convent schools, and other institutions throughout Australia cannot be kept going without charging fees. My father paid for my education at the Melbourne Grammar School, yet it is a public institution in the sense in which the large English schools are public ; it is not conducted for the making of profits to be distributed amongst the proprietors. The University of Sydney has had some very large bequests, and Challis House, opposite the General Post Office there, was erected out of the funds provided in that way. The University, of course, collects rents for the offices in that building. Then the Ballarat Orphanage has reclaimed 50 or 60 acres of worn-out mining land on which it has a market garden and farm, the produce of which is sold, and the proceeds used for the maintenance of the institution. In my opinion, such land should not be taxable. The block occupied by the Church of England Grammar School here has an enormous unimproved value which, if taxed, would have to pay more than any income that could be obtained from the school. </para>

The Salvation Army has farms outside most of our large cities, on which it grows produce which it sells for the benefit of its charities. Such lands would be taxable under the Bill.

                        <para>- Under the Bill, a trustee is made an owner liable to pay taxation. I would point out that the lands of many religious institutions are held by corporation trusts, under special deeds, or, in some cases, the synod or governing body of the church is made a corporation. The institutions receive only the rents or profits, and we need to exempt both the trustees and the persons who get the profits. In one or two cases, a question has been raised as to whether a distinction is made between the owners, who are the trustees, and the institutions themselves. The point is rather important, for I know that the Attorney-General desires to exempt such institutions. </para>

                        <para>.- 1 urge the Attorney-General to omit the word " public," as proposed by the honorable member for Angas. It is very difficult to obtain a satisfactory definition of the word ; and I am afraid that, by employing it, in this case we may frustrate our real intention. In some cases, an educational institution on land vested in trustees, and which charges no fees, is held to be a public institution ; but the difficulty is to determine whether by the mere act of charging fees the privilege of being a "public" institution is not destroyed. I think that the Committee desires to preserve from taxation all charitable and educational institutions that are substantially intended for the benefit of the community generally, notwithstanding that they may be limited to specific denominations or persons, provided that they are not carried on by some individual for his own personal gain. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Angas has intimated that he intends to move an amendment of the amendment dealing with those words. If a man accepted an offer to carry on an institution as a charity and to get what he could out of it, he would probably be carrying it on for his own pecuniary gain, but the institutions to which I have referred are not conducted in that way. The salaries of the teachers in public schools are fixed by public committees, and come out of the funds. Tn other cases public institutions are carried on by sisterhoods, who give their services free of cost, with the result that the whole of the fees charged go to the institution concerned. . In other cases teachers are appointed, and receive small salaries to carry on institutions, and all these should be exempt from taxation since they are not carried on for pecuniary gain or profit. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Balaclava pointed out that the words " and not for pecuniary profit " might be interpreted otherwise than the Attorney-General thinks they ought to be interpreted ; and we have to remember that we shall not have the benefit of the honorable gentleman's decision when these questions arise. The Commissioner may take a different view. The honorable member for Balaclava has pointed out that in some cases institutions which come within the exemption provisions, invest their money in a building from which they collect rents, and he expressed some anxiety lest these should be held to be properties which should be taxed since they produce a. commercial result in the shape of rents. I think that we are all anxious to provide that where one of these institutions so invests its money as to derive a profit in the shape of interest from its [accumulated funds that investment shall not, in itself, constitute it a profit-making concern. I ask the Attorney-General, therefore to consider whether he does not need some modification of the proposed amendment. Passing from that question I desire to know whether the Attorney-General does not think it would be desirable to deal with all these institutions, including building societies and mutual life assurance and friendly societies, in one clause providing for their exemption. As it is, we have one set of institutions dealt with in clause 37 and another in an earlier part of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no objection to that. The matter which the Committee is now discussing is one of grave interest to large numbers of our fellow citizens. I share with honorable members generally the desire to make this tax press as lightly as possible upon every interest, and especially upon those of which mention has just been made. The word" " public charitable or public educational institution " are by no means unambiguous, and the decisions that have been given under the land and income tax law of New South Wales unfortunately do not make the position clear. They deal with public charitable, rather than wit!) ]ublic educational, purposes. Under the New South Wales Act a number of educational institutions are specified as being exempt. For instance, the University affiliated colleges, and the Sydney Grammar School are by name exempted. The institutions that are not so exempted are, of course, liable to taxation. The question is what is a charity? According to the technical legal meaning, it covers a very wide field, and would not appear to be at all limited by the popular meaning of the term, but it seems to be generally admitted that there must be some public purpose. It need not be a public purpose in which the whole community share, and its benefits may be restricted to a comparatively small proportion of the community. It may be for the relief of poverty, for the advancement of education or religion, or for other purposes beneficial to the community. It has been laid down, in the New South Wales Courts that the words " public charitable purposes " have a special and more limited meaning, and are not to be construed in their technical, acquired, and legal sense, although they go pretty far even there. For instance, in a case decided under the Municipalities Act in New South Wales, " benevolent institution " was held' to include St. Martha's Industrial Home, conducted by the Sisters of the Order of St. Joseph as a home for destitute and orphan girls. The institution received a substantial sum from fees and sale of work, but not enough to cover the expense of carrying it on, and the deficiency was made good, and some what more than made good, by voluntary subscriptions. Similarly, a refuge supported by donations, and carried on in a building used for private worship, was held to be a benevolent institution. The same thing applies to the Home of Hope, a very well-known institution in our State, where evidently they live on something more than hope. I submit that there is no necessity to leave out the word " public " before the word "charitable." " Public charitable purposes " is a term sufficiently wide to cover the whole field of charity, and if "public" were struck out, I doubt very much whether anything could be construed to be a charity that did not effect a public purpose.. Can the honorable and learned member find a decision bearing on that point ? </para>

                        <para>- I am anxious to exempt every charitable institution that is properly charitable, and shall be glad of the name of that case. The New South Wales and New Zealand Acts speak of public charitable purposes. The South Australian Act and the Victorian Bill do not use the word " public." I do not want to refuse the amendment without the best of reasons, and I confess that there appear to be conflicting authorities. I should like to be allowed to look into the cases, and, if the honorable member is agreeable, this exemption can be considered and dealt with on the recommittal. </para>

                    <para>. - I appreciate the spirit in which the Attorney-General has approached the question, but I do not know that much more information can be got upon it. There is a leading English case, <inline font-style="italic">Pensel</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Commissioner of Taxes,</inline> decided about 1894, which defines what the Privy Council considered was meant by charities. The same significance would not attach to the term in Australia, because at Home there are charities under various Acts for the last five or six hundred years of which we know nothing, but even there they must not be institutions which are self-regarding. I think it has been decided that the receipt of fees is not the essential difference between what is and what is not a charity. It is the object of the application of the moneys that determines the charity, and common sense will follow in the line of judicial decision on that point. If an institution can further its own objects, which must be charitable, by the receipt of fees, so long as those fees are only applied to the maintenance or the development of the institution it still retains its essential character as a charitable institution. In South Australia, the words of the Act are " solely for charitable or religious purposes." The word " public " is not used. There was a test case there about five or six years ago as to the meaning of those words in the Waterworks Act. I appeared for one of the institutions - I think the Sisters of St. Joseph - and some other refuges. There is no doubt about their being strictly charities. They are supported by sisters, whose motives in life every one will respect. They do not get a penny piece for themselves, and in some cases have really to deny themselves a good deal in order to keep the institution going. The Crown, after hearing the merits of the case, declared that, whether the Act did or did not cover the case, they would not insist upon the tax if certain conditions in regard to inspection were complied with. Consequently, the defence was never gone into, the requisition for the tax or rates was abated, and the case is left undecided so far as the Supreme Court is concerned. I have not much doubt that the decision would have been that the institution was a charity within the apparent intention of the Legislature, and ought not to be taxed, as none of the funds were applied to other than charitable purposes. I have in my mind in this matter all institutions which serve every end that benevolence recognises, and which ought not to come under our taxing power. I do not think that, if the Attorney-General looks up the English case I mentioned, or the Victorian case decided some years ago, or the New South Wales cases referred to, he will get much more light than common sense will throw upon the interpretation of these words. In the South Australian Act, there is no limitation to the effect that the institution is not to exist for pecuniary profit. We are putting in additional words of limitation in that regard, which will prevent the possibility of institutions carried on purely for private ends being exempt. I propose to move to add, after the words " pecuniary profit," the words " applied to other than such charitable or educational purpose." Then, even if the institution is self-supporting in the sense of doing some work and getting paid for it, and the proceeds being applied to the maintenance of the institution, but there being no division  of  profits amongst the members of the institution, it will still be exempt. Our common sense ought to regard such an institution as one that should be exempt from the taxing powers exercised under this Bill. </para>

Under the circumstances, perhaps the honorable member for Angas would be prepared to let the clause pass. </para>

                        <para>- It is proposed to recommit the clause to consider points on which there is some difference of opinion, but I gather that there is no substantial difference in regard to the words now proposed, which are inserted merely because they have already been agreed to in the preceding sub-clause. As a matter of fact, land held by religious bodies is nearly always vested in trustees. </para>

I hope that the Attorney-General will consider the advisability of exempting the lands of that, and similar institutions. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I believe that the Government lays claim to the minerals in any land. In some cases a mineral lease is let to a coal-mining company, and the surface is leased for agricultural or other purposes. The position is the same in the electorate represented by the honorable member for Hunter, and in one or two other constituencies. I should like to know exactly how such companies will be dealt with under the Bill. Some mining companies retain only sufficient of the surface to enable them to carry on screening and coking operations, and so forth, the rest of the land being leased for other purposes. The land is sometimes freehold and sometimes leasehold. The surface rights are occasionally sold, while the mining company retains all mineral rights. I think that honorable members generally will be anxious to learn what is the position of such companies under this Bill. </para>

                <para class="block">This is an important amendment, but I shall not discuss it at length, because it ought to be decided upon the knowledge we have of the inconvenience which would result from our insisting upon annual returns being furnished. We started in South Australia with triennial returns, but even those were found to be inconvenient and harassing. In 1902 the law. was altered so as to require that assessments should bo made only once in every five years. Under this clause we provide for an annual return, and at least several persons will be obliged to make returns, subject to the penalties of this Bill, as against only one under the South Australian Act. Under that Act .the first return was made in 1885, and from 47,000 to 50,000 returns were received. On that basis we shall have under this Bill something like 600,000 returns. If we make allowance for those who, for the purpose of this measure, will have to make returns, there may be more, even though no returns are made by those who own less than £5,000 worth. Are we going to insist that annual returns shall be made? Surely, if a valuation is made for one year, it ought to inure for three or ' four years. It is unnecessary every year to test whether there is a rise or fall in values. It requires more than a year to accurately determine what has been the addition to the unimproved value of land. If a slight leakage did occur, it would be in favour of the owner, and the taxpayer would not suffer very much. If the revenue shrank to too great a degree, we could always increase the productive rates under the tax.

                        <para>- There were from 47,000 to 50,000 returns in South Australia in 1885, with a much smaller population. In that State only two classes of persons had to make a return - the owner in fee-simple or its equivalent, and, if the land was held in trust, the trustee. Under this Bill, not only the owner of the fee-simple, but a lessee, a sub-lessee, beneficial owners, and others have to make a return. Making allowance for the difference in population, I think I am not far out in saying that 500,000 or 600,000 returns will have to be sent in every year ; and we shall have the position which has been arrived at in England, where they., simply cannot deal with the returns. In South Australia, it was found that the returns were so erratic, even when sent in by honest men, and that there were such honest differences of opinion, that the Commissioner got no guidance from them as to what he should do; and after his first experience of returns, he did not seek the aid of them. They now let the Department make the assessment; notice is given to each taxpayer, and if he thinks the assessment is unfair, he appeals. I do not think we require to do more than that. I hope, in the circumstances, the Government will consider the desirableness of not insisting on an annual return. I should like to see one Federal valuation made every three years, and let the States adopt it for their purposes also. It could be made in concert with !the States, on some basis which could be agreed upon, so as to save the necessity of harassing people unduly with our various systems of taxation. I hope, eventually, that every system, including municipal rates, water rates, and every thing else, will be based on the unimproved value of land ; and that we shall realize the ideal of having one unimproved assessment right through Australia, which may be used for State as well as Federal purposes. Although we cannot attain that ideal at once, we can do something to bring ourselves into line with the States by having the assessment as near as possible on the dates on which they make theirs. Let us, therefore, start with a triennial assessment. Advantage might be taken of the assessment that is now being made in South Australia; and that will; perhaps, be published within the next few weeks. By that means, a good deal of trouble could be- saved. </para>

                    SMITH (Parkes) [10.15;. - I should like to suggest a medium course. I recognise that the measure will require an enormous number of returns for the whole Commonwealth. If South Australia, some years ago, with a comparatively small population, required from 40,000 to 50,000 returns, we may safely conclude that the number will be 600,000. or 700,000 for the whole Commonwealth. To require these returns to be sent in every year by Statute is rather arbitrary. Very little change may take place over a period of three years in the general value of lands. The Attorney-General might accept the suggestion of the honorable member for Angas, while still giving the Commissioner power to have a fresh assessment made at any time within the three years if he thought it desirable. If the Commissioner sees that there is but little fluctuation in the land market, he might allow the assessment to run for another year.

                    <para>. - I shall support the amendment of the honorable member for Angas. In South Australia, the three years' periodical assessment was continued for a considerable time ; and the change from three to five years was brought about to save money during times of very severe stress. While the change from three to five years might not have been for the better, it would be a distinct advantage to substitute a three-year for an annual period in this Bill. The Minister of External Affairs knows that, when the periodical assessment is made in South Australia, the taxation offices are crowded with extra hands. An annual assessment under this Bill would entail an extra amount of work, and an attendant cost that would not be justified. A big army would be required in the Taxation Department, and a three years' periodical valuation is all that is necessary to catch the fluctuations in the value of land. I am strongly against requiring the individual land-owner to send in his own return. The system is copied from the original New Zealand Act ; but I believe it is .being set aside there because it has proved entirely unsatisfactory. Three or" four years ago, I was told by one of the Ministers who was in charge of that Department in New Zealand that the system was found in .practice to be bad. They had more people making an over, than an under, estimate ; and the system was so unsatisfactory that they abandoned the principle of every man making his own assessment for a better one under which the Department made it. </para>

                    <para>. - The Government cannot accept the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Angas. The valuations are to be made by the Commissioner, not every year, but when he pleases. Under the New South Wales Act return's are called for every year. They may include any particulars. They may include, and usually do include - they have always included within my recollection - the value of land. There is nothing unusual in this. It is the practice followed in New Zealand and in New South Wales. The object is to burst up estates and settle people on the land. It is desired, therefore, to exempt persons who in a previous year were liable to the tax, but who, having subdivided, are no longer liable. We desire to see how the country progresses under a tax of this sort - whether, in point of fact, values are going up or down. It is an excellent thing to take an annual valuation. The amount of trouble to the taxpayer is quite negligible. He will have to furnish an annual return, and the question whether he shall furnish an annual valuation is merely one of putting down a few more figures on his already voluminous return. </para>

                    <para>.-. One of the weaknesses of any scheme of land taxation in a country like this must be the cost, not merely to the Government, but to the individual taxpayer. Experience has shown that it is very heavy. In his remarks to the Committee - the Attorney-General appears to be utterly indifferent to this aspect* of the matter, and this is the: more regrettable because excessive cost of collection will be - a strong argument against the continuance of land taxation. The honorable gentleman said just now that it was a mere trifle' for a man who was making up his annual return to include also the particulars required in clause . 14. The particulars required in that clause include a full and complete statement of the land owned by the. individual on the 30th June last. Now, there are very few alterations in the ownership of land throughout a year in proportion to the total number of assessments that must be made. I have it on the very best authority - that of a gentleman who has had practical experience in a land tax office in another State - that the cost of these annual assessments will be enormous. He says - </para>

                    <para>To furnish a return of land in each financial year would involve taxpayers in tremendous expense. The preparation of a big land tax return is a formidable affair. Once furnished, it should, after verification, be the basis; and subsidiary returns might be provided for in respect of sales and acquisitions. </para>

Take the case of a large bank or society or land mortgage company whose own first return would cover many sheets of demy-sized paper; they would have a substantial grievance if compelled to furnish practically the same particulars each year. </para>

                <para class="block">While it may be comparatively easy to deal with the returns made by new taxpayers, if the Commissioner is obliged to verify each separate return and to compare it with the previous returns of the same taxpayer, he will require a very large staff of officials. As the Attorney-General finds it necessary to indulge in second thoughts in respect of some of the- amendments which have been submitted, he may very fairly devote his attention to the proposal of the honorable member for Angas. It seems to be a more workable and less costly arrangement than that proposed in the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to point out that in South Australia a tax at one rate is levied upon land up to ?5,000 value, and a tax at another rate upon land in excess of that value. The same practice is adopted in checking the subdivision of lands. That is accomplished by the Taxation Department being kept informed by the Registrar of Titles of every land transaction which takes place. The fact that an assessment is made every five years does not make the slightest difference to the owners of land. Consequently there is nothing in the objection of the Attorney-General regarding the necessity of effecting an alteration according to the way in which properties have been subdivided. We can provide in this Bill for the necessary information being supplied through the State Registrars of Titles Offices. But I object to the whole scheme of the Bill in regard to the assessment of land. I was told in Adelaide last week, by the solicitor of an estate which has a rent roll of about ?13,000 or ?14,000 a year, that to furnish the. Department with the returns contemplated under this measure will cost that estate about ?1,000 annually. This may be an exaggeration. There is not to be one general valuation made by the Commissioner; therefore, there will be no uniformity in regard to the comparative valuations. These are matters to which- I deem it my. duty to call attention. I regret that the Government are not prepared to prevent inconvenience by dispensing with these annua)  returns. </para>

In this provision the words "taxpayer" or "person" are used, and under it a " person " will be at liberty to appeal, whereas under clause  40  the appeal must be by a " taxpayer." </para>
