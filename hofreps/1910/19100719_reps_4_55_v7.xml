                        <para>The Defence Act 1903 has now been in force for over six years, and during that period there have been only four district courts martial on members of the Citizen Forces. Three resulted in acquittal, and in one a fine was inflicted. It has been found that breaches of discipline in time of peace can ordinarily be sufficiently punished by the powers of fine and discharge now given to commanding officers. It is, however, provided by section 265 of the Commonwealth Military Regulations, that, whenever a commanding Officer proposes to inflict any but a minor punishment upon a soldier the latter shall be so informed, and that he shall have a right to demand trial by court martial. </para>
                        <para>In time of war it is obvious that offences cannot be dealt with by civil courts, and therefore the Imperial Army Act comes into force under section 55 of the Defence Act 1903-4. In the area of active operations no civil courts would be in operation, and it would be impracticable to send the officers and soldiers, whose presence would be required at a trial, back to the base for the purpose. The application of the Army Act is, however, limited by sections 96,98, and 106 of the Defence Act 1903-4. </para>

                        <para>Onmy arrival at Vancouver I was astonished to find that the number of telephone exchange connexions was about twice as many as those in Wellington, although the cities are about the same size, and Wellington rates are considerably cheaper. </para>
                        <para>In the exploitation of the business the telephone companies are assisted by the almost universal system of the measured rate charge, i.e., a charge for each call made over a certain number. For branch exchange work this is the only method that can be well employed, as no hotel-keeper is likely to go to the expense of paying a flat rental for  100  or  200  telephones for the use of his guests. </para>
                        <para>While I am not convinced that the measured rate system should be adopted in its entirety, I think it is likely that the rigid flat rate as in use in New Zealand, is largely responsible for our failure to develop on the lines I have indicated, and it would be well to consider whether a measured rate could not be adopted for branch exchanges,&#38;c., which would give satisfaction alike to the Department and telephone users; that is to say, the present flat rate to be maintained for single connexions, particularly with private residences, and a measured rate introduced for branch exchanges and party lines. </para>

                            <para>The arrangement in force in the Department is that as regards semi-official offices the personal allowance of the postmaster, together with the allowance for maintenance of the office (light, &#38;c.), and the rental value of the premises as quarters shall equal the minimum wage of &#163;110 per annum. I was not previously aware that in four cases in New South Wales and one in Tasmania this had not been carried out. In two of these cases the total is &#163;2 <inline font-style="italic">less</inline> than&#163;110, in one case  &#163;3  less, in one &#163;7, and in the other &#163;12. In the last-mentioned &#163;52 per annum additional, and in the other cases &#163;26 per annum additional is allowed for assistants. Steps have been taken to rectify the anomalies in these instances. In all other cases it is reported that the equivalent of the minimum wage is being paid. With respect to non-official (allowance) offices, which are in the hands of persons who make their living by other occupations, the allowance is paid according to a scale based on the statistics of postal work performed. A non-official (allowance) office is established on a revenue of&#163;15 per annum. The work does not occupy the whole time of the postmaster, and the minimum wage does not apply. </para>

The five exceptions comprise three postmasters in Western Australia and two female telegraph messengers in South Australia. The revenue derived from the offices controlled by the postmasters in Western Australia referred to is &#163;17, &#163;21, and&#163;87 per annum. In each case the postmaster receives an allowance in excess of the revenue. These persons became permanent employes of the Department owing to a technicality, they having been appointed by the Governor in Council of the State prior to Federation. On the retirement of these officers, whose salaries are at present fixed under section  20  of the Public Service Act, the permanent positions will be abolished. The two female telegraph messengers referred to are over twenty-one years of age, and are receiving a salary of &#163;52. per annum (fixed in accordance with the provisions of the Act). One of these has declined to accept transfer from her present position, while the other (fifty years of age) is unfitted for any other duties. </para>

                        <para>. - It is generally admitted, I think, that this is one of the most important Bills with which this Parliament will have to deal. It is a great pity that the Financial Agreement entered into between the representatives of the States and the Commonwealth has not been given effect to ; and one of the chief weaknesses in the Bill is that it does not, and cannot, give any hope of stability for a period of ten years. The Prime Minister, in introducing the measure, pledged himself to endeavour to keep the contract as herein entered into; but personal guarantees are not of the slightest value in such a case. Even- during the present session, we have been shown the utter futility of placing any reliance on this ten years&#39; agreement. Three years ago we passed a Bill the operation of which was to cease at the end of 1912. That term was arrived at by a compromise, but we find on the notice-paper to-day a proposal to repeal that Bill before it has run half its length. I have no wish to transgress by dealing with that other measure, but merely desire to show how vain it is to expect that this or any other Parliament can pledge future Parliaments. Those who took the same view as myself think that the effect would be much more permanent if we left the future- consideration of the financial arrangements to the electors rather than to a future Parliament over which this Parliament has no control. What we urge is that the people of Australia ought to be trusted. There are two agencies elected by the people to do different works for the same people. Those people pay the same taxes, and when the two agencies differ as to the allocation of the money, a fair and proper tribunal is not one of the parties to the contract, but the people who have subscribed the money. The Prime Minister has said that the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of this House is an answer to the terms of that proposed Financial Agreement: but it is nothing of the kind. In practically every State the candidates who opposed the Financial Agreement did so on totally different issues. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -Pearce,</inline> the Leader of the Labour party in Western Australia, writing to the newspapers, pledged his party to a contract for twenty-five years, whereas in my own State the present Minister of Home Affairs, the leader of the party there, and those acting with him, based their opposition to the agreement on the ground that it was not fair to Tasmania in that it did not give her a sufficiency. At the great Labour Tally in the Theatre Royal, Hobart, at which, I think, nearly all the Labour candidates were present, the Minister of Home Affairs called on the people to reject the agreement, pledging himself and his party- </para>

                            <para>- It will do nothing of the kind. Those members who have so pledged themselves will have an opportunity of voting on their pledges. What has happened since those diverse pledges were given? The .Financial Agreement has been defeated, and the Labour party has been returned to power; and it will be interesting to see how those men who have pledged themselves - I say nothing of those who did not pledge themselves - will vote on the question whether or not the Braddon section shall be continued in operation to the end of the current year. It has been said that those who supported that agreement have no reason to complain, because it has practically been given effect to. But the agreement, as I understand it, and as it was set down in black and white, showed that the then Treasurer anticipated a deficiency of &#163;1,200,000. It will be remembered that ,&#163;600,000 of this was deficiency in revenue, caused largely, if not wholly, by the obligations of old-age pensions, ,;and &#163;600,000 for new works. The State Premiers agreed that, as the Commonwealth had to pay old-age pensions, they would make good the deficiency on the conditions laid down. As a matter of fact, however, the revenue increased, and the deficiency is only some &#163;440,000; and the whole of this, and not half, as previously agreed, the Treasurers are asked to provide. In the interests of Tasmania, it is exceedingly regrettable that the Financial Agreement has not been given effect to, because greater security would then have been given to the States, and also a larger contribution than under the proposed Bill. Another feature of the financial relations has been brought under the notice of the House by the honorable member for Wilmot. I am not here to ask for any charity for my State, but I think it is recognised by everyone who has gone into the question that there is a certain amount due to Tasmania on account of what is commonly called &#34;leakage&#34;; that is, the loss caused by goods, which have been imported into other States, being transferred to Tasmania without the ordinary procedure of trade certificates being observed. When the honorable member for Swan was Treasurer, he went into the matter, and, I think, he accepted the view that there was a deficiency or leakage representing &#163;20,000to &#163;25,000. The matter was brought more prominently under the notice of the honorable member for Hume when he was Treasurer, and he came to a similar conclusion. The honorable member went so far as to bring the matter under the notice of the then Premiers of Victoria and New South Wales, and urged them to consider this claim, which he recognised as fair and just. They were not prepared to recognise any claim whatever. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear it, because it is the State of Victoria which really secures the benefit of the larger amount of the leakage, although there is also a portion coming from New South Wales. Now that the Commonwealth Parliament is dealing with the matter in equity and justice, taking over the whole of the Customs revenue and distributing to the States the proportion to which it thinks they are lawfully entitled, and which it can honestly and fairly spare, the matter ceases to be one of concession between State and State, and it devolves upon the Federal Parliament, which has the responsibility, to do what is right, just and honest. The Federal Government must take the full and complete responsibility in dealing with this question of leakage, seeing that the Commonwealth officials in the Customs Department have failed to deal with it. A considerable portion of Tasmania, especially the north-west&#39; coast and the west coast, does practically the whole of its trade, in the shape of importations, with Victoria. The north-west coast has become the happy hunting ground for commercial travellers from the adjoining States. There is an exceedingly large trade done between Tasmania and Victoria. A few figures will show how Victoria and New South Wales are becoming not only distributing, but also manufacturing, centres for the whole Commonwealth. Whilst the increase in population of Victoria for the ten years ending 1908 was 7&#189; per cent., the number of her factories increased in eight years by 60 per cent., the average number of factory hands employed increased by 71 per cent., the value of the buildings and lands on which the factories were erected by 16 per cent., and the value of the plant and machinery by 54 per cent. In those eight years the number of factories in Victoria increased by1,739 and the number of employes by 39,000, while the increased expenditure on lands and buildings for factory purposes amounted to , &#163;3,600,000. One of the reasons why there has been such a falling-off in the Customs duties in Tasmania is that prior to Federation the same duties were levied, for instance, on boots coming from Victoria, as on those coming from England and America; but when Tasmania entered the Federation, and a uniform Tariff was imposed, whilst the duties remained, and were even increased against England and America, they vanished as against the factories of Victoria. These have consequently monopolized the whole of the trade, and the Customs duties have correspondingly fallen off. One of the interesting features of Federation is the extent to which InterState trade has grown, and the right honorable member for Swan has placed on the paper a notice of question asking whether uniform rates of wages are to be paid, in order that the people in the West, where wages are higher, may be protected from the undue competition of Victoria and New South Wales. Our experience in Tasmania is that, no matter what wages are paid in the smaller centres, the large centres, owing to the advantages of their increased output, can swamp the market. Prior to Federation, we had several flourishing little boot factories in Hobart and Launceston. There are no Wages Boards in Tasmania to regulate wages, which are much lower than in the Melbourne factories. Yet the Melbourne factories have practically wiped the Tasmanian factories out of existence. </para>

                            <para>- It is due to the larger output and a little dumping. The manufacture of boots in Tasmania is now almost wholly confined to one line, which is not used and therefore not made in Victoria - a very heavy class of boot for bushmen. Melbourne and Sydney have not only become the manufacturing centres for the greater portion of Australia, but they are rapidly becoming the distributing centres. Sydney is the distributing centre to some extent for Queensland, while Melbourne and Sydney are to a large extent distributing centres not only for Tasmania, but also for Western Australia. We shall, therefore, have to face the question of the allocation of Customs duties in a truly Federal spirit, because the leakage will go on. I am not blaming the Customs authorities, because I know from experience the difficulties which are placed in the way of any one buying goods in Victoria who endeavours to get a Customs certificate in order that the duties may be transferred. In fact, some of the business houses object to give certificates, as they do not care for the trouble. We make our claim in this matter not as a pauper State, not as a necessitous State, and not as an act of charity. We are trying to put our case within the four corners of equity and justice. We claim that goods are imported into Victoria, pay duty here, and are transferred to our own State, but instead of the duties being credited to the State where the goods are consumed, they remain in the first port of entry. The right honorable member for Swan and the honorable member for Hume, who were both Treasurer for years, and went into the matter carefully, recognised that a large amount is due to Tasmania. The honorable member for Hume even took the trouble to appeal to the Premiers of the two States concerned to do an act of justice to Tasmania, and, therefore, now that the Federation has taken the matter over, and the responsibility rests upon this Parliament, it is the duty of the Federation to put the matter right without any appeal to the Premiers of other States, and not as a concession, but as a matter of right and justice. I think it will be generally con ceded that so far this discussion has been conducted with the desire to get down to the bedrock of things, and without any attempt to throw undue obstacles in the way of the passage of the Bill. We recognise that some measure of this kind is a necessity. It would have been much better for the States if the settlement had taken place years ago. The longer it is delayed the worse it will be for the States, and I wish I could hope that the Bill would run for ten years. I fear, however, that the projects which we are somewhat extravagantly and rashly launching will entail such an expenditure on the Federation that our resources will be strained, and strained so far that a desire may be evinced to get the money in the easiest way available, by restricting the life of this measure and deducting the amount required from the amount payable to the States. I warn honorable members of the utter futility of believing that a pledge given by a Minister, or, indeed, by any other member of the House, can bind future Parliaments. The Sugar Bounty Bill, which will be before us in the course of a few clays, is a case in point. It will serve to show that, although a time limit may be fixed to the operation of a Bill - although the Minister in charge of that measure may pledge himself that it shall run to its full limit - there is no guarantee that that limitation will be observed after an appeal has been made <inline font-style="italic">to the</inline> electors, and a new Parliament may decide that a change shall be made. The weakness of one State is the weakness of the whole Common wealth. That has been the experience over and over again of the United States of America. When honorable members say that the States of America have succeeded individually in carrying out their work without receiving any share of the Customs revenue, I am constrained to ask them to consider the straits to which they have been reduced because of the absence of that source of income. Many of the works now carried out by the States of the Commonwealth have long been impossible, so far as the States of America are concerned. They have had to hand over the greater proportion of works, such as we carry out through the States, to private syndicates and trusts which have gloated over and robbed the people of America to an extent which the people of Australia have never fully appreciated. While the Union Treasury has been overflowing with money - whilst the Union Government have been purchasing and storing in the vaults at Washington hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of silver, and have administered a pension list in relation to soldiers who took part in the American Civil War, in a way that has been disgraceful, every effort being made by the Union to spend money wisely or unwisely, the States themselves have been starved, and compelled, I repeat, to hand over to trusts and syndicates works which we in Australia hope the States will always be able to undertake. There is no room in this matter for antagonism between the States and the Commonwealth. If we could only keep always in front of us the fact that we all represent the same people, and that an injustice done by the Federation, or a State, injures alike all the people whom we represent, we should be able sometimes, I think, to come&#39;to fairer judgments in these matters. It will not be in the best interests of the Commonwealth itself if, by starving the States, we prevent them from carrying out. the great developmental works which must be undertaken if Australia is to make the progress that we desire. The States can be enabled to undertake the construction of roads, bridges, and other public works only by the allotment to them of a fair share of the Customs revenue. It would be well for this Parliament to remember that many of the most important functions of government are still in the hands of the States. They have to carry on extensive railway systems, the construction of public works of various kinds, a great national system of education - which, after all, is the most important duty that could devolve upon a Government - and State Judiciaries, and they have also to meet the interest on their national debt. For every pound in respect of which there is a claim upon the Commonwealth to-day, there is a claim of &#163;7 or &#163;8 on the State Treasurers, and they must be granted a reasonable proportion of the Customs revenue if they are to discharge their highly important functions. It matters little to the people who spends the money so long as it is expended to their advantage, but it will be a matter of serious concern to them if one of their governmental agencies, having a surplus revenue, expends it on works that are not wholly essential and thereby renders it impossible for their other governmental agency to carry out equally, or more, important functions. It would be a serious matter for the people if, as the result of this process, the States were compelled to apply a brake to the wheels of progress, and to say that developmental works within their borders must-cease. We can come to a fair and proper decision on this question only by viewing it broadly from the standpoint of the rights of the Federation and of the States. I hope the time will never come when there will be any desire, either on the part of this Legislature or the State Parliaments, to create antagonism between the two great agencies of government, or to create in the minds of the people a feeling that one of the agencies which they have elected to do special work is in direct antagonism to another agency which is also elected to do work for them. The. Federation should be more generous to the States than is proposed under this Bill. The <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> allowance of 25s. per annum represents practically only one-half of the Customs and Excise revenue, and I believe that the payment of so small an allowance will cause a reduction in the expenditure of the States and hit a class of people whom&#39; very few of us wish to see injured. In Tasmania, as the result of the pressure upon the Treasury by reason of the great reduction in the amounts that it has received from the Federation, officers in the lower ranks of the Public Service are receiving rates of wages of which few if any of us are proud. Their salaries have been cut down and they cannot be increased because of the shortage of revenue, and the loss Tasmania has sustained owing to the upsetting of her Customs and Excise income. We have an honest claim to make. When it can be shown by two men, who have gone into the matter carefully, and neither of whom is a representative of Tasmania, that that State, since the inception of Federation, has not received its rightful share of her Customs revenue, then I do think that the Federal Government ought to go thoroughly into the whole question before this Bill passes through Committee. It will be too late to take action after it has been passed. This Bill is to determine for ten years the allocation of the Customs and Excise revenue to the States, and, in view of the evidence of the two gentlemen to whom I have referred that Tasmania has been improperly deprived of her fair share of the revenue from Customs duties, it is the bounden duty of the Government to see, before the Bill leaves the Committee, whether the wrong cannot be righted. I trust that the claims of Tasmania will be determined, not on grounds of necessity or pauperism, but wholly and solely on the grounds of public right and justice, and that fair play will be meted out to the smallest State of the Union, and one which has made a greater sacrifice for Federation than has any other State in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not intend to occupy the time of the House at very great length, but I wish to draw attention to one or two matters in connexion with this Bill which, I think, are worthy of consideration. The fact that the measure embodies a proposal that the Commonwealth shall annually return to the States  25s.per <inline font-style="italic">capita</inline> is a great tribute to the agreement which was entered into between the late Government and the State Premiers. Notwithstanding all the denunciation which the present Ministry and their supporters heaped upon that agreement in this House, on the public platform, and in the press, they have now presented for our consideration a Bill which, according to their own statements, embodies practically the same proposals as those submitted by the Deakin Government. They were unable to find any better scheme for submission to Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to repeat my statement. While it is true that this Bill embodies the same proposal as that which was put forward by the late Government, it is the same proposal with a very vital difference, inasmuch as the agreement which was entered into by the Deakin-Cook Ministry would, if adopted, have given to the State finances that element of stability which is entirely lacking under this measure. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to rise in his place, and in that pompous lordly autocratic style which he has affected so much of late, to say &#34;We &#34; - that is, he and his friends- &#34; guarantee to the States that the provision incorporated in this Bill shall continue for ten years.&#34; But he cannot guarantee that it will continue for more than twelve months. He has not the power to do so. He can pledge nobody but himself. He cannot pledge even his own followers, because none of them is his own master, while they are all his masters, and in turn he and they are but the recording agents of another set of masters above them. Their masters are a body of men who meet and decide these things outside of Parliament. Notwithstanding anything that the Prime Minister may affirm in this House, he is merely the mouthpiece, and not the leader, of the Labour party. He is here, in the first place, to voice the decisions which are arrived at by an outside body, and, in the second, to register the decrees of another body which meets within the precincts of the building, obedient slaves to the irresponsible outside body. No matter what his own views may be, he has to voice those decisions, and in no sense can he be regarded as a leader. </para>

                            <para>- The agreement which was entered into between the late Libera&#93; Government and the State Premiers, would, if ratified by the electors, have been embodied in the Constitution, and thus would have given to the finances of the States that element of stability which, under the present Bill, is entirely lacking. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to urge that the Bill secures the payment of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> for ten years. It secures nothing of the sort. It may possibly continue in force during the life of this Parliament, and it may conceivably last for ten years. But this Parliament cannot bind any succeeding Parliament. It cannot legislate for more than three years ahead. Indeed, we cannot guarantee that the provision shall continue operative for three years, because nobody can foresee what political exigencies may arise which may result in the Government being suddenly deprived of office. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that there does not seem much probability of the Ministry being deposed during the life of the present Parliament. But, whilst we may regard the proposals of the Government as likely to continue operative during the term for which this Parliament has been elected, we cannot guarantee their continuance even for that term and certainly not for any longer period. As a matter of fact, the Government cannot guarantee that they will remain undisturbed even during the life of this Parliament, because the next InterState Labour Conference may not approve of them. The Ministry may find themselves obliged to bow to the decision of a majority in that Conference, and to make some amendment in the Bill, even if they are not driven to a pretext for its repeal. </para>

                            <para>- I am perfectly prepared to stand by every word that I uttered upon the Financial Agreement as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> During my recent election campaign I took up the same position as I took then and am adopting now. I said then, that while the State Premiers would have been well advised if they had permitted a time limit to be imposed upon the operation of the agreement which was entered into between them and the late Government, still&#39;, as they had not done so,  that was their affair, and as they were prepared to accept that agreement for an indeterminate period, the stability which was guaranteed to their finances under that arrangement was not so good in my opinion as that which was guaranteed to the Commonwealth. The great point was to get the agreement into the Constitution, whatever the duration of it might be. And the Bill upon which I voted was not a Bill to indorse the agreement, but a Bill to refer the decision of the matter to a referendum of the electors. But there is no proposal to put this scheme into the Constitution. Consequently, there is no security for the States&#39; finances. I propose now to quote the opinion expressed by the  Deputy  Leader of the Labour party in the Parliament pf New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> is reported as having said, in the New South Wales Parliamentary Debates of 21st October, 1908 - </para>

                        saw the element of danger as I saw it then and as I see it now. Notwithstanding anything the Prime Minister may allege, the guarantee that the new arrangement will last for ten years is not worth the printer&#39;s ink used on the Bill. We have heard a good deal about the Brisbane Conference scheme of the Labour party. Notwithstanding anything that has been said during the elections, and notwithstanding anything said in this House, anybody who has read the proceedings of the Brisbane Conference can come to no other conclusion than that the original intention of the Labour party in regard to the financial arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States was that it should be of a permanent character, and that it should be embodied in the Constitution.

                    <para class="block">Here is a positive declaration, made in the most unequivocal terms, by one of the members of the present Government, that the scheme of the Brisbane Conference was not merely a temporary expedient, but a settlement for all time. How. is the element of permanency to be secured unless the arrangement made be embodied in the Constitution? There is no other way in which permanency can be obtained, because there is no other way by which a future Parliament could be prevented from repealing an Act passed by this Parliament. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Bill, a future Parliament will have the same power to repeal it as we have to pass it. It was this undeniable fact that caused several members of the Labour party in the different States to recognise that&#39; in order to secure permanency there must be an alteration of the Constitution to prevent any tampering with the agreement, which, otherwise, would be at the mercy of every change of Government, of every party occupying the Treasury bench, and of every impecunious Treasurer. But notwithstanding that the Attorney-General, on the 1 2th August last, made the declaration that I have quoted, in less than a month he made an absolutely contradictory statement, which will be found on page 56 of the volume of reprint of <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Debates</inline> on the Financial Agreement - </para>

                    <para class="block">In August the Attorney-General insisted that there should be an agreement for all time, and that the Brisbane Labour Conference had so decided; but in September he declared that to make the agreement permanent would be an outrage. I notice the Minister of External Affairs is now silent. There is no defence to such incredible inconsistency. What are we to think of a party that changes its opinions so frequently, and whose leaders make certain statements one day and exactly opposite statements on the morrow ? Yet this is the party that claims to be above all other parties in respect to consistency - the party which keeps steadily on one course with one objective in view. </para>

                            <para>- I have already explained that very phrase. I do not object to a limitation of the period, so long as security is afforded for giving effect to the Bill. This can only be done by putting it into the Constitution. I put my views before Parliament clearly in saying that the Premiers would have been well advised to adopt a certain course, but since they did not see their way clear to adopt that course the only thing to do was to take the agreement as it was presented to us. I did not commit myself to the agreement as such, but simply to the proposal to refer it to the electors, so the honorable member&#39;s attempt to misrepresent my attitude is at once defeated. The Bill before Parliament was not a Bill to ratify the agreement, but to allow the whole matter to be referred to the people for their decision, and I was not going to block that, whatever my opinion as to the merits of the agreement might have been. That is all I have to say in regard to that matter. This element of permanency was really the strong feature of the Brisbane Labour Conference scheme, the belated denials of the Labour party to the contrary notwithstanding. Again, I will put into the witness box one of the prime movers in the matter, and quote his own words from the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> said - </para>

                            said that. I myself said, when introducing it, that it was to be a permanent arrangement, and I gave this illustration of how it would work. &#34; For example, if Queensland&#39;s population doubled in ten years the return would be double in the aggregate to the Queensland Treasurer.

                    <para class="block">That remark was made by the man who drafted the proposal, brought it before the Conference, and was familiar with all the details. He rejected <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne&#39;s proposal because it was limited only to thirty-five years ahead. The proposal of the present Minister of Home Affairs was rejected because the element of permanency was absent. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lamont,</inline> who is well known in Labour circles, also addressed the Conference.

                        <para>He had to say that it was utterly impracticable to carry it out. Seeing that it was impossible to dissociate the finances of the Commonwealth and the States, he believed the scheme submitted was the only one which gave freedom to the Federal Parliament and security to the State Parliaments. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is pretty definite. It shows that in the mind of other members of the Conference the idea of permanency was fixed and immovable. They had no idea of fixing the arrangement for any term of years. </para>

                        <para>My impression is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> thought he would be driven to depart from the proposal of the Brisbane Conference, and to bring forward some alternative suggestion. I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> has anywhere asserted that the Brisbane Conference proposal did not provide for a steadily increasing aggregate return in proportion to the population of every State. . . . I am in full accord with my leader in the stand he has taken here, and I say that the Labour Party in its conference determined that there should be an allocation of this particular fund - saying nothing, of course, of the revenue raised from other sources - between the Commonwealth and the States to provide for old-age pensions, the reasonable necessities of defence, certain other expenditure which is directly or indirectly connected with defence, and other matters such as the site for the Federal Capital. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the proposal which has been so roundly condemned by the present Federal Labour party, and roundly condemned, even since that statement was made, and since a further conference of the Labour leagues has been held, by the very men who gave utterance to the statements which are recorded in cold print in the State <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The members of the State Labour party drew up a manifesto, in which they complained of the attitude  adopted by the members of the Federal Labour party towards the agreement between the Deakin Administration and the Premiers. They repudiated what was done by the Federal Labour party, and justified their position, explaining that the settlement of the finances suggested by the Labour Conference was intended to be permanent. Let me read a statement concerning this manifesto which has appeared in the public press - in their recent attitude, in connection with the financial debate in the New South Wales Parliament, had only repeated for the third time what they had said on two previous occasions with the full approval of the Labour movement. The statement gives an outline of the Brisbane Conference financial proposals, and the party&#39;s reasons for regarding those proposals as permanent, and to be embodied in the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>The last step taken by the State Labour party was when they laid down for the third time the Brisbane Conference scheme as the one they supported, and this was the occasion that had given rise to all the criticism that had been indulged in in certain quarters. </para>
                        <para>The State Labour party&#39;s view of the controversy is then summed up into three propositions - one, that the Brisbane Conference scheme was intended to be a compact between the States and Federal interests represented within the Labour movement; second, that such a compact was binding upon both parties to it, and that neither party was free to depart from or alter it without previously consulting and obtaining the assent of the other; third, that the compact was intended to be final and permanent. </para>

                    <para class="block">Thus we have the three propositions laid down, that the scheme was to be a compact between the State and Federal sections of the Labour party, that it was binding upon both sections, and that it was to be permanent. These statements have been, denied by members of the Federal Labour party, and with most positive insistence affirmed by the State Labour party ; but since another conference has been- held, some of those w-ho originally objected most strongly to the position of the Federal Labour members have had to re-adjust their views and swallow everything they said. The Minister of External Affairs contradicted me when I said that the Attorney-General had stated that 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> was too large a sum to return to the States, and that  &#163;1  would be enough. He denied, too, that the honorable gentleman had stated that the proposal to return 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> was intended to bring about an influx of  immigrants  to reduce wages. Again, let me give proof of my assertions. Speaking on the 9th September last - the remarks are to be found on page 49 of the reprint of the Financial Debates - the Attorney-General said - </para>

                            <para>- Of the inconsistency and changeableness of honorable members opposite. We do not know from day to day what their opinions are. To-day they say one thing, and to-morrow they will approve of what they condemn to-day, and condemn what they approve today. And they all the time boast of their consistency. The Ministry has. put before the House proposals which last session they condemned. We never know from one day to another what their mind is on any subject, because they never know themselves. They are creatures of expediency in matters of finance, as in everything else. No governing principle is discoverable in anything they do. They are all the time creatures of circumstance. The Prime Minister has included in this Bill a clause which is intended to provide that the payment of 25s. per head shall be made to the States from the first of this month. The honorable gentleman is aware that under the Constitution he cannot limit himself to that, and that the Bill in this respect is merely make-believe. Willy-nilly the Government must pay to the States three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise during the first half of the current financial year. That is provided for under the Braddon section of the Constitution, the operation of which does not expire until 31st December next. And we have no power to alter that provision. Under that section the States must receive &#163;4,400,000 for the first half of the current financial year. During the second half of the year the States will receive, under the Government proposal, not &#163;4,400,000, but, after deducting amounts totalling &#163;450,000 which appear in the schedule, a sum of only &#163;45&#176;&#62;&#176;&#176;&#176;- In the circumstances, the States will receive during the second half of the current financial year, not 12s. <inline font-style="italic">66.</inline> -per head, but only 2s. 7 Jd. </para>

                            <para>- In the second six months certainly much less. If the Financial Agreement were made to date from 1st January next, and the States were to get 25s. per head of population from that date, they would receive a great deal more during the second half of the financial year than they will receive under this Bill. What is being proposed now is to ante-date the payment. It is proposed, then, to deduct the amount which the States will receive under the Braddon section for the first half of the year. </para>

                            <para>- They will, get very much less under this Bill during the second half of the year, as I have already pointed out. I remind the Prime Minister that the States only accepted the Financial Agreement because of the permanent character underlying it, and they were prepared to make their arrangements accordingly. The present Government&#39;s proposals will dislocate their finances. I do not say that they will not receive a certain amount during the whole of the financial year. </para>

                            <para>- They will certainly receive less in the second half of the year. The Prime Minister is compelled by the Constitution to give more in the ensuing six months ; the States have nothing to thank him for in that regard. I am objecting that the conditions under which the payments to the States will be made are different. There was an element of permanency in the Financial Agreement which this Bill lacks. It is not proposed that the provisions of this Bill shall be embodied in the Constitution, and they may continue in force only for the next three years. </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister may continue to harp on that string, but the fact remains that in the second half of the current financial year they will get considerably less, and this proposal will place the State Governments in a very difficult position financially.I think they should have been given due notice of what the Federal Ministry intended to do. The Prime Minister might, at any rate, have accepted the suggestion to hold another Conference, so that some mutually satisfactory arrangement might have been arrived at between the Federal and State Governments, and the financial relations adjusted in a way more acceptable to all parties concerned. </para>

                            <para>- I think not. I have a copy of the correspondence here, and it seems to me that the Prime Minister treated the State Premiers most scurvily, and behaved certainly in a very undignified way. The honorable gentleman treated them as though they were so many schoolboys. He seems to forget that the State Premiers represent sovereign States, whose rights, secured to them under their own Constitutions, are as important and sacred as are any rights which we enjoy under the Federal Constitution. The States are not dependencies of the Commonwealth. They are not merely municipal bodies. The Prime Minister dealt with the State Premiers as though the Commonwealth Parliament were the only Parliament in Australia, as though it possessed arbitrary and unlimited powers, and the State Parliaments had no status whatever in the community. That was not a proper or a dignified attitude for the honorable gentleman to take up. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> the Premier of New South Wales, in the third paragraph of his letter to the Prime Minister, says - </para>

                    <para>He did not desire to dictate to the Commonwealth Parliament what it should do in dealing with the financial relations. He did not question its right to control Commonwealth finances. But he made a request for information as to what the Prime Minister and his Government proposed to do. He asked the honorable gentleman if he would lay his proposals before them, so that they might know what the Government intended to do, and consider the proposals at a Conference. </para>

After all, the Commonwealth Ministers represent the same people as do the State Premiers; the same people are interested in the question of the financial relation, because it is the same people who have to foot the bill, and therefore they ought to have been enabled to make their views known through their recognised representatives. This, I submit, was not a proper way to treat the Premiers of sovereign States. As the heads of the State Governments, they have the right to speak for the States; and it would have been only ordinary courtesy on the part of the Prime Minister to recognise their status and lay his proposals before them, even though those proposals might not be accepted. I desire to record my protest against the action of the Prime Minister as belittling the Commonwealth in an attempt to belittle the State Parliaments, and not doing justice to his position. It is an attitude that no other Prime Minister, representing any other party in the Commonwealth, would have dreamt of assuming. I am sorry the Prime Minister took that course, because at all times we should do our best to preserve harmonious relations between the States and the Commonwealth, and avoid by every possible means anything that may lead to friction and misunderstanding. </para>

                        <para>. - I recognise the importance of the Bill before the House, and, therefore, desire to say a few words in reference to the history of this financial measure. It will be within the memory of most honorable members that the suggestion for a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> return to the States first saw the light at the Brisbane Labour Conference. In its embryo state, the proposal was taken up by the Tasmanian Statistician, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> M. Johnston, and by him handed over &#34;to a conference of Premiers. Year after year, it was under consideration by the Premiers, and eventually found expression in the Commonwealth Parliament by means of the Bill of last year. Members of the Opposition did not hesitate then to support a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> return of 25s., but they desired a provision to that end to be placed in the Constitution for all time. So far as I can see, the only difference between members of the Opposition and members on this side is that the latter protested against thus shackling the Commonwealth for ever. I fail to see why members of the Opposition should now oppose what their own daily newspaper tells them is really their measure, and on the acceptance of which by the present Government they are complimented by that journal. I regret that the right honorable member for Swan is not in his place, because I desire to refer to the cruel manner in which he spoke of honorable members on this side of the House. I speak of the honorable gentleman most respectfully, in view of his long political career as a member of various Governments in Australia ; but it is a pity he was not more guarded in his utterances. I have signed the platform as laid down by the Brisbane Labour Conference, but I emphatically declare that, outside that platform, I am&#39; a free man, notwithstanding what the right honorable member said about the declaration of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who, at that time, was not a Minister of the Crown. Why should the Western Australian utterances of. a member of the Labour party, who was not a Minister, bind a member of the Labour party in Tasmania? Why should a statement made by the present Minister of Home Affairs be binding on me? I happened to be at the Hobart meeting referred to by the honorable member for Franklin ; and I spoke before the present Minister of Home Affairs, and simply told the people that I was in favour of a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> return of 25s., but not in favour of the provision being placed in the Constitution for all time. I cared not one iota what the honorable member for Darwin might say. Why should his statements bind me any more than the statements of the Leader of the Opposition bind honorable members opposite? I tell the right honorable member for Swan that, in my opinion, Western Australia has been exceedingly well treated. In addition to the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> return, Western Australia is given a special grant in the face of a declining revenue. Who can say what the revenue of Western Australia, large as it may be at present, will be in ten years&#39; time? We can say what the revenue of the other States will be at the end of that period, because they have reached normal conditions. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> Western Australia, in 1901, had a revenue of &#163;20 13s. 4d. per head; whereas, at the present time, it is only &#163;12 2s. 5d., showing a decline since Federation. Seeing that Western Australia has been so well treated, I should advise the representatives of that State to take what is .offered as quietly and quickly as possible, in case other honorable members may go more deeply into the question and change their minds. In Tasmania, in 1901, the imports per head amounted to &#163;4 14s. 2d., whereas at present the figure is &#163;4 2s. id. But, the imports of Tasmania are low because its Inter-State trade is so high. Its Inter-State trade is &#163;13 8s. 11d. per head, whereas that of Western Australia is only &#163;11 3s. 10d. per head, so that we are not the poor hungry little people that the right honorable member for Swan and other honorable members would lead the House to believe. We are importing largely from Victoria and New South Wales, and, therefore, we should be granted some consideration by the Commonwealth Government. The oversea and Inter- State trade of Western Australia is &#163;23 6s. 3d. per head, while that of Tasmania is &#163;18 us., or a difference of only &#163;4 15s. 3d., so that there is not such a vast difference after all between the amount of products consumed per head in Western Australia and Tasmania. New South Wales and Victoria have stepped in and taken practically the whole of our trade, and so a considerable leakage has come about, because people come from Tasmania and purchase dutiable goods in Victoria. Only the other day, as the honorable member for Bass can bear out, I met a gentleman from Tasmania, who had purchased in Melbourne, and was wearing, apparel to the value of He had no Inter-State certificate, and was going back to Tasmania, and so no duty would be credited to Tasmania on those goods. That sort of thing has been going on all these years, and our excellent statistician, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> M. Johnston, stakes his reputation on the statement that Tasmania has been done out of no less than ,&#163;40,000 per year since Federation began. If we have been done out of that big sum of money, surely we are entitled to some consideration from the Federal Government. I do not ask for consideration for the relief of the wealthy taxpayer of Tasmania. We have very few wealthy men there, but even those are paying considerably more than is paid in any other State. The Tasmanian income tax would be considered a war tax in any other country. If I interpret it correctly, I shall pay this year about is. in the pound, or a total of ^30 in income tax. It is a question of&#34; the interpretation of the Act. A gentleman I approached here looked up both Acts, and said, &#34; I should not care to interpret them; that is a matter for the Commissioner of Taxes.&#34; I may pay 6d., or I may pay is., but I shall say no more about the matter lest the Minister of Home Affairs, hearing the enormous sum he will have to pay to the State of Tasmania in income tax, should take fright or fall ill. It is not on behalf of the wealthy taxpayer that I am speaking now, but on behalf of the poor taxpayer who is in receipt of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 2s. a week. If a man in that position loses a day&#39;s pay it takes him six weeks to overtake his consequent indebtedness. Yet in Tasmania he has had to pay an ability tax in the past, and now has to pay an income tax. I also appeal to the House on behalf of the widows who, in Tasmania, are making incomes of slightly over &#163;100 a year by keeping small business establishments. They have to pay income tax. Surely if we are federated, as I hope we are, the wealthy States will come to the rescue of our little State. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that the system is bad, but the honorable member&#39;s interjection reminds me that I have a question to put to him, and to the honorable member for Franklin.&#39; Why did they not move in the matter last year when it was before the House ? Why did they sit quietly ir their seats when if they had made out the case which they have made out this year, they might have led the present Prime Minister to consider our claim favorably? They simply sacrificed their little State to save the Fusion party which they had joined. They cared not one iota for their State, but now they ask the House for a special grant, in order to inconvenience the present Government, and to enable them to mount the hustings next time, and say, &#34;Look what I did for Tasmania.&#34; If they were in earnest, why did they not do this last year when they had the opportunity? My task of obtaining a special grant for Tasmania has been made exceedingly hard by the action of honorable members representing Tasmania, not only here, but in another place. When they had the opportunity to vote for a special grant in the Senate last year, they did not do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> brought the matter up. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister of Home Affairs did not have the opportunity to move in the matter. He was then sitting in Opposition, and it was not his place to do so. The system of bookkeeping has been far from perfect, and through it Tasmania has lost considerably. It is also losing population owing to the progress the larger States are making. I am proud to say that Tasmania shows the highest birthrate of any of the States, and yet our population is on the decline owing to the rapid progress which Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia are making under Federation. Our young people, -who are the true wealth of the country, are being attracted into those States, and a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> return will not benefit us as it will the richer States, whose population is so rapidly increasing to the detriment of our own. I hope that it is not too late for our little State to be helped, but I fear it is. From the little I know of parliamentary procedure, I fear that the suggestion made by the honorable member for Wilmot, will be ruled out of order when it comes before the House, and that when the Bill passes this House it will be finally dealt with, and we shall not have an opportunity to reopen the question. I have, therefore, very little hope that Tasmania will get any help from the Commonwealth, but I am sure that, had members gone deeply into the question, they would certainly, as a matter of justice, have given us more than a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> return of 25s. Trade with the west coast of Tasmania, as I pointed out the other day, is practically in the hands of Victoria; we bring profits to Victoria and New South Wales, and I appeal to the representatives of those two States to give some consideration to the claims of Tasmania in dealing with this measure. I do not intend to take up the time of the House further than to say that at the Brisbane Conference no reference was made to the proposed <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> return being embodied in the Constitution, or to paying a fixed sum to the States for all time. I have the report of that Conference, and shall be pleased to hand it to any honorable member who desires lo read it. A perusal of it will show that the Conference had no intention of urging that the arrangement which it proposed should be placed in the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- Some of the members? Some one has said, &#34; Give me the liberty to utter, to argue, and to answer freely according to conscience above all liberties, &#39; &#39; and I say that the Labour party enjoys that liberty. Although I have attended every caucus, I never saw this Bill until it was placed on the table of the House. The same may be said of our party generally. We have perfect confidence in the Government we have elected, and we hold them personally responsible for the measures they bring down. We are not responsible for them. If the Ministry went out of office to-morrow, I fail to see that we should be called upon to retire from the seats we now occupy. Why should we be held responsible for anything that the Government do? Honorable members on this side of the House are as free as, if not freer than, the Opposition. I had the pleasure on one occasion of travelling to New South Wales with a gentleman with whom I engaged in conversation, and eventually we became friendly enough to allow of my asking whether he was a member of any Government. &#34; No,&#34; he replied; &#34; if I were, I should be only one man in the House, but at present, when  1  pull the strings, nine men jump.&#34; Who is the freer man - the man who is here with no-  thing to lose, or the man who is running a big business, and has, perhaps, a big overdraft with one of the financial institutions of the Commonwealth ? We know how hard it is to be free when one is running a business, and certain men can bring certain pressure to bear. </para>

                            <para>- I shall do so, sir. This is a big financial question, and I was diverted from my line of argument by the statement of an honorable member opposite that the Labour party had no freedom - in other words, that we are mere automata, working as we are instructed. I hope that honorable members will rise to the occasion, and give the little State of Tasmania something more than the mere <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> allowance of 25s. per annum. </para>

                        <para>.- As this Bill has been discussed fairly and well by honorable members on both sides of the House, I do not propose to speak at any great length ; but there are one or two matters connected with it which the Prime Minister has not made as clear as he might have done.I should like, at the outset, to congratulate the Government upon having brought forward this measure so early in the session. That, I think, is their due. I gladly and heartily congratulate them, believing that the measure is one of the utmost importance to all the States, and that <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> time should be lost in passing it, so as to settle, for at least ten years, the financial relationship of the Commonwealth with the States. The time limit is certainly too short, but, I suppose, that we cannot hope for more at the present time. Old members will recollect very well the difficulties which State Treasurers have experienced from year to year in preparing their Estimates, because of their inability to determine with any degree of certainty what revenue would be forthcoming from the Commonwealth. With the passing of this Bill that difficulty will disappear to some extent, and that fact alone should induce honorable members to assist in passing it into law as soon as possible. One of my objections to it is that its operation ought not to be limited to a period of only ten years. The Prime Minister the other day spoke freely of his generosity to the States, and while he was in that generous mood I think that he might well have proposed to provide for this <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment extending over a period of at least fifteen, if not twenty, years. I am given to under stand, however, by some honorable members who have spoken, that there is a possibility that this allowance may not be paid to the States for even ten years. The Prime Minister has assured us that, so far as he is concerned, he will protest against any change being made before the end of that period. </para>

                            <para>- I did not mean to convey such an inference; but I do feel that if the majority of the members of this Parliament had business to attend to that was worth looking after they would not be here. Whilst I object to the proposed <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> allowance being limited to a period of ten years, I presume that the Opposition will have to take whatever the Government chooses to give, and to be thankful for it. This Bill, to my mind, has not been well drafted, and appears to me to be contradictory in terms. We have the statement in plain language in clause 4, that the Braddon section, under which the States are to receive at least three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue until 31st December, 1910, shall cease to  operate six months before the time limit attaching to it. That clause reads - </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>The Commonwealth shall, during the period of ten years beginning on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and ten, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, pay to each State by monthly instalments, or apply to the payment of interest on debts of the State taken over by the Commonwealth, an annual sum amounting to Twenty-five shillings per head of the number of the people of the State. </para>
                    <para class="block">Under that clause, the Bill would come into operation as from the1st July of this year, and the provision in question contemplates the payment to the States of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> In this connexion, I desire to ask the Prime Minister one or two questions in the hope that he will be able to make the position clearer than he did the other day. Under clause 4, I repeat, the Bill will become operative as from the1st July. But section 87 of the Constitution, which is known as the Braddon section, provides for the return to the States of three- fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue until the 31st December next. I wish, therefore, to ask the Prime Minister whether the States will receive their full three-fourths of that revenue during the first half of the present financial year ? </para>

                            <para>- Those who supported the agreement which was entered into between the late Government and the State Premiers desired to have that agreement embodied in the Constitution. But the electors refused to ratify it, although it could have been eliminated from the Constitution at any time by the self same electors. However, I am not so dissatisfied with the Bill now that I have the assurance of the Prime Minister that for a period of ten years it is certain the States will annually receive from the Commonwealth 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline></para>

                    <para>Mr.R. EDWARDS.- I think that more reliance may be placed in the honor of the Commonwealth Parliament than the honorable member&#39;s interjection would appear to suggest. I wish now to ask the Prime Minister whether the States will receive 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> from the Commonwealth during the second half of the current financial year? 1 am somewhat anxious about this point, because it has been rumoured that they will not. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill is not as explicit as it ought to me. It is badly drafted. I regret that, because I think that measures submitted for our consideration ought to be drafted in as explicit a form as possible. In the absence of the Prime Minister, perhaps the Attorney-General can tell me whether it is proposed to return to the States 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> from 1st January to 30th June, 191 1? Will there be no deductions made? As the Attorney-General does not reply, I put the question to the Minister of Trade and Customs? </para>

I take it for ganted, therefore, that upon the termination of the Braddon section of the Constitution the 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> will be paid to them. In other words, that payment will begin on the1st January, 1911. As the Prime Minister has now returned to the chamber, I ask him whether, during the second half of the current financial year, the States will receive in full 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> as provided by clause 4 of the Bill ? </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister ought to know better than I do, but I still think the States would succeed on such an issue. I regret that the &#163;450,000 is to be deducted from the States&#39; share of Customs and Excise revenue, and do not think that the Prime Minister has shown much generosity towards them. He tried to impress upon us how very generously he was dealing with the States, but his generosity certainly does not go to very great lengths. Rather does his treatment of them tend in the opposite direction. However, the principles of the Bill have been thoroughly threshed out, and the sooner we pass the second reading the better. I do, however, once more appeal to the Prime Minister to deal with the States, after a full consideration of their claims with as much generosity as he can afford to do. </para>

                        <para>.- As this Bill is likely to pass and to remain on the statute-book in substantially its present form for a number of years, I desire to make a few remarks explanatory of my views and attitude concerning it. During the recent election I was one of the strongest supporters of the Financial Agreement, and did my best to secure its adoption. I am glad to say that in my constituency I was able to secure, not only a majority for myself, but also a majority for that mode of settlement. The Financial Agreement is now, however, a thing  of  the past, and, as practical politicians and statesmen, we must make the best of the means and opportunities at our disposal. Subject to certain comments which I shall make upon the form of the Bill. I welcome it as the nearest obtainable equivalent to the ill-fated Financial Agreement. There are three elements in the Bill to which I desire to draw attention as being somewhat approximate to the fundamental provisions and principles of that scheme. First, there is the principle of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> allowance; secondly, there is the 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> amount; and, thirdly, there is the element not of constitutional stability, but of parliamentary continuity within the period of ten years. Those were, no doubt, the broad outlines and the organic principles of the Financial Agreement. The claim has been put forward this afternoon that the principle of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> allowance originated with the Labour party at the Brisbane Conference. That is not historically accurate. As a matter of fact, the principle of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution of the surplus revenue was considered by the Federal Convention at its first session held in Adelaide. A proposal was put forward there that the surplus revenue should be distributed <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> among the peoples of the various States ; but objection was strongly taken to that principle by the representatives of some of the States, especially New South Wales. It was held by them that owing to the vast revenue that would be received under the Federal </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Tariff, a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution would be hardly fair to New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder, on behalf of South Australia, gave his approval to the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> principle, and said that he believed it would prove to be fair. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, then Premier of New South Wales, said that he would agree to a sliding scale ending in a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system after ten years. So that those leading members of the Convention were advocates of the principle of a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution after a certain time - that is, after the expiration of what is known as the book-keeping period, which was limited to five years. This Parliament could have brought into operation the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> principle at the end of the five-years&#39; period. But, unfortunately, parties were so distributed, and opinion was so divided, that we could not arrive at any settlement of the question. Then came the Financial Agreement arrived at by the representatives of the late Federal Government and the State Premiers. That agreement recognised the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> principle for the first time in this Parliament. Consequently, it is hardly fair to say that the Labour party at the Brisbane Conference was the originator of this system. At any rate, I believe that we are now unanimously agreed as to the 25s. and as to the mode of distribution according to population. I welcome this Bill also, because I think it is a manifestation of a desire on the part of the Ministry and the Labour party to do some measure of justice to the States in the distribution of the surplus revenue. It is also, I consider, a refutation of some of the misrepresentations made, and objections urged, against the Financial Agreement during the last election. I believe that the agreement suffered defeat to a very large extent owing to misrepresentations, and to some extent also through misapprehensions and misunderstandings as to its possible results and its probable effect upon the finances of the Commonwealth. In some quarters, the very strongest objections were urged to the amount of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> It was said that that was too large. The honorable member for Lang has quoted to-day the strong argument that was pressed by the present Attorney- General in Sydney, to the effect that 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> would lead to the Commonwealth revenue being unduly strained and straitened. No doubt that argument went a long way. There were columns of articles in some of the newspapers urging that the payment of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> would mean that the Commonwealth would be crippled, would be leg-roped, would be manacled, would be starved, and would be unable to carry out such national works as the transcontinental railway, the taking over of the Northern Territory, and the establishment of the Federal Capital. It was urged that we would be short of money for defence purposes. All these arguments no doubt told in the minds of a considerable number of Federal electors, who thought that the Commonwealth had better have the benefit of the doubt. Accordingly, they refused to ratify the agreement. I should like to know what has become of the great outcry that was raised against the agreement based upon (the necessities of the Commonwealth? We do not hear it urged now in the House that 25s. per head is too much. It is not said now that we shall be short of money for the Northern Territory or the transcontinental railway or the Federal capital or for Defence purposes. There is a remarkable silence on that side of the House, as to the possible shortage of Federal funds. Apparently we are all going now merrily and strongly for the 25s. per head. We hear a murmur here and there that it is not sufficient; but very little is said now under the heading that 25s. per head is toomuch. </para>

They further contemplated the revenue from the issue of bank notes as a part of their policy. It cannot be said that the Commonwealth can pay 25s. better now under the Labour policy than it could under the late Ministerial policy. Therefore, to <inline font-style="italic">some</inline> extent the Ministry are to be complimented on the promptness with which they have dealt with the question, and their desire to remove all doubts in the minds of the State Governments and State Parliaments. It is only fair that they should know at the earliest opportunity what are to be their financial rights under the new <inline font-style="italic">regime. It</inline> is said by the Prime Minister that this is practically a crystallization or re-enactment of the Financial. Agreement. His intention may be such, but I hardly agree as to the possible realization of that. Under the Financial </para>

                    <para class="block">Agreement we proposed to shorten the period of the operation of the Braddon section by at least six months. That was an important feature of the agreement which cannot possibly be realized by this Bill. An attempt is made in the form of the Bill. I admit, to make it appear to the general public that the new arrangement will begin on and after 1st July of this year. I do not know how the Government propose to do that, except in the cutting down process of the last six months, as was suggested just now. I fail to see how the arrangement can possibly begin on1st July. It cannot possibly begin until1st January, 191 1, because the Braddon section is still in operation, and will automatically require the Treasurer to pay to the State Governments monthly their three-fourths share of the net Customs and Excise revenue. Therefore, I agree with those honorable members who have said that it would have been far more straightforward, consistent, and in harmony with the Constitution, had the Treasurer stated straight out, &#34; This is a ten years&#39; agreement, to come in force on1st January next.&#34; That would not have prevented him from deducting the amount which he claims to deduct as representing the shortage or the deficiency for the past year. I agree with him that it is only fitting and proper that that deduction should be made at some time or other. That could have been made within a ten years&#39; period, beginning on1st January, without the Bill assuming its present form. As it is, the Treasurer will be in a difficulty. Under the Bill there will be two appropriations operating.&#39; First there will be the month&#39;s appropriation of three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise from month to month under the Constitution, which goes on automatically and cannot be stopped. Secondly, it may be contended by some smart lawyers that in the Bill there is a second appropriation of 25s. per head, because it says - </para>

Those were his troubles, and they can give the Minister trouble before it is over. During the balance of the operation of the Braddon section - that is up to the 31st December, 1910 - I fail to see how he can carry out his honest desire and intention of abolishing Inter-State certificates. Certainly it will come very hard upon the smaller States if they are abolished. As a representative of Victoria, as a Federalist, and as a public man, I would very much like to see the principle of absolute freedom of trade introduced right off if it can possibly be done by the abolition of those certificates. </para>

                            <para>- On the lines of this Bill the honorable gentleman will begin the abolition of Inter-State certificates. There is to be no record of InterState trade since 1st July last. That may be a very good, desirable, and nice thing ; but what about the consuming States such as Tasmania, Queensland, and South Australia, which are to a large extent dependent upon the great States of New South Wales and Victoria for their supplies ? </para>

                            <para>- It seems to me that it would be fitting and proper to keep the old system in force until the new system can be brought into operation. With a half-and-half system it will be difficult to say what the rights of the States are. I approve of a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution, and would have welcomed its adoption long ago. had it not been for the Braddon provision ; but, as that provision must operate until the end of this year, it would be better to wait  until it has expired before making a change. We have the assurance of the Prime Minister, on behalf of his party, that the legislation now proposed is to remain the law of the land for ten years at least - that is, during the life of at least three Parliaments. It is not to be changed at&#34; the will of chance majorities from session to session, or from Parliament to Parliament. That gives the States a certain amount of security. The last Government held the view  that the States would not have sufficient security, and would be unable to launch into  enterprizes  to be carried out over a number of years, if their revenues were liable <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be affected by the policies of changing majorities in the Federal Parliament, and, therefore, it thought that the Financial Agreement should be embodied in the Constitution. During the electoral campaign we had the greatest difficulty in convincing the public that it was not intended that the arrangement come to should last for ever. It was argued that, if put into the Constitution, it would be unalterable, but the intention was simply that it should remain in the Constitution until a majority of the people, voting in a majority of the States, decided &#34;that there should be an alteration. Had the people determined to put the agreement Into the Constitution, they could at a later date have taken it out again. If the people put a provision into the Constitution, that provision can be taken out again at the will of those who put it there. When addressing my constituents, I said that I thought it probable that the proposed agreement, if embodied in the Constitution, would remain there for ten or fifteen years. I did not suggest that it would last longer. By the end of that period, the requirements of the Commonwealth may have so largely increased that the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States will have to be reviewed. I did not dream of the continuance of the arrangement for twenty-five or thirty years. As to the argument that an agreement put into the Constitution has to remain there in perpetuity, it must be remembered that the Constitution makes this Parliament supreme in matters of finance. Were the Financial Agreement -embodied in the &#39;Constitution, and were it to be discovered later that the Commonwealth was not receiving enough revenue to meet its requirements, this Parliament could, should the States raise any objection to the reconsideration of the financial position, impose a land tax, an income tax, a stamp tax, or other direct imposts. That position was put by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dugald</inline> Thomson. He pointed out that, were an objection to be raised to a proposal to amend the Constitution with a view to allowing the requirements of the Commonwealth to be met. this Parliament would be the master  of the situation, because it could say to the  Governments  of the States and to the State Parliaments, &#34; If you will not allow a re- arrangement, we must exercise powers of direct taxation, which we do not wish to exercise unless you make it necessary for us to do so.&#34; It would be most disastrous were any political party to endeavour to foment disputes or jealousies between the various governing bodies existing under our Constitution. The State Parliaments and Governments have their proper share of activity, just as this Parliament and Government have their proper share. I do not think that the Prime Minister and his party will ever make it part of their policy to foment such disturbances as 1 speak of. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the leaders of parties in the Federal Parliament should set a good example, and should not sanction anything like a war against the States, because the State Parliaments, as well as the Federal Parliament, are representative of the Commonwealth. I wish to say that, backed as this Bill will be by the assurance of the Federal Labour party that it is to remain on the statute-book for ten years at least - and to that statement I hear no dissent - the States will have the benefit, to a large extent, of the constitutional security which we proposed to give them under the Financial Agreement. With that guarantee and security, this proposal for the payment of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> is open to the objection of rigidity and inelasticity which was raised against the Financial Agreement by the Labour party and the opponents generally of that agreement. It is, in the circumstances, a matter for congratulation that we have been able out of the wreck of the Financial Agreement to secure in this Bill an alternative which, if it does not satisfy some of the advocates of the agreement, may be regarded as a not inconsiderable instalment of what they expected and desired. I hope, in conclusion, that the Prime Minister will remember the objections raised to the form of the Bill, and will not insist upon passing it in its present form, pretending, so to speak, that the agreement will come into operation as from the1st July last when it will really be made to operate from the 1st of January next. If an agreement for nine and a-half years, or for only nine years, is meant, why not say so? A great and important instrument such as this, intended to operate for ten years at least, should on the face of it be clear and unmistakable. It should not be open to any quibbles, doubts, or ambiguities. The States should know clearly what their position under it will be. It is obvious from the criticism offered in various parts of this House, and by various State authorities, that the provisions of this Bill, even after this debate is concluded, will not be clearly understood, and it is suspected in certain quarters that there are some ambiguities in it, and that it is not as clear as a great and important instrument like this ought to be. </para>

The honorable gentleman Will recognise that he is proposing the repeal of section 4 of the Surplus Revenue Act of 1908.  That  section provides machinery for crediting revenue and debiting expenditure and for the payment of balances to the several States. The Treasurer has said that he intends to observe section 87 of the Constitution - I am assuming that no arrangements are made with the States - and I should like to know upon what basis the honorable gentleman proposes during the next six months to pay monthly to the States their proportion of three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise? </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable gentleman&#39;s question, of course, involves the whole of the bookkeeping . system. The Government propose, on advice of course, to abandon the whole of the Inter-State certificates of the bookkeeping system immediately this Bill becomes law. They think that the provision made in this measure is ample and secure. It will enable them to keep account of the whole of the revenue collected, and to make dead sure that three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue will, during the first six months of the current financial year, be paid over to the State Governments if they demand it. But, as I mentioned in my speech on the second reading of the Bill, in view of the fact that not very long ago the whole of the State Governments agreed together with the Government of the Commonwealth to the repeal of the constitutional provisions requiring the payment to the States of three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue, and so enable the Federal Government to begin the payment of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> as from the1st July of this year, they might very well, if they desire a good result to follow their labours, come to some agreement with the present Commonwealth Government. I do not wish to enter into any controversial matter, but, as it affects the question raised, I should like to mention that I was approached by the Premier of Victoria, in view of my public promises, and  he  informed me that he was ready and willing to consult with the Commonwealth Government, and to come to an arrangement. He thought, after that interview with me, that it was worth his while to go. to Sydney and interview <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade.</inline> He subsequently returned to Melbourne, and came to see me again. He asked if the  17th  June would be a suitable time for Commonwealth Ministers to meet State Ministers. I said that it would be a most inconvenient time for the Government of the Commonwealth, but that I was quite ready and willing to meet State Ministers to discuss the matter on the conditions laid down. The conditions were the fulfilment of the pledges of myself and the Government to the people of the Commonwealth. That was communicated, I understand, to all the Premiers, and subsequently there ensued the correspondence which Has been laid on the table. I am advised by the authorities who are competent to advise me that what is here proposed is the proper way of dealing with the matter ; and it is the desire and wish of this Government, and all the Governments, together with the traders and the people generally, to have the Inter-State certificates abolished as useless, unnecessary, and as retarding trade and industry. That can be done in the way proposed as soon as this Bill is passed, or by. another measure if it is desired. </para>

                        <para>.- I am glad that the Prime Minister realizes what I am trying to show - that we ought to know, in case of difficulty, where the States stand and where the Treasurer stands. We are all agreed, I think, as to the advisability of abolishing any machinery which interferes with Inter- State trade. But supposing that during the next six months, owing to some misfortune, the Government are not able to make any arrangements with the States, and the Braddon section continues to operate, the States being entitled to three-fourths of the revenue, what is the basis on which the States are going to be paid during that period of six months? If we keep section  4  of the Act, revenue will have to be credited, and the expenditure debited, according to certain lines. If we delete the bookkeeping sections, must not there be some machinery provided for the next six months, in case the States should not fall into line with the Commonwealth, to determine what the States are to get? If the Prime Minister will look through the Bill, he will find that he is not providing for that contingency. He provides for the payment of monthly instalments, by which the States shall not get more than  -25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> in the twelve months. These, he says, he will adjust to comply with section  87.  The adjustments should be made monthly; but section  93  and section  89  of the Constitution have been superseded by the Surplus Revenue Aci  1908.  During the next six months, when the monthly adjustments are being made, some principle for payment must be adopted. Will it be the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> principle&#39;? </para>

                            <para>- Ultimately ; but during the next six months what are the States to expect, and on what basis? I suggest that the consideration of the clause should be postponed. I raise the point simply because there is a difficulty presented. For instance, if the Premier of Queensland desired to know on what basis the payments would be made during the. next six months - whether <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> or on crediting revenue, debiting expenditure and payment of balances to each State - what answer would the Prime Minister give? </para>

                            <para>- That may be proposed, but is it being not laid down as a matter of law? What we are most concerned about, and what the States may want to know, is how the Treasurer proposes to distribute the balances, and will it depend on the basis on which he is going to keep his books? If the Treasurer is satisfied that the course he is taking is correct, I am satisfied that I have done my duty in raising the point, but it would be just as well for him to consult&#39; the Crown Law authorities on the point.. It may be that, either way you take it, it does not make much difference in the end. </para>

                        <para>. - If we turn to the Constitution for a Little light on the point, which was new to me until submitted by the honorable member for Darling Downs, we find by section 94 that, after a period of five years from the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, &#34; The Parliament may provide, on such&#39; basis as it deems fair, for the monthly payment to the several States of all surplus revenue of the Commonwealth.&#34; Parliament made such a provision by the Surplus Revenue Act 1908, of which we are now repealing section 4. It contains the whole of the provisions made by the Parliament for the distribution of the surplus revenue in accordance  with the Constitution. If we sweep away that section, no provision by Parliament, &#34; on the basis that it deems fair,&#34; remains, so far as I know. Section 4 provides for the Commonwealth crediting each State with revenue, debiting each State with expenditure, and paying over each month to the States the balance of revenue over expenditure, on a certain basis. It provides also a definition of new revenue, directs what is to be done with duties of Customs in certain cases, and defines payment to trust accounts as expenditure. All this goes. Nothing is proposed by the Government to be substituted for that section. Consequently there will be no provision of this kind by Parliament for the distribution of our revenue during the current six months. The Treasurer, of course, can during the following six months adjust his payments to fall in with his own design of paying only  25s.  per head for the whole financial year, if he still thinks fit to do so. That is another matter, we are not now concerned whether it is right or wrong. But for the current six months the Treasurer appears to be sawing off the branch on which he and other Treasurers for the last nine years have been sitting. He should appeal to Parliament to authorize some provision for the distribution during the six months of the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue which, under the Constitution, he must return to the States. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. I think the honorable member for Darling Downs is right in his suggestion that the wholesale repeal of section  4  of the Surplus Revenue Act will necessitate the introduction of other provisions. I do not think it is fair to press the Treasurer to look into a new point of this sort at once. </para>

It provides for the amount of one-fourth which the Commonwealth may retain for its own purposes, and for the other three-fourths which the Commonwealth must distribute to the States, but it does not lay down what principle must be followed in allotting that three-fourths between the States for the next six months. The principle of distribution must be laid down by Parliament. The Treasurer will shortly have an opportunity of putting this point to his legal advisers, and, if he so desires, the clause can be postponed. </para>

                            <para>- My impression is that what the draftsman had in his mind was that we are only collectors of the Customs and Excise revenue, and that our power to spend is limited to one-fourth. We collect under section  86  of the Constitution. and under section 87 can spend one-fourth. Three-fourths must be given back to the States, and, as the bookkeeping clauses have been abolished, it does not matter much to the States one way or the other whether these provisions in the Surplus Revenue Act 1908 are repealed or not, because we can only distribute the balances in the way in which we have been paying them hitherto, <inline font-style="italic">i.e., per capita.</inline> We have now stopped crediting to each State the amount of revenue collected in each, and debiting them with the expenditure pf the Departments taken over, but, independent of that provision, which is contained in section 89, and of the provision in section 93 which has been repealed, there is the provision in section 87 by which we hold as. trustees for the States three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue, and it is on that point that the question has arisen. </para>

I merely make the suggestion that it might be well if there is a doubt to make this measure to come into force on a date to be fixed by proclamation. </para>

I am pleased that the honorable member for Angas shares my view, although he puts his opinion very delicately, saying that he &#34; thinks &#34; the provision is&#39; all right. As a layman, I believe that it. is. and in that view I am fortified by the statement that the Crown Law officers are satisfied that there is no better way of securing what we desire, and of doing away with the bookkeeping system, than that which we propose. </para>

                        <para>; - Owing to the way in which this . Bill is drafted, it is difficult to understand how&#34; the Government propose to d1stribute, the Customs and Excise revenue in accordance&#39; with the principle which has been in operation since the establishment of Federation.&#39;&#39; Under the bookkeeping system we have&#39; credited to each State all revenue received, and debited against each State all expenditure incurred within it, and I fail to see how that system is to be carried out under these provisions. The difficulty has arisen owing to the desire of the Government to make this Bill come into operation before the expiration of the Braddon section. Had the Government proposed that it should take effect as from ist January, 191 1, the provisions of the Surplus Revenue Act could have been repealed as from that date; but the Government desire to bring this Bill into force six months before there is any legal power to make it effective. It cannot be made effective so far as the annual payment of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> is concerned until 1st January next, and the whole trouble arises from the determination of the Government to try to drive a coach and four through the Constitution. I agree with those who have spoken that it is inadvisable to repeal section 4 of the Surplus Revenue Act until we can get something in  its place. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to talk airily about the States agreeing to the Government&#39;s proposal, but I doubt whether they have power to come to such an agreement. The State Governments could not invade the Constitution by merely saying, &#34;We will take 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> during the remaining six months of the present year, instead of our proportion of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue due to us.&#34; Each State Parliament would have to pass an Appropriation Act providing that any amount over 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> per annum may be retained by the Commonwealth during this six months&#39; period. </para>

                            <para>- I think so; but, after all, it would be a very clumsy method of dealing with the matter. There would be great difficulty in inducing the six State Parliaments to pass such a measure. The whole proposal on the part of the Government is clumsy, and cannot be readily understood.I fail to see what their object can be. The present system will expire on 31st December, and a new system can then be instituted. As it is, the Government are creating a difficulty, and I am convinced that the matter will not end here. The Prime Minister may say, &#34; It is all right; &#34; but if section 4 of the Surplus Revenue Act be repealed, we shall have no basis on which to proceed. Three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue will be available to the States under section 87 of the Constitution, but how is it to be distributed ? </para>

                        <para>. - I must congratulate the Treasurer or his officers upon having presented to Parliament one of the most extraordinary financial conundrums that has even been put before any legislative body. I have read the Bill over and over again. I have had a good deal of experience in reading Acts of Parliament, but I must confess that the position has already presented itself to me in at least two or three different lights, and I do not yet know which is the correct one. I would like the attention of the Prime Minister for a moment, because, after all, we are merely dealing with a matter of form, and, so far as our work in Committee is concerned, we all desire to assist the Government to put the Bill in a form in which it will give effect to the Intention which the House has affirmed by agreeing to its second reading. Let me put one or two of the difficulties that I feel in connexion with this matter. As I intimated during my remarks upon the motion for the second reading of the measure, the object of clause 4 seemed to me to be to provide that during the whole of the current financial year the Commonwealth should return to the States 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> but should it be obliged to return them more than that amount during the first half of the year, it should be enabled to strike a balance by returning them less during the second half of the year. Is that the view of the Prime Minister? </para>

                        <para>The Commonwealth shall, during the period of ten years beginning on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and ten, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, pay to each State by monthly instalments, or apply to the payment of interest on debts of the State taken over by the Commonwealth, an annual sum amounting to Twenty-five shillings per head of the number of the people of the State. </para>

                    <para class="block">Suppose, for example, that we wish to arrive at how much ought to be paid in Queensland. Under that provision we inquire, &#34; What is the population of Queensland?&#34; The reply is, &#34; Half a million.&#34; We then have to ask ourselves, &#34; What has the Commonwealth to return to Queensland ?&#34; The answer is, &#34; 25s. per head, or &#163;625,000 per annum.&#34; How is that to be paid? By monthly instalments. Therefore the Commonwealth, during each month of the financial year, must pay to Queensland one-twelfth of &#163;625,000. That is what the clause provides. For- the current six months of the financial year the provision is really in the nature of a parliamentary appropriation. One-twelfth of 25s. per head must be paid monthly to Queensland. Let the matter stand there for a moment. Queensland may say, &#34;Oh, that is all very well, but section 87 of the Constitution is in existence until 31st December next, and under that the return to Queensland of a great deal more than 25s. per head is guaranteed.&#34; Therefore, during the first six months of the present financial year, the proposed monthly appropriation will go for nothing. The declaration is tantamount to saying that we will pay a portion of our debts. Of course we will. The Constitution provides that during that term we must pay to Queensland a great deal more than 25s. per head. Now, the Treasurer must obey. an Act of Parliament as well as the Constitution, and under this Bill he will be required to pay monthly to Queensland during the first half of the current year one-twelfth of 25s. per head, whilst under the Constitution he will be bound to return the difference between that amount and the three-fourths share of the net revenue from Customs and Excise. That is the extraordinary way in which the matter is put. I have always maintained that in the settlement of this financial question we ought to exercise the powers which have been directly vested in us by the Constitution, without any agreement with the State Premiers or with anybody else, and that we ought to exercise them as authorized by the Constitution, that is, from the 1st January next. But for some reason or other, the Government have chosen to say, &#34; We are going to initiate this scheme as from ist July of the present year.&#34; </para>

But we are concerned with what the effect of this Bill will be if it becomes law. Under it the Treasurer will be obliged to pay to Queensland 25s. per head for the ensuing six months. But the Constitution also imposes upon him the obligation to return to that State the difference between 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> and her three-fourths share of the net revenue from Customs and Excise. The Bill does not provide any parliamentary authority regarding the method in which that difference is to be distributed. </para>

                            <para>- That is admitted. Assuming that the Bill becomes law, the Treasurer will have his authority to draw a cheque monthly for one-twelfth of the amount represented by 25s. per head in the case of all the States. But the States are entitled, during the present half-year, to three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise, and, therefore, Queensland ought to receive more than 25s. per head during that period. Where does the Treasurer derive any authority to return to Queensland any portion of that sum, how much is it to be, and in what manner is it to be returned? </para>

It does not declare that it must pay to Tasmania so much of that balance in proportion to its population. Neither does it affirm that the Commonwealth shall pay the amount monthly to Queensland or Tasmania. Consequently, the Treasurer must come to Parliament to obtain the necessary authority to pay its proportion of the balance to Queensland, and to prescribe the mode in which the payment shall be made.

But in this Bill we are not dealing with the Commonwealth revenue at all. We are&#34; dealing with the three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue which must be returned to the States. It will be seen, therefore, that clause 6 of this measure has nothing whatever to do with it. I entertain the highest respect for the gentlemen whom the Treasurer has been consulting - the Law officers of the Crown.

One of them is that he intends that the  25s.  per head, the payment of which is to commence from the  1st  July in the present financial year, is to cover all the payments to be made to the States during the whole year. </para>

                            <para>- And that, if we have to pay more than that in the first six months, we are to make it good by paying less during the second half of the financial year. That is one intention. I have dealt with it before on its merits. But assuming the intention to be right, I say that  clause 4  does not give effect to it, because  it  says that you are to pay by monthly instalments 25s. per head in the first six months, and then the Constitution comes in and says that, in addition, you have to pay the surplus amount to the States. In the second half of the year you would not be able to cut down the 25s. instalments. You must still go on. According to that view, the intention of the Government will not be carried out, if I can read the clause at all. The second point is that this Bill gives no parliamentary authority, no direction, no authority to the head of the Government, as Treasurer, to distribute amongst the States, in proportion to population, or in any other way, that very large sum - amounting to some millions - forming the difference arising during the first half of the financial year between the aggregate amount of 25s. per head and what will be ascertained to be three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue. Unless I can be shown to be wrong, surely the Treasurer ought to take time to have this matter investigated. The Attorney-General is not here. We have been offered no explanation of this particular crux. I can promise the Treasurer that, if he will give us an opportunity, I will render him every assistance in my power to frame a Bill to carry out the intention which the House has authorized in passing the second reading; but I have thought it right to point out the difficulties which present themselves to my mind. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that. I stated at the commencement of my speech that this Bill has presented several different meanings to me at different times. When I read it at first, I thought that the effect of clause 4 was to enable the Treasurer to subtract from payments made in the second half of the financial year the amounts more than 25s. per head which he was obliged to pay in the first half . That was undoubtedly the way in which the clause presented itself to my mind, and that was the basis of my former criticism. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that, if the Treasurer had made his meaning clearer in moving the second reading of this Bill, the debate would have presented a different complexion. At one time, like the honorable member who has just spoken, I thought that I had grasped the Treasurer&#39;s meaning, and the view just presented is that which I took. But something said by the Treasurer in his speech made me think that I was wrong. The position as it appears to me is plainly this: The Treasurer intends - and some of the legal members on this side of the Chamber say that that is what the Bill will effect - to carry out the terms of the Constitution during the current six months of the financial year by paying back three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to the States ; that is, if he does not - as he seems to assume that he will be able to do - effect some arrangement with the States by which they will fall in with his ultimate design. That ultimate design is simply this : Having paid to the States - in some manner which I can assure him that no legal member on this side can understand - three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue during the current half of the financial year, he is then going to pay, under the succeeding clause, a sum sufficient to make up the total of 25s. per head for the whole financial year. </para>

                            <para>- He will have no means of apportioning the sum. The clause takes away some of the machinery created by Parliament in place of the constitutional machinery with regard to the division of the &#34;three-fourths. If that be done, there will be no machinery left, either under the Constitution or in this Bill, to enable the Treasurer to apportion the three-fourths of the revenue between the different States. Consequently the Treasurer will be in this position&#39;: He will  either have to apportion the sum by some means of his own, month by month - because it must be month by month - or he will get himself into trouble with the States that will lead to litigation in the High Court. It seems to me that, if the Treasurer will only take the view of this matter which we on this side of the Chamber have advocated, and make the clause dealing with the 25s. grant date from the expiration of the Braddon section of the Constitution, the whole of the difficulties will vanish. </para>

                            <para>- Whether it is political or not, the suggestion offered will solve all the difficulties connected with a very vexed question indeed, and will enable the new financial arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States to be started on a fair and square basis, and one that will give ample satisfaction to the States, whilst leaving the Commonwealth, if in a somewhat hampered position for a few months, yet ultimately in a very fair position indeed. At the same time it will make this Bill what it ought to be, a model of clearness, for which we have precedents in some of our other measures. The honorable member for Darling Downs on Friday referred to the clearness and accuracy of the draftsmanship exhibited in Commonwealth Acts of Parliament. I am inclined to believe that the honorable member was quite correct in what he said. But if the draftsmanship of this Bill be clear, it certainly is draftsmanship that cannot be easily understood, except perhaps by some of the legal members of this Parliament. During the whole course of the present debate there has been a close critical discussion as to the exact meaning intended to be conveyed by the language of the Bill. It cannot be said to be a model of drafting which requires of the States - </para>

                            <para>- If we negative the provisions of the Surplus Revenue Act, as proposed by the clause, the Government will not have any directions from either the Parliament or the Constitution as to how they are to pay over three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue to the States from month to month during the first half of the financial year in compliance with the Braddon section. All that, however, can be obviated if the Government will see fit to extend further the generosity which I, for one, recognise they have exhibited in drafting the measure. They have shown admirable generosity so far as it goes, in complying with all their election pledges, and promises, in endeavouring to solve a very vexed question, and placing the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States on a fair and definite basis agreeable to both parties. If they will only date the new arrangement from the expiration of the Braddon section instead of dating it back six months, all these difficulties will vanish, and we shall start everything with a fair understanding, and in such circumstances as will do away with a vast amount of the friction which has hitherto existed. </para>

                        <para>. - I think, on consideration, that the Bill is right as it is. When I first read the clause I made a note that there was a doubt as to what was meant. What the honorable member for Flinders relies on mainly, I think, is that &#34;surplus revenue &#34; referred to in the Constitution is the difference between out one-fourth share of the net Customs and Excise revenue and our expenditure. I went to the Library to get the report of the surplus revenue case, but it is not there at the present moment. I think that in that case the High Court did not say that that was the definition of &#34;surplus revenue.&#34; I think it said that it did not decide that point, and could see no distinction between the surplus revenue dealt with in section 94, which is all the balances and the surplus revenue referred to in section 89. In other words, section 94 obliges the Commonwealth to hand back to the States the whole of the unexpended or unappropriated balances, and that applies after the expiration of the Braddon section, as well as before it. Before the expiration, the payment must amount to at least three-fourths of the Customs and Excise. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that the High Court laid down any limitation in regard to time. All it said was that so long as it was an expenditure which the Parliament was justified in authorizing an appropriation might be made for a period df, say, three or four or five years, so as to diminish the surplus, but subject to the payment of the three-fourths Customs and Excise to the States. But I do not think that it ever decided that surplus revenue is defined in the Constitution by necessary inference as being the difference between one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise revenue and the Commonwealth expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot help that. I do not think that there is an Act or decision to say that we are entitled to keep the whole of the revenue which does not come from Customs and Excise. What the Constitution says we are entitled to spend is, in relation to our powers of administration and legislation, all revenue received from any . source, subject for ten years to the payment of three-fourths of the Customs and Excise to the States. Any revenue in hand beyond that is surplus revenue which must be handed to the States. Had the Financial Agreement of las&#39;- year been carried at the referendum, that would have been put an end to, and then we would have had the power of retaining from time to time, subject to section 87, without appropriation, the unexpended moneys in our hands, and the States would have been entitled to nothing. But section 94 is not repealed by this measure, and the result is that we will continue to make payment to the States of surplus revenue from whatever source it may have come. The intent of the Bill is that we do not want to let the States see that we are not giving them 25s. per head from the 1st January, 191 1. By an ingenious method of drafting which reflects great credit upon the draftsman we say that we will pay 25s. per head from the 1st July of this year, less &#163;450,000 and subject to section 87. And after deducting our expenditure from whatever balance is in hand - and part of that expenditure will be &#163;125,000 to Western Australia as provided for in clause 5 - we shall make the ordinary deductions for the management of the Department which will no longer be affected by the bookkeeping provisions. Therefore all expenditure will become Commonwealth expenditure, and all that is deducted from whatever revenue we have in hand. The balance remaining is surplus revenue, and is dealt with under clause 6 of the Bill. If that balance, plus a payment of 25s. per head to the States, amounts to whatever sum ought to be paid under the Braddon &#34; blot &#34; for six months and under the 25s. per head provision for the balance of the year, then all constitutional requirements will be complied with. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Angas says that the Committee is indebted to the honorable member for Flinders for raising a second point. In my opinion, it is indebted to the. honorable member himself for his clear and lucid explanation of the position. He has put, not only the legal, but also the political, position, and I have no complaint about the language which he has used. The honorable member for North Sydney dealt with the question only from the political stand-point. He says that the Act should take effect from 1st January next, and that the Braddon section should have effect during the last six months of 1910. That would be intolerable. </para>

                            <para>- If so, the responsibility rests upon some one, and the consensus of legal and other opinion is that the effect of the Bill will be exactly what it says. It will permit the Commonwealth to pay to the States three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue collected during the first six months of the current financial year, and to adjust the finances for the second half of the year - from 1st January to the 30th June next - so that each State will have returned to it not less than 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> for the whole of the financial year. In my opinion, the Bill permits of ample justice being done the States, and I remind honorable members that immediately it is passed there will be absolute Free Trade between the States, unfettered by any bookkeeping embarrassments whatever. </para>

                        <para>.- The speech just delivered by the Prime Minister is actually more difficult to follow than the Bill. If we examine the Bill carefully for a considerable time, we may discover from it the intentions of the Government, but though we have listened to the Prime Minister for some minutes I defy any one to understand the reply he has given to what has been said on this side. Arguments by authorities who merit attention were addressed to the Committee on the legal aspect of the case, and the Prime Minister, jumping in where the Attorney-General fears to tread, does not reply to the arguments at all, but says that the Crown Law authorities, whose presence we are not privileged to have here, have told him that the Bill is all right. The honorable gentleman himself, in his legal wisdom, also thinks that it is all right, but as a lay member of the Committee I should like very much, in answer to the arguments to which I have referred, to have the opinion of the only representative of the law in the Cabinet. I do think the Attorney-General might answer what has been said upon a question fraught with enormous consequence to the Commonwealth ; because if we have to pay 25s. per head for the last six months of the coming financial year, in addition to three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue for the first half of the year, the Commonwealth will either be bankrupt or will have to raise the money by loan. I am sure it is not the intention of the Government to bring about such a state of affairs. I think the Attorney-General might take the Committee into his full confidence, and let us know, what the Prime Minister in the course of his speech was unable to do, what are the arguments behind the Government proposal to give us assurance that the position of .the Commonwealth in the matter will be absolutely, safe. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member will do- me the justice of listening to what I have to say, so far from suggesting that I am speaking for the Attorney-General, he will probably come to the conclusion that the Attorney-General does not agree with my contention. I understand that what we purpose doing is to try under this measure to reach the result which would have been reached under the Financial Agreement. We want to pay 25s. per head to the States from the 1st July of this year, and we desire also to deduct a sum which it was estimated would amount to &#163;600,000, but which it turns out now will amount to &#163;450,000. I am concerned to know whether under this Bill we shall reach the result at which we are aiming, and I am bound to say that I think there is more in the criticism of the honorable member for Flinders than has been answered up to the present. Clause 4 of the Bill says that- </para>

                        <para>The Commonwealth shall, during the period of ten years beginning on the 1st day of July, 1910, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides -  pay to each State, by monthly instalments, the sum of 25s. per head per annum. I understand from that that we desire to make two deductions. We desire, first of all, to deduct an amount of &#163;450,000, as set out in the schedule. We desire, in addition, to deduct for the first half of the financial year the difference between 25s. per head and three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. </para>

As I understand the position the States will stand by their rights under the Constitution. They will say that they want three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue for the first half of the current financial year. We cannot deny it to them. All we can say is that on the 1st January next we shall have complete control of the Customs and Excise revenue, and that if we choose to exercise it we can then get even by retaining in the second half of the year the amount in excess of 25s. which we paid them in the first half of the year. </para>

                        <para>. - A difficulty presents itself which has not been answered by the Prime Minister, or any honorable member opposite. In clause 2 it is proposed to sweep away all parliamentary authority as to the distribution of the three-fourths of the revenue from Customs and Excise under section 87 of the Constitution, and in clause 4 it is proposed to pay 25s. per head, and only 25s. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but the great difficulty which presents itself to my mind is that the difference between 25s. per head and three-fourths of the revenue from Customs and Excise is not surplus, for the simple reason that it does not belong to the Commonwealth, but belongs to the States, under section 87 of the Constitution. In this Bill there is no provision whatever for paying over the difference between 25s. per head and the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue. </para>

                            <para>- For ten years, as from the 1st July this year. What I cannot understand is why there is this straining at what I might call two negatives in order to state a positive. Why does not clause 4 state distinctly the two deductions straight away as from1stJanuary, 191 1, and in that way adjust the whole thing? That would make the matter plain and simple. </para>

                        <para>.- I understand that the position suggested is that the revenue is to be federalized, so to speak, on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis from the 1st July this year; but I should like to know whether the expenditure is also to be federalized? Is the expenditure to be apportioned on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis, or is it to be apportioned according to the expenses of each State? The Bill is silent on that proposition, and leaves it an open question whether the whole of the expenditure of the Commonwealth is to be federalized and paid out of the Federal Treasury, irrespective of the expenditure in each State, or whether the expenditure in each State is to be debited to and deducted from the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution in each State. </para>

                            <para>- The proposal was that there was to be a complete federalization of the revenue and complete federalization of the expenditure on a certain <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis; but the scheme before us seems to be silent on that point. If the expenditure is to be maintained on a State basis, then there arises the point which I made in my remarks, that it will be impossible to abolish Inter- State certificates until there is complete federalization. If the States are still to be debited with their respective expenditure in collecting this revenue, they ought to be secured the right and privilege of getting the whole of the revenue which is earned by consumption in each State ; but in regard to that the present scheme seems to make no provision. I am in favour, if possible, of bringing about the complete federalization of both expenditure and revenue ; and the Minister in charge of the Bill ought to say whether that is intended. </para>

                            <para>- Then let the honorable gentleman point out words in the Bill which provide for that. Our argument is that there are no words in the Bill providing for the federalization of the whole of the expenditure. It is proposed to wipe out section 4 of the Surplus Revenue Act, and nothing is said about the expenditure. It may be that the Commonwealth Treasurer, in the exercise of his administrative authority, may proceed to debit each State with its respective expenditure, and deduct that from its share in the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution. </para>

                        <para>. - The question raised by the honorable member for Bendigo is an important one. namely, the federalization of both the payments to the States and the expenditure in the States. In spite of the talk about Federal expenditure being adjusted on a State basis, it has never been actually so adjusted during the whole of these years. Fortunately in some respects, the Federal Parliament has been Federal from the first, and some States have got a large excess of expenditure compared with others. I hope that question will not be raised so late in the history of the Federation, and I did not expect it to be raised by the honorable member for Bendigo. </para>

I hail with satisfaction any settlement of this vexed question, and if we have to take the Government&#39;s proposal I am willing to do so. But I am with the legal gentlemen on this side who say, &#34; Let us understand what we are doing. Do not let even the Government make a blunder that will lead them into trouble.&#34; Under this proposal the Government may find themselves faced with this position, that the Law Courts may decide that under the Constitution and under this Bill they will not only have to pay back three-fourths of the revenue to the States, but will have to pay month by month 25s. per head. </para>

Seeing that this Parliament has the power to review and settle every provision in the Constitution affecting the  relations between the States and the Commonwealth, we ought to make one settlement of the whole of them at one time, and that time is at the expiration of the Braddon section. Make what arrangements you like, no matter how easy or how hard they are on the States; but tide over the time between now and then, and when you get to that point solve the whole block of them - including section 94, which  I  have held all along ought not to be left there, and without which you would not want clause  6  of this Bill - by a commutation of the whole arrangement for the payment of 25s. per head for ten years. We shall then have something that he who runs may read; but at present we have before us a Bill on which there are almost as many opinions in this Committee as there are men. </para>

                        <para>. - I  had &#34;not the advantage of hearing the honorable member for Flinders, and am therefore in a little difficulty as to the precise point that was taken, but so far as  I  understand it it amounts to this, that the Bill abolishes the bookkeeping sections of the Constitution, but does not say how or in what proportion the three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue under the provision of section 87 is to be returned. If that be the point, then it is necessary to emphasize the distinction between section 87 of the Constitution which deals with the aggregate minimum to be returned, and sections 89. 93, and 94, which deal with its distribution. This Bill substitutes for those sections a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution. From the date of its passage there is a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution, which, until 31st December, 1910, is to be of not less than three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue, and thereafter during the currency of this measure not less than 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> per annum. As to whether it is advisable to legislate in advance of the expiration of the ten years&#39; period, or whether section 87 by the word &#34;thereafter&#34; purports to limit the right of this Parliament to legislate in advance, that, with all respect to other honorable members., is a matter- </para>

They will be not one penny piece the poorer for any legislation such as this. We cannot take from them one penny that is their due, and the whole question, as the Treasurer has frequently pointed out, is simply whether we should take it from there when we have a right to take it, after the first day of the coming year, or whether they should not, seeing that we and they are partners, do what is proper by making allowances for the position. The whole thing is simple, and  I  do not see why, in the circumstances, there should be any hesitation on their part or doubt on ours. As to our right to deal with the matter, and the manner in which the three-fourths is to be paid, it was laid down clearly by the Chief Justice in the judgment of the High Court on the Surplus Revenue Act, as reported on page 190 of volume VII. of the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Law Reports,</inline> that for certain reasons given it is impossible to hold that the balances are to be finally struck as of the last day of every month.

                        <para>But the real foundation of the claims of the States is, I think (although disavowed by the plaintiffs&#39; counsel), a notion that the &#34; financial year&#34; is part of the order of nature as regards government finance, so that the surplus must be finally ascertained and distributed at intervals not longer than a year. </para>

                    <para class="block">But that view was so clearly untenable that counsel for the States did not openly advance it. What we are proposing to do is to* substitute for the method of distribution laid down in section 93. a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution. That must, under section 87, operate in such a way as to give the States not less than three-fourths of die net Customs and Excise revenue for the remainder of the current calendar year, and thereafter not less than 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> The remark of the honorable member for Richmond that the Bill does not provide for the allocation of surplus revenue, because the three- fourths is not surplus revenue, is not correct. It is perfectly true that the three-fourths is not surplus revenue, and it is what the States are entitled to under section 87. When, therefore, &#34;surplus revenue &#34; is spoken of in the Bill, the words do not and cannot refer to the three-fourths, which has to be paid to the States until  31st  December of this year. They refer to the difference between the Commonwealth&#39;s share and the Commonwealth&#39;s expenditure, which, unless appropriated, will be surplus revenue, and must, under the ruling of the Court, be paid over to the States before the  31st  December,  1910.  After that date all revenue beyond  25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> plus that which is expended or appropriated by the Commonwealth, will be surplus revenue, and, therefore, will be dealt with in the way provided by this Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I recognise, and have always recognised, that on constitutional questions arising in the House we are ultimately bound to be guided by the determination of the Attorney-General. No matter what our opinions or the ultimate consequences may be, the House cannot be expected to transform itself into a Court to decide questions of law as between lawyers who take up different views. The Attorney-General is the authority of this House. Believing that, I should have been quite prepared to submit to the decision which he has given without making any further observations, but for the fact that, owing probably to his absence during a considerable portion of the time devoted to the consideration of this point, he seems not yet to have grasped or to have fully considered the difficulties which have arisen. I shall put again the two points that I raised, my only excuse for doing so being the vast moment and importance of the matter with which we are dealing. Hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of pounds are involved in the difference between our views. I stated, first of all, that I understood the intention of the Government was that the <inline font-style="italic">-per capita</inline> payment of  25s.  per annum should commence as from 1st inst. - that is to say, that it should cover the whole of the present financial year - and that, although we were obliged under the Braddon section, which must be observed until the end of the year, to pay more during the current six months, we should be enabled to strike an average by making a deduction from the payments during the last six months. The Treasurer assented completely to that view. I was therefore amazed when, later on, in answer to a statement by the honorable member for Werriwa - a statement which I feel sure the Treasurer did not fully grasp - he took up a diametrically opposite position. </para>

Committee should properly understand what is the intention of the Government to be embodied in this Bill. Was I right or wrong? Did I misunderstand the Prime Minister when I took him to assent to &#34;the position I have outlined? It has been repeated over and over again by the Treasurer during the discussion that it is intended to make from the payments for the second half-year the deduction necessary to bring down the average payment for the year to  25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> Is that so? </para>

That being so, and taking the intention of the Government to be that which I have stated, I wish to point out to the Attorney-General that clause 4 does not give effect to it. It provides, not merely that there shall be an annual payment of  25s.  per head, but that that annual payment shall be made by monthly instalments. </para>

                            <para>- That is in. re- &#39;spect of a provision in the Constitution, but here we have a clause providing that a certain annual sum shall be payable by monthly instalments - a sum which is to be calculated upon the basis of population. If Parliament directed the Treasurer to pay that amount by &#34; monthly instalments,&#34; what could it mean except equal instalments? Would it mean that the Treasurer could pay one penny in respect of one month and  &#163;500.000  in respect of the next? Clearly not. If the Treasurer knows his own mind, there ought to be no difficulty in making his intention perfectly clear. Do  not let us put on the statute-book a provision bristling with legal difficulties. Let us make it clear now. Surely the Treasurer is not going to stand upon pique, or to consider this a political attack which must be defeated. Surely his officers and the Attorney-General are capable. of removing any doubts which exist. It seems to me to be clear that the intention expressed by the Treasurer will not be carried out <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> clause 4. What will be done will be this : The Treasurer will have to pay, monthly, proportional parts of the sum determined, upon the basis of population, to be payable during the first half-year, and he will have, in addition, to pay the difference between that and what becomes due under the Braddon section. He will not be entitled, however, during the second half of the year, to make the deduction requisite to bring down the payments to the average of 25s. per head per annum. The Attorney-General has not dealt with that point. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Flinders has deliberately stated that T ought to know what is in my own mind, and that the honorable member for Werriwa understood me to tell the Committee that the Government would have power, during the first half of the present_ financial year, to make certain deductions from the three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue payable to the States under the Braddon section. I never uttered words that would convey that impression. I had never such an idea in my mind, and the honorable member for Werriwa did not understand me to make such a statement. I have said over and over again that there shall be paid to the States for the . first half of the financial year - during which the Braddon section will remain in operation - a sum equal to the full three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue due to the States. That payment, however, will be made subject to the one possible qualification that I have mentioned again and again, namely, that some .of the States, of their own volition, will probably take steps to allow the Commonwealth to retain more. That will be their own act, and will have nothing whatever to do with us. The misunderstanding, I venture to say, never arose in the minds of any large number of honorable members of the Opposition. </para>

                            <para>- It need not be so. If the States stand honorably to the propositions which they have put before the country it ought not to be so. They ought to pass Bills through their Parliaments authorizing the Commonwealth Parliament to make use of the whole amount of the Federal revenue, subject to the return to the States of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> But if they do not adopt that course, the result will be the same, because I believe that this Parliament will authorize the Government to give legal effect to the will of the people. That is all that I wish to say upon the matter. _ Its legal aspect I leave others to deal with. I have never made any statement different from that which I have just made, as reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will show. The monthly balances will be adjusted as nearly as it is possible to adjust them in relation to the different States. </para>

With whatever may have passed between the Treasurer and the honorable member for Werriwa, I am not concerned, but certainly the remarks of the Treasurer have made clear the position which he took up in moving the second reading of the Bill.

                        <para>I should be more stupid than I look if I thought that we could pay less than three-quarters of the net Customs and Excise revenue to the States during the first six months of the current financial year. I am under no such hallucination. But, at the same time, it is, I presume, a right thing for this Parliament to pay that amount during the first half of the financial year, and then during the second half arrange the payments in such a way as to enable the net 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> to have been paid to the States during the whole of the financial year. </para>

                    <para>Mr.W.  H.  IRVINE.- I should like to proceed with my exposition of the difficulty which confronts the Government, at the point at which the Treasurer Began his personal explanation. In the quotation which I have just made, he clearly stated the intention of the Government. With the. merits of that intention I have nothing to do. But under this Bill he will be required to return to the States, during the first half of the current financial year, 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> plus the difference between that amount and three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. During the second half of the financial year his intention is to deduct from the monthly contributions to the States the amount necessary to bring down the total average payments during the year to 25s. per head. </para>

                            <para>- No. To do justice to the Treasurer I have always understood him to put the position as I have just stated it. But it is a position to which this Bill will not give effect, and for the reasons which I have stated. I ask the Attorney- General for an answer to my contention. The Bill can very easily be made to give effect to the desire of the Committee. I am not going to cavil at language if it clearly expresses the intention of the Government. The only other point which I raised when I previously addressed the Committee was that under this Bill we shall entirely wipe out the provision relating to the distribution as between the States, of the three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. We shall wipe out the whole machinery of the Constitution and also that which has been substituted for it. </para>

                            <para>- That is precisely what the Bill does not do. The <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution applies only to the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth, and if there is one thing which the Attorney-General has made clear, it is that the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth does not include the three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue which is payable to the States. Therefore, the provisions relating to the distribution of the surplus revenue do not touch the particular subject with which I am dealing, namely, the difference between the 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> and the three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. The Bill deals with a contribution of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> which is only a portion of that revenue. The remainder is left unprovided for. Neither the Constitution nor the Surplus Revenue Act, which this Bill will to some extent repeal, nor the Bill itself, makes any provision as to how the Commonwealth shall pay that difference, or in what proportions it shall be paid to the several States. The Government require parliamentary directions in this matter - why not take them? Why not frame the Bill in such a way as to make it give specific directions? The Committee have a right to have these legal difficulties removed, apart altogether from questions of policy. It is true that questions of policy have been introduced into this debate by some honorable members, but by none more than by the Prime Minister himself. I put to the Attorney-General the two points which I have raised, and which seem to me to require explanation. Another point has been put by the honorable member for Bendigo which did not occur to me, but which seems to carry equal weight with the points which I have raised. The Constitution provides the mode in which the apportionment to the States of their share of the Customs and Excise revenue shall be determined. It sets revenue against expenditure, and under the Surplus Revenue Act that disposition has been continued with slight modifications. But under this Bill it is proposed to wipe out that Act. . If the Government are attempting to federalize our revenue, they are making no provision for the other side of the account, by which to arrive at the amounts which will be payable to the States. Without unduly pressing Ministers upon the matter, I think that we are entitled to have these points made clear. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish that I were able to see the many exceedingly subtle points which the honorable member for Flinders has raised, as clearly as he himself sees them, and as clearly as I feel sure a number of honorable members opposite are endeavouring to see them, although I venture to say they are not meeting with that degree of success which might be expected of them. In my opinion, there is no difficulty and no inconsistency in this, Bill. There is nothing contradictory in clause 4. Two points require emphasis. The Bill cannot affect the provisions of section 87 of the Constitution before 31st December next. The three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue must be returned by the Commonwealth to the States until 31st December of the present year. Twenty-five shillingsper <inline font-style="italic">capita</inline> per annum must be paid to the States as from the1st of July, 1 910. Now clause 4 provides for both of these things being done. It says - </para>

                    <para class="block">Very well ; since this Bill is to take effect as from the1st day of July, 1 9 10, the Commonwealth cannot pay at the rate of the 253., if that is less than the three-fourths of net Customs and Excise revenue, until after the 31st day of December, 1910. Section 87 of the Constitution prohibits that, and clause 4 of the Bill is not inconsistent with the Constitution. But, after 31st December, it can pay at the rate of 25s. per annum. Now, since the arrangement starts on the1st of July, 1910, all the Commonwealth has to do to comply with section 87 of the Constitution and clause 4 of this Bill is to pay 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> in the year that starts on the1st July, 1910, and ends on the 30th June, 191 1. And there is nothing in clause 4 that regulates the amounts to be paid each month or during each six-monthly period. The Bill thus complies with section 87 of the Constitution, and also with the condition to pay the 25s. per head. The 25s. has to be paid during the year, and as from the 1st July, 1910. It is perfectly clear that if you pay 18s. out of 25s. before the expiration of this year, you will only owe 7s. during the six months of the year which starts on the1st day of January, 191 1. Clearly, then, this Bill does not violate the Constitution, nor attempt to take from the States anything to which they are entitled. If I agree to pay a man 25s. in a fortnight, and I am also bound by a prior agreement to pay him  &#163;1  in the first week of the fortnight, the second agreement does not necessarily conflict with the first at all. I pay him the pound when it is due. </para>

                            <para>- I am asked why not state the intention plainly. I contend that it does so. When I contrast the ideal clarity of the terms of this clause with some sections of Acts of Parliament, I stand amazed and reproved at having invaded that special preserve which affords the members of our profession such opportunities of profitably doing that which some honorable members have been doing gratuitously this afternoon. There is absolutely nothing in this clause inconsistent either with the Constitution or with the intention of the Bill. That is to say, we can pay the 25s., and we can pay the three-fourths. And we need not pay to any State which, as the Prime Minister puts it, demands its pound of flesh, a penny more than it ought to get. Each State will get just what it is entitled to, neither more nor less. The States cannot complain. They have no right to complain. Those rights which were given to them under section 87 of the Constitution remain unimpaired. When they contended that they had a right to monthly balances, the High Court held that they had no such right. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton, in delivering judgment, said - </para>

It would mean that in some months, when receipts fell below Federal disbursements, the Federal Treasury would have a debit balance, and therefore could not give the States anything with which to meet their needs. On the other hand, when the Treasurer found that he had received in a month a vast sum more than he had actually paid out for the purposes of the Commonwealth, he would have to pay the whole excess over to the States at once, knowing, perhaps that there were millions to be met the next month and, <inline font-style="italic">ex hypothesi,</inline> a depleted treasury to meet them. </para>

                        <para>.- With great regret I have to say that we are not getting any &#34;forrader.&#34; I do not propose to occupy any time in repeating or elaborating the argument against the legal effect or form of this Bill, since all the points suggested by the debate have just been admirably summarized by. the honorable member for Flinders. But let me ask honorable members to measure the divagations of the Bill by what is actually authorized to be done thereunder. In the first place it does not authorize, and it cannot alter, as the Attorney-General has just admitted, the primary obligation of the Commonwealth to pay three- fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue up to the end of this calendar year. That has to be done; it cannot be escaped. In the next six months of the year what is proposed is to pay to the States not 12s. 6d. per head for that period but some sum less, owing to deductions made from the three-fourths legally paid to the States, so as to bring their income clown to 25s. per head for the whole financial year under a method of calculation, less &#163;450.000. In the first six months the provision of the Constitution runs and three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue must be paid to the States. In the second six months something has to be paid less &#163;450,000, and therefore only after the 1st July, 191 1, is 25s. per head to be really paid, to the States without deduction. All the difficulty before the Committee, all this long argument, and all our misunderstandings are due to the fact that  for  some mysterious reason the Government wishes to draft this measure so that it may appear to authorize the payment of 25s. per head to the States from the 1st July of the present year. As a matter of fact, it cannot constitutionally do that and does not, in fact, do it. This is the whole point. Yet all that the Ministry desire to do might have been clone without question or delay. They had only to accept the provision of the Constitution, as they must do, until the end of the year. They had then to deduct &#163;450,000 in the first six months of next year and after that authorize the payment of 25s. per head for ten years. The whole of our difficulties to-night are due to the fact that instead of putting these three propositions plainly on the face of the measure, the Government, whose attention was drawn to this point during the debate on the Address-in-Reply, has thought fit to adopt a method of draftsmanship which has brought us face to face with three intricate questions as to the legality of the measure, to which the honorable members for Darling Downs, Flinders, Angas, Bendigo, and others have called attention. Is this worth while? It is for the Government to decide. We have nothing more to add. Why not frankly legalize their proposed action at once, getting rid of all this transparent pretence, which deceives no one, of commencing to pay the 25s. per head earlier than the Government intends to pay it? </para>

                        <para>. - I take no exception to the language of the honorable member for Ballarat or the advice which he has tendered. It is the business of the Opposition to criticise wherever they find loop-holes in Government measures. Its leader said that the honorable and learned member for Flinders had pointed out two or three defects, and he rested his legal case largely on that point. I would remind the Committee that another honorable and learned member, with a great deal more diffidence and humbleness - the Attorney-General in the previous Government - has expressed in legal language a very positive  opinion that the present drafting of the clause covers all necessities from a legal point of view. Expressing himself in quiet language, he said that it only bears that meaning. He did not speak dogmatically and say, &#34; That is the law and no other.&#34; He simply expressed his humble opinion on the point. That negatives the contention of the Opposition. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not press the point home. Speaking with the greatest respect to legal members on both sides of the chamber, in a matter of this kind&#39; I would lean more on the honorable member for Angas than perhaps on any other legal member, but that is a mere expression of opinion on my part. My present legal adviser sits here at my side. Were it not for that fact, I, as a layman, would have ventured to suggest that perhaps the term  &#39; surplus revenue &#34; covers the revenue referred to in the Braddon section as well as the rest. But that is subject to other matters. Ultimately, of course, somebody must take the responsibility, and it rests with the Government to do so. </para>

                        <para>- I am very sorry to prolong the debate, but I only want to speak for a moment or two. I was very pleased to hear the Prime Minister&#39;s statement. I assure him that I have no desire to obstruct or to unduly criticise, but I was under the impression that after the first six months of the present year - that is, after the Braddon section has expired on the 31st December next - any difference between the 25s. per head and the amount paid to the States under that section would be deducted during the second half of the year. </para>

                        <para>. - The intention seems to be to pay the States, during the financial year commencing 1st July last, at. the rate of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> The Constitution, however, requires that, until the end of 1910, they must be paid three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. I am afraid that 1he High Court, the final arbitrator, may decide that this measure is an attempt to over-ride the Constitution, and may compel us to pay to the States three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue for the first six months of the financial year, and for the second six months an amount equal to 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> according to their populations. Would it not be better to say clearly that, until the end of 1010, the States will be paid the three- fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue due to them under the Constitution, and that, from 1st January until 30th June, 191 1, they shall receive a sum - less the deductions provided for in the schedule - which, taken with the payments for the first six months of the current financial year, will make the total payments for the financial year equivalent to a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution of 25s. for the whole of the year? It seems to me that it would be safer to legislate in that way than to run the risk of being mulcted in costs for attempting to evade the Constitution. Personally, I think that we are treating the States very liberally. If I had my way. I would not do more than bind this Parliament. I think it would be. enough to provide for three years ahead. What is being proposed is to bind this and two subsequent Parliaments. Of course, the Government, having decided that the arrangement which is to be made is to stand for ten years, will be able to carry that decision into effect. It would be safest, however, to make our legislation date from the beginning of next January. </para>

                        <para>.- The time taken in discussing the measure tonight has not been wasted. By threshing out matters here, we may save their discussion in another place at greater expense to the country. The only doubt remaining in my mind is as to the meaning of the term &#34;monthly instalments.&#34; The honorable member for Flinders contends that it means &#34;equal monthly instalments.&#34; </para>

                            <para>-  If the contention of the honorable member for Flinders is incorrect, the Bill does what we wish to do. If we have the right to pay to the States &#163;1 <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> during the first six months ot the current financial year, in order to comply with the provisions of the Braddon section, and 5s. <inline font-style="italic">pet capita</inline> during the second six months, the Bill effectuates our purpose. It is with considerable diffidence that I put my opinion against that of the honorable member, but I cannot think that his contention, that the term &#34; monthly instalments &#34; means ,: equal monthly instalments,&#34; would be upheld. </para>

                            <para>-  It depends entirely on the context. In section 93 of the Constitution, &#34; monthly instalments &#34; could not mean equal instalments. That was decided by the High Court in the surplus revenue case. But, as used in this clause, the term&#34; monthly instalments&#34; could not mean anything but equal instalments, because, after fixing a definite sum to be paid during the year, we then say that it shall be payable in monthly instalments. </para>

At the same time, in deference to the doubts that have been raised by legal members of the Committee, I feel that it would not be a bad thing to insert a further clause to make our meaning a little more clear. Having a doubt about the matter, it is better that we should make sure now rather than run the risk of having our doubts resolved against us. It seems to me that it should not be difficult to draft a clause directing the Treasurer in paying these instalments to pay during the first half of the year so much in excess of 25s. per head as will make up the three- fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue which will be due to the States under the Braddon section, and to deduct an equal amount in paying the instalments for the second half of the year. Personally, I think it would be well to give the matter a little further consideration. </para>

                        <para>. - I think it is quite wrong to read into the reference to monthly instalments in this Bill anything more than is read into the equivalent words of sections 89 and 94 of the Constitution. In section 89, the reference is -  shall pay to each State, month by month, the balance - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">In section 94, the reference is -  may provide for the monthly payment. </para>
                    <para class="block">It is very clear in the light of the judgment  of.  the High Court in the surplus revenue case that that does not mean equal payments. The dictionary meaning of &#34; instalment &#34; is just as clear as is the dictionary meaning of &#34; payment.&#34; That is to  say,  that unless it is qualified by a term that comes before it &#34; instalment &#34; does not connote equality in any  way.  In fact, it is a common thing in connexion with agreements for the purchase of land on a time- payment principle to say that there shall be a payment for so many months of equal instalments. There is nothing in the Bill to lead one to attach to the word &#34; instalment &#34; as used here anything more than attaches to it generally: I think I might explain the difference between &#34; payment &#34; and&#34; instalment &#34;  in  this  way:  The word &#34; payment&#34; is properly used in sections 89 and 94 of the Constitution, because it relates to an unknown amount of money. The word &#34;instalment&#34; relates to a definite amount - namely, 25s. per head of the population. There might be no payment at all under section 94 of the Constitution, but if there is it must be paid, not by equal monthly payments, but monthly. I submit that &#34;instalment&#34; is the proper word to use in relation to this specific amount of 25s. per head. There is absolutely nothing in the terms of the Bill which should force one to attach to it the meaning suggested by the honorable member for Flinders. &#39;That meaning really cannot be attached to it, because, as I pointed out by way of interjection, to do so would make clause 4 <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> It clearly could not have effect, because it would mean that we could not fulfil the terms of section 87 of the Constitution. If we paid the 25s. per head in equal instalments clearly we should pay during the current six months less than three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. I submit that the difficulties in this matter are only those which have- been created by the remarks of honorable members on the other side, and whether one views the matter from the stand-point of constitutionality or from the very much more important point of equity to the States, this Bill gives effect in the only way possible to the terms of the agreement arrived at between the State. Premiers and the last Commonwealth Government. There is no other way by which effect could be given to the terms of that agreement without throwing the affairs of the Commonwealth Treasury into headlong confusion during the next six months. That I am sure would not be desired for a moment. There is nothing in the wording of these clauses to alarm honorable members. In my opinion, they are perfectly in order, are constitutional, and are adapted to the purpose we have in view. </para>

                            <para>- Why should we put&#39; ourselves in that position? I have never yet heard this point argued, except by the laymen of the Chamber, in which category I am ; and it seems to me the more we look at. it, the more we ought not to have the power to put through a Bill like this. I take the view that we have no right, either by legislative act, administrative act, or in any other way, to do anything which will have the effect of undoing one day&#39;s operation of section 87 of the Constitution. However, the legal gentlemen of the Chamber say that we can antedate this Bill, and make it begin six months before the date of the expiration of the Braddon section; but I fancy that if I were the Judge of a Court, I should have a question or two to put to the Attorney-General if he appeared before me. When the case was put that, in the second six months, only 2s. 6d. or 2s. 7d. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> had been paid to the States, I should, if the Judge, ask why that was so; and there could be but one answer, namely, that because &#163;2 per head. let us say, was paid during the previous six months, the present course was taken in order to get round the difficulty. That is the only truthful answer that could be given to the Judge; only the truth would be spoken if the reply was, &#34; Your Honour, we are trying to evade this provision, which is broad based in the Constitution ; it is our way of getting round the legal difficulties in which we find ourselves.&#34; </para>

My honorable friends are trying to get round the electors now, I venture to say, in what is being proposed. &#39;There was a straightforward statement made to the electors that the States would be guaranteed for ten years a payment of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> and this Bill, on the face of it, attempts to do that to a certain extent. The Bill says distinctly, in clause 4, that there will be an annual payment made to the States by monthly instalments at the rate of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> That, I take it, is the clear meaning of clause 4, but it seems that the Government are going to do nothing of the kind. After declaring, in the clearest language, that they are going to pay the States an annual sum of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> by monthly instalments, the Government show that the real purpose is to pay the States for half a year at the rate not of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> but of only 5s. 2d. or 5s. 3d. <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline></para>

                            <para>- That is precisely what I do say, and the Government will have to go to the Judge and say, &#34; Your Honour, the reason why we are paying only 2s. 6d. in the last half-year is that we complied with the Constitution in the first half, or, in other words, we are taking this from the States, although we had to give it to them at the time.&#34; That is the position in a nutshell ; and how this can be accounted a straightforward transaction, I am at a loss to understand. Here is the place where the Government can make their Act of Parliament a truthful statement of their intentions as expressed on the platforms of the country. The only thing the Prime Minister can say, it seems to me, either here or in a law court, is that he cannot do what the Government promised the people of Australia - that they are not going to give them the 2 5s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> for ten years, though ostensibly doing so, but propose to give them only 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> for nine and a-half years, and at the rate of 5s. 3d. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> for the first six months of the period. This is not a period of ten years, but a period of only nine and a-half years; and for a portion of the period the States are to be paid at the rate I have mentioned. </para>

                        <para>.- One part of the reply of the Attorney- General struck me as particularly valuable to the Committee at the present juncture. The honorable member referred to the fact that the instalments could, under this Bill,  be  paid in unequal amounts during the course of the year, to any States, provided the States received the full amount  of  25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> in the year. How  is  that going to affect the finances of Australia and the general Government agencies that are absolutely essential to the wellbeing of the people, whether those agencies be operated by this Parliament or the Parliaments of the States? Almost as important as getting the money to any governing body that wishes to remain solvent, is getting it in even proportions and amounts,  so  that they may know what they have to expect.  What  is going to happen in the future with regard to the Bill should be pointed out now, because it seems to show the necessity for more definite and clear machinery than the Bill embodies. If in the latter half of this financial year we may give the States something less than 2s. 6d. per head in order to make up for the excess they have received in the first six months, equally properly - if that is proper - we could, in the next nine years, give any State the same amount in the first month, practically nothing the next, more the third, and so forth, right through the year. If the amounts are going to be paid unequally for the next nine or ten years, a very serious state of affairs will be brought about by the Bill. If the instalments are not to be regular equal instalments, it will be within the power of any party which may happen to be in control of the Federation to bring to its knees any particular State Government with which they happen to be in disagreement. </para>

I shall not labour the question, because we are bound to accept the opinion of the Attorney-General in all matters of this kind. He has accepted the responsibility, from which neither himself nor his party can escape. If I viewed the matter from a party point of view, I should be delighted at his action in assuming responsibility for an Act of this kind, and throwing upon his party the onus-- </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has had so little responsibility until lately that he is almost as greedy for it as I used to be. The Attorney-General is putting&#39; his party into a false position by refusing to make the meaning of this legislation abundantly clear. If it fails, and if after the new year Parliament has to be suddenly called together to put the matter right, in the eyes of the people the Attorney-General will stand in the dock of public opinion as a person unfit to take charge of legal technicalities, because he refused to alter a single line of a BiU to make its. meaning clear. If his opinion is wrong, and the opinion of others more versed in the law is right, and if, in defence of Commonwealth rights, not State rights, and to safeguard Commonwealth solvency, Parliament has to be called together after the new year to repeal this legislation, not only the Attorney-General, but the whole of his party will be held convicted of a very stupid piece of business - a piece of stubbornness which has landed them in a mess and put the country to the expense of calling Parliament together unnecessarily. 1 am not going to beat the air. We have placed our views forward, and it is not our fault if the Attorney-General accepts, on his own behalf, and on behalf of his party, the complete responsibility for such a contingency as that which I have hinted at,c,and which, I think, will arise. </para>

                        <para>.- As I .have been engaged for about twelve hours to-day in parliamentary work I do not intend to deal with this question at length. In listening to the arguments, I have been reminded of the statement of the honorable member for Parkes that the law in t&#62; the essence of common sense, and also of a statement by the beadle Bumble in <inline font-style="italic">Oliver Twist</inline> that &#34; the law is a ass.&#34; Those who have listened to the debate to-night will have great difficulty in deciding which authority is right. 1 heard the honorable member for Angas&#39; with a great deal of interest, but I did not like his statement that the Bill was an ingenious attempt at pretending to do something that was not intended. When, before the electors, I pledged myself to support a Bill guaranteeing the States 25s. per head per annum for a period of ten years in substitution of the Braddon section, I am still of opinion, after what has taken place tonight, that the best thing for the Government to do would be to state clearly in the Bill that  they  propose to abide by th&#34;. terms of the Constitution and pay the States three-fourths of the net Customs  and  Excise revenue up to the end of this year, and then commence afresh. Let them deduct the &#163;450,000 if they insist on deducting it, but let us make a commencement from 1st January, 1911. </para>

They did their level best to keep me out of the House, and would do it again if they could, and I am not at all influenced by their cheers, although they might be encouraging to people who have not been in politics as long as I have. But I heard the Attorney-General to-night express a doubt. He said that although the Government had power to do what they proposed to do in the Bill, if there was any doubt they were entitled to receive from the State Premiers the same consideration as would have been given to the member*  of the Opposition if they had remained in power. May I remind the Attorney-General that he must expect no mercy from the State Premiers? </para>

                            <para>- From the majority of them. The Government have received very handsome treatment from the Victorian Government, and I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> will be only too glad to fall in with any reasonable arrangement, but honorable members must altogether dismiss from their minds the agreement which was proposed last year by the Premiers and the late Government. It was smashed at the last election, and it can only be taken into consideration by the House in deciding what is fair to put in the Bill. But Ministers and the House will have to consider that there must be no loop-hole whatever in any legislation we pass, or else some opponent of the Federation will take us to the High Court. I should prefer to pay the three-fourths right to the end of the year, and even go so far as to give the States back the &#163;450,000. No doubt, with overflowing coffers, we shall be able to pay that sum. and it would be far better for the National Parliament to rise above any petty matters of half-a-million or so, and give the State Premiers and Treasurers, who may be opposed to us, nothing to cavil at. </para>

                        <para>.- On the point referred to by the honorable member for Capricornia. I did say that it was a very ingenious method of doing something that the Government wanted to conceal. I did not mean any disparagement, but was paying a tribute to the ingenuity of expression of the draftsman. The Government are now professing by this ingenious method of drafting to pay the States 25s. per head on the expiration of the Braddon section, and to comply with the terms of the Constitution, to pay the other amount until the end of this year. They are concealing the fact, although not deliberately, by an ingenious method of drafting that for the whole year the 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> may be made up of payments under section  8  7 to the end of the year. </para>

                            <para>- Not the validity. Although I have listened attentively to the debate, I have not altered the opinion I first expressed that the Bill will accomplish the intention of the Government. It will carry out the requirement of the Braddon section that the States shall receive three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue for the first six months of the present financial year, and it will give the States for the whole year, taking into account the payments under the Braddon section, 25s. per head. The one will be a compliance with the Bill ; the other a compliance with the Constitution. At the same time, this will not be a compliance with what the electors were led to believe was the Labour party&#39;s proposal to continue the Braddon section until the end of the present year, and for ten years thereafter to pay the States 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> per annum. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to say any more upon the question. The point was raised, during my absence from the Committee, that the payments made under the Bill must be by equal monthly instalments so that the power of the Government to take into account the amount paid during the first half of the year in making this payment of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> will be cut down. I do not think that that power is limited, nor do I think that the monthly instalments need be equal. In leases and other documents as a rule we have the words &#34;equal monthly instalments&#34; when the instalments are intended to be equal. </para>

                    <para class="block">To hold that the instalments must be equal would be to render the whole clause an absurdity, because if that were the position we could not deduct from the proposed payments the amounts set forth in the schedule. We could not deduct them in respect of die first half of the year because the Braddon section would prevent that being done; and if the deduction were made during the second half we should not be making a payment of 25s. for the whole year by equal monthly instalments. I therefore hold that the alleged check on monthly payments does not exist in the terms of the Bill and that the Government can during the next half-year cut down the payments to an amount that, having regard to what has been paid under the Braddon section during the first six months, &#39; will make the total payment for the year equal to 25s. per head. </para>

                        <para>. - With the exception of the statement made by. the honorable member for Flinders, nothing has been advanced that affects the validity of this Bill. Several honorable members have declared that we are going to give, not for ten years but for only nine and a-half years, the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> allowance of 25s. per annum. It appears to me, first of all, that what we are going to do under this Bill is exactly that which we have promised ; that we are proposing to do .it in a way which the Constitution will permit; that the States will not be deprived of any revenue, and that in the circumstances we are clearly entitled to expect that the Bill shall receive the assent of the Committee. </para>

                        <para>. - I have only two or three remarks to offer in reply to the Attorney-General. My recollection of what he said during the recent election campaign is quite contrary to the statements to which he has just given utterance. The honorable gentleman said during the campaign, in the most unequivocal terms, that his party pledged themselves to return to the States for a period of ten years 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> per annum. As a matter of fact, under this Bill they will do nothing of the kind. They are pledging the Government to give 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> for nine years. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard that for the first time since I came back to this House. It is not what the honorable member told the people of New South Wales. He promised definitely that the Labour pr.-;; would give the States 25s. per head per am. \n for ten years after the expiration nf the Braddon section. That is not what he is proposing to do under this Bill. The more I think over this matter the more I am convinced that, if the question is tested, the High Court must rule that whatever is done subsequent to the expiration of the Braddon section must have no relation, in the way of modification, to what has been done during the operation of the Braddon section. The very purpose of this Bill is to modify the ten years&#39; period during which, under the Constitution, the Braddon section must operate. The Bill has no other purpose. If the law is a canon of common sense, as laid down by the honorable member for Parkes, it seems to me that that is a result impossible to obviate. </para>

                            <para>- I am not concerned with the ingenious drafting of the Bill. Apparently, there is no great fault to be found with it by the honorable member. The Leader of the Opposition has contradicted my statement that a date for the initiation of the Financial Agreement had been mentioned by the Labour candidates in South Australia. I repeat that they emphatically fixed the date as the 1st July of this year. They advocated the substitution for the Braddon section of the Constitution of a provision authorizing the return to the several States of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> for a period of ten years. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. But perhaps I may be permitted for a moment - only for a moment - to overlook Western Australia, and to reply to the statement which was made by the Leader of the Opposition. Honorable members on this side of the House have just had thrown at them, by the honorable member for Parramatta, the suggestion that a proposal of a most dangerous character is now being submitted, and that the States are being interfered with in so shocking a manner as to offend the sense of justice of all the Judges of the High Court. </para>

                            <para>- That is practically what the honorable member alleged against the proposal which is now under consideration. We were told by him that during the first six months of the current financial year it is proposed to give a certain amount to the various States, and that during the second half of that year it is proposed to take so much from them. Thus he sought to convey to the public the impression that the proposal embodied in the Bill will take something from the States. It is true that under the measure the monthly payments may not be quite what they would have been had the agreement which was entered into between the late Government and the State Premiers been ratified by the electors and embodied in the Constitution. But if under that arrangement &#163;5,000,000 would have been returned to the several States during the financial year, under this Bill the same amount will be paid to them within the same period. The honorable member for Parramatta has alleged that the Government intend to make excessive payments to the State during the first half of the financial year, and to make certain deductions during the second half of that year. But I submit that when the balance is adjusted on the 30th June, 191 1, the same amount will have been paid to the States under this Bill as would have been paid to them under the agreement made by the late Government. </para>

                            <para>- There, of course, the honorable member has a distinct advantage over me, inasmuch as I do not know what the State Premiers said. Whatever they said was uttered in a secret caucus, of which I was not a member, and so far the Leader of the Opposition has not favoured us with the substance of their deliverances. I do not know what are the different considerations to which he alludes. But I do know that under this Bill the several States will receive, during the current financial year, precisely the amount which they would have received under the agreement which was entered into by the late Government. Further, that remark is applicable to a period of ten years. Why an honorable member should seek by specious reasoning to prove that honorable members upon this side of the Chamber are doing something which would shock the sense of justice of any Judge is to my mind incomprehensible. At the end of the ten years&#39; period it will be for the Commonwealth Parliament, in the light of the knowledge of the financial situation,, which it will then have, to reconsider the whole position. Of course I recognise that under the scheme propounded by the late Government that agreement would have been embodied in the Constitution. By the adoption of that course there would have been created in the States such a vested interest that a minority of about one in ten would have been able to withstand all the pleas of this Parliament and of the majority, and to have entirely ignored the difficulties which it imposed upon Federal growth. </para>

                            <para>- I do not desire to debate the subject generally, but in the circumstances I thought that I might be permitted to offer my opinion in reply to some of the general statements which have been made. Much of the difficulty seems to have arisen because of the attempt of the Government to make the Bill operative from the date suggested by honorable members opposite. Had they been content to continue to make the payments to the States in accordance with the provisions of the Braddon section till 31st December next, and had they during the succeeding six months deducted from the amounts returnable to the States such a sum as would have given the latter 25s. per head for the whole financial year, all this debate would have been obviated. The result would have been precisely the same. </para>

                            <para>- To my mind, the unfairness is in the allegation that this is not a straightforward way of doing what is in tended, especially as the honorable member is unable to deny that each and every State and the Commonwealth will, at the end of the financial year, be in precisely the same position under this proposal as they would have been under the proposal that he himself asked the electors to approve. Had the Government taken advantage of their power, instead of endeavouring to please honorable members opposite by placing in their Bill a statement to the effect that the 25s. payment shall start from the 1st July of this year, there would have been no debate. But we have here another instance to show how unfortunate it is when one side in politics proposes to do something which previously pleased the other side, because then the other side professes to be displeased. </para>

                        <para>.- The statement of the honorable member for Adelaide may be quite correct, that he stated on the platform in South Australia that the agreement that&#34; he and his party were prepared to make should start from the 1st July last. But I am afraid that all that he said to his constituents will not help us very much if this matter comes before the High Court and it is contended that we are contravening the Constitution by an attempt to get round It. </para>

                            <para>- If we pay three-fourths to the States until the end of this year, and then deduct from them so much that we do riot really pay them more than 25s. per head for the&#39; twelve months running from the 1st July last to the 30th June next, we may be contravening the Constitution by endeavouring to do indirectly something which we could not do directly. The High Court may say, &#34; You shall not do by indirect means what you cannot do directly.&#34; Then, again, if the monthly instalments are not to be equal, the whole field is left very wide. We are going to pay to the States a&#39; fixed amount. That amount is known beforehand, because it is to be based upon the census to be taken on the 31st December next. If that arrangement does not bind us to equal monthly instalments, I should like to know what it does mean. This is a serious matter. It is not a party affair. We are trying to pass a Bill which should do credit to Parliament. If we are overruled by the High Court, we shall place the Commonwealth in a worse position than it would otherwise occupy. It would&#39; suit the States to have our legislation overruled, because, until we could pass another Act of Parliament, they would be entitled to the continuance, under the Braddon section, of payments which would be more than we are prepared to make to them. </para>

                        <para>. - There is a great difference between the proposal of the Bill which was submitted to the people at the referendum and that to which we are now asked to agree. The Premiers representing the States made concessions in order that the Financial Agreement might be embodied in the Constitution. The clause under consideration proposes to repeal certain legislation passed by Parliament to effect the distribution of revenue to the States. The Government propose to pay 25s. per head per annum. The point has been raised that they have not provided the machinery to deal with the apportionment of the revenue hereafter. The honorable member for Adelaide says that the opposition is based on political motives. It is not so in my case, because I am prepared to approve any reasonable arrangement to settle the difficulty. I state at once that the1 proposal of the Government is a reasonable one ; not perhaps so reasonable as I should have hoped to get, but that is another matter. Are the Government satisfied that the provisions of the Bill will give effect to their intention? The arguments to the contrary have been clearly put from this side. With all due deference to the Attorney-General, whose ability in dealing with general questions is well known, I hold that he has not given any clear answer to satisfy the Committee that the Government are even carrying out their own intention. After the second reading of a Bill has been affirmed, our duty is to make its provisions as perfect as possible. Now the question is, will this clause carry out the intention of the Government. Certain discrepancies have been pointed out by legal members on this side, and the Attorney-General has been asked to specifically answer their objections. He has risen and made a declamatory address, hut he has not answered them in any&#39; sense.  1  for one now wash my hands of all responsibility, which of course the Government must take. I have been in no way actuated by party hostility to them. I desire to see this question settled, and, even though the Government&#39;s proposal may not be what I should like altogether, still I am prepared to accept it. But I am unable to see that the provisions in die Bill will carry out definitely, without fear of controversy in the High Court, their intention. </para>

                    <para>. - It will be remembered that on a previous occasion the members of this House were called upon to consider a Sugar Excise Bill and a Sugar Bounty Bill. Very great difficulty was then experienced, because it was not possible to discuss one Bill without referring to the other - the two measures were inseparably connected. If a general discussion could take place- on this motion, it could cover the whole ground of the two Bills and thus save time. I suggest that at this stage progress might be reported, and that on another occasion the Minister should place the whole question fully before the Committee so that a general debate could take place on his statement. </para>
