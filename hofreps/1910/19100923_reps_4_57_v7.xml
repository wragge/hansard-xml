                        <para>- During the last Federal election difficulty arose in some places because of the differences between the Commonwealth and the State electoral systems, especially regarding methods of voting. We passed an Act to enable cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States in this matter, and I wish to know from the Minister of Home Affairs whether the negotiations commenced by his predecessors with a view to bringing the Commonwealth and State administrations into harmony, especially as regards registration, appointment of officers, and methods of voting, are being continued. If not, will the honorable gentleman press forward with the matter as much as he can ? </para>

                    <para>. - I would like to ask the Attorney-General for information. Does he intend to rely on the definition of " Land " in the Acts Interpretation Act? In several of the Acts dealing with land taxation to which 1 have referred, the term " Land " is defined, but this Bill contains no such definition, and, in the absence of a definition, presumably recourse will be had to the Acts Interpretation Act, section 22 of which declares that " Land " includes messuages, tenements, hereditaments corporeal and incorporeal, and tenures of any description, and whatever may be the estate or interest in them. This definition is somewhat similar to that contained in the New Zealand Land Tax Act. Unless the contrary intention appears, that definition applies generally when the word is used in our legislation. The contrary intention is made known either by means of a definition, or by the context, or by the whole structure of the measure in which the word is used. In certain parts of the Bill the relations of persons holding interests in land are" defined, and the rights and position of parties in respect to them made known. That is so regarding joint tenures, husbands and -wives, companies and trustees, and we have "been informed that Crown leases will be -excluded. I should like to know whether mining interests and minerals come under the definition of " Land " in this Bill. Some of our mining is done on land leased from the Crown, but some, I understand, is done on freehold land. I think that part of the Mount Morgan property is freehold. </para>

                    <para>. - I submit that there is no room for uncertainty as to the meaning of "land." The honorable member for Darling Downs has referred the Committee to section 22 of the Acts Interpretation Act, where " Land " is thus defined - -  " Land " shall include messuages, tenements, and hereditaments, corporeal and incorporeal, of any tenure or description, and whatever may be the estate or interest therein. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>On that definition the honorable member seeks to show that there is some ambiguity as to what may be meant by a tax on un- . improved land values. But I ask the honorable member, what would be the unimproved value of an incorporeal hereditament? On the face of it there can be no unimproved value of an incorporeal hereditament ; and therefore, whatever the definition means, it does not mean that. Then it is very obvious that the unimproved value of a messuage or tenement is so much nonsense; and, therefore, the definition cannot mean that. What the definition means is what it says, though it seems to somewhat bewilder the Committee that the provisions of a Bill should be so clear. How, for instance, could there be a leasehold, fee-simple, or freehold for a term of years in an incorporeal hereditament? How could there be any unimproved value in any or all three of these tenures? Unimproved value can only relate to land as such ; it can relate to nothing else but the solid earth on which we stand to-day. If we go down into the bowels of the earth, the question is entirely whether the owners come under this clause or not. If they have £5,000 of value, and are not exempt as Crown lessees, they are liable, and not otherwise. </para>

But it is not confined to freehold estate, but goes on to give another class, as follows -  or (b) is entitled to receive, or in receipt of, or if the land were let to a tenant would be entitled to receive, the rents and profits thereof, whether as beneficial owner, trustee, mortgagee in possession, or otherwise ; and includes every person who by virtue of this Act is deemed to be the owner. </para>
                <para class="block">The important point is that this tax applies, not only to freeholds generally within certain values, but also to estates other than freeholds, namely, leaseholds, or estates held on certain other lesser rights. I take it that the words " in receipt of rents and profits," are wide enough to include all sorts of leases or licences issued by the Crown. </para>

                        <para>- That is the conclusion I drew, and this part of the Bill justifies the opinion. Now it seems that a modification is to be introduced, limiting the definition in regard to such lands, and the question is whether that limited definition will include such properties as mines, or the land over which tramways run, held on lease or licence from the Crown. I am not quite, sure as to the real effect of the amendment to insert new clause  26a,  of which notice has been given by the Government. The proposed new clause is as follows :  - </para>

I do not think it desirable to tax these institutions, seeing that they are in possession, under rights and agreements entered into with the State Government, and that their properties revert to either the State or the local municipalities at the end of their tenure. </para>

                        <para>- In most cases, so far as I know, at any rate, such is the fact in Bendigo, Ballarat, and Melbourne. It would be most unfair to increase the burdens of those institutions at the present time, and, indeed, it would amount practically to a breach of contract. However, I am not so much interested in tramways as I am in mining properties, and I contend that it would be most unjust to leave any doubt as to the liability of mining companies. </para>

                    <para>.- It is just as well to be perfectly clear as to what is meant. I have not much fear of any wrong being done under the definition of " Land," because the whole of the Bill seems to show that " land " means something physical. We could not, for instance, have a church built on an " incorporeal hereditament," and I do not think that, reading the whole Bill, there is much danger in the definition. I draw attention, however, to certain uses of the term "land," as distinguished from interest, in clause  44,  which deals with the compulsory purchase of land, and also to the confiscation clause  67,  in which a distinction is drawn between "land" and "interest." I merely mention this now because there seems to be something incongruous in these provisions. As regards leases from the Crown, I think the Bill, as it stands, does exempt them, notwithstanding the definition. I have no desire to split hairs about the meaning of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> of the definition of " Owner," but when we look at the subsequent clause, apportioning the liability, we see there no express provision as to Crown leases. It is an apportionment of the liability between the freeholder, and the leaseholder under the freeholder, and as they cannot be lessees from the Crown, and a Crown ownership is not a freehold, it is clear that any ambiguity in the definition of "Owner" is removed by the subsequent clause apportioning liability. It seems to me that this cannot apply to the Crown, but we need not discuss that matter, since the Attorney-General intends to insert an express declaration that the Crown is not taxed. </para>

                    <para>. -  I do not pretend to deal with the legal side of this matter, but wish to ask the Attorney-General to keep in mind such cases as the rights-of-way in mining districts. In the Newcastle District, as he is aware, one company has to pay another, in some cases up to1s. a ton, for a right-of-way over land. Land yielding a revenue of that kind would, I think, be assessed as particularly valuable, although it might be only a mere strip. The value would, probably, be fixed in all cases by capitalizing the returns. A company now having to pay1s. per ton to another company in respect of a right-of-way will have, in addition, to pay the Federal Government a considerable amount in the way of taxation, so that the impost will be a tremendously heavy one. </para>

I now ask the Attorney-General whether this definition will cover tramway rights, which are held under different tenures, by private companies, and whether it will also include private railways in Queensland, which are estates or interests held in different forms of tenure ?

                    <para>. - -I have already pointed out that the definition of "Owner" is so wide as to include, in my opinion, everything set forth in section  22  of the Acts Interpretation Act, except tenements and incorporeal hereditaments, to which it cannot possibly apply, since this is a tax on unimproved land values. Wherever that term cannot apply, then, obviously, so much of the definition as is set forth in section  22  of the Acts Interpretation Act does not apply in this case. It does not follow that it is intended to apply this Bill to all cases covered by section  22  of the Acts Interpretation Act.

                    <para>.- I think that, on the whole, there is no danger to be apprehended as to the definition of " land," because, reading the Bill through, one finds that what is meant is fairly plain. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The definition of " unimproved values " shows that the land in computation must be in fee simple; it must be something physical, because we could not have improvements upon that which is intangible. In the amendment of which we have notice, any ambiguity that may arise in regard to leaseholds and freeholds as contradistinguished is cured. On looking into the matter, I am not very nervous as to the scope of this definition. I think that it means the taxation of the fee-simple of the land, and the apportionment of the tax to the extent of the estate held under it. I have an amendment defining " joint owners " as owners with a right of survivorship, and excising from the definition as it stands in the Bill tenants in common. I do not want to press it here if there is no chance of carrying it, but tenants in common who have a distinct ownership of the land should be regarded, for the purpose of taxation, as separate owners. In the case of " joint owners," as the law understands the term, the whole estate belongs to the one who survives. It would have been better had " joint owners " been limited to such joint ownership as the law understands, and so as not to include tenants in common who are not joint owners according to the ordinary legal interpretation of the term. It would be well to consider that point, and so to overcome a good deal of the difficulty with regard to the position of societies. As the definition of " joint owners " stands, it would cover the members of co-operative societies, but if it were amended as I suggest it would not. </para>

                    <para>.- We find that "unimproved value," under the definition clause, means the capital sum which the fee-simple of the land might be expected to realize, " assuming that the actual improvements thereon (if any) had not been made." There are many instances where men have expended large sums in improving their properties by drainage and irrigation schemes, which, although not actually upon their land, have added very considerably to its unimproved value. In some cases roads and bridges have been constructed by a man to improve access to his own land, and, although they are not upon his property, they have materially increased its unimproved value. In the definition of " Unimproved value" in the New South Wales Act there is a provision admitting of these improvements being taken into consideration. It is only fair, in the circumstances, that we should take into consideration in determining the unimproved value of land any money which has been expended by the owner or occupier, and which has added to its unimproved value. I therefore move - </para>

                    <para>. - The amendment opens up a considerable field for discussion. It is not acceptable to me, and I think it would be inadvisable to make it because it materially complicates a sufficiently difficult question, and will entitle persons who are valuing their land to make a deduction where none should be allowed. I admit that there are cases where landowners have made improvements which are not on their land. A drain from or to a man's land might be such an improvement. The number of cases in which there would be any difficulty are not numerous, and the amount involved is trifling. I do not think it can be said that the definition in the Bill involves any injustice to the owner of land in the making of an estimate of the unimproved value. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. The New Zealand Act has now been amended nine times. The Parliament of the Dominion have been finding out the weak places in it, remedying injustices, and generally getting the machine to work smoothly, and their definition of unimproved value is substantially that of this Bill. It is as follows : -  " Unimproved value " of any piece of land means the sum which the owner's estate or interest therein, if unencumbered by any mortgage or other charge thereon, and if no improvements existed on that particular piece of land, might be expected to realize at the time of valuation if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> seller might be expected to require. </para>

If a man has a piece of land, and a hundred miles away has a factory in which the product of that land is put to a different use, it might be claimed that the factory was, in relation to his land, an " improvement thereto." He might be bark-growing, and claim that his tannery, a hundred miles away, was an improvement to his farm. He might have a boiling down factory to treat the beef grown or rabbits caught upon his property. Unless there is some explanation from the Attorney-General of what "thereto" means, I shall take the only course open to me of voting against the proposed amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I am afraid the honorable member for Adelaide forgets one or two things. He forgets that through every mile over which the oil pipes that he mentioned would run, there would be an increment of value. Similarly, in regard to the " tannery  100  miles away," the improvements would be on the land on which the wattles were growing, and would have no relation whatever to the improvements of the land where the tannery stood. The honorable member is letting his imagination run a little riot in thinking that things done  100  miles away could be counted as improvements on the spot. The tannery might add to the unimproved value of the tannery site, just as every railway and every improvement in the country does. These things contribute indirectly to the betterment of the site value, but that is taxable under the Bill, and not exempt. It is only the improvements that we are exempting. I understand that what the honorable member for Richmond wants to provide for is a substantial improvement, such as a storage dam, or something of that kind, which is contiguous or fairly contiguous to the land. That sort of thing might very well be exempt, and it seems to me that the expression suggested by the Attorney-General would meet the case. </para>

                    <para>. - I trust the Attorney-General will give the matter more consideration before he assents to the proposition of the honorable member for Richmond. It will lead to endless trouble if we allow improvements outside the area to be taxed to be taken into consideration. Why treat a farmer who has constructed a bridge or made a road to his property more approachable by his own expenditure any differently from the man who has paid for part of the street paving or channelling in a town? That is an improvement contiguous to his property. Under the New Zealand Act, the value of improvements is the sum which the improvements actually upon the land have added to the value of the land. We must keep to the owner's land, because, if we once depart from it, we shall find ourselves in great difficulties. I hope that the Attorney-General before accepting the proposal of the honorable member for Richmond will thoroughly consider the whole case, and, unless I have been further enlightened on the point, I shall vote against it. </para>

                    <para>. - We are dealing now with unimproved value, that is, the value which attaches to land apart from the improvements on it. We shall have to define what "value" means; but it is suggested that the unimproved value may be determined by deducting the value of the improvements from the total value of the property. The honorable member for Richmond has pointed out that land may be improved by expenditure by the owner, not on the land itself, but near it, and that, in fairness, that expenditure should be deducted from the total value of the property to ascertain the unimproved value. If a man were to sink a shaft on his land and erect a windmill or a steam-engine over it to pump water for purposes of irrigation, the value of that improvement would be deducted from the total value of the property, in order to ascertain the . unimproved value. But the property might be equally improved by similar expenditure on the bank of a river to which the owner of the land had not a frontage. The New South Wales Local Government Act of  1906  defines .the unimproved capital value of land as - </para>

                        <para>- The New South Wales Parliament imposed a tax on the unimproved Value of land to be used for State purposes, and subsequently transferred it to the local governments of the State. The Act is a measure for the imposition of a tax on the unimproved value of land, and it is perfectly fair to allow the deduction of actual improvements. As to the ambiguity of the word " thereto " I am willing to admit that the difference between "thereto" and "thereon" is considerable; " thereon " confines the area referred to, while " thereto," to adopt an extreme case, might cover a pipe line extending for hundreds of miles. By the next definition, "Value of improvements," in relation to land, is defined as meaning the difference between the improved value and the unimproved value of the land. That seems to call for something more precise; but I think that a definition of " value " will remove the objections that have been urged. </para>

                    <para>.- I am desirous of doing what is fair in this matter, but am afraid that if the amendment be accepted in the form suggested by the Attorney-Genera^ it will cause trouble. It must not be forgotten that the New South Wales Act referred to takes into account only improvements made by the owner of the land, by expenditure either on or off that land; but the amendment under discussion provides for the deduction of the value of improvements made off the land by any person. The amendment of the honorable member for Richmond is not so wide as that of the Attorney-General, because the use of the word " thereto " re-  moves all limitations. Notwithstanding what the honorable member for Parramatta has said, the improvement in value, created by the construction of a Government railway improving adjacent land, could be deducted under the proposal which we are discussing. </para>

                        <para>- It frequently happens that land which is worth very little suddenly acquires considerable value by the opening up of a coal mine, followed by the making of a railway, and the creation of a township. The private coal mining companies' railways often improve the land through which they pass very considerably, the owners of such land in some cases obtaining as much as is. for every ton of coal which passes over it. The proposal of the Attorney-General would prevent the increase of value so given to land from being taken into consideration in the making of an assessment. It has always been recognised that in order to ascertain clearly the unimproved value, the value of improvements made by the expenditure of the owner on the land or adjacent to it must be taken into consideration, but the word " thereto " in itself is altogether too vague. </para>

                    <para>. - According to the amendment, unimproved value in relation to land means the capital sum which the fee-simple of the land might be expected to realize if offered for sale. By whom only could it be offered for sale? By the man who has the right to sell it; who would be the man liable for the tax. If he offered to sell, an intending purchaser would ask, " What shall I buy?" and would be told, "You will buy the fee-simple of the land, on which there is a house and other improvements, and off which there is a pump or windmill, providing for irrigation." The improvements whose value may be deducted, no matter by whom made, must belong to the owner of the land. The point taken by the honorable member for Adelaide as to the ambiguity of the word " thereto " is sound, though the use of the words "adjacent thereto" suggested by the honorable member for Hunter, would do much to remove it. It is clear, however, that the improvements whose value may be deducted must belong to the owner of the land. An intending purchaser would say, " I estimate the value of the land at so much, the value of the improvements on it at so much, and the value of the improvements off it at so much." The unimproved value would be the value of the whole property, less the value of the improvements belonging to the owner, both on and off the land. </para>

                        <para>- In this clause we postulate a buyer and a seller, and we say that the value is what a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> seller and a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> buyer would agree to between them. What the owner sells is the whole of his interest, which includes the unimproved value, or the value less all the improvements that he owns. He does not own the improvements made by the town or by the man next door, but only owns those improvements he has made or bought with his own money. All this provision does is to allow an owner to have the benefit of the money he or his predecessor has spent, although some of the money may have been spent in an irrigation plant, part of which goes outside his particular land. </para>

                    <para>. - If the restriction implied by the word " thereon " be retained, I am afraid that some injustice will be done. In Melbourne and all our principal towns large verandahs are built over the footpaths, but these. while not on the land, are certainly an improvement to the property. In Western Australia and our northern towns, the people spend a great deal of their time, particularly in summer weather, on extensive verandahs and balconies which cost large sums to construct; and yet the owners of the land, if the clause be passed as drawn, will get no credit for those improvements. I cannot imagine that a railway or any other Government or municipal scheme can be regarded as an improvement belonging to the owner of the land, who, certainly, can claim only those improvements he or the prior owner has effected. A purchaser is in exactly the same position as the original owner, and improvements "thereon" means those in actual connexion with the property. </para>

                    <para>. - In many of the shires in Victoria, landholders often allow themselves to be specially rated for the construction of roads in their immediate vicinity. The ordinary rate may be is. or is. 6d., but they are voluntarily rated at 2s. or 2s. 6d. for the purpose I have mentioned. In Victoria hundreds of miles of roads and scores of miles of streets are constructed on these terms ; and I should like to know whether the value will be subtracted from the tax. If a man has contributed, say, <inline font-style="italic">£$0</inline> towards the construction of a road, will he be allowed to deduct that ^30? I think he will according to the definition of the Attorney-General, because it is an improvement paid for out of the pocket of the taxpayer. </para>

The only improvements to be considered are those which the owner himself can sell, will to his children, or give to a friend. All improvements made partly by the taxpayer and partly by the community are improvements with which he cannot deal when he sells his property. However, although I do not see the slightest difficulty, I am prepared, in order to meet the objection raised, to suggest that instead of "or thereto," the words "or adjacent thereto have been made by the owner thereof " be inserted. </para>

Supposing an owner has 5,000 acres of land, and next to him is a block of land belonging to another person, and on the other side of that block there is a river. The owner may suffer very serious injury from floods, and may spend, perhaps, .£2,000 in building a mole or other work, which results in saving his land from inundation. By this means the land, which was worth originally <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> an acre, may suddenly become worth _£io or ^12 ; and I desire to know whether he is only to be allowed to deduct ^2,000 as spent in improvements, or to deduct the whole of the increased price he can get on the market. </para>

                    <para>. - It: seems to me that we are confusing things that are quite plain, because there is a key which unlocks a great many of the difficulties. That key is in the word "sale," which implies price, and price is that which makes the matter plain. In assessing the value of improvements, we may, for instance, have two blocks of land side by side, or in the immediate neighbourhood, one totally unimproved and the other with improvements. Each block has a selling price ascertainable in the market. Whatever the one will fetch in the open market over the other represents the price of the improvements upon it, and it is the price of the improvements, not the amount that has been spent upon those improvements, which is to determine the exemption. The next question is - Who has made those improvements? They might consist of works, such as a dam across a river, undertaken by a number of persons, acting conjointly, materially adding to the productivity of the property, and, there-fore, being in the very nature of improvements. I take it that the share which the owner of a block of land has contributed to such improvements is the share which is deductable from the total amount of the selling price of his property. </para>

                    <para>.- If the Minister would accept a part of the honorable member for Richmond's amendment, namely, after the words " therein and thereto" as proposed, and add "for its more beneficial use," the definition would be improved. A block of land, having associated with it an irrigation plant, or other works* which could be sold with it, would fetch more than an adjoining unimproved block. In Victoria, for instance, in many cases water frontages are not sold. A man might have a block of land close to a river, with an irrigation plant immediately adjoining it, and erected for the beneficial use of the land, and capable of being sold with it. That would be an improvement, and should, I think, be treated as such. We have a provision in regard to a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> buyer, and a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> seller, and with the addition of the words which I have suggested this provision would be improved. </para>

                    <para>. - The valuation of improvements generally is one of the most important and difficult matters relating to this measure, and we cannot take too much care in trying to arrive at a proper solution of the problem.. If I understand the principle of this tax,, it is that it is not to be imposed in respect of money that has been expended in making, improvements. In other words, the tax, as the Attorney-General himself has said, should be upon the added value which the community, as a whole, or the taxation of any portion of the community, has1 given to the land. I see great difficulty in adopting the suggestion made by the honorable gentleman as to the use of the word " thereto." In the first place, it is extremely vague, and vagueness, of all things, ought, if possible, to be avoided in a definition clause. It might or might not include quite a number of things lying on doubtful ground. Take a case where a number of adjoining land-owners have combined, either through a trust, sanctioned by Act of Parliament, or by voluntary cooperation, to make a channel to drain their land. Such a combination is of common occurrence, and I am sure that honorable members would desire, if possible, to exempt from the operation of this tax such' an improvement. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily. It might run through land which they had jointly acquired for the purpose, or land in respect of which they had obtained a drainage easement. The money might be spent in many ways, and represent a considerable portion of the efforts of" the land-owners to improve their lands, an3' therefore ought not to be taxable.

                        <para>- In one sense it does. No doubt every road near a property increases its value, whether the owner of that property has or has not made it. If he acquires land for the purpose, and makes the road himself, that land is part of his holding. But a man might not acquire the land ; he might merely acquire a right-of-way over it, so as to give access to his farm. If a man obtains a right-of-way to give access to his farm, and pays money for it, then that right-of-way undoubtedly is part of the easement which he can sell. If he has expended a considerable amount in forming and metalling that right-of-way, then that ought to come within his exemption. Now we come to another difficulty. As the honorable member for Maribyrnong has pointed out, there are many cases where special rates are imposed - usually confined to a riding or portion of a riding - and designed to provide -for making a particular road or improvement, which mainly, if not solely, relates to that particular part of the shire. According to all principles of logic and justice, that ought to be in exactly the same position as an improvement made by a number of people outside their own land at their own expense. A line of demarcation ought to be drawn between cases where the actual money can be identified as being spent for the improvement of particular lands. I do not think that we ought to draw a line as to the mere form in which the improvement is carried out - as to whether it is done by voluntary co-operation, by the formation of a trust, under statutory authority, or through municipal machinery - provided the money contributed can be identified as having been expended for certain definite improvements, which are improvements to the land concerned. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that. It would be difficult to accurately define such a case as the honorable member has mentioned, but we should attempt to deal with it either by exempting or including such an im«provement. I do not think the Attorney-General's suggestion would leave that matter clear, and I did not quite understand the line of reasoning which he adopted when he tried to draw a distinction between something which a man can, and something that he cannot, sell. That cannot be taken as the line of division. In most cases the improvement is the act of some form of co-operation, either formal or informal. What we want to secure to the particular land-owner is that money expended jointly with others, and which may represent a considerable proportion of the improvement of his land, shall be exempt. </para>

                        <para>- Any form of imposition of a new kind of tax will necessarily affect a number of people more or less injuriously. The principle we are following is that, if a piece of land is worth £100 now, and would be only worth £50 if it were still prairie land, it should be taxed on the <inline font-style="italic">£50.</inline> That is the logical principle of the whole measure, and if we once depart from it and begin to make allowances to people who have expended money, the result of which, through their own misfortune or misguidance, is not still upon the land, we shall get into an absolute quagmire. The amendment regarding improvements circulated by the honorable member for Wimmera opens the door for a discussion as to how far each man's money expended in clearing, for instance, ought to be allowed for. I merely rose to suggest that the original proposal of the honorable member for Richmond, with some slight modifications, most nearly arrives at a solution of what is undoubtedly a very difficult problem. </para>

                    <para>.- I am very grateful to the honorable member for Flinders for his explanation. It would seem, after all, that I was justified in taking exception to the course proposed by the Attorney-General. We have now a legal opinion that the word "thereto" is far too ambiguous to be put in the Bill. I agree with the honorable member for Hunter that the original suggestion of the honorable member for Richmond was preferable to the insertion of the vague word " thereto." Certainly the honorable member's original amendment defined to some extent the additional improvements the value of - which could be deducted before arriving at the unimproved value of land. The moment we get away from the improvements on the land itself we get into deep water. It is very dangerous to get into deep water if you are not certain that you can swim. </para>

                        <para>- That confirms my contention. My reply to the argument used by the Attorney-General and the Deputy-Leader of the Opposition is that there is no question of sale in the case of the improvements. We are considering the unimproved value of a piece of land, and can only arrive at it by deducting the- value of the improvements. Manifestly, the greater the value of the improvements, the less the unimproved value for taxation purposes. I have no desire to prevent a man being relieved from taxation because of improvements that he has made, and that are inseparable from the working of the land, and are the result of his own energy or brain power, or coin ; but I have a strong objection to allowing any individual to deduct the value of improvements which are made in a general way, and over which he had absolutely no control, before we arrive at the unimproved value of his land. Manifestly, the phrase " improvements thereto " would include a road. </para>

                        <para>- It is not the saleable value of the improvements. We are considering only the sale of the land after deducting the value of all the improvements, irrespective of whether the owner has the right to sell them or not. Under the definition it is the land that is offered for sale apart from any improvements. What has the sale of that portion of the land to do with the sale of the improvements ? We only arrive at what the land would bring if there were no improvements on it, by deducting the value of the improvements, and the amendment will allow an owner to deduct the value of certain improvements that he has not made. That is what I object to. </para>

                    <para>. - A careful perusal of this provision will disclose, first, that the unimproved value is something with which the man who is on the land has nothing to do, and, secondly, that what we call the improved value is something with which he has everything to do, because he made it himself, or bought it. We propose, for the sake of arriving" at a commercial price, to suppose that an owner says to another man, " What will you give me for the whole lot?" And the other replies, " I will give you £1,000 We have then in our minds to separate what, in the minds of the buyer and seller, is the amount to be given for the improvements for which the land-owner is himself responsible, ' and we deduct that amount from the £1,000 offered. The balance is the value with which the owner of the land had nothing to do, namely, the value that had been given to it by the community. Directly you spend a penny on rates by improving a road, putting in a gas main or water-pipes, you add to the unimproved value of the man's land. If you spent £1,000,000 in that way and raised the unimproved value from <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> an acre to £50 a foot, you would not increase the value of the improvements by the millionth part of a penny. You would only have increased the value given to the land by the community. Of .course, there may be cases in which a man owns the land, but does not own the improvements on it, but they are immaterial. The point is that the improvements whose value may be deducted in the making of an assessment must be improvements which some person has a right to sell. No one can sell a public utility. I admit the ambiguity of " thereto,." but it arises upon the attempt to limit the point at which the expenditure on improvements attaches to a piece of land. The use of the word " adjacent " increases the difficulty. All we desire is that the man who has spent money in improving his land, or has bought from another an improvement, should be permitted to deduct the value of the improvement, whether it happens to be within or outside his boundaries. By way of illustration, let me mention the case of a land-holder on the Hawkesbury, who has an engine and pump on the river bank, and  200  yards of piping running across the river flat outside his boundaries. That plant constitutes an improvement to his land, but it is wholly outside the boundaries of that land. It has been suggested that the words "or by his predecessor in title" be added. But the provision will be perfectly clear without those words, because improvements could not be made by any one except the person who has a right to sell them. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that if the provision were amended by confining the word "thereto" to. improvements at the expense of the owner or his predecessor in title, it would be fairly safe. I had an amendment drafted providing for the addition of the words " or at the expense of the owner or his predecessor in title." There might be a joint expenditure by the owner and others. The honorable member for Richmond has referred, either here or in private conversation, to co-operative expenditure; but we should not allow an owner to deduct the full value of an improvement to whose cost he has contributed only a part. Another difficulty to be provided against is the allowing of a double exemption. "A" might be entitled to deduct the value of the improvements made on " B's " land, because they improved his land, while " B," under cover of the word " thereon " might also be entitled to deduct their value because they were on his land. My first impression was that the definition might read " improvements thereon or thereto at the expense of the owner or his predecessor in title." That would prevent any other than the owner of the land claiming an exemption for the improvements. </para>

                        <para>- I am coming to the opinion that it is undesirable to make any alteration. The South Australian provision works very well, and, do what we will, we must use indefinite words. I tried to cure the indefiniteness of "thereto" by confining it to improvements at the expense of the owner. Another man might be prevented from deducting the value of the improvements on his land which had already been credited to another owner by making the provision read " thereon or thereto so far as made at the expense of the owner or his predecessor in title." The Attorney-General has suggested an addition to the amendment of the honorable member for Richmond, and 1 suggest that further addition ; but if the Government does not wish to accept it, I shall not press it. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that a great deal of trouble is being made about nothing. The Bill says distinctly that the unimproved value in relation to land means the capital value which the fee-simple might be expected to realize if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions- as a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> seller would require, assuming that the actual improvements thereon, if any, had not been made. </para>

Persons of common sense may be left to determine the unimproved value of land, that is, what land is worth apart from the improvements made to it directly or indirectly. The opening up of a road would be an improvement, or the cutting of a drain. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment just moved is a considerable improvement on the previous amendment. I should have preferred the proposal of the honorable member for Richmond, but the amendment of the Attorney-General is very much in line with the New Zealand Act, which deals with this troublesome and difficult question, and provides that improvements shall not include work done, or material used, " in or for the benefit of the land by the Crown, or any statutory public body, unless such work has been paid for by the contribution of the owner." If the phraseology of the amendment is legally in harmony with the Bill, I think it might be accepted. </para>

                    <para>. - I think the amendment moved by the Attorney-General makes the matter clearer, but another difficulty occurs to me. It is generally admitted that an owner should not take advantage of any improvement created by the -community, but, while that is so, we have to take into account improvements created by what I may term neighbourly co-operation. In pioneering work in this country such a case as I have in my mind often arises. A local authority may have made a road, and it is necessary that a drain should be constructed. The local authorities cannot afford to carry out the work, and four or five neighbours co-operate, with the sanction of the authorities, and make the drain. This materially improves the value of the lands of all, and it is a work carried out by private arrangement, with the owners own money. </para>

                        <para>- I think the Attorney-General's amendment would cover such a case, but, seeing that the line of demarcation is so indistinct, I think we should clearly provide against anybody making a claim in the case of improvements created by the public authorities and the community. While it is only just that an improvement, carried out by cooperation of this kind, should be protected, we ought to be very careful that similar pro lection is not accorded in the case of improvement made by the community. </para>

                    <para>.- The case cited by the honorable member for Darling Downs appeals to me. Supposing two three, or four men agree to drain a certain area of country, borrow the necessary money from a bank, and in time repay it; in such case, does the Attorney-General contend that they are not entitled to deduction? </para>

                        <para>- Without following any further the argument in which I was engaged before the adjournment, I think that what we all have in view is that ' ' unimproved value" should include only that value which has been given to the land by the efforts of the community. We do not want to include any value given to it by the owner of the land- himself. Although the amendment moved by the Attorney-General will not cover all the ground, it goes a long way towards doing so, and I am prepared to accept it in the form finally proposed by him. </para>

                    <para>. - I am in favour of this definition as originally drafted, rather than as proposed to be amended, for I believe that the amendment would lead to much confusion, and simply play into the hands of the lawyers. We wish, if possible, to avoid that; but, at the same time, our desire is to do justice to those who have improved their land. The owner of a piece of land knows its value, and ought to be able to value it better than any one else. In the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> volume LXXIV., page  2764,  I find a clause proposed to be inserted in the Land Tax Bill, as introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, in  1894,  which seems to cover the point which honorable members have been discussing. No doubt many honorable members have local surroundings in their mind in dealing with this matter, and do not wish certain works in their own constituencies to be added to the unimproved value of the land therein. They are doubtless trying to serve their own constituents, but in doing so we must be careful that we do not leave loopholes by which people may avoid the payment of just taxation. The clause which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid proposed to insert in the New South Wales Bill reads -  " Unimproved value " means, in respect to land, the capital sum foi which the fee-simple estate in such land would sell, under such reasonable conditions of sale as a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> seller would require, assuming the visible improvements (if any) were not upon it. </para>

The words "predecessor in title" occur in several Irish Acts, and there has been a great deal of litigation in Ireland between landlords and tenants as to the value of improvements. I shall not move a further amendment, but will throw upon those in charge of the Bill the whole responsibility. We may find that,, by the use of these words, we have qualified the word " thereon." </para>

                        <para>- And the purchaser, I presume, pays for that improvement. The existence of an improvement on a .piece of land pre-supposes that it was made by human agency. Usually a man does not improve land unless he has a title to it, and can sell the land and the improvement upon it if he chooses to do so. As to the statement made by the honorable member for Angas, that difficulty has arisen in Ireland in determining what are  improvements to land, the difficulty was not as to the improvements, but as to who created them originally. An Irish landlord never made any, and the trouble was as to who, in past generations, constructed drains, erected fences, and the like. The Attorney-General said just now that untaxable improvements were such, and such only, as a seller can convey to a buyer. But there are improvements which cannot be so conveyed. For instance, some time ago I sold a block of land, and before doing so, had to pay for the cost of making a street on which it abutted. I did not convey that street to the buyer, although I may have conveyed to him a right of way over it. </para>

There would be just' as much justification in taxing a man in respect of a barn, a stable, or other improvements erected with his own money, as there would be in taxing him in respect of the improvement made to his property by the construction of a street for which he alone had paid. An amendment of the clause is required so as to exempt improvements contiguous to a piece of land, and which amount to an improvement to the land itself. No man should be taxed for his enterprise; but, on the contrary, he should be encouraged to spend money on improvements. </para>

If a man is compelled by a municipality to make a road or street, there is no difference at all between the labour of such a man and the improvement made by such a man in those circumstances, and the collective improvements made by the community out of the contributions of each individual. Every improvement that we see around us in the city of Melbourne has been made as a direct result of contributions by each citizen in the community. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members, by not keeping the clear line of demarcation before them, have contrived to obscure the distinction between improved and unimproved values. The unimproved value of land is a value which cannot be added to by anything that the owner of the land can do. No matter what he does he cannot add to the unimproved value of the land, because the unimproved value is the value added by the community. Therefore, the very statement of the case precludes one kind of value being added in any other than that particular way. It was for that reason the honorable member for Adelaide, the honorable member for Hunter, and the honorable member for Maribyrnong took exception to the ambiguity or vagueness of the clause in possibly including improvements which were made by the community. I wish to make it perfectly clear that- what we mean by improvements, which may be deducted from the value of a man's land in estimating its unimproved value, is improvements that are made by the man himself, or acquired by the man himself, as distinguished1 from improvements made by the community, either in its corporate capacity, or under its corporate direction, which is one and the same thing. </para>

                    <para>.- I think the difficulty has been caused by a confusion' of the issues. The amendment originally suggested by the honorable member for Richmond, referred to improvements made by the owner in building dams, erecting pumping machinery, or constructing drains. The matter of paying for the formation of roads or streets, or the work of subdivision, comes under another head altogether. </para>

                        <para>- The Local Government Act of New South Wales provides for the local governing authority contributing, say, half the cost. The owner generally pays half towards the construction of roads or streets, or new subdivisions.; but, in some cases, he has to make the whole of the new streets. If the Committee concedes the amount that the owner of the land pays towards that sort of work, to be an improvement, it will lead to endless confusion, because the value imparted to the land is partly contributed to by the local governing authority. If we depart from the original intention of the Committee, as expressed during almost the whole of this morning, that improvements were to be only improvements made by the owner of the land for his own particular benefit, and increasing the value of the land, we shall be making a mistake. I am prepared to allow for any improvements that may be made by the owner personally, but I distinctly draw the line at allowing for improvements that may be contributed to by the local governing body. The two things are altogether separate and distinct, and should be kept so. </para>

                        <para>- I should not. If the local governing body subscribes part of the cost and the owner of the land finds the other part, the benefit to both is mutual. The owner reaps a certain amount of benefit both ways, but that is a very different proposition from the one argued this morning with regard to the building of dams, or even the provision of better access. If the owner of the land were making a road wholly and solely on his own account I should say at once that he was entitled to the benefit of an exemption, but I would give him no benefit by way of exemption for a road built wholly or partly by a public authority. </para>

                    <para>. -I agree with the honorable member for Nepean, but in Victoria, under the Local Government Act, there are two ways of dealing with roads. The owner has to pay half the cost of making the footpath and the channels opposite a house, but he pays nothing towards the cost of the road. The lanes at the back of, or between, the houses are made by the municipality, and each owner is assessed for his share of the cost. The point raised by the honorable member for Coolgardie is different from that, because where an owner of a block" of land subdivides it for building purposes he makes the roads, footpaths, and channels at his own expense. The municipality will refuse to consent to the subdivision of the land or to take the roads over until the owner has done that work himself. By doing it he increases the value of the unimproved blocks that are sold, and the Commonwealth will get the benefit of the increased value by means of this taxation. It is only fair that,  when the original owner has added the cost of making the roads and footpaths on to the value of each block of land, the purchaser should have the benefit of his proportion, the whole expense having been borne by the land-owner and not by the municipality. </para>

                    <para>.- Let me give another illustration. Take the case of irrigation works such as those on one of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> McCaughey's stations. The most expensive part of the works may not be on any particular allotment. I do not know whether that gentleman is selling his allotments, but let me assume that they are sold. The erection of the plant improves all the areas, and yet under the Bill as it stands each individual owning an allotment will not be able to count his share of the cost of the total improvement against its unimproved value. That is an even more definite illustration than the one given by the honorable member for Coolgardie, because other things may be urged against the question of street subdivision. In the instance I have given the private subdivider has done everything himself. He has provided the whole plant, and so improved the whole property. Is it not fair that over and above the mere irrigation ditches that go through each area you should include in the value of the improvements on any allotment its proportionate share of the whole cost of the pumping plant? Under this Bill as it stands that will not be done, and it constitutes an anomaly. </para>

                    <para>. - I doubt whether the Attorney-General is correctly seized of the point I raised a few moments back. If he is, he has drawn a most extraordinary conclusion from it. The honorable member for Balaclava very fairly stated the case of the owner of a piece of land within a municipality who desires to cut it up. The municipality will not make the streets or footpaths through that land. The owner makes the streets at his own expense, and pays his share towards the cost of making the footpaths. He may spend anything from £500 to £1,000 in roads and footpaths through the property. The effect of that is to increase the value of the unsold portions of the land by giving access to them. The Attorney-General is rather ambiguous as to improved and unimproved values. He tells us that the unimproved value is never varied except by improvements made by the community, which must be taken to mean that private expenditure adds nothing to that value. As theory, that may stand, but when the assessor comes along to ascertain the unimproved value of the land, he will not be guided by the definition of the Attorney-General. He will not stop to inquire whether a particular street was made by the community, or at the cost of a private individual. Unless we put in this clause something which releases people from taxation on the value of their own improvements, we shall be doing what is unjust. We ought to take into account the money spent by a land-owner in making a road to improve his property as much as his expenditure on improvements on the land itself. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. A man may spend £500 or £1,000 in making roads which improve, not only his property, but add to the value of adjacent land by improving the means of access. If we agree to tax only unimproved value, that is, community created value, we should certainly exempt from taxation every improvement on or adjacent to an owner's land which has been made by the expenditure of his own money. </para>

                    <para>.- The more the matter is discussed, the more it must be apparent that we should have done well to adopt the amendment of the honorable member for Richmond, which would meet the objections of the honorable member for Coolgardie and others on the Ministerial side of the Chamber. The desire is to tax the unimproved value of property, and if an owner spends money outside the borders of his property for the express purpose of improving it, he should be allowed to deduct the value of the improvements when making out his return. The Attorney-General has gone some way to meet the honorable member for Richmond in admitting that improvements appertaining to the land should be allowed. </para>

                        <para>- That is what we must know. I think that it would be better to adopt the original proposal of the honorable member for Richmond. The value given to a property by the making of roads at the expense of the owner is not community-created value, and a deduction should be allowed in respect to it. If we allow owners to deduct the value of houses and other expenditure on their land, which has increased its value, we should also allow them to deduct expenditure outside the land which has increased its value. I should like to know from the Attorney-General exactly what has to be done to ascertain the unimproved value pf land, because the Bill throws upon every landowner the onus of assessing his own land. I assume that if the land to be assessed is in a rich district like Colac, and worth, with improvements, £50 an acre, though originally bought for £1 an acre, the owner, in determining its unimproved value, has to try to ascertain what it would sell for, assuming that there were no improvements on it, but that the improvements on the surrounding properties, and the roads, railways, and facilities of communication remained as they are. Having done so, he might fix the unimproved value at ,£20 an acre, but that would be merely his opinion on the subject, and the best valuers in the country might differ from him, one fixing the value at .£15, and another at £25. Under the Bill, a man who is 25 per cent, below the Commissioner's valuation will be in a very awkward position, because the onus will be thrown on him of proving that he has not wilfully undervalued his property; if he cannot prove that, he will be liable to extremely heavy penalties. Ten years hence the unimproved value of the same land may be £30, or it may have dropped to ,£15. There should be some definite starting point. There are properties which have been in occupation for eighty years or more, chiefly for grazing, which have been gradually improved to the extent of £1 an acre. A little clearing has been done in one place, and some other improvement elsewhere, but it would be difficult to show exactly how the improvements were effected. To the ordinary man the land might seem to be practically in its natural state. These facts show how difficult it is to arrive at the unimproved value of land. That would not matter so much were it not for the unchristian penalties provided. I' should like the Attorney-General to give a concrete example of the manner in which he thinks the unimproved value should be arrived at. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Coolgardie has argued that a deduction should be made in respect to money spent by a land-owner in making roads which improve his property, but, according to the <inline font-style="italic">New Zealand YearBook,</inline> if a public road is made by an owner for the purpose of increasing the value of his land, it is not valued as an improve.ment. as it is not on the land, and is not included in the area which is valued. In the Dominion they have had years of experience of land value taxation. </para>

                    <para>- I was considerably surprised to hear the Attorney-General state that the, amendment he had previously foreshadowed did not allow of any deduction for expenditure by an owner or occupier in making improvements, such as drainage or road construction, adjacent or adjoining his property. We know well that, in order to ascertain the unimproved value, we cannot go back to the original price, seeing that the land would then be in a state of nature, and of very little value indeed. There are districts in my own constituency devoted wholly to wheat and wool-growing, and there the land has been improved to the extent of <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> per cent, through the corporate efforts of the people who cultivate it. It is true that a railway in their midst is paying interest, but their individual and corporate efforts in making improvements, and bringing the land into a high state of cultivation, have brought about the present improved and unimproved value. These people are not dependent "on the local community for the consumption of their produce, the whole of which, probably, is exported. But, as to what are improvements and what are not, it seems to me that the present Government, in confining the deductions to individual holdings, are going in the face of the experience of New Zealand, which has been referred to by the honorable member for Maribyrnong. 'We have had experience in every State of the Commonwealth in regard to land values, both capital and unimproved. But New Zealand, it will be admitted, has had even more experience than ourselves. In the Dominion, the graduated land tax is possibly on a more scientific basis than is the case in any of the Australian States. The land legislation there shows that land valuation has been brought to a very high pitch of efficiency ; and I regret to say that the Bill before us does not provide, as in the case of the Dominion, for a Valuer-General, whose duty, with his staff, it is, not only to value every block of land, but to prepare a list of the valuations for distribution, under proper supervision, throughout the country. The experience of New Zealand in this most difficult work does not bear the interpretation placed upon it by the honorable member for Maribyrnong. What the honorable member has quoted has reference only to valuing the improvements on the land, but there is a still wider provision in the New Zealand Act, declaring that the value of improvements shall not include " work done, or material used, on or for the benefit of land " by the Crown, or by any statutory public body, unless such work has been paid for "by the contribution of the owner or the occupier for the purpose." That is exactly the case we are discussing. I am sure honorable members will admit that New Zealand is a most democratic country, and that they regard with pride the wonderful success of the legislation there, particularly that relating to land. We are told that, if we allow the individual contribution of the owner or occupier to be taken into account in connexion with works adjoining his land, we might as well make a deduction in the case of the rates paid to the municipality. But I find that the New Zealand Act provides that " payment of rates or taxes " shall not be deemed to be " a contribution within the meaning of this definition.'' That really meets the whole position; and, under the circumstances, the Attorney-General might well pay regard to the claims which have been made 'under this  head. </para>

                        <para>- In any case, we are on dangerous ground when we go outside the land itself ; and the original definition is the safer provision. I know something of country interests, and how private owners have to go out with axes and clear tracks from their holdings in order to reach the main roads. Then, again, owners may find it necessary, even at a considerable distance from their holdings, to construct a bridge, for example, and two or three neighbours may or may not join in the work. The allowance that would be necessary in such a case might be small, but it would entail valuation and lead to endless difficulty. Who is to say what is the real meaning of "appertaining to"? I have never heard of overvaluation, except in very odd cases, under any of our present taxation systems. In Victoria the valuations are certainly under. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but under the system of land taxation in Victoria, which, I admit, is very unjust, we have undervaluation in the same way. There is wide room for honest difference of opinion in regard to the valuation of land, and it is just as well to face the fact. A man who desires to dispose of his land will endeavour to keep it at a high, and even fictitious, value, while, of course, the buyer takes quite an opposite view. After all, it is a matter of opinion, and land may be worth more to one man than to another. One man will refuse to sell land at a price that would be accepted by another man for land of the same quality ; and all this is quite in accord with human nature and sentiment. I have no doubt that the Commissioner, in valuing land, will make some allowance for cases where works of the kind referred to have been carried out. </para>

                        <para>- I disagree with the honorable member. The Commissioner, desiring to be absolutely fair, might possibly say that, in certain cases, something that had been done in the way of improving land, although not actually on the land itself, should be taken into consideration. When we propose to take into account the construction of roads, we touch most dangerous ground. A year or two ago, I read an interesting article by the  President  of the Cyclists' Association of the United States of America, in which he showed the great loss which the country had suffered, in the aggregate, owing to the failure to keep certain portions of main roads in order. For instance, a well-made macadamized road adjoining a farmer's land would be a mere waste of money, so far as he was concerned, if between his land and the market there were a stretch of road that was practically impassable. </para>

                <para class="block">If allowance is to be made for a road immediately adjoining a block of land, where shall we find ourselves? As we measure the strength of a chain by its weakest link, so we must measure the efficiency of a road by taking into account the worst part of it. If we make our intention clear by the use of words showing that the improvements must appertain to the land, we shall go far enough; but, if the construction of roads is to be taken into consideration, we shall have complications, trouble, and litigation. Our only safe course is to keep to improvements upon the laud. In connexion with small allotments, there will not be so much of the co-operative work which occurs in connexion with large estates. I think that it would be safer to keep to the original wording of the paragraph, unless the Attorney-General can draw a distinct line as to what our intention actually is in this regard. </para>

                        <para>- It has not been suggested by the honorable member for Coolgardie, who introduced this question, that such a thing should take place. The law under which a vast number of suburban streets have been constructed in Victoria is that it is competent for municipalities to construct roadways, and to apportion the cost amongst the owners of the various holdings abutting thereon. The owners are forced to make a contribution towards the construction of unmade roads. In such circumstances, the municipality itself is the mere instrument for the purpose of making the roads, and the money is contributed by the owners of the property for the benefit and improvement of their own property. As the honorable member must know, under the New Zealand Act there isa special exemption of such expenditure. Why should it not be so? A man so situated cannot help himself. Whether he desires that a road shall be constructed or not is quite beside the question. It is for the local governing body to determine whether an unmade road is technically a nuisance or a menace to public health, and if it exercises a reasonable discretion and determines that it is essential that it should' be made, it has to be made. That is the practice throughout Victoria, and no doubt it obtains elsewhere. When we realize that all the improvements due to the construction of a road in such circumstances are brought about by private contributions, surely it is reasonable that some allowance should be made. </para>

                        <para>- That is where the honorable member misconceives the intention of the honorable member for Coolgardie. No one contends that roads and other improvements made by the expenditure of money contributed by way of taxation should be allowed for in determining the unimproved value of a property. In New Zealand all private contributions towards the making of improvements are allowed in the assessment of the unimproved value. Therefore, is it not fair, since this Bill is largely founded upon the New Zealand Act, that the exemptions contained in that Act should be embodied in this measure? </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the statement in the <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book</inline> is inconsistent, but the law on the subject is very specific. Let me refer to another matter quite apart from the private contribution to the construction of roads made by municipalities, and that is the recognised practice of making roads, drains, and other improvements in connexion with a subdivision. People ought to be encouraged to do that. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. The honorable member for Darling also contended that it was not fair to allow for any expenditure outside the land itself, and thought it advisable to go back to the original terms of the paragraph. That is scarcely a reasonable contention. Take a very common case where the owners of property within a large area are suffering because of the swampy nature of the land, and all join together for the purpose of draining it. The land, which hitherto was of very small value, is made valuable by reason of that expenditure. Is it not reasonable in those circumstances that some allowance should be made for the drainage expenditure incurred to secure those results ? That is the class of case that we contend should be allowed for, and the Attorney-General will do well to endeavour to recast this provision with a view to following the lines laid down by the New Zealand Act in this connexion. </para>

                    <para>.- The more the discussion proceeds the more advisable does it appear to exclude roads altogether. If we are going to deal with the class of road alluded to by the honorable member for Coolgardie, we shall have to include every other class of road throughout the Commonwealth. Take the case of a suburban paddock. It is increased in value in consequence of the spread of population from the metropolitan centre. The municipality does not at any time enter upon that land for the purpose of making roads, nor does it demand that the owner shall make roads, but the owner, for his own purposes, in order to make a profit, decides to subdivide the land and sell it in small lots. He cannot do that without making the roads, because it would be useless without them. We are told that in Victoria the owner is materially assisted iri doing that work with the taxpayers' money. He is called upon only to pay for the cost of making the centre of the road, while he pays only half the cost cf making the footpaths and forming the channels, which in many cases is very much greater than the cost of making the road itself. It has not yet been pointed out to the Committee that, when those roads are made, they increase the value of the land, and the owner when he subdivides and sells gets paid, not only for his land, but, perhaps, ten times over for the money that he has spent in those improvements. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Once he sells, the whole thing goes over to the municipal body, and for ever after the ratepayers of the municipality have to maintain the roads and footpaths. It is not sufficient to make roads, channels, or footpaths. They have to be maintained for all time out of the rates contributed by the ratepayers. It would be exceedingly unwise to attempt to include any roads as improvements under this Bill. Any sane Commissioner, or his deputy, will take into consideration what are legitimate improvements on country lands. Can a channel for irrigation purposes be regarded as in the same category as a street made for subdivisional purposes to increase the value of private lands? The street is made for the purpose of individual gain, whereas the irrigation channel benefits, not only the individual, but a great number of others. </para>

                        <para>- A house is such a palpable improvement that it is beside the question. We are dealing with what have been called invisible improvements, which give an enhanced value to land. I take it that honorable members on neither side of the Chamber desire to do anything calculated to bring the Act into ridicule, or to cause litigation. We must so frame it as to do justice to those who will come under it. The honorable member for Flinders seems to have forgotten that clause 62 gives the Commissioner powers so exceedingly wide that one sometimes wonders whether they are not altogether too great. If it can be shown to him that a wrong would be done, or a serious loss or hardship inflicted, he can remit a portion, or even the whole, of the tax. We must make the Act workable, and not put in conditions which would intensify the difficulty of elucidating the measure a hundredfold. The improvements exempted should be absolutely palpable, and the more the discussion proceeds, the more does it seem advisable to me to confine them to the " improvements thereon." </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the Committee will come to a decision. We have been on the same point for the whole day. The Government take up the position that only those improvements which can be sold or conveyed by the owner of the property to another, and are quite distinguishable from the value of the land itself, shall be properly deductable from the whole value of the land. We, therefore, cannot entertain a proposition to allow the value of these communal efforts, no matter how they aic disguised, to be deducted. They are communal efforts, and there is no difference between the construction of a railway, to which each one of us contributes so much, by others, and its construction by ourselves. Whether we pay a man to do it or do it ourselves, the principle is the same. If I make a road in front of my door, instead of paying a tax to pay another man to make it, the principle and the effect are exactly the same. With regard to roads of that kind, or anything similar, we cannot make any concession. The proposal of the Government is to limit these deductable improvements to the " improvements thereon, or appertaining thereto, and made or acquired by the owner or his predecessor in title." That severely limits the improvements that can be deducted, and excludes all that very vague and ever-increasing "sphere of undertakings put before the Committee by a number of honorable members. </para>

                    <para>.- The Attorney-General has got on to dangerous ground in putting in the amendment just made. The theory of land taxation is that you are not to tax improvements. It is not the addition to the value of the land that we are to take into account. Supposing a man constructs a road beside his land. That is not an improvement of which you can assess the sale value. Hence there is no necessity to exempt it at all. We never dreamt of exempting that. But, supposing there are two blocks of land, each worth £10 a foot, on one of which there is a house, and on the other there is not. The house does not add one iota to the value of the land as defined for taxation. It is the aggregation of population that does all that. You do not put a penny on to the value of the land by putting up a house on the block, and the Bill says you are not to tax improvements, and all through the morning we have been mixing up the two things. I think the Bill as it stood was all right, or that if we had added the word " thereto," it would have done no harm. In clause 24 we give the same value to the improvements on the compulsory purchase of them. We actually say there that the sum total is to be determined by adding the value of the land, which is constant, except where there is an increase of population, to the value of the improvements. In the South Australian Act there is no reference to the value of improvements, because compulsory purchase is not provided for. This provision is put in only so that the man may, on the compulsory purchase of his land, get the value of the improvements, as well as the value of the land itself. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendment was not necessary as the definition stood, but it is necessary as it has been amended, because now we are dealing with improvements that are off the land, and have a separate existence; and therefore we must take their value, and not their cost. Improvements add to the value of land, but not to its unimproved value. I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment. </para>

My amendment embraces the New Zealand definition, but I understand that that of the honorable member for Richmond may be more acceptable to the Government, and therefore I shall give way to him. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Laanecoorie has made rather an unusual request. As an old newspaper man from the country, I know that Government advertisements, whether Federal or State, if they refer to the particular locality in which a newspaper is published, are inserted in that newspaper, or, if not, it is regarded as very unusual. But to suggest that general advertisements of the Government should appear in country newspapers is to suggest an expenditure that would not be at all warranted. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to supplement the remarks of the honorable member for Laanecoorie by asking whether such important newspapers as the <inline font-style="italic">Leader,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Weekly Times,</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Australasian</inline> will also share in these advertisements ? If the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call</inline> is to be the only weekly paper in Melbourne to receive Government advertisements, it is certainly a departure. The honorable member for Laanecoorie has based his suggestion on a plea of which I do not at all approve, namely, that country newspapers have a difficulty in making ends meet; but I should like to know why the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call</inline> is to be selected out of the whole of the Melbourne weekly papers to receive such advertisements? </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Laanecoorie deserves credit for directing attention to what may prove a serious departure in the practice of advertising of very considerable importance, and may involve the country in enormous expense. There is a multitude of small weekly newspapers in Australia; and as it is very difficult to discriminate as to which should receive Government patronage, this innovation may eventually entail the country in enormous expense. I found, when in office in 1904, that the then existing practice regarding advertising led to extravagant and unnecessary outlay. I then directed that the lengthy advertisements usually inserted in the daily press should be curtailed, and a short notification substituted, informing persons interested that the full particulars would be found in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette.</inline> That was the practice initiated and carried out when I was Postmaster-General. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly ; but the outlay was small compared to what the other practice entailed. Unless rigid supervision is exercised, the Government will find newspaper advertising absorbing a good deal of money without any adequate return. I do not presume to say that advertisements should not be given to such journals as the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call</inline> - a good deal depends on whether a newspaper circulates amongst those whom it is desired the advertisements shall reach. But if other considerations are to have weight, then the organ of the Employers' Federation, <inline font-style="italic">Liberty and Progress,</inline> is entitled to equal patronage. No matter how powerful a party may be, it should not exclude from purview the fact that it represents the whole people, and that every side is entitled to fair play. To illustrate this, let me recall the indignation we felt, when in Opposition, at the " gagging " tactics of the then Government. Now that we have changed places, we will, I hope, remember our feelings at the time I refer to, and display a magnanimous spirit. It may be well to have a giant's strength, but it may not be always well to use it as a giant. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Bourke became perturbed immediately this matter was mentioned, though I do not know why. We have not heard a sound from him all the week, but the moment the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call</inline> is mentioned he becomes quite nervous, and immediately asks a question concerning some other journal. If anything wrong has been done in the past it should be rectified. The <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call</inline> should have just the same treatment as any other <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> newspaper, no more and no less. It is not a matter of magnanimity, as the honorable member for Coolgardie suggested just now. No one on this side of the House wants magnanimous action of that kind. All that is needed is even-handed justice. Let all newspapers be treated alike. An inquiry into the whole matter could do no possible harm. I believe that there are some newspapers that at present do not get a fair share of this patronage ; but, on the whole, my impression is that there would be found to be very little complaint. I should like to know from the Prime Minister what business is to be taken next week. </para>

                        <para>. - I am sorry to see such heat exhibited over such a little matter. A number of honorable members seem to suffer from a multiplicity of delusions. The fact of the matter is that the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call</inline> circulates largely amongst working people who do the very kind of work referred to in the advertisement. I have carefully weighed the matter. Any case of this kind that is brought under my notice will be carefully considered. My principle is - treat all alike ; equal opportunities for all ; special privileges for none. </para>
