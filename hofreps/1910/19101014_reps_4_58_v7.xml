                        <para>- I desire to ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> what is the practice regarding private members&#39; business on the notice-paper. I had a motion on yesterday&#39;s notice-paper proposing the appointment of a Royal Commission to investigate the condition of the sugar industry, and without my authority or request some one has had h set down for the 201 October. I had made arrangements with the Acting Prime Minister to have &#39;the motion discussed today should opportunity offer, . but apparently this will not now be possible. I ask you whether, should the opportunity arise, I shall be at liberty to bring the matter forward for discussion to-day? </para>

                            <para>- When a motion is postponed by an honorable member other than the mover, he must have the consent of the mover. The business to which the honorable member refers was an Order of the Day, and had no action been taken regarding it when it was called on, it would have lapsed. The honorable member for Newcastle, therefore, moved the postponement of . its consideration until Thursday next. When an Order of the Day is called on, if no one rises to speak, the question is put to the vote, or the postponement of its consideration is moved. Yesterday the business of the honorable member was called on within a minute of the time when, under our Standing Orders, the period set apart for private Orders of the Day would have expired, and had no one moved its postponement, it would have dropped off the notice-paper. </para>

                        <para>- I spoke in the heat of the moment just now regarding the action of the honorable member for Newcastle, and express regret for what I said. I was altogether under a misapprehension as to what had occurred, thinking that when I left the House last night there would be no alteration of the business-paper. I was in the chamber yesterday morning until close upon half-past  t2,  the time when the period allotted to the discussion of private. Orders of the Day expired. The honorable member for Newcastle has informed me that, two minutes before that time, my Order of the Day was called on, and he rose and moved its postponement for the purpose of keeping it upon the business-paper. </para>

                        <para>I have to thank you for your letter of the 22nd of September with respect to statements made in Parliament as to the alteration in the scale of allowances to postmasters under the allowance system, and the file enclosed relating thereto, which has enabled me, to some extent, to refresh my memory with regard to the circumstances. So far as I can remember, the Postmaster-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick, on the eve of his departure for Bendigo - where he anticipated being engaged for some time in connexion with the elections - gave me the usual instruction, namely, to approve of all matters in which I could act without Ministerial authority, and to refer any others to him at Bendigo, or, if I considered it necessary, to take the papers to him for action. In my opinion, the slight alteration to the schedule of allowances was a matter in which I could have acted under the authority given to me under the provisions of section  6  of the Post and Telegraph Act 1901 ; but as the schedule to be thus altered had been approved by the previous Minister, I thought it better to approve of it for the Postmaster-General, in accordance with the practice of the Department in many previous instances, and with the instruction given in every instance when the Minister anticipated a prolonged absence from Melbourne. If it is considered that I have exceeded my authority in this instance I must accept the full responsibility for an &#39;error of judgment;but in view of the thousands of instances in which I have similarly approved of even more important matters for the Postmaster- General, I may perhaps be permitted to congratulate myself that in this instance only has any exception been taken to such action on my part during my term of office. With respect to the alteration referred to,  it  may be as well for me to point out that it was an alteration in a schedule of allowances approved in the previous March, but which was only to be brought into operation either upon a change of postmaster, or in case where it would increase the allowances then paid. As the alteration in no way altered or modified this condition,  it  followed that there could be no reduction of a then existing allowance except under these conditions. It must also be borne in mind that allowance post-offices were supposed to be, and were, generally, held in connexion with some other business - usually a shop - and that very few shops opened later than  8  a.m. or closed before </para>

                            <para>p.m.  ; there was, consequently, little reason to suppose that any hardship could be caused by the alteration in question. In many instances the emoluments were largely increased by the schedule approved in March, 1909, as, for instance, in the case with the file, that of Keswick, South Australia, where the revenue was only &#163;24 per annum, but where, under the approved scale, the allowance was increased from &#163;6 per annum to &#163;20 per annum. It would, in my opinion, in such instances be only reasonable to modify the payment for early and late mails, as proposed. It must also be remembered that at the  time the alteration was &#34;made it was necessary to exercise economy to bring the expenditure in most States within the appropriation. Allow me to express regret that any action on my part should have given you so much trouble, or should, have led to statements in Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I have found that in the postal service there are some men who are over twenty-one years of age, but are not getting  ^110  a year, because they have not been three years in the service. That has arisen in this way : A number, although perhaps not all, of these men were in the service .when they were young fellows, but when they arrived at the age of eighteen they had to leave because there was no work for them to do. A little while ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> the Public Service Commissioner, in order to meet cases of that sort, called for applications permitting persons to enter the service- although they were over the age of twenty-one, and beginning, I think, at twenty-four or twenty-five. This gave some of those- men an opportunity- of coming into the service again, but if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> had started them at a minimum wage of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;110</inline> a year, he would have put them over the heads of men who were in the- permanent service, and these would naturally have objected. He therefore said they must start at  ,&#163;84  a year, and when they had been three years in the service they would get <inline font-style="italic">&#163;110</inline> a year. It seems, however, that quite a number who have got in at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;&#38;4</inline> per annum are now complaining that they are being sweated, because they are not getting ;&#163;no per annum. I have seen <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> on this point, and he says that, in order to avoid any difficulty in the future, he will simply say that those who enter the service must be younger. Through his action, a number of men of about twenty -four or twenty-live years of age have got into the service again, and at the end of three- years would be paid  ^110  per annum, and&#39; have a permanent job ; but as there has been such a fuss over t!ie matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan-</inline></para>

He said he only took the action he did to give a number of men an opportunity of getting back into the service, but he would not do it in the future, because he could get all the men he wanted under the age of twenty-one. So far as the  Postal Department is concerned, it is better for us to have the employes younger, as we get hold of them sooner, and can train them more as we want them. </para>

The next stage is, I think, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;96,</inline> and after that they reach  ^110.

                            <para>- I do not say that it is so in every case, but there are quite a number of young fellows who had to leave the service at eighteen. I think that age has now been raised to twenty. In order to meet those cases, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> called for applications in a certain form. It is quite possible that in answer to the advertisement some came in who had never been in the service before, but there is no doubt that he gave preference to those who had previously been in the service. He told me that he acted as he did in order to try to meet those cases and so as to give the men another start, since he found that he could get work for them. He tells me that he is not going to do it again after all this fuss. </para>

I want to see the reports before I take action, but I have already publicly stated that, in my opinion, 6 o&#39;clock is a fair time for closing the post-offices throughout Australia. I shall be very glad if in a little while I can issue an instruction accordingly. </para>

                            <para>- That is rather an awkward question to ask me. The Public Service Commissioner has certain defined duties under Act of Parliament, and is responsible to this Parliament for carrying them out. I take it that when any action is necessary in regard to increasing a staff he consults the officers of the Postal Department, and meets their wishes as far as he thinks is reasonable. </para>

                <para class="block">This motion is customary at various stages of the session, and has been moved during every session of the Federal Parliament. There is rather a lengthy programme now before Parliament, containing measures of first importance. It is very desirable that the business should proceed uninterruptedly; and for that reason it is in the interests of the House and of the country that Government business should fake precedence. There is no desire on the part of the Government to prevent the measures standing in the names of private members from being discussed, and I repeat my promise that an opportunity will, be afforded to deal with those motions before the close of the session. Under the circumstances, I think honorable members might permit the motion to pass without discussion. As a matter of fact, I think honorable members will be better off, so far as time is concerned, for, at any rate, they will have the opportunity promised, together with the knowledge that they are facilitating public business. I am unable to indicate at what particular stage the opportunity will be afforded, but before the close of the session, and while there is yet Government business to be transacted, there may be time to dispose of private members&#39; business, wholly or in part. As I said yesterday, it <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> the intention of the Government to proceed next week with the discussion of the Bills relating to the amendment of the Constitution, and that business will proceed uninterruptedly. Other business of almost equal importance will follow; but there may be. and very likely will be, an interregnum, when it will be convenient for private members&#39; business to be dealt with. If such opportunity does not occur, private members&#39; business will be taken at the end of the session. </para>

                    <para>.- Any one who knows the Leader of the House as I do, is perfectly well aware that it is of no use entering any protest whatever against a line of action on which he has determined. At the same time, considering that we usually do not rise until Christmas - though I do not think we shall be so late this year - it is really too early to deprive honorable members of the small time placed at their disposal, in order to discuss matters which to them, at least, seem of considerable moment. I have on the notice-paper a motion dealing with the question, on which, if not in  1913,  certainly in  1916,  every Federal candidate will have to express a definite opinion, for there is no doubt that unification will then, if not earlier, be the leading topic. I did hope to be allowed to make the introductory speech for the edification of honorable members and the people outside. I cannot say that I am very sanguine about the time which will be placed at our disposal. We have already been deprived of some portions of the time, so that, as matters are now, only some three and a half hours are allowed each week. Seeing, however, that this morning, as on other days, half-an-hour has been devoted to questions and personal explanations, we may take it that no more than three hours each week is at the disposal of private members to discuss such important motions as that, for instance, of the honorable member for Brisbane, who is so deeply concerned about the moral tone of this Parliament. I have known the Acting Prime Minister to be in a generous mood more than once ; and I hope he will allow not one or two days, but, perhaps, a week for private members&#39; business before the end of the session. </para>

                    <para>-- I see no reason why the motion should not be carried, subject to the understanding that there will be a reasonable arrangement with private members to give them time as promised. The honorable member for Herbert takes rather a pessimistic view when he suggests that the work of the session will last ;another two months.; for, judging by .the rate of progress in the last week or two, there will scarcely be any necessity for prolonging the session so close to Christmas. I, like many others, have every desire to facilitate the reasonable despatch &#169;f business ; and I do not think&#39; that that is promoted a by a long break .for .private members&#39; business every Thursday, when that business might be .concentrated into two or three suitable .days. Honorable members would then come properly prepared to discuss the various questions raised, and we should not have a collapse such as we witnessed yesterday. </para>

                    <para>.- Yesterday morning I questioned the Acting Prime Minister on this subject, and I am glad to hear the reply &#34;that he has given. There is scarcely a Parliament in the world where so much time is devoted to private members&#39; business; at any rate, nothing like the time is allowed in the House of Commons. Instead of taking private members&#39; business in the &#39;casual sort of way we do now, it would be much, better to devote a week to it during the session, when we could all come properly prepared to deal with the various questions raised. To break into Government business on the most important day of the week is simply nonsense, and the Acting Prime Minister is taking the right course. I hope the Parliament will not continue to sit right into December, because we have been here long enough. If Parliament is to be turned into a club where we may stay all the year round, ret the fact be known, so that we may conduct the business under less pressure. It was always contemplated that the Commonwealth Parliament would not sit more than three or four months in each year. </para>

                    <para>. - I have always held the view that honorable members should be exceedingly jealous in surrendering the one small prerogative in relation to business which exists outside the Cabinet. More and more Cabinets are usurping the functions of government ; and, especially when business is conducted on strict party lines, it is almost impossible for honorable members who happen to sit in Opposition to ventilate a question unless a day in the week is set apart for general business. Grievance day gives rise to a series of rambling discussions, which practically have no result ; and if there were a proposal to abolish that institution, it would be much more rational on the part of the Government. Some of the private business is of equal importance with Government business, such, for instance, as the motion dealing with the sugar industry. If the proposal is to simply devote the last two days of the session to private members&#39; business when the bulk of honorable members have gone home, there is nothing in the promise. </para>

                        <para>- It is not a question of what I can- carry, but a question of whether private members are prepared, to surrender their right. The Acting Prime Minister should arrange that the two days given shall not be at the close of the session. Year after year there is always a thin attendance at that time; and the arrangement is invariably made between the Government and the Opposition that attention shall not be called to the state of the House when the fragments of the session&#39;s business are being cleared away. I hope that honorable members will receive from the Acting Prime Minister a promise that the two days to be set apart for the disposal of private members&#39; business on the notice-paper will be, not at the end of the session, but at least a fortnight before its close, in order that it may be dealt with in a fairly full House. </para>

That should afford those having notices of motion on the business-paper ample time to dispose of them. In this National Parliament we are following too slavishly the methods of &#34;State Parliaments, where members are .given opportunities to air all sorts of fads and grievances. This Parliament does not exist for such a purpose ; it is convened to deal with large questions of national importance. I do not know that a private member has succeeded in carrying a Bill through this House. </para>

I am strongly in favour of restricting private business as much as possible. The sooner we close up the better. We have been sitting here for months, and many honorable members, who are hundreds of miles away from their constituencies, are anxious to return to them. They are out of touch with their constituents, and we all know that an honorable member from a distant State was disfranchised because, in attending to his Parliamentary duties here, he was absent from his home for more than six months. </para>

In the State Parliament, of which I had the honour to be a member for some years, it was the invariable practice, towards the close of the session, to give to the consideration of Government measures the time usually allotted to private members&#39; business. We sit here from ro.30 a.m. to 11 p.m., and for reasons that are not worth referring to this practice means that honorable members from other States, from the moment they arrive here until they leave for their homes again at the end of the week, have to be constantly in the House. Owing to the strength of the party behind the Government many important measures have been carried this session which have required the close attention of Government supporters, as well as of the Opposition. In the House of Commons it is thought that a good session&#39;s work has been done in passing two measures, but before this session closes we shall have come to the conclusion that we have passed more than two which, from our point of view, are of a very substantial character, and for the benefit of the people. As a new member, I do not think there is very much in this practice of allotting time for the consideration of private members&#39; business. From the opening to the close of the session, one or two honorable members monopolize the whole of the notice-paper. Their motions are not closured, and week after week the debate upon them is resumed and adjourned. I am inclined to think that many notices of motion are placed on the business-paper for the purpose of blocking a real discussion of the matters to which they relate; and since we allow private members&#39; day to be utilized in this way, I question whether the wisdom of the honorable members concerned is worth the tremendous expense which its expression entails on the people. The much-despised .grievance day is far more important. On a formal supply motion it is possible to bring forward a substantial grievance, and to make such an impression on the Government as to secure its redress. After all, it is an old constitutional practice - and I have yet to learn that everything that has come down from our fathers is bad- that the King shall obtain no Supply until he has redressed the grievances of his subjects. All sorts of abstract motions by cranks and faddists appear on the notice-paper for the purpose of advertising the National Parliament, and showing that some honorable members think that this Chamber exists to enable them to make academic speeches to enlighten the heathen. I have pleasure&#34; in supporting the Government motion, because I think it is a reasonable one. </para>

                        <para>- But he described himself as a new member of this House, and declared that all private members who had business on the notice-paper were faddists and cranks. That is the sort of expression that one might expect from a hoary and crusted old Conservative. Honorable members who like myself have taken part in reform movements must be familiar with such expressions. As an old member of the Labour party, the honorable member for Hindmarsh in his time no doubt has been called a faddist and a crank, presuming that- he has ever proposed any labour reform. I am not sufficiently acquainted with his history to know whether he has or has not. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member seems to be annoyed, because I am throwing a little light on his reform measures, and his particular sentiments as a re former. I shall not refer to the big railway. I protest against the proposal of the Acting Prime Minister on the ground that it is an interference with the rights of minorities. It would appear that the rights of minorities were never in greater danger than they are to-day. I would remind those who have scoffed at private members&#39; business day of the learned and eloquent speech made by the honorable member for North Sydney on the motion he has submitted in reference to the currency. I would also remind them of the proceedings in this House yesterday when the honorable member for Perm brought forward a matter of such importance that the Minister of External Affairs readily promised to introduce legislation dealing with it. I venture to say that that question would not have been considered by even this Government, anxious as they are to bring about reforms, if it had not been for the honorable member for Perth&#39;s action in bringing it before the House. Then, again, I would draw the attention of honorable members to the motion which I have submitted, calling for the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the sugar industry. Nearly every honorable member who has spoken to that motion has urged the necessity of such an inquiry. I have also on the notice-paper a motion that we should avail ourselves of the terms of the Constitution to carry out a certain reform. Is that the proposal of a faddist or a crank ? If the honorable member for Hindmarsh visits my district he will find that the people there regard it as a matter of vital importance, and I certainly consider it of the utmost importance to the whole of Australia. I agree with the honorable member for Herbert, who points out that the Ministry are going to deprive us of the three hours per week which are now devoted to private members&#39; business. The honorable member for Franklin has shown us that although on grievance day on a formal motion of Supply we may discuss grievances and desired reforms, we cannot come to a vote upon them. On such a motion all sorts of questions are discussed, and the debate is as variegated as a patchwork quilt. After all, I suppose we cannot carry an adverse motion, and I shall not call for a division on this question, although I should like to do so. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to record my dissent from the suggestion made that private members should not be given an opportunity to submit motions to the House, and that the Government alone should provide the session&#39;s business. That would mean party Government in its worst form, and it is just that form of party Government that I am most anxious to see done away with. I believe that the wisdom of this or of any other Parliament is not wholly vested in the Ministry. Whilst the control of the business of the House must, and properly should, rest with Ministers, there are nevertheless behind the Government and in the front Opposition benches, members who are able to contribute very much to the work of the House, and to bring forward measures of advantage to the community. </para>

I am satisfied to take my chance with other honorable members having notices of motion on the business-paper, and I do not say that my motion is of relatively greater importance than are those of others. My point is that there are certain honorable members who while owing a duty to the Government and the country have a special duty to discharge to their constituents. Many of the most important measures that have been passed by the House of Commons have been brought forward for years previously by private members, and have been the result of constant ventilation of the subject. </para>

                        <para>- Probably that is so. Private members by a constant ventilation of the necessity for a desired reform have succeeded in ultimately inducing the Government to take it up. I speak with considerable temerity because of want of experience; but the two hours devoted on Thursday morning to private members&#39; business seem to be found particularly convenient by Ministers and many private members for attending to matters of public or private concern, and afford a welcome break in the monotony of the sittings. If it were not for the opportunity thus given to slip into the library, or elsewhere, it would be difficult for some of us to prepare ourselves for the consideration of the business brought forward by the Government. Taking the list on the notice-paper this session as a criterion of the nature of the proposals of private members, it will be seen that a. very solid attempt is being made by those who are not in the Cabinet to legislate for the benefit of the country. A reasonable opportunity should be given for private members&#39; business, because the right to bring forward legislative proposals is one which private members should and must have. There are many Statutes which have: not found a place in the programmes of Governments, but whose incidence has. proved most beneficial to the community. </para>

                    <para>. This seems a suitable opportunity for inviting the Minister in charge of the Bill to say what preliminaries will precede the issue of the proclamation bringing the measure into force. Is it proposed to arrive at an understanding with the Government of South Australia regarding the questions which have been raised during the second reading discussion, and particularly as to the right of the Commonwealth to determine the route of the proposed railway? Until the proclamation is issued, the Government of the Commonwealth will be master of the situation ; but once it has been issued everything will have been done finally and absolutely, and there will be no opportunity for negotiation or concession. There is a latent ambiguity in the agreement which it is most desirable to remove before the issue of the proclamation, and an attempt should be made to arrive at a clear understanding with the Government of South Australia regarding the matter. The Minister would allay considerable apprehension if he would announce emphatically the policy of the Government in this matter. Do Ministers consider that the Commonwealth will have a free hand in the determination, of the route, of the proposed railway, so that it can. choose such a route as after proper, survey and examination, of the country may be recommended as the best in the interests of the Territory ? </para>

                    <para>.- The settlement of the Territory is a very important matter-, and I hope that it will not be allowed to proceed in the haphazard method which has been followed in some of the States, notably New South Wales, where the best land has been picked up in different districts, so that the whole country has been &#34; peacocked.&#34; Before the proclamation is issued, a precise scheme of settlement should be devised. When I. was Minister of Home Affairs, the secretary had commenced the compilation of geodetic information, with a view to the grading of the country, so that settlers might know exactly where they could get the land they most require. If a proper system of grading were followed, and the land suitable for close settlement made known, the construction of railways for the opening up of the Territory would be much less expensive than it will be if this preliminary work is not done. The Minister might also at this stage inform us how he proposes to people the Territory. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> last night pointed out in your eloquent speech, the close- proximity of the Territory to countries inhabited by coloured races numbering hundreds of millions; and, while some may laugh at the idea of invasion by any of those peoples-, I look upon the Territory, while it continues- unoccupied, as a menace to the safety of Australia, and a peril to our White Australia policy. I should like to know what system the Minister intends to follow for the settling and developing of the Territory. Those already in Australia cannot be expected to leave temperate latitudes- to take up land in tropical districts. Immigrants will, therefore, have to be obtained from other parts of the world, and to get them a bold policy of immigration is necessary. Although I, as a member of the late Administration, had objections to the Bill, I had. no hesitation in supporting it, because I&#34; felt that defence was one of the most important matters for which we had to provide, and we were advocating a forward system of immigration to bring about the occupation of tropical Australia. Unless the Government is ready to encourage immigration, it will be useless to hope for the settlement and development of the Territory by white races. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Illawarra and others will recognise that it is rather much to ask me to outline our policy for settling the Northern Territory, of which we know so little, at a time when it has not been transferred to the Commonwealth. Every one knows generally what must be done, but I can hardly be expected to deal in detail with the matter now. Our first business will be to increase our knowledge of the Territory. A geodetic survey is, of course, necessary for the proper understanding of its conditions. </para>

                        <para>- The South. Australian legislation provides for leases- for terms of twenty-five or forty-two years. The Government do not propose to issue leases for that length of tenure. We want some other legislation, which will&#39; enable us to people the country more on our own lines, and a short measure with elastic provisions enabling leases to be given on some more moderate tenure than is possible under the South Australian legislation will be necessary at a very early stage. The honorable member for Bendigo asked&#39;, in effect, whether the Government would hang up the proclamation and start negotiations; with South Australia as to the railway. That is not the proposal of the Government. They have all along taken the attitude that their powers under the agreement are to construct the railway where this Parliament deems fit. According to the Government&#39;s view, it is not essential that the railway should be constructed wholly within the Territory. That is the position the Government take up. </para>

                        <para>- We do not want to discuss the whole question again. Honorable members know perfectly well that the Government view is the view expressed by the Attorney-General. Both the South Australian Parliament and this Parliament having passed identical Bills, we do not think there will be any necessity for further communication about the matter. To raise the question would simply mean an apparent attempt to vary the agreement. It is of no use to do anything of the kind, and therefore the proclamation need not be held up pending discussions which can have no other effect than to delay the settlement of the whole matter, and which may possibly engender considerable friction. </para>

                        <para>- I am strongly of opinion that the Government should not alienate or give long leases for a single acre. When we come to the question of dealing with land tenure, it will be for this House, and not for the Government, to decide the policy to be followed. I do not think the Minister can at present do more than give expression to what must be simply an idea in the mind of the Government. The land tenure question is a most important feature in dealing with a Territory of this kind. We have the experience of the past in all the States to guide us, and we certainly ought to take advantage of it, and avoid their mistakes. My feeling about the Territory is that, except on the rivers or along the coast, 01 in other places suitable for tropical agriculture in :small areas, the land should not be leased in very small areas, because it is a vast stretch of unknown country, and has to be pioneered. But, in any case, the tenure should not be so long that, when later on we want to deal with the land for purposes of smaller settlement, we shall find ourselves unable to touch it. I think the land legislation of South Australia, small as its .population has been, was the best passed in Australia. She threw her lands open first in hundreds, or hundreds of hundreds, in small blocks .suitable for smaller settlement. Those had to be filled unfairly well before the extension of smaller settlement or selection was allowed beyond them. Quite a different policy -was followed in New South Wales. Under <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Robertson&#39;s Act of 1861, the whole country was thrown open for selection before survey, with the result that &#34; peacocking &#34; took place all over .the colony, and difficulty has been experienced ever since in dealing with the lands that were then taken up. When we come to administer the Territory, it will .be .better to deal with it in factions, just as was done in South Australia ; let us alienate or lease a certain portion, and have that filled up, instead of allowing people to go all over -the country and &#34; peacock &#34; it. I do .not know what arrangement the South Australian Government have made in .reference to the cancellation of leases that have already been granted, or whether we have any power to cancel .them if required, and, if so, under what conditions. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but .it w,as stated last night that provision had already been made to prevent the Commonwealth having to pay on the resumption of leases any increased value that might be given to the land through the building of the railway. I take, perhaps, more than usual interest in this matter, &#62;having been in the Territory forty-six years ago. I was one of a party who took up land in Queensland, on the Barklay tablelands, in 1864, and, by mistake, two blocks of Northern Territory country were included. I may say that the land in that part, and for a considerable distance into the Territory, is as fine land for pastoral purposes as can be found in Australia. We ought to see that we conserve it properly. </para>

                        <para>- That is why I am referring to the leasing question. I want this Parliament to have power to deal with such land as that, because it is susceptible of great improvement. It has a good rainfall and good rivers. The only difficulty was that it was a long way from Burketown, and, at the time I speak of, there was no communication except by buggy or team. After holding the property for seven years we had to give it up. I think that a great deal of the country in the Northern Territory is very much better than people think. It must be different from other parts of Australia if it is not. </para>

                        <para>- The development of the Northern Territory by railway is of the greatest importance, in order to enable the settlers to get to the markets. I do not know whether the Government will deal with the question in the proclamation, but it is also most important that we should have a good port on the northwestern coast, in close communication with the Malay and other States, for the conveyance of our produce to them. I understand that  a  geodetic survey of the Territory has been prepared, and is available in the Home Affairs Department. If so. the House should be given the advantage of it now, because the information would be most useful in dealing with this question. I take it that there is no serious objection to our taking over the Territory. The only difficulty is with regard to details, particularly whether the railway should go outside the Territory or not. Some honorable members who have, perhaps, a better knowledge of the MacDonnell Ranges want the railway carried right through there. I think that such a route would go through very dry country. I hope, in issuing the proclamation, all care will be taken to insure that we have as much control over the Territory as can possibly be given to us. I do not know that the question of the peopling of the country can be dealt with in the proclamation, but I heard the honorable member for Franklin make a very long speech last night on the question, and I hope he will excuse me for saying that he does not know much about the country. </para>

                        <para>- It was a very good corner. I give the honorable member credit for having dug up all the history regarding the Territory, because the information is very useful to the House, but &#34; the country is so vast that we do not realize what it is, or how it can best be developed. We are told that we cannot people it wiLh a white race, but the same thing was said about the sugar lands of Northern Queensland. If we use proper discretion in dealing with the Northern Territory, the majority of those who will develop the country will be white, though I do not say there will not be some coloured people, half-castes, and so forth. Until we have sufficient population to guarantee the ultimate domination of the white race, we should not allow many aliens to be there. </para>

Given the advantages of civilization, the Northern Territory is the place where white people can live; and, with the quicker communication to which we look forward, they will, if necessary, be able to periodically come south, for a change. The manager of a station on the borders of the Territory, who has lived there for about thirty years, tells me that there is no better climate. </para>

                        <para>- I confess I was somewhat exercised in mind when the honorable member for Bendigo initiated a discussion on matters altogether beside the question of the proclamation. Then the honorable member for Illawarra dealt with the land question, and advanced arguments in favour of a certain policy, and the honorable member for Hume covered a very wide ground of discussion. I am very anxious to know what particular subject we may discuss under this clause, which refers to the date on which the proclamation shall be issued. </para>

                        <para>- The debate does not appear to be very open, seeing that the  Chairman  rules that I must not discuss the railway question. I am quite willing, however, to confine myself to the proclamation, and I ask the  Chairman  to limit other honorable members in the same way. What is intended by the proclamation ? Are we going to keep faith with the people of Australia, and carry out the intention of this Bill when it is passed, or is the measure to be hung up for fifty years, as was suggested Vast night by the honorable member for Ballarat? The clause, as it stands, may mean anything ; and I think we ought to know what the Government propose to do. Is the Bill to be brought into operation within a year, or when? </para>

                        <para>- Several honorable members have said that the Northern Territory is a barren country, but I can assure honorable members that when I was a young fellow, in the early eighties. I brought across into Queensland cattle which had been fattened  on  the Barklay tablelands. That fact, from a pastoral point of view, speaks volumes ; and, so far as the fertility of the Territory is concerned, I have no doubt. One thing that has kept the Territory back- </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister* of External Affairs, so far from &#34;stone- walling&#34; his own Bill, has, in my opinion, acted with only proper courtesy in giving the short explanation he did. The House has decided to accept this Bill, and upon the issue of the proclamation a great deal will depend. It is of the utmost importance that Ministers should not immediately upon its issue rush into a policy to which they have not given reasonable consideration. The historians of .the Northern Territory say that it was damned by the first ten years of its administration, and my point is that it is very important that the Government before proceeding to give effect to the proclamation should give the fullest consideration to the policy to be pursued. The Minister of External Affairs will find that South Australia has expended something like ,&#163;300,000 upon surveys and cognate matters, and all the information thus obtained should be available to the Commonwealth. The earliest experiences of South Australia should save the Federation from repeating the errors which that State made shortly after taking over the Territory . As the House has agreed to the principle of the Bill we can only accept its decision, and our whole object now should be to make the measure as perfect as possible. The success or failure of the Territory will depend upon the way in which it is .administered during the first year or two following the issue of the proclamation providing for its transfer. </para>

Will it arise .with the issue of the proclamation? lt would be as well to look into the matter, &#39;because the agreement is somewhat vague as to the date from which the sale and transfer of the railway really begins. </para>

The Minister told us this morning that the understanding was that it was not essential that the railway- should be wholly within the Territory, but I believe the understanding in South Australia is that it shall be constructed in the Territory, and I am prepared to recognise that understanding. Does any honorable member seriously believe that it is not essential, as the Minister has said, to construct the railway within the Territory ? </para>

                        <para>- - Some of the designing advocates of the proposition to construct this railway have endeavoured to gain support for it by suggesting that it will be carried across to the junction of Western Australia with the Northern Territory, whilst others have said that it will run from Port Darwin to Camooweal, on the Queensland border. Even in this House, the members of which might well be expected to know the ways of the world, there are many simple-minded men, and they sometimes believe such statements. I cannot understand a man who has fought his way into the Federal&#34; Legislature being so simpleminded as to accept the suggestion that this line- may be carried towards the west or the east as- the Parliament thinks fit. Honorable members- who believe that, are very simple, or, perhaps,, it. is those who make the statement who are simple; and misjudge the intelligence of the Committee. Those who have had experience of the- Law Courts- know that the Judges construe- Acts of Parliament in accordance with the meaning of the provisions contained in them, and without reference to the speeches made in Parliament. They would have a very difficult duty in ascertaining from the speeches of honorable members the intention of any Act. Therefore the agreement ratified by this Parliament will be interpreted by the Judges in accordance with its actual text. It may be asked why I refer to the Judges. I do so because they will be called on to adjudicate, if, acting on the statement of the Minister of External Affairs, and believing that the Commonwealth can take the railway out of the Northern Territory, we incur great expense in doing so. If we spend money in that way, the people of South Australia will bring the matter before the Courts, and the Judges will ask to see the agreement. They will then find - unless it is amended as I propose - that the agreement plainly states that the railway must be constructed southwards from Pine Creek to a point on the Port Augusta line. But, as there is little interest displayed in my remarks, I call attention to the state of the Committee,- so that we may have a quorum. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#39;&#93;</inline></para>

We ought not to pass the agreement without knowing exactly what we are doing. We have been told that to propose to negotiate regarding it would cause irritation. Irritation to whom? To the Premier of South Australia? But I am positive that he is willing to deal fairly with the Commonwealth, as is the majority of the citizens of South Australia, who have probably not given more consideration to the matter than has the majority in the other States. This is merely a battle between certain business firms and politicians who wish to do the best they can for South Australia and for the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Capricornia suggests that the people of South Australia do not understand this question. I think that the representatives of that State know more of it than do the representatives of Queensland. I should not like to say that I know more about Queensland than do those who represent the Queensland electorates. I ask the Committee to view this matter from a broad stand-point - putting aside all suggested South Australian concerns - <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the interests of the Northern Territory alone. The Northern Territory, for reasons into which it is unnecessary to enter now, has not developed as it should. I hope the Federal Parliament will carry the agreement as it stands, and take the country over, for I believe the people of Australia as a whole are in favour of placing it under Federal control. This should be done in the best interests of the Territory itself. The agreement simply provides that the railway shall be constructed from the Pine Creek line in the north to a point on the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta line, leaving it perfectly open whether the connexion shall be made at Oodnadatta or at Hergott. That is a matter which is entirely in the province of the Federal Parliament to decide; but, as I understand it, the agreement means that the railway shall be constructed in the Northern Territory. That is what the people of South Australia understand. We ought to do what is best in the interests of the Territory itself, and less anxiety should be exhibited to get a line in one direction or another. - What we should aim at is the development of this long-neglected province in the best possible way. The agreement does not bind us to construct the railway on the particular route marked on the map. The Federal Parliament has perfect freedom of action within the Northern Territory, and, with regard to the question of route, I think that, when politicians build railroads themselves, they do not build good ones. It is as well for us to get the opinion of expert engineers as to the best route to take. I should not care about voting for the building of the railway on the precise route marked on the map without having first obtained the opinions of engineers. There may be something in what the honorable member for Fremantle, said in regard to the MacDonnell Ranges, but that question can soon be&#39; settled by railway engineers. It is highly desirable, in the interests of the Territory, that a main line should run right up to connect the north with the south. Branch lines can then be constructed by the Federal Government to connect with the different States&#39; systems, according to what the Federal Parliament believes to be best in the interest of the development of the Territory. In the best interests of Australia, we should not be too anxious to spend a very large sum of money for the development of the northern portion of the Northern Territory straight away. If, for the first development of the country, a line were built from somewhere further north than Barrow Creek into the Victoria River country, millions of acres of land would be opened up, with every probability that it could be utilized for agriculture. If that were done, the Federal Government, within a year or two, would be recouped the money that had been expended. I am anxious not only that the Territory should be taken over, but that it should be developed, and that we should get as quick a return as possible; and for that purpose we should open up the land suitable for agriculture to which I have referred. </para>

                        <para>- The agreement is as clear as the noon-day sun. Some may think that the line ought to run into Queensland, but I take it that, even if the agreement allowed it, the Federal Parliament would consider it extremely unwise to build it in that direction. I ask honorable members to look at the agreement, not in the light of every technicality that can be raised, but as it is understood by the people of South Australia, and, I believe, by .the people of Australia as a whole. It means that the railway connecting the two existing lines shall be made in the Northern Territory, and our great consideration, now and hereafter, should always be the development of the Territory. Its interests must be put first, and the wire-pulling and scheming that may be resorted to in the future ought to be put into second place, if it is tolerated at all. </para>

                    (Franklin) &#91;12.52&#93;. - The speech of the honorable member for Hindmarsh was distinctly amusing. He started off with an assertion that we must consider the matter from the stand-point of the interests of the Northern Territory, and immediately afterwards said that we must stand to the agreement, which compels the railway to be built through South Australian territory, right or wrong, no matter what the reports may show. The honorable member spoke of a national feeling, and deprecated the introduction of State questions.

                    <para>- I am doing so, and am dealing with the arguments that have been put forward in its favour. The honorable member for Hindmarsh argues that a national stand -point, and the interests of the Territory itself, demand the construction of the railway within the Territory to some point on the Port Augusta line. I have always claimed that neither South Australia nor Queensland should be considered in this matter. Perhaps the man whose State has no direct interest in this question is in a better position to judge than are the representatives of the States directly concerned. Tasmania will not be affected by the railway, except that she will have to help to provide the money, and any mistake in fixing the route will make her share all the greater. We therefore claim that the Commonwealth must not be tied up under this agreement as to where the railway shall go before an expert examination has been made to determine the best route. If we pass the agreement as it now stands the Commonwealth will be bound, legally and morally, to construct the railway southwards wholly and solely in the Northern Territory and in South Australia. I should be no party, if the agreement is passed, to taking advantage of the agreement to attempt to deprive South Australia of what she would have a perfect right to claim under it. That would be the meanest kind of repudiation. I hope that if the agreement is passed the National Parliament will not descend to trickery in, for instance, manipulation of the word &#34; southwards.&#34; I doubt if any Court of law would hold that a south-easterly or a southwesterly course would comply with the stipulation contained in the word &#34; southward.&#34; Even if that construction were possible, it would not be an honorable or proper position for the National Parliament to take up. We should not in our first agreement start off with a quibble which would land us in the High Court. The history of this Territory is going to repeat itself, because the first transaction that South Australia made over the sale of certain lands in connexion with the Northern Territory landed her finally in the Privy Council. </para>

                    <para>. - I think the proposed amendment would have come more appropriately in sub-clause b of clause  14,  which would have allowed greater scope for debate. The South Australians, in my opinion, are not considering this matter altogether from an Australian stand-point, but evidently desire this line to be brought to Adelaide. </para>

                        <para>- Probably it would be more correct to say Port Augusta, though, practically, that means Adelaide. On the map prepared, I think by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alexander</inline> Wilson, the proposed route is further, and, perhaps, too far, to the east, but there is no doubt that, whichever route be selected, the time is not far distant when branch lines from the eastern States will have to be constructed. The population is in the eastern States at the present time, and much of the business of the Northern Territory must be conducted from that part of the Commonwealth ; and, under all the circumstances, I do not think that we ought to be confined to any particular route. As the honorable member for Hindmarsh has said, clause 14, which must be read with the clause now under consideration, provides that the line may be taken in any direction so long as it is when it crosses the South Australian border within the Northern Territory. That is the opinion of the Attorney-General, though the Crown Law officers of South Australia have advised to the contrary. </para>

                        <para>- Such opinions are some guide, though, of course, not binding; and there ought to be no direction as to the route of the line. There should be investigation, and, I presume, there will be, after the Territory is transferred. The question ought to be left perfectly open. Railways are always acceptable in Australia, wherever they may be made ; and if it can be shown at any time that a railway to the MacDonnell Ranges will develop the country and pay in the future, then one ought to be constructed. I have been in the eastern part of the Northern Territory, and there I found very good country ; but. on my present information, I do not think that, from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, there is much room for development for the time being, and there should be no objection to deviating the line to the east if the conditions warrant such a step. It is ridiculous to contend that the line should under no circumstances be taken out of the Territory, because it would in no way prejudice South Australia if it were so deviated in order to strike higher ground,, or for some other reason, and then was brought by way of Hergott Springs. It has been said that the country is too low to the east of the lakes-, and that may be so, but there should certainly be some investigation, and my own opinion is that it would be shown that the line could be taken across. Cooper&#39;s Creek, and constructed in such a way as to withstand any floods that might happen. It might be generally advantageous to take the line through a small comer of Queensland; and the question of a line to MacDonnell Ranges might, in that event, be dealt with as  a separate project. It must be acknowledged that the South Australians, who. now possess the Territory and have not done anything with it, are desirous that the trade shall come in the direction of their State, and finally to Adelaide; but that is not altogether a consideration for us, though it is a factor in the question. We have to regard the development of the Territory as a whole from an Australian stand-point. </para>

                        <para>- It was exceedingly .useful financially, and all credit must be .given to the .South Australians for the energy they displayed in the construction of the railways to Silverton. I know that my idea was that a line should be constructed from Cobar right through to Broken Hill, but in New South Wales there were not men with pluck enough to undertake the work. However, all this is by the way; and I only desire to say that, in my opinion, there is in Australia too much Slate feeling, though it is true that that feeling is not so strong as it used to be, and it- is growing weaker every year. &#39; There is no doubt that a line from Queensland will be taken into the Northern Territory, no matter what the route of the proposed transcontinental line may be. </para>

                        <para>- I am not well acquainted with the country north of the ranges, but, from what I know of Australia, I should imagine that, until the tropical zone is reached, the country is dry. If the Attorney-General is right in his interpretation of the agreement, we have not much to fear; but, at the same time, we ought not to be bound to keep the line within the Northern Territory all the way down. The South Australians would get the advantage, if there were any, of a deviation into the Barkly tablelands, because the produce would be taken to Port Augusta, and thence to Adelaide. Prior to Federation I was as strong a State representative as could be found, .because I was looking to the development of New South Wales; but there is now a Commonwealth Parliament, and State feeling must be tempered very much in view of the development of the whole of Australia. Despite what the honorable member for Franklin has said, it is .absolutely necessary to have railway communication with the north for the purposes of defence. The Northern Territory is a rich country, and it must not be allowed to remain empty and undefended as a temptation to any other nation. </para>

                        <para>- I said at the outset that the proposed amendment would have come better in clause 14. We must deal with the benefits which the .construction of a railway is likely to confer on the Territory, although in referring to them I may perhaps not keep strictly within the Standing Orders. It is urged that this line is necessary largely for defence purposes, as well as for the development of the Territory. A large population is sure to settle -  and settle more rapidly than many people imagine - along the main water-courses, fronting which there is some very rich land. lt is for these reasons that I think we should not neglect the Territory, and leave it as a gift for some other nation. Lord Kitchener has expressed a very decided opinion as to the need of a railway, and the development of the Territory, arid we ought to give great weight to his views. My own idea is that the railway from Pine Creek should come down as far as the Barklay tablelands, and then stretch across to Cooper&#39;s Creek, and as near as possible to the lakes. I would remind the Committee that Lake Eyre is about  100  feet below sea level, so that the whole of the country in the neighbourhood must be very low. No doubt, however, a route could be found <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Cooper&#39;s Creek and the Thomson to the west of Lake Eyre eminently suited for such a railway as we desire to build, and we could bring it down to Hergott Springs. I have never been able to understand why the present railway, on reaching Hergott Springs, was deviated and carried over to Oodnadatta. I should have thought that the South Australian Government would desire to develop that part of the country which was likely to give the quickest return. </para>

                <para class="block">The wording of that provision is somewhat indefinite. It does not declare that the line southward from Pine Creek shall be confined within the Territory. It might be necessary for engineering purposes to go outside the Territory, and I think that, as long as we comply with the spirit and intention of the agreement - that the line should be carried to a point on the northern boundary of South Australia - no objection would be taken to a slight deviation outside the boundaries of the Territory. I do not think the honorable member for Franklin would be justified in voting against a proposal to take the railway a little way out of the Territory. All that we are asked to bind ourselves to is to construct the line southwards from Pine Creek to a point on the Port Augusta railway. </para>

                        <para>- There may be such an implication, but I think that the High Court would hold that, even if the railway from Pine Creek were carried slightly outside the borders of the Territory, it would be a compliance with the agreement, so long as we carried it to a point on the Port Augusta railway. Having taken over the Territory in trust for the people of Australia, we must develop it by what seems to us to be the most desirable means, whilst conforming as far as possible to the desire of South Australia. It is not to be supposed that that State should be prepared to hand over the Territory to us without imposing some conditions, but I do not wish to see in this Bill a condition that will hamper us in determining the exact course which the railway shall take. To carry the line to Thargomindah, as shown in the plan distributed amongst honorable members, would be, I think, to go a little too far east. Queensland has already a railway running to Cloncurry and Mount Elliott, which is not far from the border of the Northern Territory, and it is unreasonable to assume that the Queensland Government would not speedily extend that line so as to tap the transcontinental railway, and thus gain a quick means of transit for their stock to Port Darwin. That would give station-owners in the western part of Queensland a readier means of communication with the world&#39;s markets than they now possess. I shall certainly vote to carry out the agreement, but should not object to a reasonable amendment enabling us to take the railway slightly out of the Territory, if necessary, having regard to the country to be served. My chief consideration is that the Territory shall be in the hands of the Commonwealth as soon as possible. The railways are now controlled by the States, but I think that both the railways and water supply would be better in the hands of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- It would be a good thing if we had unification of railway and water supply, and the construction of railways in the Northern Territory will be the first step towards making the railways the property of the Commonwealth. The States would find that the Commonwealth could manage them by means of Commissioners as well as they can. Here we have another incentive for taking over the Territory, and building a railway as soon as possible. Railway extensions in any direction are sure to prove of value. It is only a question of building lines a little earlier than they would otherwise be made. A line to develop the Territory can never do any harm, and, if we can only find the money to carry out the work, before many years have passed it will certainly prove useful. Not only the Northern Territory, but Australia as a whole is going to develop, in my opinion, by leaps and bounds. I wish to place on record the fact that I shall not oppose the measure before us on account of the provision in it regarding the construction of a railway, but I do desire that it shall be within the discretion of this Parliament to select what, in its opinion, is the best route. I do not wish to see the Commonwealth Government hound down to building a Hue that must be absolutely confined to the Northern Territory. I should be quite prepared to support a slight deviation beyond the borders of the Territory if that were found necessary, believing that such a deviation would still be in accord with the spirit of the agreement. </para>

                        <para>- I think the agreement is capable of so liberal an interpretation as would allow of the construction of a line as shown on the map from Pine Creek southwards, leaving the Territory at Urandang - still going southward - and then cutting the northern boundary of South Australia. That would come within the meaning of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of the agreement, to which I invite the attention of the honorable member for Capricornia. </para>

                        <para>- The agreement, in my opinion, allows a deviation into Queensland, but there must be a junction with the railway from Port Augusta. In construing the agreement, stress must be laid on the fact that the line can be taken southwards from Pine Creek to any point on the northern boundary of South Australia, and connected from that point with the line from Port Augusta. There is an ambiguity in the words &#34; to connect with that part of the transcontinental railway to be built in the Northern Territory,&#34; which are&#34; used under the misapprehension that there is an obligation on the Common wealth to keep the railway running southwards from Pine Creek within the Northern Territory, whereas there is no such obligation. I favour a reasonable and liberal construction of the agreement, rather than the limited interpretation which the amendment sets upon it. The main consideration in regard to the construction of the railway should be the development of the Northern Territory. No doubt the eastern States will be ready to make connexions with the transcontinental line. Queensland will endeavour to tap it at some suitable point, and New South Wales will do the same. The object which we must keep in view, however, is the development of the Territory itself. </para>

                <para class="block">Government cannot accept the amendment. No doubt the honorable member for Capricornia thinks it to be the true Australian view that this Parliament should have a free hand in determining the- route of- the transcontinental railway, and not be bound in respect to it by the terms of the agreement under which the Territory is transferred, lt must be remembered, however, that the Commonwealth is acquiring the Territory by virtue- of an agreement with South Australia, which holds it, and is prepared to hold it, if her terms are not complied with. Australia, generally, thinks that the burden of administering the Northern Territory is too heavy for any one State to bear, and. that settlement and occupation would proceed there more rapidly if the administration were controlled directly by the Commonwealth. But South Australia, as the possessor of the Territory, is entitled to say on what- conditions she will part with it. It is quite unnecessary to suggest that her people wish to bring the trade of the Northern Territory to Port Augusta. But it must be remembered that South Australia, having held the Northern Territory for nearly fifty years, and projected certain railway lines for its development, is averse to the adoption of any other policy.  Her  people do not take a hard, grasping, and un-Federal view. Their opinion is that a railway, following the route which they desire, would best develop the Territory. Furthermore, they do not wish to see the money which they have already spent on railway construction wasted. </para>

They feel sure that in the interests of Australia generally the railway&#39; should be constructed as they propose. The people of South Australia have always held that there should be a connexion north and south ; as to whether the route should . be the straightest possible line, or should deviate a. little to the right or to the left, is not material. We are assured by the Attorney-General and the Crown Law advisers that the letter- of the agreement, does not preclude deviation if necessary.

Naturally, at the Conference they pressed for an alteration of the Bill which would make it definite that the line- should he constructed wholly within the Northern Territory, but we were not prepared to agree to any modification.

                        <para>- And a majority in the Council against it. Consequently, if any amendment whatever is made, and the agreement is sent back to South Australia, the majority opposed to it in one House will take the opportunity of closing the whole proceeding. The House in South Australia who are .anxious that the Commonwealth shall reject the Bill or alter it in .such a way as to give them a pretext for rejecting it are not the House that represent the majority of the people of South Australia, but the House that specially represent the commercial and property interests. The property interest in South Australia strongly desires to retain the Territory. I ask honorable members to consider the whole question in that light. Surely we can rely on our Attorney-General to give us a genuine straightforward opinion.  His  view is supported by the honorable member for Bendigo. I think it would be undoubtedly held that the spirit .and letter of the agreement is that the Commonwealth has reasonable latitude in constructing the .railway, but that it must link up the north and south railways within a reasonable time, so as to enable the whole of the Territory to be developed. It is not a question of the interests of one State as against another. </para>

All the lines connecting the big cities of Australia have been built for communication, and not mainly for developmental purposes. If we want to spend, say, &#163;10,000,000 in developing the Northern Territory, we can better achieve our object by building a number of short lines in the north of the Territory, so linking up the ports, than by running a railway through from north to south. </para>

                <para>For the next hundred years we shall not have the coastal lands of Australia properly settled. Why, then, should we seek to- develop the heart of Australia before we have developed the coastal lands, which are much more fertile and much more acceptable as living areas from climatic and social points of view? </para>
                <para>The developmental lines built so far in Australia run inland from the coast. It is complained even now that the capital cities have been too much considered, and that developmental lines have been sacrificed in favour of lines for commercial or communication purposes. The Queensland people seem to have followed the sanest course in building their railway lines, which run into the agricultural lands from the coast. If we take the northern half of the Territory, covering a strip of, say, from 200 to 250 miles inland, we get a tremendous amount of country with beautiful rivers and a very high&#39; rainfall. If anything is to be done in the way of development, that is where it can be done most readily, and will pay the best. </para>

This will tap the best lands for settlement, and enable produce to be conveyed quickly to the markets of Australia and of the world. I hold that a line for defence purposes and a line for development or for communication with the populous centres, should be considered separately. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. If we require a line for transport services, then a line straight up through Australia is not the one. Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, and Adelaide would have to be connected in some way ; and a line from Pine Creek, through the western portion of Queensland and the north-western corner of New South Wales, around by Broken Hill, would, perhaps, be suitable. But if there were a line, as proposed, straight through Australia, and trouble arose in the Northern Territory, troops from Brisbane, for instance, would have to be brought right round to Adelaide, and then conveyed over the central line, thus sacrificing much valuable time. </para>

                        <para>- But under the agreement such a power is not given ; and I am urging that it should be left to defence, engineering, and railway experts to advise as to the best routes for the different purposes I have mentioned. I am sure that it would then be seen to be most inadvisable, especially on the scanty information we have, to build a line which will in all probability result in utter waste of money. </para>

I am sure that no honorable member has the remotest idea of the expenditure which we may have to face under this agreement - whether, if this railway be built, it will ever pay. </para>

                <para>The proposal before us is in the nature of a &#34; leg- rope,&#34; the term applied by the honorable &#39;member for Flinders on a previous occasion to another agreement. So long as I occupy a position in this House I shall express the strongest objection to embodying, in any .agreement any provision which will limit the jurisdiction or action of this Parliament, either now or in the future. It means the placing of a dead hand upon the actions, not only of the representatives &#39;of the people of to-day, but of future generations. </para>
                <para>The suggested route through the centre of Australia may be the very best or the very worst. It is because of the tremendous element of doubt - because of the possibility of our perpetrating one of the gravest blunders that has yet occurred in the history of Australia - that I sincerely ask the Committee not to ratify this agreement - made, not between Parliaments or peoples, but between individuals - in its present form. I appeal to the Committee to rely upon the reasonableness of the people of South Australia - to rely upon their recognising that this Parliament, in asking for more latitude, does so only because of a desire to do that which is best for Australia. I believe that, if appealed to, the South Australian people would be patriotic enough not to insist upon the agreement as it stands, and to respect the strong objection which has been taken by honorable members, although those honorable members are apparently in a  minority. </para>

Assuming that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> of clause 1, is open to any ambiguity, then I would remind the Committee that where you find in the agreement another expression relating to the same subject matter,, but couched in more- definite language, you- must, in order to read the whole- contract together, so limit the generality of the more indefinite phrase as to bring it within- the more definite expression. We shall simply be endeavouring to blind our eyes to the plain facts of the case if we allow this Bill to go through with the idea that there is any doubt about the matter. We are going to salve our own consciences by holding, out. the view that there is some way of getting out of the agreement - that, in the opinion of the Attorney-General, w&#60;e shall be entitled, if we choose to do so, to connect this line with part of the Queensland territory. In doing so, however, we should be doing something in direct conflict with the express language of the agreement. </para>

The question for the Committee is, &#34; Are those obligations either necessary or reasonable for the Commonwealth to enter into at this stage?&#34; I am emphatically of opinion that they, are not. We are told that the people of South Australia are not willing to allow us to take over the Territory on any other terms. We are told that they insist upon strict, compliance with the letter of the bond ; that they must have these terms, as well, as all the others, or they will not. surrender the Territory, with its obligations, to the Commonwealth. The only evidence of that attitude on the part of South Australia is the almost feverish anxiety with which all its representatives, with one exception, urge us to accept this agreement. That does not carry conviction to my mind. Only one representative of South Australia has ventured to express a different view; but the eloquent enthusiasm of the remaining representatives of the State in favour of the agreement is quite sufficient, to override any inference that might be drawn, from his attitude. I realize as much as does any honorable member the obligation we are under to show a generous front to South Australia, not merely by taking over the Territory, but by relieving her of the big burden that she has laboured tinder in connexion with it. Therefore, although I think this is a very one-sided bargain, I should be prepared to consent to- the Commonwealth taking over, not only the whole of&#34; the indebtedness incurred by South Australia in connexion with the Territory, whether the result of wise or unwise expenditure, but,, as the agreement requires, the whole of the accumulated deficit. I should even go further and assent, although with some reluctance,, to the extraordinary provision that we should take over and become responsible for the Port Augusta, line itself if that were absolutely necessary. But when we. are asked to- bind ourselves as a Parliament, to practically construct forthwith a line over 1,000 miles in length-, through practically unknown country,. I think we come to a point at which wise men must hesitate, notwithstanding all the national surroundings. I, for one, have felt myself on this,- as on a former, occasion obliged to oppose this Bill. We are very prosperous at the present time. We have command of a large amount of money ; and our credit has hitherto been unimpaired. How long these conditions may last is not known. We have had a period of unexampled prosperity, so that taxation and the raising of money seem comparatively light matters, and, therefore, our expenditure has been increased in a hundred directions. But the wave of prosperity may recede, as it has always done in the past, and our finances may be straitened. At the same time, we have staring us in the face the peril which threatens not merely Australia, but the whole Empire. The naval power of Great Britain may be placed in a position which will not permit it to guarantee our security as it has hitherto done, and will require a much greater expenditure on our part for defence than we have ever thought of. Therefore, while I desire to meet any reasonable proposition for taking over the Northern Territory, I cannot support the Bill as it stands, and shall vote for the amendment. </para>

                    (Franklin) &#91;3.58&#93;. - I would remind the Committee that this question has been discussed chiefly as it affects South Australia) the interests of the Northern Territory being largely overlooked. The Minister of External Affairs made what I regard as a threat in saying that if the Bill were amended in the slightest the South Australian Parliament would reject it.

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman tried to work on the prejudices or the fears of the Committee. We have heard too much of South Australia in this discussion. If the development of the Territory proceeds, there will be a considerable population settled there, and those who comprise it will demand that the Territory be admitted into the Union as a State. How unfairly will they be situated if they are bound hand and foot to the construction of a line which cannot be a success ! The trade avenues of the Territory may not be identical with the route proposed for this railway, and, therefore, other lines will have to be built, while the Territory may be saddled with a debt of ^8,000,000 or ^10,000,000 for a work from which she gets no benefit. There is a great deal in the contention of the honorable member for Cook that the Northern Territory is likely to be best developed by short lines running in from the coast. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member was speaking of lines running inland from ports, like those of Queensland, which are hundreds of miles in length, though short in comparison with the transcontinental line. Queensland was not developed by a line from Brisbane straight through to the Gulf, but by lines running inland from Brisbane, Rockhampton, and Townsville, which have proved very successful. We have no right to bind the Territory to the construction of a railway by any particular route, when we know nothing about the country through which the proposed line will pass. The reports which we have do not warrant us in believing that the route now being insisted on would pass through the best country, or be the best for the development of the Territory. </para>

                        <para>-  if it were not for the mines, there would be very little traffic on the Broken Hill railway. It is not die traffic between the coast and Broken Hill which keeps the line going, but the enormous traffic to and from the mines. If there be no more traffic between the termini of the proposed transcontinental railway than there would be upon the Broken Hill line in the absence of the mines the project will spell disaster from the outset. We ought to view this question from a national stand-point and not from that of any State. It is not right to commit the Commonwealth to a line which is confined to the Northern Territory, or to lay it open to a charge of repudiation. We know perfectly well that the Crown Law officers of South Australia have declared that the agreement means that the railway must be limited to the Territory itself. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister of Home Affairs an application which I have received from a very important country town in Victoria - I refer to Maryborough - which desires that when the Department is considering the question of establishing Commonwealth woollen mills its claims shall receive attention. In addition to being centrally situated, Maryborough possesses a large public building which is not now in use. I refer to a large and commodious gaol, which, owing to the law-abiding instincts of the residents, is not occupied, and which might easily be placed at the disposal of the Government. I hope that when the Minister is considering this matter he will not overlook the claims of the town in question. </para>

Now, owing to our connexion with the Empire, we may at any time be embroiled in a war.

                        <para>- I hope that that is so. I understood that the Minister of Defence and not Parliament had to decide it. I should like to know from the Minister whether he has received any official communication from the Imperial authorities regarding the events which have recently taken place in Portugal, because that country has a Treaty of Alliance with Great Britain. If the infamous suggestion of the Berlin newspaper be adopted - if there be any probability of Great Britain joining with Germany to divide up the Colonies which Portugal at present possesses, we may, before we know where we are, find ourselves involved in a European trouble. If it be understood that we are to stand by the Empire I claim that we ought to be consulted in all matters which are calculated to involve us in International trouble. If the Minister of Defence has not received an official communication in regard to the matter, I hope that he will by cable inquire the position of affairs in Portugal. We know that Switzerland and Brazil have recognised the Republic which has been established in that country, and it is quite time that other nations did likewise. </para>

                <para>With regard to the question of seniority in the Postal Service, and the payment of the minimum wage, the Minister stated this morning, on the authority of the Public Service Commissioner, that the difficulty in the way of paying certain adult employes in the Post and Telegraph Department a minimum rate of 7s. per day was the question of seniority. I have had an opportunity of studying the question of seniority for many years past in connexion with the Public Service, and I assure the Minister that there is absolutely nothing in that contention. The difficulty can be overcome in the simplest possible way, and a practical suggestion can be placed before the Minister if he is prepared to adopt it. At present seniority is being determined according to the rate of wages the employe is receiving ; but in some services it is length of service alone that determines seniority. </para>
                <para>In this particular case, it seems that the rate of wages is being made to conform to seniority, instead of seniority being made to conform to &#39;the rate of wages. The matter can be easily arranged by reversing die order of things. It could be provided by regulation that seniority should not commence until an employe1 had been three years in receipt of ,&#163;110 per annum. That would overcome the difficulty in this case. It would have just the same effect as bringing the officers in, and leaving them to serve three years, before they got &#163;110 per annum, on the plea that the seniority provision prevented the payment of the minimum rate at an earlier period. </para>
                <para>There is no need for the Commissioner to be vindictive, simply because certain employes ask for a minimum rate of 7s. per day. Seven shillings per day was laid down as a minimum wage when the cost of living was much less than it is today, and it is really no longer a living wage. That is all the more reason why no exception whatever should be made to thu rule. The excuse put forward by the Public Service Commissioner is not a valid one. He may raise objections to my suggestions for overcoming the difficulty ; but for every objection that he can raise a remedy can be found. This is at bottom a question of equity and justice. The Department are receiving the labour of an adult for less than 7 s. per day, which is not now a living wage; and, therefore, the Minister ought to take every means at his disposal to overcome any difficulty, instead of accepting the reasons adduced by the Public Service Commissioner against the payment of the 7s. rate. I have been sent into this House as an advocate of a minimum rate of pay being conceded to all employes in the Public Service, and so long as I am here I shall feel that I am not carrying out my promises to my constituents if I rest content while the Commonwealth obtains the labour of adults by paying what is really less than a living wage. </para>
                <para>I appeal to the Postmaster-General to try to find some way of overcoming the difficulty, instead of accepting the Public Service Commissioner&#39;s statement that it cannot be overcome. </para>

                <para>Whether or not it causes ill-feeling between myself and other members of the party, I am going to raise the question until justice is done. I would rather go out of Parliament altogether than make promises to my constituents on a question of this kind and not do everything in my power to remedy the wrongs which exist. If I am not able to remedy them, I am determined to show my constituents and the people of Australia upon whose shoulders the responsibility really lies. </para>
                <para>We  are  entitled to a more sympathetic reply from a Minister in a Labour Government than we have so far been able to receive on this matter.I sincerely hope the Postmaster-General will endeavour to do justice, and not allow the Public Service Commissioner to exercise his vindictiveness in the way he has indicated. &#39; This is a question of principle that ought to be determined by the Minister, and not by a public servant. I hope we shall get from the Postmaster-General that sympathetic treatment of the case which the whole of his life, and all his public speeches, would lead us to expect from him. </para>
                <para>I have brought this matter forward with some degree of hesitancy ; but, having raised the question time after time, and obtained no satisfaction, I felt that it was high time the Postmaster-General or the Cabinet went into the matter, because if the party on this side of the House is to be asked to carry the responsibility for the existing state of affairs it will be placed in a most invidious position. </para>

                        <para>- I think there are very few ; and the number will naturally become less. There is not only the question of seniority to be considered, but permanent officers who, though younger, . have had. five or six years&#39; experience, and who can do the work better, object to these others coming in and obtaining the higher wage of&#163;110. If honorable members will look at evidence given by an association&#39;s secretary to the Postal Commission, they will see that a protest was made to that effect&#34;. The position has been met by the  Commissioner,  but with no vindictiveness, by simply resuming the former practice which was followed for nine years. </para>

                        <para>- The sufferings of those who took part in the early Labour movement have made it possible for the honorable member, with others, to become members of this House. Now the honorable member tells us that we are unsympathetic with those in the Public Service ! I am as anxious as anybody to see the minimum rate of pay applied ; but we cannot control the Public Service Commissioner, any more than we can the Auditor-General, except by Act of Parliament. In any case, I cannot see that in this case there is any manifest injustice, in view of the explanation of the Public Service Commissioner, who has simply reverted to the practice that was followed for nine years. </para>
