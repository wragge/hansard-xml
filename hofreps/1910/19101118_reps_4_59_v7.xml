                    <para>.- While the honorable member for New England was speaking last night, I interjected that the honorable member for South Sydney had, on the public platform, advocated an export duty on wheat. That was. denied, and as I thought that the honorable member for South Sydney might have been misrepresented, I have since done my best to discover the paragraph upon which my statement was founded, but have not been able to do so, although, so far as the time at my disposal would admit, I have searched both the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph.</inline> The only statement which I could find made by the honorable member bearing on the subject appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of  17thMarch,  and is as follows: - </para>

                    <para>Legislation was required to prevent high prices ruling for the commodities of life. Years ago meat and bread were cheaper in New South Wales than to-day by 300 per cent. Why so? Because of the refrigerator. To-day they had millions more sheep and thousands more cattle in this country, yet the people were taxed' to subsidize the meat steamer to carry the' best of the products to the Old Country, leaving the people here to pay 300 per cent. more than they used to for the inferior portion of those products. </para>

                        <para>- I am not attempting to fasten anything on any honorable member. The statement which I have read does not show that the honorable member for South Sydney advocated a duty on wheat, although he referred to the commodities of life. Therefore I must withdraw the statement I made yesterday that he had advocated an export duty on wheat, although the passage which I have read is evidence that I have not done my honorable friend any great injustice. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, but they have not been getting as much as£110 a year. It is thought that, as we employ them for eight hours a day, and in some cases more - in regard to which I intend to make an alteration - they should receive £110a year. The practical effect of the change will be that the semi-official post-office will go. The position of those in charge of allowance post-offices is different. Sometimes the work of such offices does not occupy five minutes a day. and those in charge are paid in accordance with the work done, so much for every 1,000 letters, and so much for telephone and telegraph messages. </para>

                                <para>- That is not what we call a semi-official office; it is an allowance office. The allowance offices will not be interfered with, because we permit persons in charge of them to do other work. The revenue of an allowance office is sometimes only <inline font-style="italic">£15</inline> a year. An office becomes semi-official only when its revenue reaches ^200 a year. I do not intend to ask those at present in charge of semi-official offices to leave, as that would be a hardship, but in the future all appointments to such offices will be from the permanent staff, and the offices will become official. Of course, I shall have to consult the 'Public Service Commissioner to see how the change can be arranged. </para>

I spent a considerable time yesterday in going into the matter extremely carefully with the Chief Electrical Engineer. I shall be ready to-day to lay a statement before the Cabinet, and immediately a Cabinet meeting is held, either to-day or to-morrow, I trust that something definite will be done. I am advised by the Law officers that it is a question that cannot be settled merely by the Postmaster-General, but that it <inline font-style="italic">must</inline> be settled by the Government. We are acting at every step under the advice of the Crown  Law  officers, and that is one reason why a Cabinet meeting is necessary to deal with the matter. </para>

                                <para>- I am informed that it is the practice to issue to senior cadets forty rounds for each cadet for musketry course, and fifty rounds for practice, and to junior cadets forty rounds for musketry course and forty for practice. In previous years the total sum voted for this purpose has not been expended, and it has been usual to allot the excess to large centres, such as Ballarat and Bendigo, for the purpose of holding battalion matches. This year, however, it was found that the whole amount was required owing to the increase in the number of cadets, and, therefore, no money is available for battalion matches. </para>

                        <para>. - It seems that we are destined to have this cordon of restrictive regulations, particularly around the producers of Australia, made tighter and tighter as the years go by. I am not averse to regulations which will ensure that no advantage is taken of lax supervision to enable producers to send away deleterious articles which do no credit to Australia or to themselves. But that is quite a different proposition from the powers which the Government desire to take in this measure. In fact, this is only another screw in addition to those which have already been turned in various Acts in years gone by. A while ago a Commerce Bill was before this House, and we spent many days trying to get it down to reasonable proportions. And now, notwithstanding all our efforts, the Department of Trade and Customs is making another turn of the screw to eliminate the modifications which were inserted in that Bill. The Minister, under this measure, proposes to take further power to prescribe conditions as to the purity and soundness of exports, and their freedom from disease. I do not know how he is to exercise that power. How can he say any more than can those who are interested  in shipping sound butter to the other end of the world whether or not butter is sound ? </para>

                            <para>- Owing to the unconscionable squealing in which the honorable member and others indulged during the whole of last session, we had neither the power nor the opportunity to do many things that we should have liked to do. We did what we could, and the little we did was possible only by the use of the "gag,"for the passing of which honorable members sitting below the gangway were responsible. The Department is bringing the name and reputation of Australia into disrepute ; and dragging the name of the Government into the mire, by branding as sound fruit which they cannot guarantee to be sound when it reaches the other side of the world. Under this Bill, further powers of the kind are being taken, with a view, I presume, to their exercise. I do not object to the Minister having all the power that he wants to prescribe a standard for foods, the purity of which he may and can control. No one desires to see the faker of adulterated goods given the slightest quarter, for he is an enemy to his race, as well as to the reputation of his country. I would call attention specially to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of proposed new section 112, under which the Governor-General may prohibit the exportation of any goods " the exportation of which would, in his opinion, be harmful to the Commonwealth." Who is to determine what exports would be harmful to the Commonwealth ? Some clerk in the Minister's office. The Minister himself will have nothing to do with this supervision. He will have simply to do that which is suggested to him by some responsible clerk in his office. It is thus proposed to place this power in the hands of a man in the Department who may or may not have an intimate knowledge of the matter which he is called upon to decide, and who may hold that the exportation of certain goods would be harmful to the Commonwealth, and should, therefore, be prohibited. Some time ago the Minister in this House promised that he would take care that his officers made full inquiry into certain matters then brought forward, which all bore upon the purity of foods and their inspection and control. He promised that the producers of the country would be consulted before a decision was arrived at. Has he made any of those inquiries in connexion with the framing of this measure? Why is it that when we frame proposals in relation to almost every other matter, we are willing to obtain information from practically every available quarter, whereas, in matters relating to the primary industries, we seem to ignore the practical experience of Australians. If this were a measure affecting manufacturers the Minister would be consulting experts throughout Australia. </para>

                            <para>-  :It is more important to consider the drying or preserving of lemons. <inline font-weight="bold">"Mr. JOSEPH</inline> COOK.- If the honorable member would address himself to such a problem, he might do some good for the people of Australia. There are many methods of helping the people, but the Minister does not avail himself of them. There are many diseases of which orchardists know very little, and if the honorable gentleman would address himself to the provision of the best scientific expert advice obtainable he would do some good. Under this provision, however, he will do no good. He will make it simply impossible for many people to carry on their business as they ought to do, so tightly is he drawing round them the departmental regulations. If he could help them in this way I should not object, but it seems to me. that he is only going to land the Government in further trouble. What is the use of prescribing that fruit for export shall be sound, when the Minister cannot, by any possibility, foretell whether or not it will be sound when it gets to the other side of the world? Diseases develop on the voyage Home. Even the rancid taste in butter will develop on a voyage. No one can provide against that, and how absurd it is for the Department to brand certain things as sound when they leave here in view of the fact that no man is able to say that they will be sound when they get to the other side of the world at the end of a six or eight weeks' journey. </para>

                            <para>- No, it is an argument for inspection on such lines as will prove to be useful and reasonable. It certainly is an argument for no inspection in respect of the soundness of fruit and the grading of the quality of butter. If such a system were practicable, I should say let us follow it by all means, but why try to do something which, admittedly, no one can do. It is far wiser for the Government to confine themselves to matters which they are able to compass; but, in regard to a matter of which our present knowledge is very small, and which involves contingencies, we cannot foresee or provide against, why have regulations such as are proposed? The Government intend to do what the House on a previous occasion decided should not be done. The growers at present are vexed out of their lives, and do not know which way to turn in order to comply with regulations. They are treated roughly enough by the States, and now the Commonwealth is going to take a turn; and I really think that the interference and dictation will prove so onerous and vexatious that, in despair, they will ask the Government to take the industry over, and relieve them of the responsibility. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that is the disease, but rather one which originates at the core, and works its way to the surface. The wise course is to endeavour to discover the cause of this disease; but there is no doubt that the cases should be marked, declaring that as far as is known the contents are clean. There is no doubt that this marking does the industry some good so far as the English market is concerned. </para>

At any rate, I wish to impress on the House that every precaution is being taken. As to the proposed measures being impossible, they are being carried out in New Zealand, where the conditions, when I was there, were a long way ahead of those in New South Wales, not only in regard to fruit, but in regard to meat and all other exports. This established so much confidence that buyers in England used to telegraph out to their agents to buy on the New Zealand Government stamp. </para>

There were one or two cases in which small, miserable fruit was sent to England, and, because it paid better -to sell this as inferior stuff, it was dumped on the' market for a season, to the great injury of our reputation. </para>

                            <para>- The representatives of the Commonwealth know a good deal about the export trade, but obstruction like that of the honorable member today prevents the Government from assisting them in their work as they should be assisted. I hope that the Minister will take every power that he can get, and will exercise those powers when needful. This may not be congenial to some who are in the export trade, who wish to make a profit which could not be made by conforming to regulations framed in the best interests of the country. No country should be able to export better meat, fruit, or other products than we could send away, and, if possible, not a case nor a carcass should be exported without undue inspection. </para>

                        <para>.'- Honorable members know the importance of our export trade in meat, fruit, butter, and other produce, and the authorities should be clothed with sufficient power to insure that none but good and sound produce is sent away.- It is in the interests, not only of the community in general, but' also of the producers, that a proper standard should be insisted upon. But the Bill gives the Minister a power which is too wide, and which may be harmfully used. Of course, if we could be sure that the administration would always act with discretion and care, there would be nothing to fear, but it is possible that if a cry were raised against Australian produce, and a scare created, restrictions would be put on the export trade which were not warranted, and would be detrimental to the producers. </para>

Then, again, deterioration sometimes occurs on the voyage, from causes which are unknown to the best chemists. Therefore, we must be careful not to impose restrictions which will unduly hamper exports. </para>

                            <para>- Injury has been done by certifying that an article is of a certain quality, because on the voyage deterioration has set in. The honorable member for Hume has just mentioned that apples, to all appearances sound when they left Australia, have, on being unpacked on the other side of the world, been found unfit for consumption, and, therefore, unsaleable. If the administration is careful, no harm will be done by extending the powers of the Minister, but paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of proposed new section 112, which empowers the Governor-General to prohibit the exportation of any goods which, in his opinion, it would be harmful to the Commonwealth to allow to be exported, gives the Minister of the day a very dangerous power. If we knew that only the exportation of unsound produce would be prohibited, the position would be different. But the provision to which I refer enables the Minister to prohibit the exportation of anything. There has recently been a movement to prohibit the exportation of hides, and the Bill empowers the Minister to do this. Surely such a power is unnecessary. </para>

I should like to know how the Minister intends to use it, and why he asks for it. . Until he gives a satisfactory explanation, I shall be justified in opposing the provision. It might happen, if the price of wheat rose considerably above the normal, that the Minister of the day would be influenced to exercise this power in the interest of a section of the community, and to prohibit the exportation of wheat for a certain period, which would do great harm to the producers and to the community Until I get some assurance that it is not possible to use the clause in that way, I shall continue my opposition to it. </para>

                        <para>.- There does not appear to be a great difference of opinion in the House as to the necessity for some power over exports equal, to that now possessed to regulate imports. The honorable member for Wilmot takes exception to the- Bill only because he considers that the Minister should not be vested with the power set out in clause 4, but how is this country to be properly governed unless Ministers are vested with authority to control the export of produce, and other matters? The honorable member, like others, has raised the question of the exportation of wheat. I was surprised last night, when leading members of the Opposition were agreed as to the necessity of the Bill, to hear other honorable members on that side bring in the question of the export of wheat, not because it had anything to do with the measure, but because they thought it would have some influence in the country on the farmers' vote. The honorable member for Wentworth and the honorable member for Echuca tried to fasten on the honorable member for South Sydney a statement that he was in favour of an export duty on wheat, and that he had said so from the public platform. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Wilmot contended that in clause 4 we propose, in the- event of a shortage of wheat in this country, and the price to the consumer being considerably enhanced because of the export of wheat, to give power to- the Minister to forbid its export. No Government would interfere iw ordinary circumstances, or if there was only a slightly increased price. Let me put. to the honorable member the other extreme view. Suppose there was a famine in this country, and our wheat was being sent away because there was a great demand for it elsewhere, does the honorable member contend that the Minister should not have power to step in and prevent our people from starving for want of bread? The honorable member's argument practically means that, we should have no control over our own production, but should leave everything to those who happen to be managing the business, irrespective of whether their actions had the effect of wiping out our own. people. We might have a "famine such as was experienced in India a few years, ago-. </para>

Do the Opposition contend that, because this happens to be a Labour Government, it will not look after the interests of Australia just as any other Government would ? Is it seriously suggested that Ministers should not have power under this measure to prohibit exports in certain cases of emergency ? Every one must admit that the present Minister of Trade and Customs is just as well acquainted with the requirements of Australia as is any other man who could be put in that position. We know that he is reasonable, and that he will exercise any reasonable powers vested in him in a reasonable way. </para>

                            <para>- There is no party aspect about it ; but two or three distinctly party speeches were made last night, and personal explanations had to be made this morning to try to remove the party effect of them, when their authors were confronted with proof that what they had stated was absolutely untrue. The honorable member for Parramatta dealt with the question of the soundness of fruit for export. I admit that it is very difficult to decide whether fruit will be sound when it reaches another part of the world, although sound when passed' for export here. In many cases disease will develop after fruit has been shipped. Scientists are expert  menting in  New South Wales all the time to ascertain how these diseases develop, and how they can best be eradicated. This work takes considerable time and expense,, but it is necessary, in the interests of the orchardists themselves, and of the community generally. The Minister might take into consideration the possibility of fruit changing in condition before reaching, its destination. The honorable member for. Parramatta also complained about the officers ; but how are we to carry on the different Departments of the Commonwealth without them? Who are to be substituted for them? We can employ scientists if necessary, as well as officers ; but we must have some one to control matters for the Department. Consequently I see no objection to the  appointment  of an officer to deal with this matter. The honorable member for Parramatta seems to think that the officer will do- things that would be better left undone, but I contend that he will be wrapped1 up- in his work, and know that it is his duty to do his best  in the interests of Australia. He will, therefore, be very careful, in carrying out his work of inspection, to do nothing that will in any way interfere with the welfare of the people. From the point of view of the producers themselves, it is better that we should educate them up to the necessity of being careful. </para>

                            <para>- I hold a different opinion. We should also try, as far as&gt; possible, to eradicate the different diseases of fruit; and, as we are settling so many people on the land, and they will have to make a livelihood and get a market somewhere, we should instruct them, as far as possible, in their own interests. Thousands of people with no experience are becoming orchardists, and they must be educated in the diseases that attack fruit, and the best means of production. Consequently, the introduction of a system of inspection, together with the other work that the scientists are doing, will tend to produce fruit sounder and freer from disease, and thus benefit the products and the community generally. One of the great works which this Parliament must undertake is to place Australia on a strong footing in competition with other nations. If no power is to be vested in the Government, and things are to be allowed to be carried on in a loose way, our products, when sent to other parts of the world, will very likely be condemned, and Australia will suffer. The powers asked for in this measure are absolutely necessary. Australian interests must be placed in a much stronger position than at present. I agree with the Minister that if there had been a more rigid inspection in regard to the shipment of meat to the Philippine Islands, it would have been better for all concerned. Probably it will take Australia years and years to get over the effect of the condemnation of those two consignments. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister's information confirms my impression, and emphasizes the necessity for the exercise of care. Any nation that is competing for outside markets must  have  a rigid system of inspection as a guarantee to its customers that its goods are sound, as far as that can possibly be insured. The question of butter has been mentioned, and, in that connexion, whilst it is just as necessary to deal with butter as with any other article of export, the Minister will have to be very careful what he is doing. I quite admit that it is requisite that butter should be inspected and graded, but " I also know that if you go beyond the grading, and begin marking or branding, some butter which has been given an inferior brand at this end may improve in condition before it reaches the market, and will still have to be sold according to the lower brand placed on it. The Minister, in dealing with the export of butter, must not allow his officers to induce him to sanction regulations which would react to the detriment1 of the Australian producer without any corresponding benefit to the community. It can be clearly shown that butter graded here in a certain condition may be found to be inferior when it reaches its destination, while other butter may go through exactly the reverse process. I hope the Minister will not lose sight of statements made by different honorable members in that regard, because the question of the grading of butter is one of considerable importance to the producers, and great care will have to be exercised, although I admit that we must have some supervision of our exports in the interests of the country. Without 'it we shall find ourselves shut out of the markets of the world, just when we are doing our best to induce people to settle in Australia, and help to expand the volume of our production. I am sure the present Minister will do his duty by the producers of Australia, and therefore I have no misgivings in giving him the powers contained in this measure. </para>

                        <para>. - This Bill introduces another side of the Customs Department - the export side - with which we have not been so familiar as we have been with the import side. As a rule, chief consideration has been given to the importation rather than to the exportation of goods, and to the conditions under which our imports are placed upon the market. In this Bill, however, the Minister takes power to deal principally with the exportation of our primary products, and that being so, it is our duty to give it the most careful consideration. If the Commonwealth is to be developed we must encourage settlement under conditions that will stimulate our primary industries, and make them remunerative undertakings. I believe that the Bill has been introduced with that object in view, and that the intention of the Minister and his officers is that under it such action shall be taken as will force our exports to be of such a quality that they will command a ready market anywhere. Our population is not nearly large enough to consume all that we produce, and our primary producers have thus to compete in the markets of the world. We hope that we may yet be able to overtake the surplus. But since we have to export largely, it is advisable that we should take steps to protect the interests of honest producers. I think, that the Minister proposes, under this Bill, to endeavour to protect those who are trying to place on the markets of the world the very best that can be produced - whether it be wheat, meat, fruit, or butter - against those who are placing' on the market an article which, although it may suit their individual purposes to sell it, is likely to injure the reputation of Australia. There can be no question as to the desirableness of such supervision. The only difficulty is as to the method by which it shall be carried out, and the extent to which these powers shall be exercised. I gathered from the attitude rather than from the statement made by the Minister a few moments ago that he would be prepared to consider an amendment of clause 4 which would carry out what is evidently the intention of the House. Our desire is that only such powers shall be taken as will enable the Minister to prevent the exportation of goods that are harmful, deleterious, or likely to injure the reputation of Australian products. T think that this desire could be met by inserting after the word " would " in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b-</inline></para>

                            <para>- I merely proposed to make a suggestion which I thought would shorten the debate. I think we might declare in clause 4 that the export of goods should be prohibited only when their nature or quality is such as to make them unfit for human consumption. With such a power, we could have prevented the exportation of certain meat to the Philippines, to which reference has been made. If upon inspection it had been found to be unfit for human consumption, no one could have taken exception to the prohibition of its exportation. But a number of honorable members fear that, in exercising this power, a Minister at some future date might, with a view to affecting prices, adopt such stringent methods as would prevent the exportation of certain goods. The result to the trade generally would be even worse under such hampering conditions. We have already had some little experience in that regard in connexion with the export of butter, and I was glad to hear the Minister say that that export would not come within the scope of this measure. </para>

                            <para>- Those engaged in the export of butter do not ask that it shall be practically free from inspection. They are willing that butter for export shall be inspected, but they contend that the only mark placed upon it by the Government should be one to the effect that it is fit for export. We object to the Government placing relative marks on butter-boxes. We object to their so branding butter as to declare that the quality of one class exceeds, to a certain extent, that of another, and thus to pronounce, as to quality, an opinion, which must, to a very large extent, regulate prices on. the market. Various statements have been made as to the way in which butter is handled by speculators and others, and I wish to say in passing that practically all the butter that we export is now handled by co-operative movement. The speculator, whom we have good reason to fear, has practically been removed from the trade. The man who used to purchase butter in Australia, and export it with a view to securing a profit, is now scarcely recognised, and is hardly to be found in the Commonwealth. The conditions prevailing in New Zealand allow more room for the operation of speculators, because, I understand that purchasers in London are daily buying New Zealand butter on the grading system for the reason that it enables them to send cablegrams to their agents in New Zealand directing them to buy at a certain price, butter that carries a certain grade. Such a system enables the speculator to come in, but here we do not deal with him. </para>

                            <para>- It is largely wiped out. A large number of firms, who may be regarded by some persons as speculators, are now acting merely as forwarding agents. Any butter factory may arrange with quite a number of large firms, in Sydney to handle and ship its produce, to place it on the market, and to sell it on commission. That is the system under which a large quantity of butter is disposed of to-day. In comparing the Commonwealth system with that prevailing in other countries, it is not fair to assume that certain results, so far as prices are concerned, follow from a certain basis of treatment. The statement has been made that, owing to the grading and marking of butter exported from New Zealand and Denmark, higher prices are obtained for it than are obtainable in respect of the Australian article. That is not the reason for the difference in prices. Other factors contribute more largely to it. The most important of these is -that in New Zealand, and particularly in Denmark, milk is collected from .the farmers every morning, and separated at central factories under a uniform system. In Australia, on the other hand, owing to our great distances many farmers are unable to deliver their milk at central factories, and have to use private separators. They sell their cream, and not their milk, to the factories. Consequently the milk is separated under differing conditions on every farm, and individual farmers, instead of the factories, are responsible for the condition of the cream. That, more than any other fact, is responsible for the varying quality of our butter. The honorable member for Hunter made a very important suggestion regarding the inspection of products, and one which, though valuable, is really beyond the scope of this Bill. He urged that the system of inspection that will be carried out under it would have the effect of educating the people. Whilst I am sure that he is anxious that those engaged in primary industries shall be educated to produce only the best commodities, this Bill as it stands will not enable such education to be given. If an article intended for export is found to be below the quality prescribed it can be prohibited, but there will be no means of educating the people responsible for it to produce a better article.. I hope that the Government at an early date will take up the proposals made by their predecessors for .the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau, and when such an institution is established the object which the honorable member so highly appreciates can be carried into effect. I rose more particularly to draw attention to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of proposed new section 112, to which exception has been taken, and to point out that the difficulty could be overcome by such an. amendment as that which I have suggested. </para>

                        <para>.- I have listened attentively to the arguments of the Opposition, and as my name was drawn into the debate last night, I think it well to explain my views on certain matters concerning which there seems to be a misunderstanding. The honorable member for Cowper and others have told us that butter-making is a purely co-operative effort, and that the industry should therefore be regarded as " the pure merino." I remember, however, that some nine months ago an attempt was made to raise the price of butter to the consumer. The Cold Storage was filled with butter, and only a certain number of boxes per day were sold for local consumption. In this way it was hoped to raise the prices. I hold that the Minister has a right to say that no butter shall be exported if a ring is operating to fleece the people - causing, as they could, prices to go up to an extraordinary extent by exporting largely and refusing to place much butter on the local market. </para>

                            <para>- No ; but we never know what may happen. There is a tendency in the butter industry, as in other industries, to regulate prices; and if that regulation is sought to be brought about by exportation in the case of local .shortage, it is quite proper that the Minister should have power to step in. This, of course, could' be done without injuring the producers in any way. About nine months ago, an attempt was ' made to raise the price of butter, but the public met that by simply refusing to buy. </para>

                            <para>- That was another occasion, and it' only shows how much we are in the hands of people who claim to have wiped the middleman out. In all this the farmer does not benefit; and the facts only prove .how necessary it is that the Minister should have the proposed power. A ship was wrecked on the coast, and over 1,000 cases of butter were brought back to Melbourne. Should the Minister not have the power to say whether or not that butter may be re-exported? It was desired to re-ship this cargo, not in the interests of the farmer, but in the interests of the insurance company. </para>

                            <para>- This Bill will give the Minister all the power that is necessary under such circumstances. A good deal has been said about the exportation of bides and skins; and I should like to explain my position in the matter. I have no interest in advocating that farmers should be taxed, or should not obtain the best value for their hides. </para>

                            <para>- In Botany, which is in my electorate, the tanning industry has been long established, but to-day there are not so many men employed in it as there were twenty years ago. This is not because there are not more hides and skins, but because there is a large demand for hides in America and elsewhere, owing to the development of the motor car trade. The result is that large quantities of hides are exported, and work that used to be done here is now done in Japan, Germany, and America. Of course, the price of local leather has gone up, and it may be that the farmers are thereby reaping a temporary advantage. </para>

                            <para>- But the local tanner has to buy in open market against the other buyers, who outbid him. What I fear is that, in time, foreign buyers will crush out the local buyers, and then the farmer will not obtain so high a price as he would under ordinary circumstances, because there will be fewer buyers, who will be able to arrange among themselves as to what prices they will give. </para>

What I am urging is that the Minister should have power to step in when there is a ring which operates to the prejudice of our own people ; because&gt; as I say, I fear that without some such power the farmer, as well as the tanner, will suffer in the future. How are we to increase our population if we are only producers of the raw material ? We have the men and the skill to produce leather, but we are not producing enough for our own consumption, owing to the causes I have mentioned. </para>

                            <para>- That is only an assumption. The Minister should also have power in another direction. At one time, when there was a shortage of fodder in New South Wales, and, of course, an increase in prices, fodder continued to be exported to Africa by gamblers on the market. The result was that, in the city of Sydney, milk went up in price, while the  employes  in the industry were unable to obtain fair conditions, owing to the cost of fodder. The Minister ought to have power to prevent the exportation of any commodities of which we are short; and I agree with the honorable member for Hunter that, in case of a wheat famine, no man should be allowed to gamble in wheat exportation. </para>

                            <para>- There must be high wages when the prices of commodities rise. The honorable member for Parramatta has suggested that we are opposed to the farmer getting high prices when there is a demand for his commodities ; but who creates the demand ? The man who speculates in wheat and exports is the man who causes the shortage. It is possible to ship wheat to the Old Country, and there sell it  cheaper than in Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - Statements have been made this morning, even by honorable members on this side of the chamber, which I think should not pass without comment. I disagree with some of the remarks of the honorable member for South Sydney. If we commenced to impose export duties, it would lead to endless trouble. Should an export duty be placed on hides in the interests of the leather merchants, the makers of boots might have good cause for asking for an export duty on leather, and in their turn the wearers of boots might ask for an export duty on boots. </para>

Not sufficient recognition is given to the fact that exportation provides a great deal of employment for city workers in the handling of produce, which has to be transferred from trains to lorries, and thence to the holds of the vessels which take it away from our ports. No honorable member wishes to injure our export trade, because on it largely depends the prosperity of a great army of city workers, as well as of the community generally. </para>

                            <para>- We are dealing now with exportation, and every Honorable member, I am sure, wishes to do all that is possible to increase our export trade. We have passed laws this session whereby the operations of rings, trusts, and combines should be kept in proper bounds, and have taken the power to nationalize any industry should we find that to be necessary. The honorable member for South Sydney referred to the fact that about nine months ago the price of butter rose to an exorbitant rate, but let me inform the House that "those interested in butter-making rejoiced at the fact that the consumers took the matter into their own hands by substituting jam for butter, so that in twenty-four hours the price came down again. </para>

                            <para>- The high price of butter in Melbourne was due partly to a slight shortage, and partly &gt;to the presence of an extra large gathering of consumers in the metropolis to welcome the American Fleet. But persons interested in the making of butter told me that they were glad that the consumers took a stand against the raising of the price. There must be sympathy between producers and consumers in a healthy state of industrial conditions. If not, one side or the other must suffer. The Minister referred to the fact that we have lost trade because inferior products have been sent to other countries, but I am sure that every honorable member would set his face against the export of inferior produce. An embargo should be placed on the exportation of unsound goods. It is not the producers who are the offenders, but speculators, who try to make unfair profits. Regarding the examination of fruit, I would point out that it is not always easy to determine whether it is sound or not. I understand that <inline font-style="italic">some time ago</inline> an inspector who examined a consignment of apples, found them to be spotted on the outside, and, therefore, did not grade them as highly as some other apples which were not <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> spotted, but that in the London market the spotted apples sold well, whereas the others, which, when they left here, appeared to be free from disease, arrived in thoroughly bad condition, because they were attacked from within by a disease whose presence was not suspected at the time the examination was made here. </para>

                            <para>- I know that the honorable member is an expert in this matter, and he would do well if he could pass his knowledge on to those whose business it is to examine our exports. I believe that both apples and pears which have been certified to as sound on leaving Victoria have arrived in England almost in a state of pulp. As to butter, every one who buys it f.o.b. or on the trucks or vessels in our ports receives a certificate indicating its quality. I have always objected to the marking of quality on the boxes themselves. I know, however, that when certain butter, sent from Yea a few weeks ago, was given as a grade-mark the figures  90  to  92,  the person in charge of the exportation thought that in London it would receive only second grade price, but it brought the highest price in the market. This information came direct from a director of the Yea Dairy Company. </para>

If we desire to improve our butter, we should grade the raw product more carefully. I know that the Minister will deal on their merits with proposals which are put before him, and before taking action, consider all the pros and cons. We must pay the closest attention to our exportations, and do all we can to get the best name for our products. We shall be more than foolish if here or elsewhere we proclaim its faults to the world. Our best policy is to follow the example of other countries, and correct our faults and failings, but not to publish them abroad. Although wide powers are being given to the Minister, I feel confident that they will be exercised with discretion. </para>

                        <para>. - The debate has turned upon the provision giving the Minister power to prohibit exportation. Honorable members seem to forget that when the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> was at the head of the Customs Department, an Act was passed giving the Minister a much wider power in regard to the prohibition of imports. Under the Customs Act, no one is permitted to import goods the importation of which has been prohibited by proclamation. It is not necessary that the goods shall be harmful ; indeed, no condition is attached. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">The power given under the Bill is narrower, because the prohibition is to apply only to exports which, in the opinion of the Governor-General, are harmful to the community. When speaking on the second reading, I referred to the fact that the Bill gives fuller effect to the attempt of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro to provide for a standard sack, with which his name is so honorably associated. I am sorry the honorable member was not present, because I paid what I considered to be a well-deserved tribute to the action which he took. We are not narrowing our powers, but are taking, as regards exports, a power which is absolutely necessary. The honorable member for Parramatta and others said that we had no right to brand cases of apples as "sound" or otherwise. That regulation has been in existence for four or  five  years, but three weeks or a month ago I telegraphed to the Australian Fruitgrowers' Conference, sitting in Hobart, that it was my intention to take that word out of the regulations. I did so because it is impossible, on account of an obscure disease known as bitter pit, to decide whether the apples will be sound six or eight weeks hence. The Department has been reluctantly compelled to realize the necessity of making the change, and new regulations regarding that matter will come into operation as soon as possible, in the interests of the fruit-growers. The Department are taking all possible steps to ascertain the nature of the disease in question, and what remedial measures can be applied. We have been in consultation with some of the StateGovernments in order to secure the services of a gentleman holding a very high position in that branch of work to conduct the investigation. The honorable member for Parramatta also objected to our taking power in the last clause to regulate the size of fruit cases. The fruit-growers themselves asked that this should be done, either by regulation or by legislation, so that any case exported from Australia, and purporting to contain a bushel, should in fact contain a bushel, and not less. The fruit-growers were unanimous on the point, and some honorable members accompanied a deputation to me less than a fortnight ago on the subject. </para>

                            <para>- We want our goods to go sixteen ounces to the pound, and twelve inches to the foot. Honorable members have suggested that a Minister may go to extremes in exercising his powers under this Bill, but, as the honorable member for Maribyrnong pointed out, it is not always possible for a Minister to define exactly the extent to which certain powers are required. It would not do for those of us who are acquainted with the details of some of our industries to get up in this House and say exactly where faults have been found in our export trade. We are simply anxious to take such powers as will give us a right to inspect exports, and prohibit the sending away of articles which would damage Australian trade. Some of the people in these particular lines of business desire that this protection should be given ; while it is better, in the case of others who do not want any Government interference, that we should protect them against themselves. It is our duty to keep the name of Australia at its present high standard, and I trust it will be raised even higher. We should see that the stamp " Approved for export " is a guarantee of soundness and purity, and not, as has happened in some cases in the past, allow it to be obtained whether the goods are pure or . not. I think ' it is necessary to have this power, even in regard to butter. In to-day's papers, as the honorable member for South Sydney mentioned, particulars are given regarding  1,042  cases of butter obtained from the wreck of the <inline font-style="italic">Pericles.</inline> There is nothing in the Commerce Act at present to prevent that butter being marked in any way, and re-exported, to the injury of the Australian butter trade. I am sure the honorable member for Richmond will admit that it is not right that that butter should be allowed to go on the London market as prime Australian. </para>

Even if it were the worst quality that could possibly be imagined, there is nothing to prevent it leaving Australia. I notice that that matter will come before me for decision, and I shall treat it as fairly as I do every other case. </para>

                            <para>- The moisture content is not in question. The butter fat content is down to  81.93,  which is below the standard. It is not right that any article which will damage Australian trade should be exported. We have at present a certain amount of power. We can compel the removal of certain marks from the butter. We have provided, as far as imports are concerned, that the contents must be true to name, and I contend that we should have even greater power regarding exports. There was recently a case in which some butter had remained in the Sydney Cool Stores for eight months, and it was proposed at the start of the next season to send it away as new season's butter, on the last season's certificates. I believe that we have under the Commerce Act most of the power necessary to deal with the shipment of butter, and it is only with regard to other commodities that we are tightening up the Act by means of this Bill. I can assure the House that I, like every other Minister who succeeds me in this Department, will be very careful in exercising these powers. In fact, the greater the power a Minister has, the more careful is he likely to be in the exercise of it. </para>

I see no reason why the proclamation should not be laid on the table of the House at once if the House is sitting, or immediately after it meets if it is not then sitting ; but I do not know that we can make it, like a regulation, subject to the approval of the House. I am sure that any Government who found they had made a mistake in issuing a proclamation prohibiting certain imports or exports would take all the steps necessary to have it annulled at once. </para>

                        <para>. - I am not quite sure of the reason for the difference in phraseology between paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of section 30 of the principal Act which this clause is designed to amend and proposed new paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d.</inline> The Act as it stands provides that goods subject to export duty shall be under the control of the Department from the time when they are brought to any port or place for exportation until the payment of the duty, whilst under proposed new paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> they are to be within the control of the Department from the time that they are prepared in, or are brought into any " prescribed " place for export. Exportation, and not the purpose of export, is really the test as regards control.

                        <para>.- On the motion for the second reading of this Bill I referred to the extensive powers taken under this clause, and showed that a great deal must depend on the manner in which they are administered. I am more directly interested in the butter" industry than in any other, and I feel that a great deal of harm may be done to that industry, unless the greatest care is taken as to the regulations issued under this clause or under the Commerce Act. I recognise the necessity for preventing any Australian product being exported in such a state that it will actually injure our export trade. There is every reason why the Minister should be clothed with ample powers to deal with such cases, and. there should be regulations to set up the standards and the conditions under which Australian products should be exported, so as to prevent the unscrupulous speculator or trader, for the mere sake of putting money into his own pocket, damaging our export business. I should never protest against any regulation that the Minister might bring into force with that object in view. But when these powers are extended for a very different purpose - to secure the grading of our exports, to put upon them grade marks which practically determine their price- </para>

                            <para>- I am aware of that, but this clause will amplify the Minister's powers under that measure. A Minister not thoroughly conversant with the details and technicalities of our export business might very easily bring into force regulations whose operation might be diametrically opposed to the best interests of an industry. We had this morning from the honorable member for Hume expressions which displayed his utter and absolute ignorance of the question of which he was speaking. That honorable member  might hold office as Minister of Trade and Customs and bring into force, doubtless with the best intentions, regulations providing for the grading of our products such as he said he would like to see in operation. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware of that. The honorable member for Hume went on to point out where, in his opinion, New Zealand had been able to surpass Australia in the matter of her butter exports. He stated that the grading regulations in force there enabled London buyers to cable to New Zealand and buy on the spot. As a representative of a district where, possibly the co-operative movement has been carried further than it has in any other part of Australia, I tell the Minister that that is a practice against which the whole of the efforts of the co-operative movement have been directed. He will realize, therefore, that, in opposing the grading system, we are opposing that which, as the honorable member for Hume says, practically plays into the hands of the speculator, and enables him to buy on grade marks, irrespective of the true market value. </para>

                            <para>- It does not secure that higher price all the year round. The people of New Zealand have climatic and other conditions which enable them to compete in the production of butter in a way that is impossible to us, having regard to our climatic conditions, during the months of January, February, and March. During those months we export a very large quantity of butter, and owing to the climatic conditions, we cannot turn out as good an article as can New Zealand during the same period. Although it is true that in respect of that period New Zealand butter, on the average, realizes more than does Australian butter - leaving out of account certain factories in the Commonwealth which can compete with New Zealand butter all the year round - yet, on the average, owing to the operations of the speculator in the New Zealand market, dairy-farmers in Australia are paid from1d. to1½d. per lb. more than are the dairymen of New Zealand for the season. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; and yet the honorable member for Hume says that that is the advantage of the whole system. It is the one thing against which the dairymen have been fighting. For the last ten years we have been trying to get rid of the speculative buyer, and just when he has become almost a thing of the past we have the threat that he is once more to be brought to the front by the introduction of the grading system. We have succeeded in keeping down the speculator by shipping direct to London, and selling our butter on its merits. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that he is. The honorable member for Hume said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Meares</inline> was the man whom he had to fight ; and I would reply that the co-operative producers of Australia have to thank that man because he fought the honorable member for Hume tooth and nail. The honorable member no doubt believed that he was acting in the best interests of the co-operative movement of Australia, but he was not. There is no man in Australia to-day whom the co-operative producers have to thank so much as they have to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Meares,</inline> and there is no man whom they have so little to thank as the honorable member for Hume. I wish he were present ; if he were, I would make the same statement, and perhaps add a little to it. The honorable member said that we desired to enable a few Inter-State men to ship rotten butter from the northern rivers of New South Wales. Let me tell him that practically no one is directly interested in the industry there save the producers of the article itself, and they number some thousands. The whole of the industry on the northern rivers of New South Wales is, with the exception of a few tons of butter per month, absolutely in the hands of the producers. They have had to fight interested parties in different parts of New South Wales, whom the honorable member for Hume stood behind; and he practically forced us to adopt methods involving, for the time being, a loss of thousands of pounds, in order to overcome the machinations of those particular people. There is nobody whom we had to fight more, or who was more difficult to overcome, than the honorable member for Hume. I urge on the Minister, before proclaiming any regulations, to consider the position well. There is nobody who has any deep interest in the industry who would assist in bringing about a state of affairs which would prevent our produce being sold on its merits, or which would result in loss to our primary producers. Imports and exports are not altogether on the same basis. It is apparent that there is a wide difference between clothing the Minister with power to prevent imports - seeing that Australia is committed to a policy of Protection, which is more or less a policy of preventing imports - and giving him power to prevent exports. The honorable member for South Sydney had no hesitation in expressing the hope that this power would be used to prevent prices rising above a certain point that the party in power might think should not be exceeded; and, consequently, the proposed Ministerial power is very extensive, and possibly dangerous. There should be some safeguard, and I move - </para>

                        <para>.- This is a very good amendment. At first I thought that the power under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> ought to be exercised on a resolution of the House; but probably the Minister intends to deal with specific consignments rather than with classes. If it were intended to deal with classes of exports, then there ought to be a resolution, because that is general legislation ; but if the intention is to deal with specific shipments, he could not wait for a resolution. I have a doubt whether we can direct the Executive to revoke a proclamation, though we can decide that a proclamation should cease to have effect. However, that is a mere matter of drafting. I do not think there is any reasonable doubt that we can stop exportation. That cannot be done in Canada, where the power is to regulate trade, and it has been held that regulation does not include the power to stop. Our power, on the other hand, is to make laws in respect of trade and commerce; and whether that be wider than the Canadian power remains to be seen. However, we need not trouble ourselves on that point; if we are convinced as to the policy we should adopt it, and leave the question of its legality to the High Court. The Minister ought to be very careful in the regulations he issues as to the transfer of goods from one State to another. There is an expressed declaration in the Constitution that, after the imposition of uniform duties, trade and commerce amongst the States is to be absolutely free; and if goods are not to be sent from one State to the other except according to the regulations, unless these are clearly ancillary to exportation, the High Court may say that they are bad, because the primary injunction is freedom of trade. This provision may be a copy from the American Act, but the power is different in the United States. There Protection between the States may be declared, the only condition being that whatever law exists between two States shall apply to the whole. However, these are matters for the Judiciary, and I merely suggest that the regulations should be carefully drafted, and that the ordinary method of the Department, which is almost developing into abuse, of providing in a Bill every single power that may help, whether necessary or not, may not be carried to further extremes. Bill after Bill bristles with penalties and prohibitions, as I shall exemplify in a subsequent clause. </para>

                        <para>. - I was not present this morning, but I have heard of some remarks of the honorable member for Hume in reference to a gentleman who is the prime mover of one of the greatest co-operative movements in Australia - a movement which. I feel sure, commends itself to every man who sympathizes with unionism in any shape or form. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Meares,</inline> representative of the co-operative movement in the dairying industry. Those of us who are acquainted with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Meares</inline> know that to that gentleman we owe mainly the magnificent position of the butter export trade at the present moment; and yet, I understand, the honorable member for Hume has asserted that the reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Meares</inline> and others are opposing this Bill is in order that they may have an opportunity of exporting "rotten butter." </para>

                            <para>- It is in the north of New South Wales that there is the greatest co-operative butter factory in the world, from which comes some of the finest produce in Australia. That is the company with which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Meares,</inline> to whom the honorable member for Hume referred this morning, is associated. He and the producers of the district represented by the honorable member for Richmond have built up a factory which is pre-eminent in Australia. The co-operative movement with which he has been associated owns now what is the biggest butter factory in the world. The butter from that factory obtains the highest prices in the London market, and it is made and shipped without Government supervision, grading, or other interference. Was it right of the honorable member for Hume to refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Meares</inline> as a " man who wishes to export his rotten butter to the markets of the world " ? It is the honorable member, and men like him, whom we who are associated with the butter industry have had to fight in the past. They have thrown obstacles in the path of development, and have done their utmost to prevent improvement. Yet to-day the honorable member for Hume makes an accusation against the man who, above all others, is responsible for the great advance which the cooperative movement has made here, and has done so much to place one of our staple products on the markets of* the world in first class condition. The honorable member for Maribyrnong, who has been closely associated with the co-operative movement in Victoria, will corroborate every word I have said about the man against whom this vile slander has been uttered by the honorable member for Hume. </para>

                            <para>- I was not present at the time, and I am glad to hear the honorable member say that. Having been intimately concerned with the dairying industry, and knowing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Meares,</inline> and what he has done for the farmers of New South Wales and Australia generally, I have felt it my duty to say something in reply to the accusation made against him. I do not feel that there is much more to be said regarding the clause. The New Zealand experience is frequently referred to as evidencing the advantages to be obtained by the Government grading of butter, but those who know anything about the matter are aware that the result of the Government grading there is that the Dominion is the happy hunting ground of the speculator, who buys on the spot, and, consequently, makes large profits at the expense of the farmers. Those who are actually doing, the work, the farmers, who have all the drudgery and responsibility, are, in Victoria and New South Wales, getting more money for their products than goes into the pockets of the farmers of New Zealand. The" Minister has gone carefully into this matter, and it has been pointed out to him by representatives of the dairying industry in Australia,' and representatives of Commonwealth constituencies in which dairying is largely carried on, that, although his officers have been trying their utmost to persuade him to provide for Government grading, our farmers get more for their products under the co-operative system, without Government grading, than the farmers of New Zealand get with Government grading. We do not desire to play into the hands of the speculators. In New South Wales, the producers have been fighting against the middlemen ever since I was born. They have been trying to get out of the power of the produce merchants of Sussex-street, dozens of whom have become extremely wealthy at the expense of the farmers. The co-operative movement gets rid of the middlemen, and now three-fourths of the dairy produce sent away from New South Wales is exported directly, without the intervention of middlemen. </para>

He seems to think that prices should be kept down, whereas, we are striving to keep up prices. In my early years the Illawarra farmers got only 3d. and 4d. a lb. for their butter. </para>

                            <para>- During the last elections I read that a well-known member of the South Australian Labour Conference not long ago exclaimed, ' ' To hell with the farmers." That is the feeling of the Labour party, whose members say that 2d. is enough for the dairy farmers to receive. I have heard them express sympathy with those who have to rise at 3 in the morning to milk their cows, yet they say that 2d. and 3d. a lb. is a fair return for their industry. It is a mystery to me why the primary producers are so blind to their interests as to vote for Labour members, who are opposed to everything that will benefit them. </para>

                            <para>- I ask the Committee whether it is possible for the officials appointed by Government to satisfactorily carry out the work of grading butter for the London or any other market? Will men who know the taste of the London consumers, or of the consumers in other markets, be brought from abroad to do our grading, or is the work to be left to those who have no knowledge as to what is required elsewhere? Probably, most of the men appointed will be men who have never even been to London, and have not the faintest knowledge ot what is required-. Can such men satisfactorily grade our butter as "superfine,'" "first," "second," and " third " quality? </para>

                            <para>- What experience has he had of the grading of butter? In any case, it would be physically impossible for him to grade the millions of lbs. of butte, that are annually exported. Consequently the grading must be left to those who are ignorant of the requirements of our markets. </para>

                            <para>- A great deal. Under this clause the Minister will be able to deal with the whole question of the grading and the exportation of butter. When the compulsory system of grading was in force in Queensland, it was found that the producers were losing thousands of pounds in England, because the second grade butter was never sold on its merits. The butter trade is now established on a sound basis, having been brought up to a high standard by individualism and by the capacity and energy of men of life-long experience. Therefore, unless the Government are in a position to show that any action of theirs will put the industry on a still better footing, they ought to stay their hand. It has become one of the most important in Australia, and is giving a fair return to those who are working so hard on the land, and all I ask is that the Government shall do nothing to interfere with the men or the system that have brought about those splendid results. I regret exceedingly that a man who has occupied such a high position in New South Wales and the Commonwealth as the honorable member for Hume should have gone out of his way, as he did this morning, to make an accusation against a man who has done so much for the butter industry. </para>

                            <para>- He has made nothing out of it beyond the salary which he receives as manager, and to that he is thoroughly entitled for building up the biggest co-operative society in Australia. He started the movement with a paid-up capital of only a few thousand pounds, and last year it had a turnover of nearly ^1,000,000.  1  feel these accusations very keenly, because they affect a big industry which has meant a great deal to New South Wales and Victoria. I am sure all Victorians, including the Minister, recognise that when the boom burst in 1891 the dairying industry practically saved Victoria. The industry has been carried on under a system that has done a great deal of good for the whole of the people, and I hope that the Minister and those associated with him on the other side of the House will take every precaution to insure that nothing  k  done to retard its progress. </para>

                        <para>. - I trust we shall get hack to the clause before the Committee. The only part of it to which exception has been taken is paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b.</inline> To this the honorable member for Richmond has moved an amendment, that any proclamation made under it shall be laid on the table of Parliament within seven days. I am willing, as I said last night, to accept that, but the honorable member goes further by proposing that the proclamation shall be revoked on a resolution being passed by either House. That proposal I cannot accept. I believe it will make a Ministry more careful if they have to take the responsibility of any proclamation they issue. If there is in the House a majority ready to revoke a proclamation, that majority will be against the Government who issue it, and, therefore, there is no necessity for that part of the. amendment. I do not intend to deal with the statements regarding the butter industry. I have received a lot of information on the question from honorable members, and, as I said before, one cannot be guided by some of the figures that are used in connexion with the butter industry. I stated one afternoon - and my statement has never been contradicted - that, instead of paying a man for 2,000 lbs. of butter fat, the factories paid him on a smaller basis, until the New South Wales Government threatened to put an auditor in to see that the correct payments were made for the amount of butter produced. An article to that effect appeared in the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Agricultural Gazette.</inline></para>

                            <para>- At any rate, when honorable members point out what they call facts regarding this industry, it is, perhaps, time that a little was said on the other side. I am prepared to discuss some of the issues raised when I bring down the commerce regulations. I told honorable members last night that I will do under this. Bill, so far as butter is concerned, nothing other than I could do under the commerce regulations, and that I will do nothing under the commerce regulations until Parliament, has had an opportunity pf discussing what is proposed. Although I gave that assurance last night, seven-eighths of the debate to-day has been on that very matter. </para>

                        <para>-- The Committee should be well satisfied with the Minister's assurance regarding the commerce regulations. I was particularly anxious that nothing should be done, to injure the butter industry, and quite agree with the honorable member for Illawarra as to the immense amount of good work done by the co-operative societies. I wish to put the honorable member for Illawarra right regarding the statement that has been made that Labour members have said " To hell with the farmers." We all had to "meet that accusation during the election campaign; and I wish to put the truth about it on record. The gentleman who gave utterance to the statement was not a member of the Labour movement. He was a man named Bell, in the industrial circle in Adelaide, and what' he said was, " To hell with the farmers, and the Labour party, too." Honorable members opposite, when quoting that, have always taken care to leave out the second part of it. </para>

                            <para>- I can produce numbers of persons from South Australia to show that what I have said is true. I know nothing about the merits of the particular case in dispute between the honorable member for Hume and the honorable member for Illawarra. The honorable member for Illawarra takes exception to the interjection of the honorable member for East Sydney. What the honorable member said was that in the days when the farmers were receiving only 4d. per lb. for their butter he had seen butter so bad that it was not worth 2d. per lb. I hold that such prices are tantamount to robbery, and that good butter should always be worth at least is. per lb. The honorable member for East Sydney did not suggest that the farmers should not receive even as much as 4d. per lb. for their butter. He, like the rest of our party, believes that every farmer should receive the full return of his labour, and that if his butter is worth even 2s. per lb., he should receive that price for it. I rose only to put our position clearly before the Committee, in view of the remarks made by the- honorable member for Illawarra; and I hope that since the Minister has said that nothing will be done by way of the issue of regulations before Parliament is consulted, the clause will be agreed to. </para>

                            <para>- I hope, at all events, that the honorable member will consent to a considerable modification of the clause. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of proposed new section 112, is most undemocratic. Under it altogether too wide a power is to be given to the Minister. I should not object to the Minister having power to prevent a ship going out with certain goods ; but, under such a general power as this, he might prevent the exportation of some great Australian product on which the country depended largely for its prosperity. This power is altogether unnecessary, for the Bill elsewhere gives ample power to the Minister to control exports over which there should be some supervision. What encouragement will there be to a man to settle on the land if, when he has a good season, the Minister may be induced, in the interests of a section of the community,  to  prevent him from shipping his produce and getting for it the good prices ruling abroad ? As we all know, the producer is unprotected. Very often during season after season he has to sell his produce at a very low figure, and does well if he makes ends meet. -Sometimes, at the end of a year's labour, he finds himself in debt: but with a good season he gets a lift, and is thus encouraged to persevere. If he is to be penalized when he has a chance of making a little, then he is not to be treated as we should treat those who open up the country for us. This clause is altogether unwarranted, and I hope that the Minister will accept an amendment restricting the powers that he will have under it. As it stands, it enables the Minister to exercise powers which should be reserved to this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>-- I should npt have risen but for the heated remarks made by the honorable member for Illawarra when dealing with the statements made by the honorable member for Hume. In the course of his speech the honorable member spoke of a time when farmers received only 3 1/2d. per lb. for their butter, and I interjected, " Sometimes it was not worth more than 2d. per lb." The honorable member spoke of such prices ruling in the days of his boyhood. To show him that I know something, of the position in those times, I would remind him that Messrs. Elliott and Clark then carried on business as dairy produce merchants on a large scale in Sydney, and that for a good many years I, as a business man, purchased butter from them twice a week. No one was better pleased than I was with the introduction of the creamery system in New South Wales, and I know that it has done as much for the progress and advancement of the State as has any other industry. After the introduction of that system, it was a pleasure to purchase butter from firms engaged in the trade. The honorable member for Illawarra must remember the days of the little dairy farmers north and south of Sydney, when it was almost impossible for a business man - and this was prior to the introduction of the creamery system - to obtain a piece of good butter. When I made the interjection in question, I was referring to the early days of which the honorable member was speaking. I have visited various parts of New South Wales during the last ten or fifteen years, and have found that the factory system has made a marked improvement in the dairying industry. The suggestion that the Labour party has no interest in the farmers is not only absurd, but utterly vile. No party is more alive to the fact that the primary producers must be encouraged, and that our cities are largely dependent upon them for -their progress, than is the Labour party. It is only because of the wealth accruing to our large towns from the country districts that they are able to make any progress. I sincerely hope that we shall hear no more of these charges against our party. At the period to which the honorable member for Illawarra was referring, I had a business in Sydney, and during two months of the year it was almost impossible to obtain good butter. </para>

I have devoted my time and' what little money I have had to the improvement of the country, and to-day I am almost as poor as I was when I entered Australia. I do not regret my position, however, because I know that the work I have done has been for the benefit of this country. We have the interests of the farmers at heart just as much as have the Opposition. After all, these charges do no good, and I am sure that if the honorable member for Illawarra had not been so heated at the time he would not have accuse'd me of desiring to injure the producers of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - After listening to this discussion for some hours, one would imagine that. Australia exported nothing but butter. I think it well to remind the Committee that we have many other exports. During the earlier part of the debate I interjected that I trusted that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of proposed new section 112 was not to be used for any politico-economic reasons, and the Minister was good enough to say that no such intention was in the mind of the Government. That assurance, however, in my opinion, is not sufficient for the Committee. The paragraph, as it stands, would empower any Government, yielding to the clamour of certain interests in the community, to utterly prohibit the export of any of our principal products. It would enable them to prohibit the export of hides, which has already been suggested, or the export of wheat, and we all know that during the recent election some persons advocated that the export of wheat should be prohibited. The export of any great Australian production which a certain section of the community might think we should retain within our borders, instead of sending it abroad to obtain the world's prices, might be prohibited. The power in this direction is very dangerous, and I cannot remain silent when it is proposed to be taken. If the honorable member for Richmond will temporarily withdraw his amendment, I shall move - </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not believe that the proposed new section is necessary, as subsequent provisions give all the power that is required to enable our trade and industries to be upheld by the preservation of their purity. If the Government intend to attempt to force this clause through as it stands, then, rather than give a silent vote, I shall test the opinion of the Committee by moving the amendment which I have indicated, in order that we may get the Government to admit by act, as they have done by word, that there is no intention to exercise these powers for politico-economic purposes. </para>

                            <para>- While it is not inconceivable that a Government might prohibit the importation of sugar, I do not think any Government would dare to do so. Any proclamation issued will be laid before Parliament; and any Government who took action that could not be defended in this House would deservedly be expelled from power at the first opportunity. Cases may arise which would not come within the four corners of the amendment. For instance, three or four persons in Bradford became ill with anthrax, and it was proved that the disease had been conveyed by wool from a certain district in Australia. Such an occurrence might have the effect of reducing the price of the whole Australian clip, and the Government would be justified in declaring that all wool from that district should be scoured before leaving the country. </para>

                        <para>.- I shall now move the amendment which I have previously explained. I am willing to accept the alteration desired by the Minister. It seems to me that under the circumstances the power will still rest with Parliament. When the proclamation is tabled it will be within the power of any honorable member of this House to direct the Minister up to a certain point, and I have no doubt that if a resolution were carried against him he would retrace his steps. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to utter a word of protest before this Bill finally passes. I am amazed to find a Minister in this country taking the power contained in sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of new section 112. It seems incredible that a Ministry composed of Labour men, and supported by a Labour party, should give any Minister a power which would enable him to take the whole trade of the country under his autocratic control and direction. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member, and those who sit with him, have surrendered their power over Ministers. The Minister of Trade and Customs is now taking power to prescribe standards of purity and soundness, of freedom from disease, to prohibit anything which would interfere with any of our industries, to dictate how goods shall be sold, and under what conditions, to prescribe how they shall be packed, and in what sized cases they shall be put. The provision to which I have called attention gives the Minister power to prohibit any export which would, in his opinion, be harmful to the Commonwealth. I do not know that we could give him a greater power than that. It means, as I say, absolute autocratic control over the whole of the operations concerned with the imports and exports of Australia, and that power, forsooth, is placed in the hands of a Minister by a Labour Socialistic party ! </para>

                        <para>-- A stranger listening to the remarks of the honorable member for Parramatta might arrive at the conclusion that some extraordinary power was being given to the Minister of Trade and Customs by what he terms Labour members - a power likely, to upset the trade of the Commonwealth, bring ruin and chaos upon us all, and even interfere with the peace of mind of the honorable member himself. The hon.orable member's statement was, I am sure, most impressive to those who do not know him ; but inasmuch as honorable member? on his own side of the House seemed to pay slight attention to  His  remarks, whilst honorable members on this- side of the House know him too well, his observations had not the effect that he desired. The honorable member might have made a little' further explanation, by stating that power was simply given to the Minister of Trade and Customs to issue a proclamation under certain circumstances. </para>

No Minister would be so fatuous as to issue a proclamation that would be likely to meet with the disapproval of a majority in Parliament. This explanation should have been given before the utterances of the honorable member for Parramatta which were made solely to make political capital, and for petty party purposes. The honorable gentleman asserts that something extraordinary is proposed to be done when, as a matter of fact, a similar power would be given to any Minister, and even to the honorable gentleman himself if he were in office. </para>

                            <para>- That is another matter, and I do not intend to introduce it. We are only in this Bill giving the Minister charged with the administration of the law power to issue a. proclamation in circumstances which will be known to Parliament. The Government will be subject to the will of Parliament, and the proclamation will not be issued until the Ministry, in their corporate capacity, have arrived at the conclusion that the exportation of certain goods would be harmful to the Commonwealth. That is all the power it is proposed to give. 1 remind honorable members that the honorable member for Parramatta raised no serious objection to placing a still greater power with respect to imported goods, in the hands of the present and past Governments, including the Government of which he was himself a shining light. </para>

The honorable member, with some degree of warmth, which, perhaps, in the circumstances, was pardonable, seized upon a remark which has been broadly circulated throughout the Commonwealth, and asserted that a prominent member of a Labour Conference - those are the actual words which were taken down at the time- </para>

He suggested that, because other members of the Opposition did not speak - not wishing to keep the House sitting after the usual hour - we did not agree with what the honorable member for Parramatta said. I wish to say that the remarks of the honorable member for Parramatta concerning the Bill met with my complete and full approval. Where I agreed with him, I was willing to trust the honorable member to voice my opinions, being confident that he would express them clearly and far more concisely and decisively than could the many-worded honorable member for Adelaide, who followed him and sought to ridicule him. </para>
                    <para>I do not wish to prevent honorable members from catching their trains, but there are occasions when I regret that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> cannot record upon its pages the expression of those who make the statements which it publishes.

That provision enables the Governor in Council to prohibit the exportation of any article. We know that in practice the Governor in Council means the Minister. There would have been no harm done had the amendment of the honorable member for North Sydney been carried. He sought to limit the provision so as to provide for the prohibition of the exportation of produce likely to injure the reputation of the Commonwealth only after the approval of Parliament had been obtained. That amendment was defeated - every member of the party which calls itself democratic voting against it. </para>

                            <para>- My objection to the Bill is that it contains a provision enabling the Minister to prohibit exportation, not on the ground that it would be injurious to the reputation of Australian products, but because, perhaps, he thinks goods are required within the Commonwealth, and should be denied export. If the Minister, influenced by some fad, held that hides should not be exported, he could prohibit their exportation, and the producers of hides would then be limited to the Commonwealth market. This is not a remote possibility, because the honorable member for South Sydney this morning;, and when speaking' on the Address-in-Reply. strongly advocated an export tax on hides. Should a man imbued with his mania find himself in the Ministerial chair, he would have no hesitation in prohibiting the exportation of hides. The Bill gives to the Minister power whose exercise by one holding fanatical convictions upon economical questions might prove dangerous to the community. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to make a personal explanation. Before the honorable member for Adelaide left the chamber, he saw fit to comment upon some observations which I had made in regard to a statement by the honorable member for Hunter. The honorable member for Hunter was present at the time I made those remarks, and did not think it necessary to reply to them. I venture to say that I made it abundantly clear that I accepted his denial of my statement in all sincerity. At the same time, I did not think that it was quite sufficient. </para>
