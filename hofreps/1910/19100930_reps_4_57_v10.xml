                    <para>- I wish to make a personal explanation. During a discussion in this House on Friday last, I stated that the honorable member for Bendigo, as a Minister of the Crown, had done certain things which he complained that a member of the present Government had done. I made that statement in good faith, believing that my authority was unimpeachable. I find, upon further inquiry, however, that the statement was not correct. I therefore take this opportunity of withdrawing it and of saying at once that the attitude adopted by the honorable member on Friday was in no way inconsistent with his action as a Minister. I regret the statement, and apologize for having made it. </para>

If they suggest a certain day as the most suitable on which to have a half-holiday we adopt their recommendation, but if they report that no half-holiday should be given we carry out our original intention irrespective of their wishes. </para>

He promised, however, to obtain a report on the subject, and to ascertain whether it was not possible to make a satisfactory arrangement between the Postmaster-General's Department and the Meteorological Branch of his Department. I desire to know whether the report is yet available ? </para>

                    <para>.- This is an important clause, which raises the question of making tenants in common and partners in land, as well as joint tenants as they are generally understood in law - that is, joint tenants who have a right of survivorship - liable, not severally, but as if each were the owner of the lot. There is, of course, no double taxation. There seems to be an impression abroad that under this clause each pays a double tax, and I have a letter to that effect, but I am sure the Attorney-General will say that nothing of the sort is intended. The idea is that by making each owner, whether in severalty or not, a joint owner, under the definition, of the whole land, each would pay the rate prescribed as being payable upon the value of the whole land, rather than the lower rate which he would have to pay were he assessed as an owner in severalty. Honorable members will see how wide the definition of " joint owners " in clause  3  is. " Joint owners " means persons who own land jointly or in common, whether as partners or otherwise. True joint owners in law are those who own land with a right of survivorship. That is, if one dies, the land goes to the survivor. In the case, however, of tenants in common, although they have undivided interests, if one dies his share passes to his representatives, or according to the terms of his will. On an intestacy as regards true joint tenants the survivor takes the whole. The Attorney- General ought to confine his definition of joint tenants to those who have a right to survivorship, because, strictly speaking, they may be regarded as owners of the whole land, and it would not be at all unfair to make them liable for the higher rate for which all joint tenants under the definition in this Bill will be liable. I do not think that is against the principle of subdivision, because, although tenants in common may have an undivided interest, each owns the land separately from the other, and the value of the interest of each is absolutely known. It passes to his representatives on death <inline font-style="italic"> it is</inline> attachable on bankruptcy by the liquidator as a separate estate, and it is assignable as a separate estate. Although there may be a use of the land in common, there is subdivision so far as rents and profits are concerned. They are absolutely distinct in every way, and I think it is a mistake to regard such owners, tenants in common, and partners, as liable for the full rate prescribed by the total value of the land, whereas, as a matter of fact, each individual is in reality an owner in severalty, but for the purposes of co-operation it may be that they come together and use the land jointly.

                <para class="block">If this is carried, I shall subsequently move to add after the word " owners," in the same line the words " with the right of survivorship." The effect will be to confine this sub-clause - which now regards each owner as the owner of the lot for the purposes of the higher rate - to the joint owners as the law understands them, that is, joint owners with a right of survivorship. Consequent amendments could then be made in the other sub-clauses. I think the suggestion is reasonable. It involves a - very substantial amendment of principle, and I hope the Government will consider it favorably. In South Australia, where joint owners pay in this way, a deduction is made from the valuation of each as an owner to the extent of the increased tax he pays, the owner having, merely for purposes of collection, paid the higher rate. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendment is one to which I shall be reluctant to agree unless some distinctive principle is to be established by it, and convincing reason shown for it. In the New Zealand Act "joint owner" is defined in exactly the same terms as in this Bill, not as a joint owner with right of survivorship, but as a joint owner who holds land in common in any circumstances. Under that Act, even joint occupiers who are not related to one another in terms of law are brought under the heading of " joint owner," and later on in this Bill a joint occupier is treated in exactly the same way as a joint owner. </para>

                        <para>- I know; but I am pointing out to the honorable member that what we are aiming at is the splitting up of estates. Here are two or more persons owning  or occupying land in common. That is a thing we do not desire. We desire that the land shall be held, not jointly, but in severalty. There may be ten or fifty joint owners. A company comes under the joint ownership clause, and nothing that does not attach itself to a company ought to attach itself to joint owners who are not a company. The honorable member for Angas proposes to limit ' ' joint owners " in this clause to its technical legal meaning. The honorable member will see that under the New Zealand Act joint owners and joint occupiers are treated in exactly the same way as we propose, and the question of their legal status is immaterial. In the Victorian Bill the same thing is proposed. Therefore, the legal and technical definition, which is the narrower one, and which, as the honorable member says, limits the term to persons who have certain rights which do not terminate on the death of the others cannot be accepted here. </para>

                    <para>.I ask the Attorney-General to reconsider this clause, which has very wide consequences. These clauses, when read with the definition of "joint owner," apply to every case of co-operative ownership, and every possible case of partnership ; and the trouble is that, as only one exemption is allowed, the aggregational principle results in very high rates of taxation. Such a provision can in general have no other effect than that of producing revenue. </para>

                        <para>- Under the clause, only one exemption is given. In the case of a large estate held in joint ownership by two or three persons, with the right of survivorship, there is practically one property, and there, the clause should probably apply, but it will also apply to every case of co-operative action. </para>

                        <para>- It is not shareholders of a company, but the persons who are covered as joint owners, we are discussing. The honorable member for Angas has drawn attention to a case in which three persons own a piece of land, ' with the right of survivorship, so that if A and B die the whole goes to C as his absolute property. Under such circumstances, the honorable member sees no objection to the application of the clause ; but he does object in a case where the parties are tenants in common, with no right of survivorship - in which each has his clearly defined individual interest. </para>

As to the absentee provisions in sub-clause  5,  I direct the attention of the Attorney-General to section  54,  subsection  3,  of the New Zealand Act, which provides that if an absentee taxpayer is liable to be assessed jointly with another taxpayer not an absentee, they shall be assessed jointly, as if neither was an absentee. Under the Bill, in the case of a joint occupancy, there is a mathematical mode of taxing the absentee according to certain proportions ; and I should like to know why the New Zealand section was not adopted. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member may take that as some consolation m a sea of trouble. It is not, however, an oversight, but merely following those principles of the Bill to which the honorable member from time to time takes such exception. As to the position of absentee joint owners, the New Zealand Act practically provides that if one of the joint owners is an absentee, then none of the others shall incur any liability other than they would have incurred had none of them .been absentees. As we propose to amend the clause in relation to companies, making only those shareholders who are absentees liable as absentees, I am willing to amend this clause so as to make the same principle apply. If the Committee will pass the clause I shall have it amended so as to bring it into conformity with the other amendment to which I have just referred. Of course, a shareholder in a company is a joint owner for the purposes of this Bill, and joint owners other than those in companies should be treated in exactly the same way. </para>

I have been informed of a case in which two brothers own Melbourne property worth  ,£10,000.  There is a building on the land, so that the property cannot be divided into two halves. One brother lives in Melbourne, and the other travels, being absent from the city for three-fourths of his time, and, therefore, under the Bill is an absentee. Clause  33  causes both the resident and the travelling brother to be taxed as absentees. </para>

                    <para>.- It is a pity that the Attorney-General will not ac- . cept the amendment of the honorable member for Angas, because it is only reasonable that tenants in common should be excluded from the operation of this provision. The prime object of the Bill is to break up large estates, but the clause under discussion penalizes those working in partnership, even when they are members of a family. When speaking on the second reading, 1 instanced a case in which, on the death of.' the father, the four sons bought out .the sisters' shares, and worked the property together, each being married, and having a home upon it. As tenants in  Gammon,  those brothers would be taxable under this clause. It was suggested that they could evade their liability by dividing their property, and working it conjointly, but clause 34 applies not only to property owned in common, but also to property worked in common. In another case, six members of a family took up selections, each holding his estate in severalty, but allowing it to be worked jointly with the others. Under clause 34 they would be deemed to be joint owners of the whole property. The other day one of them died, and in connexion with the probate proceedings it came out that the whole of the estate would be worth about £7,000, the interest of each brother being a little over  £1,000.  Has that family done wrong in working its land jointly for the common benefit? Yet its members are to be taxed under the clause when, if they worked their land separately, they would not be liable to taxation. Then there are the cases in which city properties are held jointly in estates which cannot be subdivided. I know of a piece of land, not four blocks from this building, the unimproved value of which is about £7,000; it belongs to a family whose individual interests are a little over  £1,000  each. The land has a frontage of  15  feet, and' cannot be subdivided. No doubt there are many other cases of the kind. Persons should not be discouraged from working together. </para>

                    <para>.- If the provisions under discussion are passed as they stand, they will hit very hard a great many farmers in my district, notwithstanding that it is closely settled. The land there has been taken up by small men, but in many cases fathers and sons work their selections together. It is more economical to do this than to work them separately. In some instances, large areas are covered by such a partnership. I suggest that the Attorney-General should give an exemption to each of the joint owners. If an estate were owned jointly by four persons, they should be each exempted to the extent of an unimproved value of  £5,000. </para>

                        <para>- It is. I cited the other day the case of a man having £30,000 worth of land, and a family of ten children. Several of the sons are grown up, and are ready, if need be, to parcel out the land. But the father says, " Why should I not continue to give them the benefit of my advice and experience as an overseer? Why should I segregate this estate, -as I shall have to do if this law be passed?" Is it necessary that ownership of this kind should be individualized? </para>

                        <para>- They would do so, unless each parcel of land were absolutely individualized. That would lead to unnecessary labour and expense. Each farm would have to be separated by fences, and separate deeds would have to be obtained, just as if there were no co-operation among the family. The Attorney-General is constantly preaching the benefits of cooperative effort, and yet we find him here proposing to penalize it. I take it that the object of the Government is that the best use shall be got out of the land. In such a case as this, that can obviously be secured by all the parcels being consolidated for the purpose of working and using them. Is not a man's family entitled to as much justice, in connexion with the use of his land, as are outsiders ? If the land to which I have referred were divided amongst outsiders, the Attorney-General would exempt those men, but when a man divides his land between his sons who are of age, and are in need of land just as much as outsiders are, he is to be taxed because those sons are at home, and are working economically and usefully together. On the face of it, this clause must be grossly unjust. It must tend to discourage that provision for families which has so often been held up to us as an ideal by honorable members opposite. </para>

                    <para>. - This question is really more important than the Attorney-General seems to realize. A number of cases, in addition to those which the honorable member for Gippsland and others have given, might readily be cited in support of our contention. I recognise that, as the Attorney-General has said, if the amendment were made without any subsequent alteration it would open up a door to the evasion of the Act; but I think that that difficulty may be easily overcome. The honorable member for Angas proposes to insert the words " with right of survivorship " at the beginning; of the clause, and, if that amendment were accepted, we could get rid of the dangers that the Attorney-General fears by amending sub-clause 3 so that it would read " Joint owners of land with or without right of survivorship." </para>

                        <para>- Such an amendment would meet cases of the kind that have been brought forward, without any possibility of evasion of the law, because it would impose upon individual tenants in common the obligation to pay the full tax upon their individual interests. The Attorney-General has referred to the case of a man owning £100,000 worth of property who, under the amendment, could evade the tax by joining nominal or small interests with his property. That difficulty would be overcome if the further amendment I have suggested were made, because the man in that case would have to pay the full tax on his , £100,000 worth of land. </para>

                        <para>- If they owned in severalty they would not be joint owners. But in the case I have just mentioned, if they worked the land together, although their individual interests were below the exemption, as tenants in common without right of survivorship they would be taxable. I appreciate the difficulty raised by the Attorney-General, but urge (hat we can completely overcome it by making these persons contribute according to the tax on their individual interest in the land. </para>

                    <para>.- An eloquent appeal has been made on behalf of families who work, in co-operation, one block of- land, and honorable members on this side of the Committee are prepared to deal with such co-operative effort quite as generously as are the Opposition. I know of some families - fathers and sons, and in some cases sons-in-law and daughters-in-law - who are working land jointly, and in some cases one might characterize as something nearly approaching abject slavery the conditions under which land is farmed in this way. I am citing cases that have come under my own personal notice, where a farmer is prepared to continue to hold his land, and to employ his sons upon it at a mere pittance. If the " dad " were taxed under' this clause no one would be better pleased than some of the sons. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Gippsland cited as a hard case that of men who are working together on a property of the unimproved value of £7,000; but how much taxation would these joint owners pay? Allowing for the exemption of £5,000, they would be taxed on the unimproved value of £2,000, and would have to pay 25s. per annum each. Surely that would not ruin a man. We cannot legislate under this Bill for hard cases. I think that we can justly tax a man who holds a farm in his own name and is practically farming his sons in order to cultivate it. </para>

                    <para>. - We have just listened to the honorable member for Maribyrnong using the usual arguments of the other side, and pointing to one or two hard cases which ought not to lie relieved under this Bill. Is the basis of this legislation merely a desire to break up family relationships? Does the honorable member suggest that the case which he has cited is a typical one ? If it is, then the bulk of our fathers are inhuman and are using their children as they would not use dogs. The honorable member's statement is a libel upon the family life of Australia. It is a libel to suggest, as he does, that such cases are widely prevalent. </para>

                    <para>. - I rise to gain information on this question. I believe that if we accept the amendment of the honorable member for Angas some of the biggest land-holders will escape taxation altogether. I am open to conviction, but let me cite a case. I know of a case where the father of a family selected  380  acres for each member of it, although some of them were mere infants. The father is working the whole of that land himself. I take it that under; the amendment all he will have to say is that he is working the land jointly with the whole of the members of his family, and he will not pay a cent, in taxation. </para>

                        <para>- It is not the working but the ownership that is the basis of the Act, and in such a case the question for the Commissioner, or the tribunal that has to decide it would be, " Is this man the owner of all that land, or is he, in fact, the owner of only one small portion of it?" If they find that in fact he is the owner of only one small portion he escapes the taxation, as he should. The fact that he agrees to work it with other people ought not to make him liable to taxation. In the case which the honorable member for Denison put, the Commissioner would rightly find that the land belonged to the father, who would have to pay the whole tax. </para>

                    <para>.- I want to make provision for joint owners who, before the  31st  December this year, subdivide their land. It has been mentioned to me that there are cases in which such subdivision has taken place since the introduction of the Bill. I do not think the Attorney-General would object to allow those who, by subdivision in the true sense, parcelling out their land, become owners in severalty before  31st  December, to be treated differently from joint owners under the Bill. To accomplish that end, I propose to move - </para>

                    <para>. - I am not quite clear as to what the honorable gentleman desires. The proviso which was inserted in clause  11,  as a Government amendment, says that an owner, who has parted with any land, <inline font-style="italic">bond fide,</inline> after the  30th  day of June, and before the  30th  September, shall not be liable to assessment; and there is an analogy between the cases. When a man has done a thing, practically before the passing of the Bill, he should escape certain liabilities which he would not escape had he not done that thing. The honorable member contends that, in regard to estates held jointly, but distributed before a certain date, the clause, which imposes certain higher rates by reason of the joint ownership, shall not apply. As to the dates  I  say nothing, except that, in my opinion, they should fall, as in the other case, between 30th June and 30th September. As to an estate held jointly, which has been <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> cut up, and is held in severalty, are the owners entitled to be taken out of the clause? Without committing myself to the terms of the honorable member's amendment, it may be fairly said that they are entitled to some relief, seeing that what they have done is what we desire them to do. </para>

                    <para>.- I appeal to the Attorney-General to consider seriously whether he shall insist on this clause, which I regard as the most far-reaching in the whole of the Bill. What it deals with is not ownership, but simply joint working; and altogether it is certainly a most extraordinary provision. I do not think it is the intention of the Government, or their supporters, that men, who own land separately, shall be prohibited from working their lands together. No bursting up can be accomplished by this means, because the land is already as much burst up as it possibly can be. </para>

                    <para>. - While I do not like voicing objections to the Government measure, I must admit there is some force in the objection raised by the honorable member for Gippsland. I can sympathize with the object of the clause, which is to insure that genuine subdivision shall not be retarded or prevented ; because it is quite conceivable that a man with a large estate, capable of supporting a number of families, might arrange for fictitious subdivision, and thus evade the higher rate of taxation. At the same time, this clause may operate very harshly in genuine cases. Many land-owners have purchased land with a view to settling their sons and daughters, and, under this clause, they will be assessed as joint owners, though the titles are separate. It might be urged that this would apply in cases where the title is held by the father or the mother, for the children, but there would be no difficulty in taking out titles in the name of the children, and thus giving the latter some independence, if they are prepared to strike out for themselves. It is desirable that families should " pull " together; and when they are doing so, the Attorney-General should devise a method by which they may be regarded as separate owners, thus differentiating between them and others who subdivide nominally for the purpose of evading the tax. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the Attorney-General will listen to the appeals made by the honorable member for Gippsland and the honorable member for Corangamite. There are many genuine cases, especially amongst men who are opening up the country in the States which are as yet not closely settled. They have not sufficient capital to provide separate homes and complete working plant for their sons and daughters; and if the Attorney-General will promise to consider the matter honorable members will, I think, be satisfied. Surely it is not desired to prevent the members of a family from working together to make homes for themselves. This proposal cannot be defended on the ground that revenue is necessary, because we do not wish to impose taxation on those who are making the best use of their land. Will the Attorney-General promise to consider whether provision can be made for exempting from taxation individuals owning separate property, which they work in common? He cannot be expected to draft an amendment . on the spur of the moment, but he might agree, either to the striking out of the clause, or to its recommittal, and, in the meantime, consider whether he can meet our views. </para>

                    <para>. - I appreciate the force of the arguments' which have been used against the clause, but there is great difficulty sometimes in distinguishing between joint ownership and joint occupation, particularly in a family estate. In a case such as that mentioned by the honorable member for Denison, if joint ownership were not allowed, but joint occupation were, the effect might be the same, and an evasion of the tax might occur, which we do not wish. At the same time, we have no desire to discourage genuine cooperative effort. I am willing to give the proposals that have been made every consideration, and should like to hear anything that honorable members may have to say about the clause. </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">First of all, we limit the liability of mutual life assurance societies to the liability of each individual member. A society as such is not taxed on its aggregate possessions, and, in so far as it is not a mortgagee in possession, there is no liability on the part of such a society, save that which belongs to each individual member. The effect of this provision is that no policy-holder of any mutual life assurance society throughout Australia is liable for the payment of any tax under this Bill. I wish this to be clearly understood, because in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> this morning half a column was devoted to stating that the mutual principle had been invaded and violated by this Bill, and that it was lying, helpless and melancholy, on the footpath along which we are supposed to be tramping. The simple truth is that no member of a mutual life assurance company will, as such, pay any tax under this Bill. As to mortgages at present existing, and held by mutual life assurance societies, there is no liability upon any such society in Australia under this Bill, and as to future mortgages there will be no liability for a period of three years after they go into possession. It ' will thus be seen that practically, not only is every shareholder of a mutual life assurance company free, but every such company is free in respect of its liabilities as mortgagee in possession, and of the accrued mortgages which stand as the result of its operations. These companies have no liability in regard to future mortgages other than that for which clause 28 provides. Three years must elapse after they go into possession before they can become liable for anything more than the liability for which the mortgagor was responsible. Therefore, mutual life assurance companies are practically and actually exempt from this tax. I come now to the definition of what a mutual life assurance company is, and to the position of companies which are partly mutual and partly proprietary. Proposed new sub-clause 2 practically declares that a mutual life assurance society is one in which the profits are shared; societies whose profits are not shared are treated as ordinary companies. Mutual societies, including the Australian Mutual Provident Society, and all others of a similar kind, are separately dealt with. As the result of representations made by the mutual life assurance companies, we propose to insert new paragraph 3, so as to practically render it unnecessary for such a society to send in thousands of returns in respect of its policyholders. Without such a provision as this the Australian Mutual Provident Society would have to furnish something like 250,000 returns. If the clause be amended as we propose, it will be sufficient for that society to furnish a return that no member has an interest exceeding , £20 in respect of the unimproved value of its property. That will be a general return, which will be accepted by the Commissioner, and for which, of course, the society making it will be responsible. I am informed by the general secretary of the Australian Mutual Provident Society that there is no case in which any policy-holder has an interest exceeding £20 in the unimproved value of its property. There may be some cases where men, having assured their lives for £10,000, £20,000, or £30,000, have an interest exceeding that amount, and in each of those cases a special return will have to be submitted. The remaining policy-holders,, however, will be covered by one return. That will be the position in regard to all mutual  life assurance societies. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to draw attention to a matter of drafting. Under this clause it is provided that land owned by a mutual life assurance society shall be deemed to be owned by it as trustee for the several Australian policy-holders, and shall not be deemed to be occupied by them jointly. Under clause 29, however, it is provided that any person in whom land is vested as a trustee shall be liable in respect of that land as if' he were beneficially entitled to it. It will, therefore, be necessary to make it perfectly clear that as trustees for the policy-holders these societies are not liable, under that clause, both as regards laud held by them as trustees, and the shareholders' interest. </para>

                    <para>.- So far as I follow the Attorney-General, he appears to have appreciated the mutual principle in his amendment. It may support his action to remind ourselves that there are in Australia 450,000 members of purely mutual life assurance companies; that the average assurance is worth £170; and that the average yearly premium is less than  £6,  including in each case industrial assurance. The only, point to which I wish to direct attention relates to surrender values. A reference made by the Attorney-General to an interest amounting to £20 was somewhat vague. I was unable to perceive the relation of the sum mentioned to the general question of surrender values. The average policy of £170 on which there had been the average payment of  £6  per annum would acquire a surrender value of £20 in a few years. </para>

For the information of the Committee, and the general public,, let me say that a deputation consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teece</inline> and others, who thoroughly understand the life assurance business, waited on the Prime Minister and myself to ascertain exactly the meaning of this clause, and to put before us some of the difficulties with which they were confronted. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teece</inline> declared in the most positive way that the surrender value, so far as he knew - and I suppose no one knows better than he does - of any policy-holder's interest in the unimproved value of the property held by his society did not amount to £10, but I suggested that, in order to have a safe margin, he should put it down at £20. </para>

                    <para>. - The alteration has been made with the intention of making the clause clearer. The clause in itself was clear enough, but, owing to the extraordinary objection of the honorable member for Flinders that it was not quite clear, infinite labour and pains have been taken, and the clause is now a very model of perspicuous and even of elegant language as applied to this class of literature.  I  hope it will stimulate other Legislatures to go and do likewise, in which case the man in the street will be able to understand Acts of Parliament so readily that he will begin to despise Legislatures as being quite unnecessary. It is needless to explain what is meant by the amendment, because it explains itself, but the intention is this : There are references throughout the Bill to a secondary taxpayer and a primary taxpayer, and", although those terms are in themselves perfectly clear, an attempt is made in this clause, in order to make assurance doubly sure, to pin them down and, as it were, classify them in such a way that no human being can be in any difficulty. Practically, what the clause, as amended, means is that, where land is held by two or more persons, and one of them owns also other land not included in that estate, and is, consequently, liable to a higher rate of tax, there is to be deducted from the amount payable by the other man such an amount as is necessary to prevent double taxation. That is to say, once the tax has been paid by the one man, it shall not be paid by the other man as well. The Commissioner, in every case, taxes at the highest rate. Where one of those two men owns £50,000 worth of land outside a particular block, that is added to the value of the block, which may bring the rate up from1½d. to, say, 4½d., and the whole estate is therefore taxed at the 4½d. rate. But the other man might own only the land in that estate in which he was interested with the first man, and he would pay on the1½d. rate. There would be deducted from the man who paid on the 4½d. rate such an amount as would be necessary to prevent double taxation. The amendment . which has been moved is consequential on an amendment made earlier in the Bill, under which the primary taxpayer does not pay. As the clause read before, one person is deemed to be the primary taxpayer, and another is deemed to be the secondary, but in cases where there is no primary taxpayer, obviously the wording of sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> would not apply. It is therefore proposed to amend it so that it shall include cases where the primary taxpayer does not pay. </para>

                <para class="block">Bill. I do not intend to try to fully understand this particular provision until the necessary occasion arises for it. So far, however, as I can understand it, the object of the amendment would appear to be this : in the Bill, as originally drawn, there were supposed always to be a primary taxpayer and a secondary taxpayer coupled together. The idea now is that there may be cases in which the secondary taxpayer is liable to a secondary liability, but the primary taxpayer would come under some exemption, and it is therefore desired to preserve the liability of the secondary tax-  payer, while the primary taxpayer gets off. </para>

                    <para>.- This seems such a hopeless tangle that it reminds me of Mark Twain's clock. When asked how he told the time by it, he said that when the hands were at a quarter past 8 it struck twelve, and then he knew the time - it was  20  minutes to  3.  The Minister should take notice of the criticisms of the clause from both this and the other side, and knock it into decent shape. </para>

                    <para>.- Has the Attorney-General considered the advisability of extending the right of appeal in the way of providing more Courts? Under the clause, after an assessment is made by the Commissioner, right of appeal is given, but only to a Justice of the High Court. This taxation applies over the whole of Australia, and assessments will have to be made in the case of lands in all parts of the Commonwealth. At the present moment the Judges of the High Court are kept constantly employed, the appellant jurisdiction having increased, and the original jurisdiction being exercised more widely. A Justice of the High Court is the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and an amendment of the Constitution is proposed which will involve considerable increase in the work of this or the other Justices. "Unimproved value,'' which has to be determined, in the first instance, is very much a matter of opinion ; and, if we may judge from the experience in the States, there will be a vast number of appeals against assessments. I suggest that, in addition to a Justice of the High Court, Judges of the Supreme Courts, and also of District Courts, be empowered to hear appeals. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that State Courts could take appeals of the kind. In New South Wales, the Land Appeal Court, the District Court, and, I believe, Courts presided over by Police Magistrates are utilized; while in Western Australia resident magistrates preside over local tribunals for the purposes of appeals ; and in New Zealand there is an Appeal Court in each district. The tribunal ought to go to the litigants, and not the litigants to the tribunal, because cases can be better determined on the spot where local knowledge is available. The Justices of the High Court sit only in the capital cities; and we can imagine the immense cost if an assessment in the northern part of Queensland were appealed against, and the appellant had to bring all his witnesses to Brisbane. On the other hand, if a Justice of the High Court is sent to these outlying places, it will take him a week to go and a week to return, with the result that the whole of his time will be occupied in hearing appeals under the <inline font-style="italic">Act.</inline> We know that such a state of affairs is not practicable; and, in order to meet the circumstances, I have given notice of an amendment, which, however, I shall not move if the Attorney-General will give an assurance that he will look into the matter. The honorable member for Angas, too, has given notice of an amendment providing, especially if the scope of the Court is extended, for appeals from the lower courts to the High Court. During the progress of a hearing questions of interpretation of the law may arise, and, as this is a taxing measure, the interpretation ought to be uniform throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - If the clause is allowed to remain, as drafted it will be fruitful of the greatest: inconvenience and also injustice. In South Australia when a dispute arises as to an assessment, an officer of the Department is sent into the district on a day appointed, with a view to its settlement ; and if the decision is not satisfactory there is an appeal - not to the Supreme Court, but to the nearest local Court. If all the work under this Bill is to be centralized it will be most unjust to the individual taxpayers, particularly to those taxpayers who need most the protection of this Parliament. There are one or two clauses further on which render it exceedingly necessary that a High Court Justice should not be the first and final Court of Appeal. </para>

                        <para>- And, therefore, in nineteen cases out of twenty, the question will be one, not so much of law as of fact, requiring the attendance, not only of the appellant himself, but also witnesses. In many cases the appellant will require numerous witnesses - practical men, to give practical evidence for the guidance of the Court. Of course, we cannot expect the Attorney-General to settle these details on the spur of the moment while the clause is under consideration, but we urge him to devise some method which will best consult the convenience of the taxpayers. If this is not done they will be placed in an extremely difficult, and, in many instances, almost impossible position. </para>

                    <para>.- Under this clause the right of appeal if limited purely and simply to the amount of the assessment. Clause 18 provides thai the Commissioner may make an assessment of the amount on which, in his judgment, the land tax ought to be levied, and the taxpayer is liable, excepting so far as he establishes on appeal that the amount is excessive. Clause 42 provides that on the hearing of the appeal the Judge may make such order as he thinks fit, and he may either reduce or increase the assessment. But the right of appeal should not be limited purely to questions affecting assessments. It should be given in regard to all questions arising in connexion with the measure. For instance, a corporation may claim that it has been improperly placed on the list of taxpayers, being exempt, either as a charitable institution, a religious society, the trustees of a public library, or the trustees of a showground. As the Bill stands, there is no right of appeal on the ground that the person assessed claims exemption, and thus it will be impossible for the Judge to find that a person who has been assessed is not taxable. The word " assessment " is not wide enough. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with the honorable member for Darling Downs as to the advisability of having cases tried where the facts are known. If there is a difference of opinion among expert valuators, the settlement of the dispute must be determined by the evidence of persons with a knowledge of the neighbourhood in which the land assessed is situated. It has recently been held that under Commonwealth law evidence cannot be taken on commission. Therefore I am willing to make such amendments as will give effect to the honorable member's suggestion. There should, too, be an appeal on questions of law to the High Court. As to what has been urged by the honorable member for Bendigo, I would point out that in dealing with an assessment the basis on which it is made may be reviewed, and thus claims for exemption may be decided on, and such questions as whether a man is or i.- not an absentee or a joint owner dealt with. </para>

                    <para>. - The Attorney-General has referred to the New Zealand legislation, under which a special magistrate of the district is appointed President df the Court, and two other members to assist him are appointed by the Governor in Council. There might be an advantage in choosing as the two other members persons resident in and acquainted with the district, because of their knowledge of local values, but, in my opinion, there would be a still greater disadvantage in that such persons might be suspected by unsuccessful litigants of  bias, and we should do all that we can to remove any ground for suspicion of that kind. I think that the two members appointed to assist the special magistrate should not be local men, but should be chosen because of their special capacity. They should be practical assessors, because the magistrate- could not be expected to have a practical knowledge. </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to agree to that; but every convenience should be given to taxpayers by providing for the hearing of their disputes in their own districts. There should be an appeal on matters of law from the District Courts to a Justice of the High Court, or to a Justice presiding over a special Court created for the purpose; because there will be a tremendous amount of litigation, and the work of dealing with it will be too much for any Justice of the High Court. </para>

                    <para>.- I would suggest to the Attorney-General that, in the circumstances, a little more consideration might be advisable. I appreciate his desire to meet the wishes of the Opposition - and their wishes have been many in this respect - but, to my view, we are hurriedly proposing to strike out the words " Justice of the High Court" when it might be a distinct advantage to have a question of law decided at once by the High Court, instead of being submitted to some District or County Court. </para>

                        <para>- But I think it would be better to provide for these cases being heard by a " Justice of the High Court or such other Court as may be proclaimed." We need not specifically mention the Supreme, County, or District Courts. If my suggestion were adopted, Courts of such a character as the necessities of the moment required could be proclaimed in any part of Australia. It might be advisable, in the interests of all concerned, that a case should go at once to the High Court, and be finally settled by it, instead of extending through the ramifications of the lower Courts and finally reaching the High Court when the applicant was a ruined man, and the Government would be unable, if it won its case, to get its costs. There would be a natural tendency on the part of appellants to go, in the first place to District or County Courts, overlooking the possibility of appeals to- the High Court, and the costs that those appeals would involve. </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General proposes to go further than he was asked to go by the Opposition, and that is why I urge that he should reconsider the position. The additional step that he proposes to take seems to me to be, at present, unnecessary and dangerous, and one that may lead to needless expenditure on the part of both the Government and appellants. If the circumstances required it, any Government worthy of its name would proclaim a Court in almost any part of Australia to hear an appeal rather than that an appellant should be brought to the High Court, or that one or two Justices of the High Court- should be constantly travelling all over Australia. But to say that the High Court, in the first place, shall not consider these cases, except on an appeal from an inferior Court, seems to me to be unnecessary. </para>

                    <para>;. - The amendment proposed by the Attorney-General does not commend itself to me, for it provides for a proclamation where we should have a distinct statutory provision. If we state in the Bill itself what Courts shall be empowered to deal with these cases we shall be responsible .for that provision, and will know exactly what arrangement is to be made for the hearing of appeals. Under the Customs Act there is a right of appeal to a Supreme Court of a State or to the High Court. The appeals to the final tribunal under this Bill will i elite largely to questions of assessment. The penalties imposed, under certain conditions, if an assessment is unsatisfactory,, are sufficient in many instances to ruin a man. I suggest to the Attorney-General that he should, after due consideration, draft a clause to meet the position. I should strongly object to any provision being made by regulation by the Ministry of the day, no matter what party might be in power. </para>

                    <para>. - I tried to explain that it was necessary to have a case relating to a question of fact heard in the neighbourhood where it arose, and where the witnesses resided. If we left this matter primarily to the High Court we should need a High Court Bench far more numerous than we have at present, and during the next two or three years we should have Justices of that Court doing little more than hearing appeals under this Bill. Justice ought not to be delayed. The law ought to be administered, not only without favour, but without delay. Whilst I am willing to include the High Court in its original jurisdiction amongst the Courts that are to hear .these cases, it would be futile to expect the High Court to deal; with the bulk of these appeals. I invite honorable members to think for a moment of what usually takes place after a fresh municipal assessment. I was once an appellant in a local Appeal Court against a municipal assessment, and found that there were a dozen or two dozen appeals, in connexion with that small municipality, concerning a comparatively trifling matter. Here the amounts involved may be very large, and since it is impossible that the High Court could deal with all of them it is obvious that the Courts which must deal with them are the High Court - if we include the High Court in its original jurisdiction - the Supreme Court, District, and County Courts of a State, and such other Courts as may be proclaimed. Having specified the Courts to which these cases may be submitted we must leave it to the discretion of the Executive to name such other Courts as convenience may seem to dictate. To meet the honorable member for Adelaide's objections, I am prepared to include the High Court in its original jurisdiction. That Court will probably be appealed to on questions of law from the decisions of all or any of the lower Courts, and if my amendment of the amendment be adopted, it will be able to hear a case in its original jurisdiction, and in its appellate jurisdiction may decide matters of law arising out of any or all of these appeals. That should meet the honorable member's objection. We include the High Court, and specify the Supreme, County, and District Courts. To these citizens refer matters of first importance j and we should not hesitate to refer to them all questions of this kind. As to the Courts to be proclaimed, I agree that we should not specify a tribunal lower than a District or County Court; but it may be desirable to have a Land Board, or any similar tribunal proclaimed as one which may hear certain appeals in some obscure part of the Western District of New South Wales, North Queensland, or the Northern Territory. Subject to the approval of the honorable member for Adelaide, I shall move to amend my amendment so that the words to be inserted will be "to the High Court in its original jurisdiction, Supreme, </para>

                    <para>.- It would be advisable to add after " Local Court" the words " of full jurisdiction." In South Australia the Local Courts are of two kinds. One deals with cases of <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> and under, and may be a Court composed of a special magistrate or of two justices of the peace without a special magistrate. The other is a Local Court of full jurisdiction, which must consist of either a Judge of the Supreme Court, or of two justices of the peace sitting with a special magistrate. The special magistrate is a trained man, but not always a lawyer. If we want the Local Court with the special magistrate it would be better to say " Local Court of full jurisdiction." Several of our Acts do not say that. </para>

                    <para>.- There may be other forms of Local Courts in other States. I want to enter my emphatic protest against including the Local Court of full jurisdiction of South Australia in this clause. It may consist of the ordinary magistrate, who is not always a lawyer, with two honorary justices of the peace.  1  object to such a Court trying appeals of this description, and I hope that the Attorney-General will strike it out of the amendment. The inclusion of those words is only a subsequent thought on the part of one honorable member, and in the amendment without them we have gone to the full extent to which we were originally asked to go by the honorable members for Darling Downs and Bendigo. We have no County or District Courts in South Australia analogous to those in New South Wales and Victoria, but our Supreme Court Judges travel at times, and Courts are proclaimed to be held in different parts of the State. The appeals could be heard there. </para>

                    <para>.- There is not going to be such a very large number of these cases, nor will there be an immediate hurry for hearing them. We ought, therefore, to keep away from Local Courts, whether consisting of magistrates or justices of the peace. There is always local influence, of which, as the honorable member for Wakefield says, we should try to avoid even the suspicion. I agree with' the honorable member for Adelaide that a very much more experienced and independent person, and of much higher standing than the ordinary magistrate, ought to try these cases, even if it means waiting a little while for the holding of a proper Court. </para>

                <para class="block">Our Judges generally have wide experience and considerable knowledge of matters affecting land, but the local magistrates have to deal mostly with smaller cases,, such as come within Police Court proceedings. I do not like the suggestion of the honorable member for Angas, which might lead to these appeals being heard by justices of the peace. No doubt these local justices do a lot of good work generally, but they are apt to take local views of matters, and would not take the independent view that is likely to be taken by a visiting Judge who is free from local bias. </para>

I am content to see the appeals go to a police or stipendiary magistrate_ if thought necessary, but it would not be right to leave the matter to. local justices. I hope the Attorney-General will take a little time to draft an amendment which will meet with the approval of the whole Committee. </para>

We have a land tax in Western Australia, and a Court of review is established, consisting of a magistrate specially intrusted with the work. It would be of no use to leave the work "to the Supreme Court Judges, because they would not have the time to do it, except on rare occasions. A stipendiary magistrate appointed for the purpose is an excellent tribunal, because he has so much local knowledge. There are no County or District Courts in Western Australia. There is the Supreme Court, and there are Local Courts, and, in the case of the land tax, the Court of review. I hope the Attorney-General will specify the names of the Courts which are to. hear the appeals, so that _ trouble and misunderstanding may be avoided. </para>

                    <para>. - Under the Local Government Acts throughout Australia I think an appeal can be made either to the Supreme Court, the County Court, or a stipendiary magistrate. The honorable member for Maribyrnong suggested the inclusion of the latter in this clause. I am not in favour of leaving these appeals to the local justices, who may be influenced, quite unintentionally, one way or the other. I should leave them to the paid officers, who are trained men. The resident magistrates in Australia are accustomed to hear appeals in reference to municipal assessments ; and I assume that the difficulties in regard to assessments under this Bill will not be any greater than in the former case. The Courts of Appeal should be as near as possible to the doors of the appellants; we have no desire to bring a man and his witnesses from Western Australia to Melbourne or Sydney, or even to Perth. Even in the case of Victoria there are places on the South Australian border from which it would be most difficult and expensive to convey, perhaps, a dozen witnesses to Melbourne. Such a condition of affairs would make appeals so expensive as to confine them to rich men. </para>

That honorable member,. however, suggests that the tribunal should be similar to that used in the case of municipal assessments, and I remind him that associated with the stipendiary magistrates are honorary magistrates. </para>

                    <para>. - I think there is a slight difficulty in this proposal. The Constitution enables us to invest Courts of the States with Federal jurisdiction, but it must be "Courts" that are so invested. We cannot invest a Judge of a Supreme Court or a Judge of a State County Court with Federal jurisdiction, nor can we, if we invest a Court with such jurisdiction, prescribe that one Judge of the Court shall sit. Each Court will be guided according to its own rules, whatever they may be. For example, we may invest a Supreme Court with Federal jurisdiction, but we must leave that Court to determine its own procedure - to determine what number of Judges can sit, and so on. In all probability, of course, a Supreme Court would make rules to enable one Judge to act. </para>

                        <para>- I mentioned before that all this is nugatory. We have provided in a great many of our Acts that the Courts of the States shall exercise Federal jurisdiction, but, of course, these Courts need not act unless they are permitted to do so by the Governments of the States. When it is found what the work is under this Bill, the Judges may ask for payment, just as some of the registrars and magistrates have done in regard to electoral and old-age pension matters, though I believe that the payment has not yet been made. </para>

I take it, however, that section  77  of the Constitution, which gives us power to define jurisdiction, and section  79,  which deals with the number of Judges, are conclusive; and that the point taken by the honorable member is not a valid  one. </para>

                        <para>.- From the reply given by the Postmaster-General to a question I asked yesterday regarding the sale of postage stamps at railway stations on Sundays, I think the honorable gentleman is not entirely conversant with the circumstances. Some honorable members may think that I was moved to ask the question because of my Sabbatarian opinions, which are fairly strong, but my object was really to secure relief for the officers of the Railways Department, who already have too much to attend to, and honorable members know the proverb about the last straw breaking a camel's back. Many of the railway officials are overworked, and have to take advantage of the smaller train service on Sundays to make up their books. Often when a man is half-way up a column of figures, there is a tap at the window, and some one asks for a stamp. At one station the officer in charge had to answer between fifty and sixty such calls in one evening. As the public are able to buy stamps at the railway stations up to midnight on Saturday, surely it is not too much to expect them to provide themselves with their requirements against Sunday. I contend that it would be wise for the Postmaster-General, with a view to relieving deserving officers, to prohibit the sale of stamps at railway stations on Sundays. </para>
