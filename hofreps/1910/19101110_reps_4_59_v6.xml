                        <para>. - I desire to acknowledge the courtesy of the Minister in consenting to the adjournment of the debate last night so that I might have an opportunity to continue my speech this morning, and can best show my appreciation by condensing what I have to say as much as possible. The honorable member for Angas pointed to a very vital omission from the Bill when he showed that it does not contain a provision for the assumption by the Commonwealth of the financial responsibilities incurred in respect to the Territory by existing local bodies. No doubt an ordinance  passed by the Governor-General would provide for that, but it should be set out in the Bill itself, so that there may be no doubt whatever on the subject. I have no quarrel with the provisions of the measure, which are necessary for the proper government of the Territory, and its details can best be considered in Committee. But before this final step is taken - and I regard it as the final step, because I assume that when the Bill becomes law the proclamation will issue for the formal taking of possession by the Commonwealth - I urge honorable members to consider whether the Territory which has been chosen is a suitable one. Arguments against its retention have been advanced, and they are only too well founded. The great bulk of the evidence, supported by individuals and bodies having no personal interest at stake, is such as to call for further consideration. </para>

                            <para>- I am not here to discuss truisms of that character with the honorable member. What I do wish is that he, and those associated with him, would come down from the clouds, view this question from the practical standpoint, and realize that if we are to have a large, settled and contented population within the Federal Territory, we must secure for it all those advantages which&#39; modern civilization demands. We can only do that by taking in the first instance a portion of New South Wales, which could be most easily brought into use in the fashion I have indicated. The whole matter, unfortunately, has assumed the aspect of an appeal to provincial feeling. I venture to say. that in Victoria there is an absence of that provincial animosity which uphappily has been found to exist to an enormous extent in the sister State. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has quoted two newspapers in Victoria which have taken up a certain attitude with regard to this question. But I venture to say that the arguments which they have adduced against the proposals now before the House are the mere a, b, c of journalism, compared with the lurid statements which have emanated from the whole of the Sydney press. Only one newspaper in New South Wales has, I consider, taken up anything like a national attitude. During the recent election we had an exhibition of this anti- Victorian feeling, which, I venture to say, was in some degree responsible for the defeat of the late Government in that State. The appeal which was made from the platform over and over again by the candidates of the late Government to this anti- Victorian feeling was a disgrace to those who were responsible for it. I believe that it brought its own punishment. </para>

                            <para>- I should have thought that his late experience would have taught him better manners. If there is one thing to be deplored, it is that this great question should be made a provincial  one. The Governments which have brought the matter before the House from time to time have refused to allow it to become a party question. It is to be deplored that those who belong to a State Parliament should endeavour to drag it down from the position which we here have tried to make it occupy. The attitude of Victoria stands out in very bright contrast to that adopted in the other States. </para>

I have been drawn somewhat aside from the path which I laid down for myself, and I must express my regret. I wanted very briefly to again urge upon the Minister that, even at this late hour, he should exercise his own volition, and express to the House, as he only can too well do, his own convictions regarding this proposal. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member ought to have heard the Minister talking yesterday as a second Moses. It was Canaan, Rome, and other places rolled into one. I would point out that, although the Minister may desire to pose as a second Moses, looking over the promised land, in two respects he differs from his prototype. He - still remembering the crow and the water bag - has not the power to strike the rock and cause water to gush out. I hope that wherever the Federal Capital may be situated he, unlike his prototype, will be able to settle down there and enjoy it. If he were to free himself from the deadening effects of the thraldom of tradition in which he finds himself, if he were able to throw off those bonds of precedent about which he has inveighed so much, we should have in him one of the strongest advocates for the reconsideration of this question whom we could possibly hope to have, either here or outside. If he is not prepared to exercise his own volition, and give full play to his political conscience, I would ask him to take another step than that which he is now proposing. This question has, I think, about reached a point where the division amongst the representatives of the people is so marked, and the majority in favour of the particular site is so small- </para>

                            <para>- He knows that he has the numbers, and that is the most comforting thing that a Minister sitting at the table can have to recompense him for any statement made about his previous or present action. I feel that this question has reached such a position that the people of Australia should be consulted, that we should not refrain from asking them whether they are of the same opinion as those members of the Government who have changed their views with regard to this site. </para>

                            <para>- In my opinion this question should be submitted to the people; and the only valid objection to such a suggestion would be that of expense. We are told that it will cost  ^30,000  or  ^40,000  to submit the referenda in regard to the constitutional measures, but the additional cost of submitting the question in regard to the Federal Capital would be no more than that represented by the printing of the question on the voting paper. I suggest, therefore, that the Minister should adopt this Democratic method of ascertaining the views of the people, because no question will have greater effect on the future welfare of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I .do not think so ; because I am prepared to allow the question to go to the people with the limitation in the Constitution. Nothing that I have ever said or done could possibly be construed into a desire to take the Capital away from New South Wales ; but I contend that the people of that State, in return for the substantial advantages they  will reap from having the Federal Capital within their borders, should give to the Commonwealth the best available site. </para>

The honorable member knows how many votes were recorded for Lake George, Lyndhurst, and Yass-Canberra, and that the present proposal is a direct reversal of the first decision. In order that the question may be remitted to the people at the same time as the constitutional measures,I move - </para>

                    <para>This would mean the postponement of the second reading until after the referenda early next year. If the people decide in favour of Yass-Canberra, then, of course, the Bill will be proceeded with ; but if they decide otherwise, as I hope and believe they will, further consideration will be given to the question. We shall then have rescued Parliament from what 1 regard as a most serious blunder, if nothing more, and have rescued the people from the infliction of a decision which, I venture to say, is not in accord with the best interests of the Commonwealth, and is also against the expressed opinions of a majority of both Houses of the present Parliament. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not know whether to admire the honorable member for his powers as an actor, or for his constitutional temerity. The honorable member has at the last moment - evidently without sufficient thought, from the fact that he had not, even yet, completed the drafting of his amendment - endeavoured to induce the House to again postpone the settlement of this question, which has been before Parliament for ten years. I have always regarded the honorable member as an excellent actor, but to-day he seems to lack one physiognomical qualification, for, as shown in his personal appearance, there was running all through his speech a consciousness that he was not only trying to bolster up a very bad case, but was placing before us views which he knew to be absurd and impossible. Notwithstanding what the honorable member has said, I submit that, if this House were now, after ten years&#39; philandering, to practically abandon its duty as a legislative body, and throw back on the people one of the most important questions that the people elected us to determine, it would be utterly unworthy of the position it occupies. Why are we sent here? Are we sent here to go crying to the people for help every time a difficulty arises, or are we sent here to save the public the trouble, in their busy lives, of going into the details for themselves? The honorable member almost reminds us of those primitive times, when, instead of having a Parliament, people used to meet in what they called a moot, and decide administrative questions on the hillside. The honorable member knows very well that, in the evolution of things politic, we have advanced beyond that stage. The people of Australia are very busy, and, instead of taking what I might describe as the almost impossible trouble to enter into the details of questions of this sort for themselves, they have elected what they believe to be a body of intelligent men, who can make all necessary inquiry with respect to the various scientific aspects of this matter, and, in the interest of the people as a whole, settle it once for all. </para>

                            <para>- They evidently did ; and I admit that the honorable member has shown great consistency, because he has been uttering jeremiads on the subject ever since Parliament met in 1900. I never heard the honorable member speak on this question without taking the most lugubrious view of it - the water was bad, the site was bad, the time was inopportune, the people would be disappointed, the township would be a failure, there would be no commerce - indeed, I doubt whether he believes it possible to have a fine day  at Yass-Canberra, simply because it does not happen to be within the little State of Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard the honorable member speak more than twice on this question in this House. Of course, I know that discussions were held when he occupied the chair, and when, much against his will, he was prevented from adding to the jeremiads I have heard him utter. The honorable member has talked about the provincial view of some honorable members ; but surely he is not serious, and must have had his tongue in his cheek when uttering, that sentiment. Does he not know that some of the best sites of New South Wales were barred by the representative of his own State? Were not the people of Victoria so absolutely jealous of the possibility of the capital being planted in or near Sydney that their representative, without naming a place, stipulated that, though the site should be within the oldest State of the Commonwealth, it should not be within a hundred miles of that great city. We have heard frequently in the Victorian press of the &#34; bush Capital &#34; ; but who made it a &#34; bush Capital &#34; ? The Victorian people. </para>

                            <para>- Then the honorable member did not mention his objection to-day, but spoke as if the whole of the provincial feeling had been on the part of New South Wales. Does the honorable member forget the leading articles which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> of which he apparently thinks so much, and which said, in effect, &#34; True, constitutionally the people of New South Wales are entitled to the capital, but the Constitution never said when it should be placed there ; that is our point, and we shall apply the Shylock principle, and postpone it indefinitely.&#34; Those press sentiments the honorable member seems to have put on one side in considering where provincial feeling has been shown. . Then, again, did the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> not nominate four candidates for the Senate, and require them to advocate the indefinite postponement of the choice, in spite of the constitutional obligation, sincerely and seriously entered into with the Mother State? If the question had not reached a stage at which it is a foregone conclusion, I could spend an hour in enumerating the miserable pettifogging instances of provincial feeling on the part of Victoria&#39;s representatives, simply because the oldest State was to have the capital within its boundary. If the people of Victoria were willing to allow New South Wales to have the Capital, there are half-a-dozen sites within the  100-miles  limit infinitely better suited than the present one. There is the National Park, within  30  miles&#39; of Sydney, with thousands of acres of magnificent land, and a river and a harbor, which I am sure the people of the State would have been perfectly willing to give up. Then there is the district of Sutton Forest, one of the most beautiful stretches of country of the English type to be found in the whole of Australia, some  80  miles from Sydney. Unfortunately, the then Premier of New South Wales did not realize that, in fixing on the exact distance of  100  miles in order to conform with the provincial wishes of Victoria, he was cutting off at least one of the best sites in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member should know very well that in 1865, when the Protective policy began in &#34;Victoria, this State was 50 per cent, ahead of New South Wales in population, in imports, in exports, and in shipping. Yet within twenty- five years New South Wales was more than 50 per cent, ahead of Victoria. I do not, however, want to go into that matter. The honorable member for Laanecoorie has spoken disparagingly of the water supply of Yass-Canberra. It does happen that in the first report that was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener,</inline> who, I believe, is not an engineer but a surveyor, be expressed some doubt about the water supply. But when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> caine to investigate the site in company with two of the most eminent engineers of Australia, who were able to estimate the possibilities much more accurately than he was, they reported that there was an ample water supply, even by gravitation, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> himself practically amended his opinion. </para>

                            <para>- I know that it is very hard, from the point of view of the Australian Natives&#39; Association of Victoria, that this State should lose her reputation as being at the very altitude of Australian States. But the young gentlemen who are members of that body, and who are so obsessed with the idea of the importance of their own State, will have to swallow the leek. They know very well that the question is absolutely settled, and that their objections merely amount to beating the wind. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member and others may delay the final settlement by a few hours, but they will have to accept it. It is a waste of the time of the House, and a waste of their argumentative powers, for them to try and stop it now. But I do feel impelled, in the interests of my State, to protest against this repeated misrepresentation of the facts with regard to the Territory. We know very well that the matter of choosing the Federal Capital has not only extended over a very long period, but that opinion has moved about from one part of the State of New South Wales to another. At least half-a-dozen sites have at various times been favored; and out of the parliamentary turmoil this is the only one for which we have been able to secure something like a consensus of opinion on the part of a majority in Parliament. And now half-a-dozen political striplings come into the House - I do not want to offend them by saying so - and they desire, like all young reformers, to turn the doings of their predecessors upside down and begin the business again <inline font-style="italic">de novo.</inline> I think we may all smile at their efforts. I notice that there is a good deal of real dissatisfaction at the consummation of our wishes on this question ; but that cannot be helped. The honorable member for Laanecoorie has spoken of the possibility of making Yass-Canberra a commercial centre. I thought it was one of the elementary principles of history that you cannot make a commercial centre. A commercial centre is like a nerve centre in the body ; it is a growth ; it is a matter of evolution. Because you happen to choose a piece of land in the middle of a country, you cannot suddenly develop commercial activities there so as to make it a commercial city. It was never intended to make a commercial city of the Federal Capital. If we had wanted a commercial centre for Federal Capital purposes, the proper course would have been to resume some commercial centre in New South Wales, and make it the Capital site of the Commonwealth. But we have avoided doing so for a very good reason. One of the great objections to the settlement of the Capital site question has been the expense entailed. We have heard over and over again of the hundreds of thousands of pounds that are going to be spent. What a splendid case it would have given to the provincialists of Victoria if we had attempted to choose a commercial centre in New South Wales involving the resumption of a township or a town ! They would have at once said, &#34;This will mean a million of money.&#34; But, instead of doing that, Parliament has very properly taken land upon which there is very little settlement, upon which there is no town, upon which there is no township, and in connexion with which no great expenditure for resumption is involved. If the honorable member for Laanecoorie believes that we must have commercial activities around our Federal Capital, I can only tell him that he is like a child crying for the moon, unless this Parliament is prepared to take a commercial centre already established. I therefore think that, with regard to that, and with regard to population, the honorable member has been on a false line of argument altogether. He said that there would be no population at Yass-Canberra. We heard the honorable member for Parramatta quote from a well-known American book to show that when the site of Washington was first taken, although it had a river, and all the apparently natural requirements for a commercial centre, it had no commerce in it at all. Washington has no commerce to-day. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard many Victorians in this House say that they were willing that the Capital should be established in Sydney. But they only say that when they think there is a chance of getting an alteration made with the object of keeping the Seat of Government in Melbourne for all time. Did I not in this House, long before the honorable member came here, propose an amendment by which the Federal Capital, instead of being now fixed, &#39;should remain in Victoria for ten years and be in Sydney for ten years? What was the objection? It was that my proposal would involve an alteration of the Constitution. When the matter came forward I found that we in New South Wales should not be safe in respect of securing the Capital in the future, because I saw that the alteration would be used in order to prevent the settlement of the question for Australia generally. </para>

                            <para>- It is so easy to sav that now. If the honorable member chooses to move an amendment, and 5f it were possible or practicable to place the Capital in Sydney, or within the shortest possible distance of Sydney, I should like to test his sincerity. I have looked through this Bill very carefully. I congratulate the Minister of Home Affairs, and I congratulate the Government, upon having made one step further in the settlement of this question. As I have said, the question is settled. We must remember that not only has this House hummed and hawed for ten years over this question, but that at last it has made its choice, and that in pursuance of that choice the Government of New South Wales has been approached. New South Wales has not only granted the area which is required by the Constitution, but she has granted what we required many times over. She has shown the greatest generosity. She has said - &#34; We give you what you want nine times over, and we give you, in addition to that, a piece of country which will enable you, if you think it necessary, to construct a line of railway down to the finest harbor in Australia.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- That is rather a shabby way of estimating the value of a gift. Because you ask for something, and it is given to you freely, you tell the giver that it cannot be worth much ! How would the honorable member like it if his constituents said to him : &#34; If you come to us so readily to represent us, your time and services cannot be of much value &#34; ? We ought not to forget, as some of the new members do. that after philandering with the question for ten years, we settled the site. We went to the State of New South Wales, which gave us all we wanted nine times over. We have chosen a site near the finest harbor in Australia. I say that from a full personal knowledge of the harbor and of the Admiralty charts. It has an area of  120  square miles. </para>

                            <para>- No State in Australia has passed less legislation to keep anybody back. New South Wales has been the most openly free-trade and individualistic State in Australia. I understood the Minister of Home Affairs and the Acting Prime Minister to say on previous occasions that the only thing keeping back the second proclamation was the necessity for passing a Bill to arrange for the local government of the Federal Territory. I take it that this is that Bill, and that when it is passed there will be nothing to prevent the issue of the final proclamation which will bury for all time the sort of criticism that we have heard from the honorable member for Laanecoorie. The measure is very simple. Whereas under the 1904 Act the laws of New South Wales were applied, this Bill cuts out certain measures in the schedule which the Government, according to the Minister, do not think sufficiently Christian in their principles to apply to the Territory. Beyond that there is a complete body of laws applying under the 1904 Act and, in substitution for those cut out, clauses 5 to 8 make certain Commonwealth Acts applicable. It is also provided that the Governor in Council, which means ultimately the Minister and the Cabinet, shall have the power to make temporary laws in order to supplement those which the Bill makes applicable. As I told the Minister when he was making his historical speech on the second reading of this measure, he is going for a short time to be a Cromwell. No man in this House is better qualified to play the part. He is a King in name, and will, under this measure, be for a time a King in fact, because he will be able to  say  what laws shall govern the Territory. In fact, he will be better than Cromwell, because Cromwell did not have the advantage of living in the United States and seeing the spread-eagle on the Rocky Mountains. I think we can rely on it that the </para>

                    <para class="block">Ordinances for which the Minister will be responsible will be fair and reasonable, because they have to be placed on the table of each House, and can be disallowed by Parliament. Everything that can be done has been done, and the Bill is a model of simplicity. No attempt is made to frame an elaborate code of laws for the Territory. I congratulate the Minister on his great speech, and on the simplicity of the Bill, and congratulate the Government on recognising the obligation resting on this Parliament to carry out the solemn undertaking in the Constitution to give New South Wales the Capital so long as it is not within the 100-mile limit of Sydney. </para>

                        <para>.- The charge made by the honorable member for Laanecoorie that this matter has been dealt with from the most miserable provincial aspect by some people in New South Wales has been amply proved by the speech to which we have just listened. The honorable member for Parkes has shown how certain people can look at the question from one point of view only. He talks about this Parliament having philandered with the question for ten years. Let me remind him that there was one Act passed by this Parliament which, apparently, when speak- &#39; ing, he could not get out of his head, because he kept calling the Seat of Government Act relating to this site the Act of 1904 instead of the Act of 1909. The Act of 1904 was,  1  think, the Act fixing Dalgety .as the site. He knows that this Parliament selected the Dalgety site by a majority in both Chambers, and that the present site was only carried by - what? I suppose I cannot reflect upon the action of a member in another place, but we all know that on the last occasion when a ballot was taken in another place there was a tie between Tumut and Yass-Canberra, and that, for party purposes, the very man who proposed Tumut, and said that it was the best site in New South Wales, within about an hour of casting his vote for it, cast his vote on the second ballot for Yass-Canberra. </para>

                            <para>- As a matter of tactics, the supporters of Dalgety voted for Tumut on that occasion, in order to throw out Yass-Canberra. Recently, when the vote of &#163;45,000 on the Works and Buildings Estimates for the Yass-Canberra site was before the Senate, it got through on a tie, an adverse amendment passing in the negative because the voting was equal. The only clear decision on this question ever arrived at by this Parliament was the decision in favour of Dalgety. The other site has simply scraped through. On the ballot in this Chamber, Canberra was never selected. Only one man voted for it. Lake George had about the same number of votes, and then, on the final ballot, by some inexplicable workings, the combined Yass-Canberra site was selected, although Canberra and Lake George, which it included, had both been rejected. </para>

                            <para>- No; the majority of the Ministry are at this day opposed to it. If ever there was anything that justified a reference to the people on a subject, it is the way that this Parliament has dealt with the matter. The honorable member for Parkes was very severe in his references to provincialism, and his comments on the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner in insisting, as we are told that he did, upon the I 00-miles limit. But where did the provincialism first begin ? Is it not a fact that the Constitution was, in the first place, accepted by the people of New South Wales, without any limitation as to the site of the Capital, by a large majority - by the majority that was originally agreed upon - but was subsequently altered after the agreement had been entered into with the other States? </para>

When the matter came up for reconsideration, it was the Premier of New South Wales that, in a provincial spirit, said, &#34; We do not come into this great Union unless you give us something for it. We must have the Capital within our territory.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- I do not know whether he said it or not, but, whoever said it, there is no doubt that that was the sordid bargain that was made. One desired that the site should be in New South Wales, and the other insisted that it should be distant from Sydney not less than 100 miles. It was at this Premiers&#39; Conference that the provincial spirit was first displayed, and the sordid bargain made. Everything connected with .the matter since then has been tinged with the spirit which animated the Premiers at that Conference. After all, there has been no great delay in dealing with the matter. The first thing that happened was that the Government of New South Wales at the time, headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> See, deputed an independent Commissioner, selected by themselves, to report upon suitable sites for the Federal Capital. </para>

                            <para>- I may say that we have listened to the speech delivered by the honorable member for Parkes a dozen times. I have heard it four or five times already, and it is as well that the antidote should be presented with it. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> See, as Premier of New South Wales at the time, appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> as an independent Commissioner to report upon suitable sites, and that gentleman recommended as his first choice Southern Monaro. The then Premier of New South Wales was animated by some national feeling, and accepted the report of the Commissioner. He offered the Southern Monaro site for the Federal* Capital, and reserved the Crown lands in the vicinity from occupation. That was followed by the selection by this Parliament of a site in the Southern Monaro district, and then the provincialism of certain people in New South Wales was shown. I remind honorable members that the Southern Monaro site was not selected because of Victorian opinion, but as the result of investigation by an independent New South Wales official. This Parliament, comprising a majority of representatives of the other States, selected the very district that the New South Wales Commissioner recommended, and the New South Wales Premier offered to the Commonwealth. How carr* honorable members now turn round and say that Dalgety was selected as the result of Victorian influence? They must know that there is not an atom of justification for the statement. New South Wales representatives then said, &#34; We will not give you the site which our Commissioner recommenced, and will not carry out the promise made by our State Premier when he offered the site to the Commonwealth.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- Just so. New South Wales representatives said, &#34;No; we shall block you. We shall not let you go on with the matter until we can get the decision come to by the Federal Parliament reversed, and a decision made in accord with our provincial spirit.&#34; We know that when in the last Parliament a Bill was introduced to define the limits of the Dalgety site, it was blocked continually. When it was agreed that a division should be taken at 5 o&#39;clock on one Thursday afternoon, we all remember how the famous postal motion intervened. The then Prime Minister, the honorable member for Ballarat, objected that the bargain made with the honorable member for Parramatta was not being carried out, but to his intense surprise the honorable member for Parramatta got up and denounced him for trying to block the motion submitted by the honorable member for Gwydir. The matter was then put off to another time, and the honorable member for Parramatta was twitted by the honorable member for Ballarat, a week or so later, with having delayed the decision of the Federal Capital site question. In reply, the honorable member for Parramatta said that he was not a bit sorry, because those who &#39;thought with him on the matter were not ready. The honorable member was then told from the Treasury bench by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro that he knew that the numbers were against him. The settlement of the question was put off from time to time until those who were working with the honorable member -for Parramatta knew that they had the numbers necessary to give effect to their desires. </para>

On the last occasion when the matter was discussed, those in favour of Yass-Canberra had the necessary numbers, but they were secured only by some honorable members going back on the promises they had given to the honorable member for Eden-Monaro in this House. I have personal knowledge of the fact that some of those who voted for the Yass-Canberra site had voluntarily given their word to the honorable member for Eden-Monaro that they would not vote against the Dalgety site. When that honorable gentleman&#39;s health broke down, after the great speech he made in support of the Dalgety site, the honorable members referred to took advantage of his absence to do what they would not have done if he had been present. </para>

A charge has been made, not only against representatives of Victoria, but against this Parliament, of acting unjustly towards New South Wales in this matter. We know that there is no justification for the charge, but let me give this reply to it, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffith,</inline> who is a member of the present New South Wales Government. Speaking in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales on  2nd  November,  1909,  he said - </para>

                        <para>We all know that the Government of New South Wales offered the Dalgety site to the Commonwealth Parliament amongst others. We know that the Commonwealth Parliament carefully examined the various sites, and, after serious and perfectly honest consideration, a majority decided to accept that site. Then the Parliament of New South Wales turned round and withdrew the site that the Government of this State previously offered. There was a distinct breach of faith. There was bad faith, if any bad faith had been shown. It is said that the delay in fixing the Federal site is due to the Commonwealth Parliament. Such a statement is preposterous. No one in this House can believe it. When a statement is made against the Parliament of Australia which we know is untrue, such a proceeding is disgraceful. We know all this; but it is necessary to make this statement because a great many of the public do not know it. </para>

                    <para class="block">That confirms what I have already said. Now, as to the character of the YassCan.terra territory, I do not intend to repeat what has been said about the water supply, as there is already sufficient on record about it. But I shall refer honorable members to statements made in the Parliament of New South Wales. The Minister of Home Affairs has spoken eloquently of this beautiful locality, and has said that he would be prepared to buy the whole of it at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;,2</inline> an acre, although some persons who know the country have said that a great deal pf it is not worth more than from 2s. 6d. to 5s. an acre. I am qui le satisfied that though the Minister of Home Affairs may at this table say that he would be willing to give <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> an acre for the territory, outside he would never be such a fool as to do anything of the kind. One of the best indications of the character of the district is that this area of 900 square miles, although it is within a comparatively short distance from Sydney, and has been open to selection for very many years, is occupied by only 800 or 900 people. The honorable member for Parkes has described the territory as a very generous gift by New South Wales, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> speaking of it in the State Parliament, said - </para>

                        <para>Most of the land comprised within the area to be surrendered is not of very high character, so far as productive quality is concerned. Most of it has been open for settlement for the last hundred years, and has not been taken up. Some of the land in the neighbourhood of Yass is good, but other portions are not very rich. 1 1  has been open for settlement for a hundred years, and has not been taken up, and it is therefore no wonder that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> should say that it is of very small importance to New South Wales. We know very well that if the land in this area had been good land, it would have been occupied long ago by New South Wales settlers, and in the next place it would never have been offered to the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I am &#39;dealing at present with the Yass-Canberra district, and have quoted the opinions concerning it of members of the New South Wales Parliament. I shall cordially support the amendment in view of the way in which this question has been dealt with, and the decision with respect to Yass-Canberra arrived at in both Houses of this Parliament. It is clear that members of this Parliament are thoroughly divided on the question, and the decision in favour of Yass-Canberra has only been secured by intrigues and the exercise of undue influence, for reasons of personal friendship and other reasons, upon individual members. In the circumstances, I consider that it is only right that the people of Australia should be given a say in the matter. So far as I am personally concerned, I should be quite prepared to leave the matter to the decision of the people of New South Wales. I am satisfied that they would not select the Yass-Canberra site. If the feeling of the people of New South Wales in favour of &#39; the Yass-Canberra site were so strong as some New South Wales provincialists have invited us to believe, the State Government of New South Wales would have taken a referendum in that State on the subject long ago. That they have not done so satisfies me that they believe the people of New South Wales are not behind them in this matter. Dealing with the question from another point of view, I said a little time ago that I had come to the conclusion that it would be more in the interests of the Commonwealth that we should amend the Constitution, and that this Parliament should sit in Sydney for ten or fifteen years than that we should at this stage select any Capital site at all. We have an enormous expenditure to face within the next two or three years, and where we are to get ^1,000,000 with which to establish the Federal Capital on whatever site may be selected, I do not know. If it involves taxation, I, for one, shall not be willing to support it. The tide of immigration is setting in now to Australia, and ten or fifteen years hence it is quite possible that if the matter were still open we should not think it well to select either Yass-Canberra or Dalgety. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member talked of the Seven Hills of Rome, and spoke of Moses, that grand old leader of the children of Israel, standing on Mount Pisgah and viewing the promised land. He reminded us of the men who, with Joshua, were sent to spy out the land of Canaan, and who came back bearing with them the fruits of a land flowing with milk and honey. Those who go to spy out Yass-Canberra, however, can bring back no fruits. There are no grapes of Eschol to cut, and no flowing streams; no fertile valleys, or beautiful mountains of which to speak, as far as this territory is concerned. I am surprised that the Minister of Home Affairs, with a mind spiritually inclined, should have thought fit to refer, by way of illustration, to Moses standing on Mount Pisgah. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I am going to connect them just as the Minister of Home Affairs connected with the Bill his references to Moses. I wish to tell a story of a. modern political Moses, who visited New South Wales about two and a half months ago, and, arriving at the railway station nearest the district known as Yass-Canberra, and on arrival at the place he said to his guide, philosopher, and friend, &#34;  Colonel, I  want you to take me to the most elevated spot in this locality, because I desire to view the surrounding country.&#34; The  Colonel obliged  him, and, as our modern political Moses took his stand upon the highest elevation, and looked upon the country, he said, &#34;By the Red-skin Temple ! The boys down there in the House have said the correct thing. This is neither more nor less than a howling wilderness.&#34; I believe that if the Minister of Home Affairs were to speak from his heart of hearts he would say, &#34; Good Lord, deliver me from having anything to do with this measure.&#34; To come to the Bill itself, let me say that it presents many features with which I am pleased. I am glad, for instance, that it will wipe out, so far as the Federal Territory is concerned, those disgraceful pieces of legislation that were passed some time ago by the Parliament of New South Wales. </para>

                    <para>I wish now to refer to one or two remarks which have been made by some members of the Opposition. The honorable member for Parramatta suggested that the diatribes indulged in with respect to the selection of Washington as the Capital of the United States of America were similar to those to which we have now to listen in connexion with the selection of Yass-Canberra. He read a statement from what I presume is an authentic work, showing that antipathy very similar to that displayed to Yass-Canberra as the site of the Capital of the Commonwealth was exhibited in regard to the selection of Washington. Although it is admitted by Americans that a very great mistake was &#39; made in locating the Capital of the United States of America, my reading leads me to believe that as a Capital site it is a thousand times better than is the site which has been selected for the Capital of Australia. </para>

If it be true that the land in the Yass-Canberra district is worth only from 2s. 6d. to 5s. an acre, as shown in a report quoted last night by the honorable member for Indi, it could still be put to good use by the use of fertilizers and the free application of water, provided, of course, that an ample water supply were available. A good water supply is absolutely essential, and it cannot be said that Washington is lacking in that respect. Here is a description of the Potomac, on which Washington is built - </para>

                            <para>- No. It may be that some members of the Cabinet were very astute in the early history of the Cabinet, and a solidarity decision on this question was arrived at. But if there be one question upon which the Ministry should have allowed its members a free hand it is this matter of the Federal Capital site. </para>

The honorable  member for Parkes told us this morning that the passing of this Bill will represent the final act in the selection of Yass-Canberra as the permanent Seat of Government. He informed us that when once this measure has obtained legislative sanction, things will run along smoothly, and he and his friends  who think with him, will be able to give full effect to their ideas in connexion with the  Federal  Capital site. </para>

While it is my pride and pleasure to represent one of the most important parts of this city, I recognise that a bargain was struck with the people of New South Wales in reference to the Federal Capital site, and that the Constitution provides that the permanent Seat of Government shall be within the borders of that State. I intend loyally to adhere to that compact, and I told my constituents so upon every occasion that the question cropped up. </para>

I certainly think that he is a little out of order in adopting a lecturing tone. I do not blame the honorable member for Werriwa for putting up a good battle on behalf of the Yass-Canberra site. </para>

                            <para>- Last night I felt that the honorable member recognised that he had an awfully weak case, and that that was why he made such a poor job of it. The fact that we are now performing the last act in connexion with the Federal Capital site seems to afford him a wonderful amount of pleasure. But the day is coming - and I trust that, although the honorable member for Parramatta has quite a number of useful years of service behind him, he will live to see it - when the people of Australia will rise and say, &#34; We are not going to have a politically-made Capital, but a Capital which will be in consonance with our feelings and aspirations.&#34; Although to-day we may pass this Bill, and although we may even agree to further legislation in connexion with the Federal Capital, I believe that at no distant date there will be such a revulsion of feeling amongst the people that finally Yass-Canberra will not be the Seat of Government. I should like to see the electors given an opportunity to express their views upon this question when the referenda is taken upon the Bills which we have passed providing .for an alteration of the Constitution.&#34; Those who have read history must know that at one time a certain political coterie desired to make Winchester the Capital of England, that another section endeavoured to make Scone the Capital of Scotland, and that some patriotic Germans sought to&#39; make Frankfort the Capital of Germany. But do we find to-day that Winchester is the Capital of England, Scone the Capital of Scotland, or Frankfort the Capital of Germany ? </para>

                            <para>- That is not my opinion. The figures quoted by the honorable member for Werriwa in regard to the distance between the Yass-Canberra site and Jervis Bay are very much astray. But what I wish to point out is that we now have an opportunity to perform a national duty by selecting at Tooma, or in the country adjacent thereto, one of the very best sites it is possible to select in New South Wales. There are two sad defects at Yass-Canberra, namely, the poorness of the soil, and the inadequacy of the water supply. If that district had a poor soil, but possessed an adequate water supply, the latter advantage would to some extent compensate for the former deficiency. But a place with a poor water supply, and poor soil, is poverty-stricken indeed. That is why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron,</inline> a practical Scotchman, and a friend of the honorable member for Laanecoorie, had to leave the district; and when a Scotchman cannot make a &#34;do&#34; of anything, no one else can. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chesterman</inline> has reported on the physical characteristics of Tooma as follows - </para>

                        <para>Possibly the best site for a city will be found to include and surround the village reserve. However, within the area, which is edged by blue hatching on Plan X., I would not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining a well drained city site, offering good gradients and all necessary expansion. &#34;Suburban expansion could extend beyond this area which has been marked on plan from general knowledge of the locality. The average elevation of the site would probably be, approximately, 1,100 feet, and the aspect&#39; partly southerly and partly easterly. Good situations would be obtainable for prominent buildings and ample facilities for creating artificial lakelets and pleasure grounds will be found along the banks of the Murray and Tooma Rivers. The scenery in the Upper Murray District is very fine, and in the vicinity of the more lofty snow-clad mountains it becomes magnificent. From the top of Bald Hill, or from the more prominent points near the suggested city site, fine panoramic views are obtainable, embracing diversified stretches of river flats, rolling uplands, and wooded hills, the whole framed in a mountain background. </para>

What I have read is, not the report of a journalist wielding a trained pen for the fascination of his readers, but the statement of a cold, calculating surveyor, who feels compelled to burst out into this beautiful language. We could go to Tooma without any expense at all. </para>

                            <para>- There is a great difference between a district possessing beautiful, fertile river flats, and a splendid water supply, and one where some of the land is not worth more than from  2s.  to  5s.  an acre. At Tooma there is great natural beauty, and good supplies of stone, marble, wood, and other requirements, whereas everything needed for building purposes at Yass-Canberra will have to be brought from a great distance. </para>

That is an adage which -the honorable member has followed with success in private life and business pursuits, and should apply it to public life too. Marble &#34;like that in the beautiful pedestal on which the statue of the late Queen Victoria stands in the Queen&#39;s Hall can be obtained close to Tooma. What beautiful public buildings &#34;we could build with such stone. </para>

                            <para>- I have expressed not the opinion of myself, but the opinion of cool-headed men, and supported it by quoting from official documents. I have given the direct opinion of some of the most expert men who could possibly be consulted on this question. Of course, they may not be conversant with the constitutional side of the question regarding a port, but it seems to me that, instead of indulging in lavish expenditure on a railway through a strip of territory, we might very well take a larger area in a more productive part of the State. The honorable member for Werriwa has also advanced the argument that there will be no very great engineering difficulties in the construction of the proposed railway. </para>

                            <para>- I am endeavouring to place a fair and square proposition before the House. Speaking of the country this morning, somebody made the statement -  1  am rather inclined to the opinion, too, though it may be said that it is ungenerous -that, although the Constitution provides that the Commonwealth must have a Federal Territory of at least 100 square miles, New South Wales has been exceptionally magnanimous in multiplying that area by nine, and giving us 900 square miles. </para>

                            <para>- I wish that the Parliament had insisted upon getting a larger area. If the Commonwealth is going to carry out in the Federal territory some of the experiments which I hope to see carried out, its area should be far more than it is. I wish to point out from official reports that the description given by some officers of the country bears out some of the statements which have been made in the House, and which have been characterized as somewhat unfair by the honorable member for Parkes and others. Referring to the country between Jervis Bay and the Federal Capital site, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> writes - </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not&#39; know the exact width of the river, though I understand that the Federal Capital Site is about  2,000  feet higher than the level of the sea at Jervis Bay.. No doubt the honorable member for Werriwa thinks that because a train could run down to Jervis Bay on a decline practically all the way, therefore, the engineering difficulties will be very infinitesimal. But I can assure him that some of the greatest engineering difficulties in railway construction have been experienced in providing for trains to run down hill, in fact there is some danger in managing a train on down grades. The honorable member will remember that on various lines on which we have travelled they had to be graded so as to allow the trains to go down hill. -That is one of the most difficult engineering feats. Even though you might have a nice run from the Federal Capital to Jervis Bay, on the back journey you would have to travel upwards nearly all the way, I should say from sea level to a height of  2,100  feet. A railway which, according to the experts, is to cost  &#163;9,000  a mile cannot possibly be devoid of engineering difficulties. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> writes - </para>

                        <para>The line shown in red indicates a practicable route requiring bridges over the Shoalhaven, Mongarlowe, and  Corong .  Rivers. An alternative route is shown in blue, following the Bora Creek, and crossing the Shoalhaven below the Mongarlowe. If this prove practicable, it will reduce the distance between Canberra and Jervis Bay, and avoid a large bridge over the Mongarlowe. Before a route .is finally decided upon, a comprehensive inspection, extending over many weeks, is necessary, and only after such an inspection should any survey work be undertaken.  1 do not know that I need to further criticise the route of the railway. I may be wrong in thinking that no Federal port is needed, but I find that others hold that view. I do not see any necessity to have a port of entrance. I fail to realize the value of a port  100  miles away. I could understand having a port if the Federal territory were close to the coast. I am aware that the same argument has been used against the selection of Dalgety as a site. I believe that similar difficulties would be experienced in running a railway from Dalgety to Twofold Bay. </para>

On turning to records which have been handed to me I find that between the census of 1891 and the census of 1901 the population in the County of Murray, in which the Territory is, I understand, situated, decreased by 397 ; and this would seem to indicate that Yass-Canberra is regarded as a place to be left as quickly as possible. </para>

                            <para>- So far as I can see there is no rock to build on. The great misfortune is that the only elevated and the richest portion of the Territory is that which it is proposed to cover with city buildings. As there is likely to be a strong revulsion of feeling in regard to this selection, I advise the Minister of Home Affairs to draft his plans so as to provide for temporary buildings, perhaps of the tent variety, which, I understand, he once favoured in consequence of the small remuneration he received for his valuable legislative services. If we are to live in a primitive city let us live in a primitive fashion.- As to the cost of resumption, I find that the lands within the Cotter River catchment area are of a total value of &#163;55,681 ; the lands within the catchment area of the Queanbeyan River, above the Molonglo River, are valued at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;302,245;</inline> the lands in the catchment area of the Molonglo, above the junction with the Queanbeyan River, at &#163;248,649 ; and the lands within the catchment area of the Molonglo River, below the junction with the Queanbeyan River, at &#163;&#91;400,419. It will be seen that if we have to purchase these lands an immense amount of money will be required; and what for? To purchase practically, I should not say an arid waste, but lands that will be of very little use for some of the objects which I should like to see carried out within the Federal Capital area. The honorable member for Nepean says that we are going there to build a city, but that is only one of the purposes to be carried out by the Commonwealth. </para>

I protest as vigorously as I can against the Federal Capital being fixed at such a place ; and I submit that the proposal is neither more nor less than a pandering to the miserable, narrow, parochial feeling of the Sydney press and public, and of only a small section of these at the best. </para>

                            <para>- No; I desire that we should get out of Melbourne as quickly as possible. I believe, however, that a vote in New South Wales itself would show such an overwhelming majority against this selection as would surprise some of the parochialists within this Legislature. I do not claim to be a&#39; prophet or the son of a prophet, but I think that many of those who are now actively supporting Yass-Canberra will, before a few years are over, regret the step, and, in order to prevent them placing themselves in an awkward position, I plead with them, even at the eleventh hour, to give up their present idea, and select the best site, which, in my opinion, is to be found in the beautiful and salubrious district of Tooma. </para>

                        <para>.- I enter an emphatic protest against the proposed expenditure of money in face of the important works which must be carried out in the near future. Extensive railway construction &#39; has to be undertaken ; and, indeed, the whole work of development has practically to be carried out by the Commonwealth. Under the circumstances, an immediate and large expenditure on a Federal Capital will mean a great injustice to present and future generations. When the measure was before us last session, I was under the impression that it meant merely a preliminary to future building, when funds permitted, and the necessities of the Commonwealth required. I thought the wisdom of the Parliament would be sufficient to protect the people from a huge expenditure without rhyme or reason at this early stage of our development. This Bill i.i a mistaken step ; and I can only hope that the people will be afforded an opportunity of saying whether or not they approve of our now undertaking this work which, if once undertaken, cannot be abandoned. A referendum could be most conveniently taken next March or April j and this method ought certainly to be resorted to before we expend  ^50,000  straight away, and thereby pledge the Commonwealth to further large expenditure on non-reproductive work. I am not in the least, concerned whether the Seat of Government be retained in Melbourne or not. If it should prove to be in the interests of this Parliament and the people to remove to some other commercial centre for a number of years, I am quite prepared to vote for such a step. The question is, not whether we shall keep the Capital in Melbourne, but whether, at this early stage, when we are surrounded with nations daily growing in strength, we should not husband and develop our resources, and attract a large population, as the best possible means of preserving this continent for the European races. Under all the circumstances, I consider the proposal of the Government as absolutely indefensible. I have received from various parts of Victoria resolutions passed by municipal and other public bodies in favour of referring the question to those who, after all, will have to bear the taxation to meet the necessary expenditure. The merits of this site have been discussed at great length, and I have never had any hesitation in expressing the opinion that Parliament has not made the best choice in the interests of the people. Yass-Canberra will be largely under the influence and shadow of one of the great commercial centres of Australia, while not possessing any commercial importance in itself. </para>

                            <para>- I am attacking the selection of Yass-Canberra. Whatever might have been said about the choosing of the site, no substantial reason can be advanced for launching upon a large expenditure in the construction at this early stage of Australia&#39;s development of buildings which at best can serve no better purpose than is now amply met by existing structures in our great commercial centres. The shifting of the Federal Capital into some ill-chosen part of Australia can only result disastrously to the best interests of the Commonwealth, as has been proved by what has occurred in the United States of America. The Minister of Home Affairs has spoken in terms of excessive eulogy of the great capital city of Washington. Let me direct the attention of the House to the opinion of another great authority in the well-known writer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> G. Wells, who recently visited Washington.  His  views should carry some weight. They very amply and lugubriously foretell what may happen as soon as the Parliament moves to the proposed Capital Site at Canberra. After visiting Washington, where apparently he was well treated, he said - </para>

                        <para>There are many reasons for believing that the National Government will always remain a little ineffectual and detached from the full flow of American life, and this notwithstanding the very great powers with which the  President  is endowed. One of these reasons is certainly the peculiar accident which has placed the capital on the Potomac. To the thoughtful visitor to the United States this hiding away of the central Government in a minute district, removed from all the great centres of thought, population, and business, actually becomes more and more remarkable, more and more perplexing, and more and more suggestive of a weakness in the National Government as he grasps more and more firmly the peculiarities of the American situation. I do not see how the central Government of that great American nation of which I dream can possibly be Washington, as I do not see how the present central Government can possibly be transferred to any other centre. But to go to Washington, to see and talk Washington, is to receive an extraordinary impression of the utter isolation and hopelessness of Washington. The National Government has an air of being marooned there. One goes from the abounding movement and vitality of the northern cities to this sunny and enervating place, through the negligently cultivated county of Virginia, and one discovers the slovenly, unfinished promise of a city, wood avenues, lined by negro shanties and patches of cultivation, great public buildings, and an immense post-office, a lifeless museum, an inert university, a splendid desert library, a street of souvenir shops, a certain industry of &#34; seeing Washington,&#34; an idiotic colossal obelisk. It seems an ideal nest for the Tariff manipulator, a festering corner of delegates and agents and secondary people. In the White House the writer found a transitory flow of intellectual activity ; the spittoons and glasses that once made it like a London gin palace had been removed, and the former orgies of hand-shaking reduced to a minimum. To this place out of the way of everywhere, come the senators and congressmen, mostly leaving their families behind them in their States of origin. Thither, too, are driven a multitude of political agents and clerks, and a crowd of mediocre men. For most of them there is neither social nor intellectual life. The thought of America is far away, centred in New York. The business and economic development is in New York. Apart from the  President  it is in New York that one meets the people who matter, and the New York atmosphere that grows and develops ideals and purposes. . . . Government from the district of Columbia is in itself the repudiation of any organized national system. But government from this ineffectual, inert place is only the most striking outcome of that inflexible Constitution, the wrangling delegates of 1 787-1788 did at last produce out of a conflict of State jealousies. </para>

                    <para class="block">That seems a timely warning which might well be taken by this House before it advances this important question another stage. The site itself has so many disqualifications that we should hesitate to build on it at all, but in view of the enormous responsibilities that this Parliament has to undertake in the almost immediate future, no proposal to spend colossal sums in erecting buildings for the Federal Parliament when others quite as good are available in the great commercial cities of the Commonwealth can be justified. The time for discussing the financial situation that looms ahead of us is not the present, but it may not be out of place to reiterate that we must undertake in the immediate future the construction of two large transcontinental railways which, with the accumulated debt on the Northern Territory, will run the Commonwealth into an expenditure of probably &#163;20,000,000. The State Parliaments can only expect to settle the lands of this continent by tapping the rivers, storing water, and inducing intense cultivation. These things will cost large sums of money, but they are requisite to bring about that progress which is absolutely essential to the future safety of this great nation. In ordinary cases a mistake made in one session can be remedied in the next, without any very serious or lasting injury to the people, but that is not the case with the Federal Capital. Once we embark on its building, it is improbable that we shall ever repeal the Act under which the work is being done. The question is therefore different from almost any other with which we have been, or will be, called upon to deal. It can be properly considered only by attempting to realize the probable conditions of Australia in a hundred years&#39; time. </para>

The Australian people are not accustomed to sit down and wait an indefinite time before completing their plans, and the probability is that once a proper start is made with the construction of Parliament House, the Library, and various other public buildings, the work will be proceeded with until it is finished. It is very hard to say. at this stage how many millions of pounds will be involved in those undertakings, and in providing the necessary Water supply for a decent Federal city. None of these works will be interest bearing, but they can be undertaken at this early stage of our history only at the expense of those necessary developmental and reproductive works which are essential to the future safety of this great continent. </para>

Future generations will, when they look at the debates of these times, be able to judge who were the parochialists and who were the nationalists in this matter. It should have been settled altogether apart from provincial considerations, because it involves the future of the whole of Australia as does no other Act that we have been or are likely to be called upon to pass. Apparently, it is of no use to appeal to the House in its present disposition to say whether the expenditure of all this money shall be undertaken, as it must be, simultaneously with the passing of this Act, or whether the people of Australia, who have to pay the piper, shall have the opportunity of deciding this important National issue. We have already perpetrated one serious mistake in the selection of the site itself. No independent body of men, carefully weighing the evidence in regard to the several suggested sites, could come to any other conclusion than that from the stand-point of . its neutrality, its water supply, and its freedom from the influence of large cities, the site rejected in the last Parliament was the best that could be chosen in the interests of the people of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- That was the trouble, and yet this question is supposed to have been settled on National grounds. We have perpetrated one serious mistake, and  1  hope that this Parliament will not be the victim of parochial influences on this second occasion by agreeing to the expenditure of a large sum of money on a Federal Capital - an expenditure for which there can be at this stage no possible justification. </para>

                        <para>.- It is not my intention to delay the House on this question, but I feel constrained before a vote is taken to make a few observations. This Bill marks one more step towards fixing for all time the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth, and the step to be taken is so important that advantage should be taken of every opportunity to avoid a fatal blunder. It is said that this question has been threshed cut from time to time till it has become practically threadbare. I have not had an opportunity, however, to discuss it at length, neither have I had an opportunity as a representative of the people to visit Yass-Canberra. I am prepared, consequently, to take advantage of every opportunity to delay the final settlement of the question until honorable members have had an opportunity to inspect the site, and so to fit themselves to cast an intelligent vote. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with the honorable member presently. The honorable member for Parkes, in his characteristic style, this morning referred to honorable members on this side of the House as young men and striplings. I do not know that it is a crime to be young. If it is then we shall grow out of it. I would sooner be a young man, imbued with a desire to do my best for my country, than he old, and have no desire for its welfare. The honorable member for Parkes treated us to what I might call a University lecture, on the elements of almost everything under the sun, so that we might well refer to him as &#34; The Professor for Parkes.&#34; He declared that we were prepared only lc give New South Wales her pound of flesh, and he made that assertion, because he held that we were seeking at every opportunity to delay the settlement of this question. The honorable member quoted a newspaper article in support of his statement. Even if the charge be true, I would sooner be the one prepared only to give the pound of flesh than the one who demanded the pound of flesh. The honorable member said that provincialism was evidenced in connexion with the choice of the Federal Capital. Where did the provincialism first arise? Whence did it come? From New South Wales, the State which he represents. </para>

                            <para>- I stand corrected. When the people of Australia had the Constitution Bill put before them they were not asked to consider mere details or sordid bargains. They gave consideration only to the broad principle of Federation, and it is no argument to say that they agreed to the insertion in the Constitution Bill of a clause providing that the Federal Capital should be in New South Wales. The charge of provincialism comes with an ill grace from those who represent the one State which stood out for a sordid bargain. We have been told that Victoria demanded that the Capital should not be within  100  miles of Sydney, and that in that respect she was guilty of provincialism. Even if that was provincialism, it was introduced into the Constitution by a worse form of provincialism on the part of New South Wales. From start to finish provincialism has been in the atmosphere and enveloped every discussion of this important question. I may be young, but my idea is that the Federal Capital should be the ideal city of Australia. We should be able to establish a modern city which will serve as an example to the rest of the civilized world, and particularly as a guide to other parts of Australia. We are starting to build up, so to speak, from scratch, and have the experience of civilization to guide us. We are the inheritors of the progress of generations. All that science and art have been able to accomplish are within our reach, and yet the honorable member for Parkes declares that we want nothing in the nature of commerce at the Federal Capital, because if we had we should have a smoky town. No doubt that would be the position if the Capital were established at Yass-Canberra, where there is no water to give us a smokeless power ; but if it were established on a site possessing an adequate water supply the. Capital could be a centre of commerce and yet be almost smokeless. The- honorable member for Parramatta quoted from a newspaper, 130 years old, some of the prophesies made in regard to the establishment of the Capital of the United States at Washington. He read with great gusto the statements that were made against that site, and one of his colleagues cried out, &#34; History repeats itself.&#34; The honorable member waved his newspaper clipping in triumph and sought to show that all that was bad was said against Washington just as everything that is bad is now being said against Yass-Canberra. I see no reason for triumph on his part, since Washington has not been the success that its advocates claimed it would be. If it is a case of history repeating itself, then we have the strongest argument in favour of our contention that Yass-Canberra is not the best site obtainable in Australia. Let us have a little more of &#34; history repeating itself &#34; as regards the selection of Washington. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> referring to the question about twelve months ago, said - </para>

                        <para>As far as I can ascertain from the records, something like nine or ten years elapsed before the location of the Federal territory was determined upon; whilst the negotiations, the manipulation of votes, and the handling of voters that went on to secure that purpose were not very creditable to those days, and very nearly led to a violent disruption of that young Constitution. </para>

                    <para class="block">Here we have history repeating itself once more. It is because of these facts, and not because I believe that a reference to the people is the best method of settling a question such as this that I favour a referendum being taken in regard to the site of the Capital. My desire is that the decision of this question shall be removed from the arena of politics. There has been so much lobbying and such a display of party feeling and provincialism of the worst type in this Parliament that I prefer to refer the question to the people of Australia for determination. Unlike some honorable members, I am not going to decry any portion of Australia. Possibly Yass-Canberra is a very fine part of the Commonwealth, but from what I have read, and even from the admissions of its advocates, I feel convinced that it is not the best site. Even if a better site is not procurable within the limitations of the Constitution, I think that in dealing with so important a question as this we should proceed most cautiously, and give to it the most careful consideration. We do not wish to repeat the mistake of ten years ago. Is it not time that we withdrew all limitations to the opening up of this question once more, and endeavoured to secure for the Australian capital the best site that Australia can offer? The honorable member for Illawarra interjected, whilst the honorable member for Laanecoorie was speaking, that Lake George was the site that he favoured. </para>

                            <para>- Because I believe that, with all their limitations, the people are better qualified to give an honest decision than is the Parliament. When the question was first discussed in this House, the Yass site received very little support, and Canberra also received only one vote. Then, to secure a combination of votes in favour of a site near Sydney, Yass and Canberra were put together as one site, with the result that the site which secured only one vote at every ballot is that on which the Federal Capital is now to be established. The honorable member for Parramatta said that we wanted to get away from Melbourne. The honorable member and others from the remaining States of the Commonwealth have been well treated here, and it ill becomes them to express so strong a desire to get away from this city. I am not saying that we should remain here, but it ill becomes those who have received such excellent treatment from this State to express a desire to run away from it. The honorable member says that we ought to get away from it, so as to be free from the influence of the provincial press of Melbourne. I would remind him that what he describes as &#34; the provincial press of Melbourne &#34; has supported him and his colleagues ever since they have been in this Parliament. If we go to Yass-Canberra, we shall have the worst provincial newspapers in Australia delivered at our doors every morning. No one has less regard for the press than I have, but if it is necessary, as the honorable member for Parramatta asserts, to leave Melbourne to get away from the influence of the press, we should certainly not go to Yass-Canberra. I do not regard this as an ideal question to submit to the electors, but Parliament having shown itself incapable of . dealing fairly with it, we must appeal to our masters. I protest against the taking of any more steps towards dealing with the Capital until the best site has been chosen. The Bill appears to be a good one for its purpose, but our children will not look upon our actions with pride if we choose a site which is not the best for the whole Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall support the amendment, though 1 am not in accord with all the reasons which have been advanced on behalf of it. It must not be forgotten that New South Wales entered the Union on the distinct and positive promise that the Federal Capital would be built within its boundaries, and, therefore, to provide for the establishment of a Capital outside that State would be a breach of faith. When I entered Parliament I was in a similar position to that now occupied by the honorable member for Corangamite ; I had not my choice between several sites, but had to vote for either Yass-Canberra or Dalgety, and my judgment inclined me to choose the former, though I believe that there were other places more suitable, and that Tumut was infinitely superior to it. I am afraid that we shall be outvoted on the amendment, because, although most of the Ministers when in Opposition were violently opposed to Yass-Canberra, they now say that they are bound to support it on the ground that there must be continuity of action. They have not shown the same desire for continuity of action with regard to other matters, and had no hesitation in securing a reversal of the vote regarding the borrowing of money for naval construction, which was the policy of the last Parliament. I do not propose to quote the speeches of those who opposed the selection of Yass-Canberra, and are now voting for expenditure there; but as an Australian native who feels the responsibility of seeing that no false step is taken, I think that we must do all that we can to get the best site. If Parliament is not able to make a suitable choice, we should appeal to the people. I should like them to have an opportunity of choosing a better site than either Yass-Canberra or .Dalgety, and I think that in days to come they will thank us for taking action which will enable them to do so. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to lodge my protest against the present selection. I take it that every member of the House desires that the finest site on the continent should be chosen for our Federal Capital ; and I do not deny for one moment that each of us is patriotic from his own point of view. The whole history of this question discloses a huckstering bargain, which will be remembered when the history of these times is written. New South Wales refused to join the Federation unless the Capital were placed within her borders; and the spirit so disclosed was one which ought never to have had any influence in the birth of a new nation. I have nothing but contempt and loathing for those who demanded the terms of that bar gain, and for those who cravenly acquiesced. Where are the men who made the bargain? </para>

                            <para>-  One is in London. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. MALONEY</inline> (Melbourne)  &#91;3.30&#93;.-  I think, got well in out of the wet, because I feel sure that the present representative of East Sydney would have defeated him at the last election. However, I think all of us have a soft corner in our hearts for our dear, kind, stout friend; and are all inclined to say, &#34;Hang his politics; he is a dashed good fellow.&#34; But where ate the other parties to the bargain? So far as I know, only two are in active politics to-day, and they sit in Opposition, where they will remain for three years at least. The right honorable member for Swan was one who persuaded me in favour of Dalgety ; but I notice that whenever an opportunity presents itself, loyalty to the Governments of the past, and to certain friends of the present, causes him to vote for the site proposed in this Bill. Honorable members opposite know that they have no hope against honorable members on this side when we vote solidly; but this ought not to be a party question. We know, however, that the present selection was made by dint of lobbying such as I have never seen equalled in twenty years&#39; experience - lobbying which, when the history of these times is written, will stamp men, who may now shine brightly in the eyes of Australia, with the stigma of advocating an unworthy cause. A suggestion I should have liked to make is represented in the plan which was adopted when the capital of New Zealand was selected. There no little, petty, parochial interests were allowed to have any influence, but experts were brought from the Old Land, and given power to select the best spot in the whole Dominion. In my opinion, a Royal Commission of experts should be appointed, consisting of five experts chosen from Great Britain, Switzerland, France, Germany, and the United States, with the power, never exercised by men before, of selecting a Capital to dominate a Commonwealth. I ran well imagine these men, with all the honour that would pertain to them, exercising their power, unmoved by any consideration whatever, except that of making the best possible choice in the interests of the whole continent. One man who. has been thrown into the dust-bin of political oblivion - who was leader of a party in New South Wales, and was instrumental in placing an innocent man in gaol, and causing him to go abroad to seek justice - refused to give the Commonwealth free control over the lands when Dalgety was chosen, declaring that we must take Yass-Canberra, and no other site. I understand that half a port has been granted to the Commonwealth, though undoubtedly we should control the whole. Be that as it may, I make my protest&#39; against the selection, which is the result, as I have said, of lobbying, the strongest and most unceasing I ever saw. However, next session the power of the referendum and the initiative will be given to the people, and they will be able to amend the Constitution, and see that a new selection is made. Between now and next session the Minister of Home Affairs, who adorns the office he holds, will not be able to spend an unlimited amount.-  His  natural shrewdness &#39; and ability, which have been cultivated by many years of business experience, will prevent him spending money foolishly ; and even if the site be changed, the money will not have been thrown away. I understand that the honorable gentleman is planting &#34; trees ; and afforestation, in Yass-Canberra or anywhere else, is always profitable. The people who have sent the present majority to Parliament will, with their sense of wrong, rise up and disclaim a huckstering bargain which had to be accepted by those who were determined to have Federation. They will say that the Federal Capital should be chosen, not in the interests of one State or of one party, but for the benefit of the whole community. In Asia, the home of the Aryan race, there arose, perhaps the greatest empire the world ever saw; and we cannot imagine, if a capital had to be selected, that any petty considerations would have been permitted to interfere. The wisest of counsellors would have been called in, and told to select that place which would best dominate that vast dominion. As an Australian, I love my country, and my only desire is to have a Capital worthy of the Commonwealth. Were such a Commission as I have suggested appointed, the 100 mile limit might be waived, and the best possible selection made, irrespective of any condition of the kind. That is not a very great thing to face. We have already in the teeth of strenuous  &#39;Opposition  passed a Bill to alter the Constitution if the voice of our creators, the people, indorses it. I do not wish any one to think that I desire to keep the Federal Capital in Melbourne. As the member for </para>

                    <para class="block">Melbourne, with this Parliament sitting in my constituency, I could wish it a hundred miles away, and my vote would be gladly given to remove it, but I wish to see it in the site where the water power will be the greatest available in the continent, because no scientist can foretell the potentialities of power from a cheap water supply. Science has shown the way to produce a Wire which to touch is death, but the only nation that has put that into effective use is Japan, in the island of Formosa, to keep the rebellious natives under control. With our power coming from the mighty Snowy River, we could have around our Capital city at Dalgety barricade after barricade that would be absolutely impassable to any army, however bravely led, that might land on our shores. In the site that has now been chosen we shall have to raise our water supply  850  feet, or about seventeen times higher than the roof above me, before the prospective inhabitants can be supplied with a single glass of water. One member on the other side said that gravitation is not always the best way of pro- &#39;viding a city with water. Let us examine that statement in the light of history. It is an established fact that gravitation is the cheapest and best, and in fact the only effectual, way to supply a large city population with water. When Rome was at her mightiest she had nine aqueducts. To-day she has only three, yet even to-day. she is the best-watered city in the world. The combined water power of London, Paris, and New York does not equal that of Rome, so that we can imagine what her water power was like in the days of her nine aqueducts. Chicago, which has been quoted by the Minister of Home Affairs, is the only large city that has continued to supply itself with water by pumping.  </para>

That sort of thing could not happen with a water supply by gravitation. The water supply of a city is like the blood supply of a human being. The heart sends the rich, red fluid through the arteries, and when the blood has done its work it comes back through the veins. So the good water supply that comes to a city from a fair distance by gravitation leaves it by its gutters. </para>

                            <para>- I have not gone into that question, but if we have to face the difficulty of raising our water supply 850 feet, we shall find a much greater difficulty in disposing of the sewage, because that will require a large supply of water to carry it away. The only parallel that I can find to the practice adopted by Chicago until comparatively recent years is that of a Chinese junk in the river at Canton, where they empty out the sewage at one end of the vessel, and at the other draw up the water in which to cook their vegetables. By all means let us have the water supply of our Capital city as pure as possible. Our engineers should be able tq emulate what the Arabian engineers did in Spain 800 years ago. By means which as yet no engineer has been able to discover, the. snow-water from the hills 40 to 50 miles from Granada, once the capital of the Moorish possessions in Spain, is brought to the Alhambra Palace in that city, where it leaps up in a splendid stream. What was the reason of all the &#34; lobbying &#34; that took place over this site? Why did men forget the duty they owed to their own constituents? Was it a question of the value of the land, or not? I do not say for one moment that it was, but there must have been some dominant reason ; and that is as great a mystery to me to-day as was the resignation from politics of one honorable member who took a very prominent action in the matter. I do not fear to face the future. The memory of a wrong will live in the minds of a people for a long time; and a sense of wrong in this matter is permeating the electors throughout the length and breadth of Australia. It may be a long time in the life of a member, but it will be a short time in the life of our Commonwealth, before the people, when they have the power of the referendum and the initiative, will rise up, prompted by the sense of wrong and injustice done to the whole nation in the matter of the Capital site, and say to the State of New South Wales, &#34; We shall remove the Capital site from within your borders. You have proved yourself unworthy of it by putting it in a spot that was not the best. Whatever spot the experts say is the finest, whether it is in the north, south, east, or west of the continent, shall be fixed for the Capital.&#34; What will those who are now voting for this site think then, if they be still alive, or, if they are dead, what will their descendants think of them ? They will regret the stigma attaching to their names for having put the Federal Capital in an unsuitable position. In view of the nearness of Australia to the teeming millions of Asia, some might say that, if water-power could be obtained in the centre of the continent, that would be the best place in which to plant the Capital. I do not lean towards that view, because of my reading of the history of Madrid, the one capital that was planted in the centre of a nation. It was made almost unassailable by an enemy, but it lost in greatness. If, however, the experts show that a site in the centre of Australia is best, that will be equal almost at once to two or three army corps for the defence of the empty north. The wrong that is being done to the people of Australia now was first started in the huckstering which occurred among a lot of politicians, all but two of whom are now in the limbo of oblivion. The remaining two are in the cold shades of Opposition, and are likely to remain there. It was perpetuated by the personal animus of the Premier of a State, the voters of which have now sent him also into the limbo of oblivion. I venture to prophesy that, eventually, there will be an upheaval throughout the length and breadth of Australia, when the Australian citizens, endowed with the mighty powers of the referendum and &#39; the initiative, will say, &#34; A plague on your quarrels, a plague on your lobbying, a plague on your unjust hucksterings and bargainings. We ourselves shall decide where our Federal Capital is to be.&#34; When in those days the voice of Australia thunders forth, how little will appear the Premiers of the day who took this action, upholding State rights against National rights, and fighting the National Parliament at every step of our progress ! </para>

                        <para>.- Under this clause, it is provided that the State laws continued in force under this Bill shall become the laws of the Territory, and as such they will be Commonwealth laws. The principle of the Constitution is that where a State law is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the State law to that extent is abrogated. It will therefore be difficult to determine, where there is a slight inconsistency between the State laws to be continued and the general laws of the Commonwealth, which is to prevail, but, as the clause is drafted, I do not know that we can cure the difficulty. Probably the High Court would hold that the last word was the final word. </para>

                        <para>. - I candidly confess that I do not like this clause. It seems to me to empower the Government, by Executive warrant, to make laws of all kinds. The power seems rather wide. I do not favour such a method of framing laws which may interfere with the liberties of the people. The provision is very wide, and it seemed to me rather an unusual power to ask for. Legislation by Executive warrant is foreign to our practice nowadays, though power is often given to make regulations in- pursuance of an Act, so as to give effect to its provisions. This is not such a power, but is a power to be exercised by the Executive Government to pass legislation for the control of the Territory. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, I should have said three lawyers. As chief Executive officer of a Crown Colony, which subsequently, under responsible government, fell almost entirely under his personal control, the right honorable and learned  member sees the dangers hidden in these provisions. I view the clause with a great deal of suspicion. It is the correct thing to say in a connexion like this that one has every confidence in the present Minister, but we do not know who may replace him. Yet I fear that we may be placing too much power in the hands of the occupant of the office. The Ordinances, so far as parliamentary control over them is concerned, will be much like the statutory rules which are required to be laid upon the table within fifteen days of their promulgation, and which we very seldom see. Under the clause, the Minister of Home Affairs will become virtually a reigning sovereign. </para>

                            <para>- Prior to the creation of the Council, Papua was governed in the way in which it is proposed to govern this Territory. Now there is a Council, but its Ordinances do not take effect until ratified in Melbourne. Of course, there cannot be a local governing body in the Federal Territory for some time to come, and the Bill provides that until the creation of a local government the Commonwealth Administration shall have power to make Ordinances having the force of law. It is impossible for the Minister to say exactly what Ordinances will be issued this year, next year, or the year after. The legal representatives of the Opposition seem to be trying to entrap him. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not think that honorable members need be too anxious about this matter, because, although the Ordinances will take effect from the date on which they are passed, they will subsequently be ratified by the Parliament. What we wish to know is whether the Minister proposes to issue them merely for the administration of the Territory, or to lay down a definite line of policy ? That is a question which he should easily answer. </para>

                        <para>.- It is the members of the Opposition who seem dissatisfied, but none of them, not even the right honorable member for Swan, has enough courage to move - to amend the clause. I should like to know from the Minister how many bodies are going to govern the Territory. The Seat of Government Acceptance Act declares that the laws of New South Wales shall apply to the Territory, but this measure empowers the Governor-General to set aside any of them, with this proviso - </para>

Will the Minister tell us what kind of laws the State will administer in our Territory ? Of course, I&#39; know that the whole belongs to New South Wales, and I suppose this provision is another case of pandering to the Government of that State. </para>

                            <para>- I said that I quite appreciate the difficulties, though they may not be evident to the Minister himself. We are introducing for the first time the principle of delegating legislative authority to the Governor-General. At present the Governor-General has power to disallow any Act, or to reserve it for Royal assent, and so forth ; but there are no safeguards in the Bill. Under the Act dealing with Papua, for instance, the Lieutenant-Governor cannot give his assent without reservation, and some Bills do not come into force for a year after they have been passed ; and, in addition, there is a Council of Advice. But under this Bill the Governor acts, as it were, &#34; off his own bat,&#34; and there is no one to disallow any Ordinance he may issue. In the case of Papua the Lieutenant-Governor may disallow any act by the Governor, and any act by the Governor-General may be disallowed by the King ; but who is to disallow any Ordinance of the Governor-General? It seems rather anomalous to give the Governor-General <inline font-style="italic">carte blanche</inline> as to what shall be the class of legislation by Ordinance. Supposing, to take an extreme case, we abrogate the law of murder and pass another. It will not be much satisfaction to the hanged man to have the Ordinance disallowed six months after he is in the grave. </para>

                    <para>Mi. GLYNN. - It is a legal possibility. As the Bill stands we can disallow any Ordinance only after it has operated, perhaps, to the detriment of some person, and there are cases in which no compensation can be made. I understand the great difficulty of suggesting an alternative, but, as a challenge has been issued, I suggest that we confine the powers of ordinance to those of the Acts specified in the schedule. </para>

                        <para>This clause offers a wide field for criticism, but it is&#39; very difficult for those who criticise to suggest a way out of the difficulty. The Government are, in my opinion, doing all that could reasonably be expected, in providing that, with the exception of certain State laws which are specified, the others shall operate, and in taking power, if necessary, to issue. Ordinances through the Governor-General. We know that the Governor-General cannot issue an Ordinance except by the advice of the Executive; and for any Ordinance the Ministry will be answerable to this House. In view of the approaching end of the session, and the necessity for the issue of the final proclamation, the. Government cannot do. otherwise than ask the House to pass this Bill.I do not see why there should be any delay, because the laws of New South Wales will operate, with the exceptions mentioned, and there may be emergencies for which those laws do not provide, and for which the Government reserve, the power of issuing Ordinances. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister has not replied to the point I raised in regard to the administration of the laws. According to the Bill, the Ordinances may &#34;direct that the laws are to continue to be administered by the authorities of the State as if the Territory continued to form part of the State. I take it, however, that the State will have no authority in the Territory once we have possession. </para>

                    <para>The clause, as drafted, presupposes the necessity for establishing a local Legislature, which is not even contemplated by the Constitution. My amendment will give the Government all the powers necessary, without committing us to establish a local Legislature.

                        <para>.- Has the Minister in his mind, or in immediate contemplation, any particular form of administration for the Territory ? The question that I put previously to him was not intended in any way as hostile criticism. Although he takes in this clause general power to pass laws for the government of the Territory, seeing that this is intended only to be a provisional government asset out in the beginning of the Bill, what I asked him was, whether he had in contemplation only the passing of such provisional Ordinances as were necessary for the effectual administration of the Territory. I wanted him to say, in order to allay all suspicion, that it was not intended to take general powers to carry out all sorts of legislative policy. I understand that his intention is to exercise only so much power as is necessary to effectively administer the Territory. Can the Minister state whether he has yet come to any decision upon policy - as to what he is working up to? Is it intended to have Commissioners to control the Territory until such &#34;time as the city can have its municipality, with a properly constituted council and mayor, or is it contemplated to appoint from the Department some specific officer or officers to whom are to be delegated under Ordinances, in the meantime, the duties of regulating and governing the city? </para>

                            <para>- The important question arises whether any indebtedness has been incurred by those shires, and to what extent the people living in the Federal Territory are responsible for it. If they are responsible, it would be very unfair for us to exclude them from the operations of the Local Government Acts, and throw the whole of the burden of indebtedness on the people who still remain in the three shires. If any of the people in the Federal Territory have received the benefit of indebtedness incurred by the shires in order to provide roads and other facilities for them to get their produce to market, they should still be held responsible for their share of the debt. Perhaps no money has been borrowed by the shires, but, if there has been, the Minister should be able to give us some information in regard to the matter. If he cannot do so now, I hope he will consider the matter, and have inquiries made, in conjunction with New </para>

                        <para>-A very serious question has been raised by the honorable member for Hunter. I freely admit that the Minister will see that no injustice is done to the local residents, but I would point out that the schedule includes the Local Government (Loans) Act of New South Wales among the State laws which are not to continue in force in the Territory. This question affects not so much the residents as the Government of New South Wales and the creditors of the various municipal councils within the Territory. Do the Government intend to assume responsibility for all loans that have been raised by these municipalities? </para>

                        <para>. - I ask the Minister of Home Affairs to give this matter very serious consideration. He must have some clear object in view in seeking to make non-applicable to the Territory the various State Acts set forth in the schedule. Among those is the Local Government (Loans) Act  1907.  The security given to those who have advanced money to the shires within the Territory must be the rates derived from the lands of the Territory. It is now proposed in this Bill to take from those who have advanced money to the shires a portion of that security, and the Government must have a definite policy in view. When I mentioned the matter to the Minister last night I thought that he would take steps to ascertain what loans had been raised by municipalities within the Territory. Is it the intention of the Minister that those who have advanced money to these municipalities shall be compensated for this loss of security? In other words, are the Government going to assume the liability which previously attached to the Territory ? </para>

                            <para>- But they have not acquired the whole of the land within the Territory, and we need some definite information on the point. I would also point out that by declaring that the Local Government Acts of New South Wales shall no longer be applicable to the Territory, the Government, by means of this Bill, are doing away with all local government there. I presume that the reply of the Minister will be that it is proposed by Ordinance to constitute some local governing body. </para>

                            <para>- No; there are three municipalities involved, and doubtless some of them have borrowed moneys on the security of the Territory as well as other portions of the State. This Bill now declares that the Local Government (Loans) Act shall be repealed so far as it is applicable to this Territory. The Government cannot assume liability in this regard ; but the point is, what is the object of repealing these local government laws? </para>

                        <para>. - The Local Government (Loans) Act to which the honorable member has alluded is a short measure to amend the Local Government Act. It provides in its operative sections, which are two in number, that the council of certain existing municipalities may borrow money, and it validates certain loans already contracted, and deals specially with the municipality of Lithgow. Surely the honorable member does not contend that the financial obligations of that municipality concern the Federal Territory. </para>

                        <para>. - The Attorney-General seems not to apprehend the nature of the difficulty. The repeal of the Act to which he has referred, will probably only have the legal effect of preventing authority under it being exercised in respect to the Territory; but that does not determine the effect of the repeal of the Acts in the schedule, including the Local Government Act of 1906 and the amending Act of 1908, the effect of which, I take it, will be to remove the Federal Territory from the control of those shires of whose area it has, until now, formed part. The Minister is, apparently, unable to say whether money has or has not been borrowed on the security of what is now Federal Territory. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The Government must assume some definite attitude in this matter. It must either determine to deprive certain municipalities and their creditors of security, without compensation, or give the definite assurance that the obligations incurred in. respect to the Territory will be recognised. Admittedly, the Minister does not know whether money has been borrowed on the security of what is now Federal Territory. One of the strange things about the Bill is that it, apparently, destroys the existing machinery of local government, without making provision for the continuance of the maintenance of roads, and other public works, until the Minister, imitating the lawgiver whose view of the Promised Land from Mount Pisgah he described in such glowing terms, brings down another Decalogue. </para>

We wish to know how the three shires of whose area the Federal Territory forms part, will be affected by its .transfer to the Commonwealth.

The Committee are mite entitled to ask the honorable gentleman whether he has made inquiries as to the position of the three shires, and the extent to which they are indebted. If he has not that information, he should give an assurance that, before the Bill is finally dealt with, inquiries will be made, so as to prevent any injustice to either the people inside or the people outside. Unless the Government are prepared to give that assurance,  I  shall move the omission of this particular part dealing with Local Government Acts. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Hunter has permitted himself to get very heated, and to speak as though the intention of the Government was to permit injustice to be done. If the honorable member had taken the trouble to look at the Act in question, he would have seen that what  I  said was perfectly true, namely, that it does not at all interfere with existing liabilities. Where existing liabilities are interfered with, the honorable member may rest perfectly assured that evenhanded justice will be done. What  I  said by way of interjection was that when the upkeep of a shire or municipality is dependent on rates levied on the ratepayers, it is very obvious that, by so much as the area is lessened, the liabilities of the shire or municipality are decreased. I do not say for a moment that where there has been a loan raised, and the benefit of the money distributed unevenly, benefiting two-thirds of the ratepayers wholly, or much more than the other third, the remaining one-third shall, therefore, be saddled with a responsibility which ought to be distributed over the whole. Nothing of that sort will be permitted. Where there is any liability which should properly rest on those persons who, after the proclamation, will be citizens of the Commonwealth Territory, rather than ratepayers of the shire or municipality, the Commonwealth will see that they shoulder their fair share of the responsibility. </para>

                            <para>- I asked questions as to what compensation for buildings, and so on, we should have to pay. Under the Constitution, we get Crown lands free, and a difficulty arose as to what Crown lands there were. To settle the point, we specified certain things in paragraph 15 of the agreement, in respect of which the State was not to ask for payment. I remember I asked whether there were any court-houses or other buildings; and, though I forget <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade&#39;s</inline> exact words, he said, in effect, that there was nothing worth talking about involving compensation. There was never any question raised as to the liabilities of a municipality being thrown on the Commonwealth. I suggest that if there is any difficulty, the State Government ought to be consulted; and, no doubt, what appears to be fair will be done. The Lands Acquisition Act applies to the acquisition by the Commonwealth, for any puhlic purposes, of lands owned in the territory by any person. We may never take over any municipal property ; but if the functions of a municipality cease, some one will have to assume them, and if the State does so, it will have to pay. If a loan has been incurred on any properties, it will be a curious state of affairs if we have to pay for those properties, and also the debt; we cannot be expected to pay the liabilities as well as for the property. I think communications ought to be opened up with the State Government, in order to ascertain whether there is any debt, or portion cf a debt. </para>

The case put was that the municipalities within which the Territory is may have borrowed money ; and the question is who has to assume the liability - whether the Commonwealth has to assume it, which would be a most extraordinary state of affairs; or whether that proportion of the liability is to be thrown back on the municipality which borrowed the money <inline font-style="italic">e</inline></para>

                            <para>- I am talking about municipal loans raised on the rates, of that particular portion of Territory now being withdrawn from the municipalities, and the question is whether, as the rates would cease to be paid, the whole of the responsibility would be cast on the municipality that borrowed the money. If that be the state of affairs it is most unjust to the municipality. As the Attorney-General is going to look into the matter and obtain further information, I ask him also to consider whether it is advisable to repeal the Local Government Acts for the present, so far as they are applicable to the Territory. Would it not be sufficient to repeal them when we are introducing legislation for the government, local and otherwise, of the Territory ? The continuance of these Local Government Acts could be of no disadvantage in the mean - time. </para>

                        <para>. - No doubt I ought to have known that the memorandum referred to by the honorable member for Angas was in the Department, but I did not. However,  I  shall remedy that fault at the earliest possible moment, After all, this is a question of fact ; and I shall inquire to what precise extent these obligations, if any, exist, in order, by negotiation, and in every other way justice and effective administration necessitate, that justice may be done. No shirking of responsibility or liability of any sort or kind ought to be, or will be, permitted by the Commonwealth. The Acts mentioned in the schedule were singled out by him only after the most careful consideration. We might very well have omitted mention of this particular Act, because its place is insignificant by comparison with the Local Government Act itself. I can give the Committee my assurance that every care has been taken, and that, where there is anything inapplicable in other laws, it will be remedied by Ordinance. </para>

                            <para>- lt is now imposed by them for their particular purposes. After the proclamation it will go to us, and not to the State of New South Wales. The whole question arose of utilizing the Local Government Act. The land tax of the State is now carried on through the machinery of the local governing bodies. Income tax, stamp duties, and probate are all imposed and collectable for the purposes of New South Wales, and are not at all necessary for the purposes of the Commonwealth. We have thought it sufficient to rely on duties of Customs and Excise, and on land taxation, which, we think, are amply sufficient for our present purposes. Why should these people pay double? </para>

                        <para>. - There is more in the question raised by the honorable member for Maribyrnong than the Attorney-General has apprehended. Under this Bill the money derived from probate duties, under the New South Wales Act, will continue to be paid to the Government of New South Wales, but I understood that the whole scheme of the transfer was that the Territory for all purposes of taxation was to come under Federal control. What are we to get for this taxation? A very considerable part of the taxing power will still be exercised by the Government of New South Wales, because I understand that the probate duties afford a considerable amount of revenue. . </para>

                            <para>- Of course, it must, because the only authority for collecting it is the authority of a State Act, which requires that it shall be paid into the State Treasury. If that State Act is not- repealed, so far as the Territory is concerned, probate duties, collected in the Territory, will continue to be paid to the State Treasury. What are we to get for that? Our taxing power is to that extent diminished. </para>

If the whole Territory is to be managed and financed by the Federal Government, it will be rather one-sided to allow the New South Wales Government to step in and collect probate duties. &#34; When we take the Territory over, the New South Wales Government and people will have no further interest in it other than their intercourse with it. Why, then, should these duties be paid to the State of New South Wales any more than to the State of Tasmania ? </para>

                        (West Sydney- Acting Prime Minister, and Attorney-=General) &#91;5.59J. - Take, as an example, the Police Offences Act and the Crimes Act of New South Wales. We have no Commonwealth criminal code, and we must have the criminal laws of New South Wales applied to the Territory. &#39;We shall naturally utilize the New South Wales machinery to administer them. We could not now administer them at all, otherwise. So, in this case, there is machinery in New South Wales to determine the amount of the tax on the estates of deceased persons, and collect it. The money is gathered in by that machinery, which is an eminently convenient arrangement ; but I assure the honorable member that that is all the State Government will do. They will do the work, and we shall get the money.

                        <para>.- I am afraid that that statement is quite inconsistent with what the Attorney-General said before, and inconsistent with the Bill. The exception of that New South Wales Act from the repeal of all the other State taxation Acts can only mean that that Act remains in force in the Territory ; and the only effect of that is that all the inhabitants of the Territory will have to pay probate duty at death to the State of New South Wales. But an even more difficult question is raised. We are taking over a new Territory, and shall have to take over, in connexion with it, as a Federal Parliament, obligations which we have not got in regard to any other part of Australia. We have to take over, not only the ordinary&#34; Public Service, but the obligation of maintaining all the roads, bridges, and other public works, and continuing the administration of justice in the Territory ; because we cannot hope that the State of New South Wales will do all that work for nothing. In addition to the cost of the ordinary Federal services, the Government will have to provide for the local administration of the Territory. That must be financed. We have imposed Customs and Excise and land taxation over all Australia to provide for Federal expenditure, but the Government will have also to meet the expenditure which the local administration of the Territory will involve. No doubt, either by Ordinance or Act of  Parliament,  it will provide for taxation of a different kind to meet that expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, we have power to impose such taxation. Unless the Government are going to make the Territory a sort of sanctuary, wherein even&#39; one will be free from the payment of income tax, stamp and probate duties, and other taxation, all these matters will have to be provided for. I presume that the Government intend, first of all, that people within the Federal Territory shall be subject to the ordinary Federal taxation for Federal purposes, and that provision will also be made for financing the ordinary local administration by some form or forms of taxation. Why should we allow a particular portion of the taxation which belongs to New South Wales to remain within its control so far as this Territory is concerned? The Government will have to provide for an income tax and probate duties within the Territory, if such forms of taxation are to be included, and possibly a number of other methods of direct taxation, to meet the local expenditure which we shall have to undertake. The Minister should have come down with a statement showing how it is proposed to finance the local expenditure. We are making a very bad beginning by leaving New South Wales in  possession  of a large slice of the taxing power that we acquire in taking over the Territory. That is the position which the Attorney-General&#39; has not met. All the machinery for local; administration is being abolished, and I desire to know what the Government intend to do. Has the Minister in his mind any scheme to provide for the cost of keeping the roads in repair, the local administration of justice, and so forth? </para>

                            <para>- It will be affected by- the schedule. From the moment that this Bill receives the Royal assent, the whole of the machinery of local government in operation in the Territory will cease. The Government will have no provision for the maintenance of roads, or for the apprehension of malefactors if any should reside there. Action must be taken at once to make good these deficiencies, and I presume that the Government intend to provide for them by certain Ordinances. The point that I wish to emphasize is that whatever machinery is created by means of Ordinances will at once involve the Government in local expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. The Government ought simply to have provided for taking over the Territory, and have allowed the administration of justice and all matters relating to municipal government to continue under the existing laws until this Parliament could be asked to substitute other measures foi them. Had that course been followed, we should have had an opportunity to discuss a definite scheme, and, in the meantime, the Government would have had the use of their taxation power within the area to meet the wants of the local administration. I do not know what&#39; is the object of the Government in allowing this important part of the taxation power to go over to New South Wales, which will have no responsibility in connexion with the local administration of the Territory as soon as this measure becomes law. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has grasped the point that I wish to make. Since it has taken us more than a day to deal with a small Bill relating to 1,000 square miles of Territory, how long will it take us to pass measures relating to the whole of Australia when the Commonwealth Parliament supersedes the State Legislatures? After all, I do not think that there is much in the point that has just been discussed. Judging by what the honorable member for Melbourne Ports has said of the character of the country, it is hardly likely that any person dying there would leave any estate in respect of which probate duty could be collected. I trust, however, that the Minister will take this matter into careful consideration, and provide at once for the local government of the Territory and the administration of justice there. </para>

                        <para>. - Before - the Bill is reported, I should like the Government to promise to recommit it, in order that we may insert a provision to prevent the alienation of land within the Territory. When clause 10 was under consideration, I was induced to withdraw an amendment to that effect, because of the assurance of certain honorable members that the Seat of Government Act provided for the non-alienation of the lands of the Territory. I have since discovered that no such provision has been made. I take it that it is almost the unanimous opinion of this Parliament that the lands in the Federal Territory shall not be alienated, and we ought to have an opportunity to discuss the advisableness of inserting in this measure a provision to that effect. If the Government will give a promise in this regard, honorable members generally will be glad to have it. </para>

Our difficulty has been to find out what that policy .is.  1  wish to know whether it is intended to resume all the alienated land in the Territory. The clause should be more definite. The Commonwealth will spend some millions of pounds on public works in the Territory, and should profit by the increase in value which that will give to the land.

                            <para>- I have no desire to delay the passing of the measure, because the information can be subsequently supplied, and any necessary alteration made elsewhere. In the meantime I suggest that the honorable gentleman should consider the advisableness or otherwise of permitting the local government laws to remain in force until he introduces a Bill dealing with that matter. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro has asked me to make a request to the. Government. The Seat of Government Bill provides that the land taken over shall be so taken at its value on the  8th  October,  1908,  and there is a similar provision in regard to the acquisition of the Northern Territory. In the latter case, however, it is further provided that any improvements which have been made in the meantime shall be taken into account. </para>

                    <para class="block">After the debate on the Seat of Government Administration Bill, on which strong feeling was displayed owing to considerable division of opinion, it will probably be some relief to debate a measure which, so far as its object is concerned, has the support of every honorable member, whatever opinions may be entertained as to the method proposed. The Government do not regard the machinery provided in the Bill as the last word that can be said, and they invite discussion with a view to obtaining as perfect a measure as possible. Honorable members, I think, know what is sought to be obtained by the Bill, and the circumstances which have led to its introduction. The object is to afford protection to Australian children employed outside the Commonwealth, so far as it is possible for us to regulate a matter of the kind. The Bill deals with cases such as that brought under our notice a week or two ago by the honorable member for Perth, those to which I drew the attention of the House when discussing the honorable member&#39;s Bill, and also with the removal of aboriginal natives from Australia. The necessity for such protection as is proposed was shown very forcibly in the facts recently made known, particularly in the case of some children employed in opera troupes travelling in India and other parts of the East, and, further, in another case cited by the honorable member for Perth, in which an Australian child was taken by an Asiatic from her mother in Australia, though with her mother&#39;s consent, and is now being brought up  in  India under conditions which, I think, we all regret. If anything, the case of the opera children was even worse than that of the child I have just mentioned, as is shown in the conditions of their employment, and in letters written by the children, not with a view to being made public, but in order to inform their parents of the circumstances. There are, further, the facts brought out in the course of legal proceedings taken against a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rouse,</inline> who on witnessing one of the performances in India, felt that the conditions of the children&#39;s employment were so bad that he, as a British citizen, ought to interfere. He took the extreme step of practically kidnapping the children; and thereupon the proprietor of the troupe instituted the legal proceedings. When the case was heard, however, the Judge decided that the manager, owing to his treatment of the children, was not fitted to have charge of them, and dismissed the case with costs against him. It will be admitted on all hands that a repetition of this kind of treatment of Australian children should be prevented. The <inline font-style="italic">Ceylon Times</inline> of 9th April, in commenting quite temperately on this case, said that the affair raised in a striking manner the point &#34; whether the Australian authorities have sufficiently looked into the question of the. exportation of child performers,&#34; and added that we were &#34; not likely to be lax in the future.&#34; And I think the newspaper is perfectly justified in the latter remark. As soon as the facts of the cases - for there was not an isolated case - were brought under the notice of the Government, we took the earliest opportunity to deal with the matter. Of course, the children directly concerned were brought back to Australia, and the Government were glad to pay expenses and expedite their repatriation in every possible way. I take this opportunity to express the thanks of this Government and the people of Australia, to those gentlemen who interfered on behalf of the children, and to all concerned, including the members of the Indian Government, for the assistance they rendered. </para>

We all agree that we should do everything to prevent our children being treated in a similar way in the future. The only question is as to the best means, and on this, of course, there may be considerable difference of opinion. Undoubtedly the problem is not an easy one. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is much more difficult to regulate the employment of children outside than inside the Commonwealth, and we have to take what seem to be rather inefficient means of achieving our object. Although this Bill appears to do practically all that is possible, it does not give &#39; me complete satisfaction, and if honorable members can suggest ways of improving it the Government will be glad to consider and, if possible, to adopt them. One of the difficulties in dealing with the employment of children outside the Commonwealth is that we have to presume conditions - to predicate what is taking place or is likely to take place. People do not shout out from the housetops their motives or the conditions, under which they propose to employ persons. In those circumstances, all that we are able to do is to try to insure that in all cases where children are taken from the &#39; Commonwealth under contract the conditions of the contract shall be submitted to a responsible authority. We propose in the Bill that that authority shall be the Minister, and unless the conditions of contract appear to be proper we provide that the deportation of the children may be disallowed. There is a misprint in the interpretation clause in the definition of &#34;child.&#34; The Bill says, &#34; child means a child under the age of sixteen years.&#34; That should be eighteen years. The Government thinks sixteen years is too low. The means we propose to adopt to prevent, as far as possible, the employment of children outside the Commonwealth under conditions which are likely to be harmful are, first, to require that the contract shall be submitted to the Minister, and that no person shall be allowed to take out children without a permit. </para>

                            <para>- I shall be glad to discuss these details in Committee. Of course, in the middle of a busy session such as this it is somewhat difficult to draft a Bill which will effect everything that is desired. It is the intention of the Government that a permit shall not be granted unless the contract has been submitted and approved. If that is not clear in the Bill it will be made so. The same thing applies in the case of a child of European race or extraction. That means that no adult Asiatic shall be permitted to take a child of European race or extraction from Australia without -obtaining a permit. I do not think we should be justified in saying that under no conceivable circumstances shall an Asiatic take a European child out of the Commonwealth. That would be absurd, but we do say that an Asiatic shall not take a European child out of the Commonwealth without obtaining a permit and satisfying the Government that the child will be properly treated. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that the honorable member can suggest that there are no circumstances that would justify a European child accompanying an Asiatic. There would, of course, not be many cases and no permit will be granted except in cases where it is the proper thing that it should be&#39; done. The same applies to aboriginal natives. The aborigines of Australia ought not to be exploited by persons who merely wish to make money out of them. Our aborigines cannot possibly understand the conditions under which they will be employed outside the Commonwealth, or the experiences they are likely to undergo in a foreign country. They are not free agents, and we propose to take the part of guardians, and say that in no case shall an aboriginal native be taken from Australia without a permit, and then only under conditions that will insure his being properly treated. </para>

                            <para>- It is not &#34;easy to arrive at quite a satisfactory definition. I do not think that aboriginal natives have, up to the present, been taken from Australia in any great numbers, but I know that they have been taken sometimes, - and proposals frequently come along for taking out troupes of aborigines in order to show them in Europe. Quite recently I had to deal with an application for permission to take a number of Papuans and show them,, in connexion with the pageant of Empire, at the Coronation celebrations in London. I prohibited this being done, because I thought it wrong to remove a number of natives, born in the tropics and unaccustomed to clothing, straight away into a climate like that of London, merely for the sake of pleasing a crowd and making a London holiday, and, perhaps, without sufficient thought being given to the probable effects on the natives themselves. The next important provision is contained in clause 4, to the effect that a child shall be deemed to be under contract tq perform theatrical, operatic, or other work outside the Commonwealth if any agreement or arrangement exists between the child, or a parent, or guardian of the child, and any other person under which the child is to perform, or take part in the performance of any theatrical, operatic, or other work. That provision, perhaps, sounds loose, but there may be no formal contract- </para>

                            <para>- Yes, decidedly so. We ought to know the conditions under which any child is being taken away from the Commonwealth under contract or agreement. That is the only way in which we can begin to take Steps to prevent a repetition of the very deplorable cases that have already arisen. Clause 5 shows when an aboriginal native is deemed to be taken out of the Commonwealth, and clauses 6 and 7 provide for the granting of permits By the Minister or persons authorized by him. The&#39; next important clauses are those providing that, if the master of a ship has reason to suspect that a child under contract, or an aboriginal native, is being wrongfully taken away, or that a child of European race or extraction is -in charge of some adult person who is not df European race or extraction, he shall inform the officers of the fact, failing which he shall be liable to ai penalty. The succeeding clauses deal with the power of our officers to board ships, and to search any vessel or boat, and under them the master of a vessel is bound to facilitate a search by mustering the passengers and crew. Power is also given to officers to remove a child or aboriginal native from a vessel, and to restore it to the parents or guardian, or, in the event of the parents or guardian being considered undesirable, to the custody of a Commonwealth or State authority. It is also provided that the Department may require a person taking a child or aboriginal native out of Australia to enter into a bond, which may be forfeited in the event of the nonfulfilment of the conditions. That, in practice, may prove a very substantial and useful part of the Bill. I do not say that cases will not arise in which these provisions will be evaded, and that children from Australia may not possibly be subjected to conditions different from those under which they would be employed if they remained here. But we are at least making an attempt to remove an existing evil, and if we did not do so, our neglect would stand to our everlasting disgrace. I do not think it likely that there will be any lengthy debate on this motion, for every honorable member is in sympathy with the object of the Bill. My desire is that it shall be taken into Committee as soon as possible, so that any provision which may seem to be impracticable may be discussed and improved. I submit this measure with confidence to the House. </para>

                        <para>.- I was not aware until I entered the chamber this evening that the Government proposed to submit this Bill to-night, and I have not had an opportunity to consider its provisions in detail. I cannot say, however, that the matter is altogether new to me, because whilst I was administering the Department of External Affairs the necessity for some such regulatory measure was brought under my notice, and the whole question was being inquired into at the close of last session. The honorable member for Perth is deserving of the thanks of the community for having first raised this question, and also because of the care which he exercised in making a personal investigation of the facts, in order to bring home to the Department the seriousness of&#34; a case which had come under his attention, lt was at his request that inquiries were made from the Indian Government, and&#39; the information elicited revealed the absolute necessity for some measure to safeguard the interests of Australian-bom&#34;- children who were taken beyond the boundaries of the Commonwealth. This Bill deals with three classes of cases. First of all, it deals with those of children under the age of eighteen years who are taken beyond Australia to earn money for parents or guardians who, as a rule, remain in the Commonwealth. We know, from the actual facts, that children are taken out of Australia without the exercise of any safeguards, and that they are subjected to conditions entirely beyond their control. The Commonwealth Parliament has no power to legislate for the whole world, and does not desire to attempt to arrogate to itself such <inline font-style="italic">n.</inline> right ; but we have the power to regulate the conditions of those who reside here. lt is proposed under this Bill to safeguard the interests of those who leave Australia at an early age, when they could hardly be expected to understand the conditions <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> employment under which they are engaged to go abroad. Some safeguard is necessary to prevent their being subjected to conditions such as we would not tolerate in Australia. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> of clause 3, which deals with that class, must meet with our approval, bub-clause <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> deals with the case of children of European race or extraction who are taken beyond Australia under the &#163;are or charge of some adult person, who  3S  not of European race or extraction. That -provision will apply to the general class of cases brought under our notice by the honorable member for Perth. There is urgent need for such legislation. I am glad that the Minister has also taken power to deal with aboriginal natives, although the extent to which it conflicts with the power of control which is left to the States, under the Constitution, is a matter for consideration. </para>

                            <para>- I was about to mention that fact. Under the Constitution, aborigines are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the States, and we are debarred from legislating with respect to them. We have full control, however, over emigration and immigration. It is quite possible to reconcile those powers and leave to the Commonwealth the power to legislate with respect to aborigines leaving Australia. It will be gratifying to Australians to learn that the Commonwealth Parliament looks upon the aborigines of Australia as deserving of the special care and consideration of the people, and I am inclined to the opinion that their general control should be vested in the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- The example set by the Government of Queensland in the treatment of aborigines might well be followed by every humane and Christian community. The aboriginal natives of Australia are scattered over the whole of the northern portion of the continent, from Western Australia to Queensland; and they are subjected to three different jurisdictions; but, as time advances, we shall have a larger and larger shipping trade in the northern ports, and uniform control will become more necessary. The information I &#34;Gave from those who are working amongst the aborigines inclines me to the opinion that it would be better if some form of Commonwealth control over them were adopted. The power taken under this Bill to deal with them is most essential. I think, however, it will be necessary to insert in the Bill a clause relating to the production of contracts, a precedent for which will be found in the Contract Immigrants Act. Under that Act, a copy of every contract under which an immigrant is being brought to Australia must be filed with the application to the Department, and I think it would be well to require, in all cases where a permit is sought to take children to serve outside Australia, that an absolute copy of the contract, giving the full conditions under which the child is to be employed, shall be filed. </para>

In that way alone will it be possible for the Minister to ascertain the terms of the contract. Whether the Bill is wide enough, I am not prepared to say until I have had an opportunity to further examine it, but inasmuch as it emphasizes the growing feeling as to the responsibility of the nation for its child life it meets with my hearty approval. We are beginning to realize more and more, in connexion with our social legislation, that the nation owes a duty to child life, and that there are growing up what may be called child rights, which are just as worthy of regard as are any other. Our young life is going to be the future manhood and womanhood of Australia, and the more attention we pay to the conditions which regulate its growth and development, the better it will be for the nation. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister is to be heartily congratulated on the expedition with which he has redeemed the promise that he gave me to introduce, before the close of the session, a measure to take the place of that which, at his suggestion, I withdrew. I am glad to realize that this is one of the few measures that have come before the House which is likely to be discussed apart from party considerations. The result should be such as to secure the object aimed at, although the achievement of that object in all respects may be somewhat difficult. I cannot, however, help expressing a feeling of disappointment with this measure. When I withdrew the Bill that I introduced, I understood that the Minister would substitute proposals more drastic and far reaching. It appears to me, however, that the reasons for asking for the withdrawal of my measure are not quite apparent in this. It undoubtedly provides for the protection of children proposed to be taken out of the Commonwealth to take part in operatic or theatrical entertainments, but I fail to see why the Bill which I  submitted could not have been amended in that direction. The measure, compared with that which I introduced, fails in an important respect, in that it does not instruct the Minister as to the conditions which must be observed before a permit is issued. I have given n. good deal of thought to this matter, and the more I study it the less inclined I am to err on the side of moderation. We cannot express our views too strongly, nor make the law too drastic, for the welfare of Australian children. </para>

                    <para>The clauses which have been drafted to prevent the emigration of children from Australia under contract to take part in theatrical performances, or to do other work, are very weak indeed. There will be great difficulty in proving the existence of a contract, especially when it is proposed to take children away with the connivance and for the pecuniary advantage of parents. Girls, who, although they had reached physical womanhood, were mentally children, have been allowed by their parents to leave the country under imperfect oversight, for purely monetary considerations; and we cannot avoid the conclusion that those parents grossly failed in their duty, and that the State must exercise its powers of <inline font-style="italic">parens patria,</inline> and give such children the protection which they need. At a meeting of a ladies&#39; organization in this city, the Government was congratulated on the legislation which it proposes, and an earnest appeal was made to parents to &#34; safeguard the moral welfare of their girls by absolutely refusing, so far as they have it in their power, to allow them to go to India with such associations, and exposed to such alarming temptations and perils,&#34; and the co-operation of other women&#39;s societies was invited. Those ladies have shown the weakness of the Government&#39;s position. There will be the utmost difficulty in many cases in proving the existence of a contract. Where parents are agreeable, a hundred reasons may be given in place of the real one. It may be said that the children are to be taken to Europe to complete their musical education. </para>

                            <para>- I intend to move an amendment in Committee which I think will go a long way to meet the difficulty. I propose to amend paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of subclause  1  of clause 3 so as to require a permit in the. case of every child who is taken out of Australia by any one other than its parents. I do not think that that proposal goes too far, though I fancy that I hear some expressions of dissent. When a child who is not in charge of its parents is proposed to be taken out of Australia, the Government are justified in inquiring whether the emigration will be for its welfare. </para>

Surely we cannot do wrong in applying to all children in Australia a provision which safeguards the propertied child in England ? </para>

A child might very well be taken to other lands where its f future life would be seriously affected. We can go as far here as has been gone in England. The Minister in criticising my measure pointed out a defect which he has not remedied. He showed quite correctly that my Bill would not remedy a case such as that which I brought under his notice, in which a child born of white parents, with an alleged Asiatic step-father, was taken to India, and converted to Mahommedanism, being educated and reared as a native of that country. </para>

I should not try to prevent an adult from changing his religion as often as he wished to do so, but children who have not reached years of discretion should not be forced into an alien religion. There are many cases in which women have formed a connexion with Asiatics, and when they have children by former marriages, they should not be permitted, under the domination of the alien step-fathers, to send them out of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I repeat that I intend to move the insertion of a sub-clause containing specific directions as to the conditions to be observed in the issuing, of permits. The Minister or authorized officer should be satisfied that children proposed to be taken from Australia by irresponsible white persons, will not be subjected to conditions likely to be detrimental to their welfare. We shall be able, by the insertion of my proposed amendment, to secure to a certainty all the Minister aims at in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> which, I am afraid, goes no further than a pious intention. As to the second condition, when it is proposed to take away a child of European birth by, or at the instigation of, any person other than of European race, I desire to secure that the Minister shall be satisfied before a permit is given that the child will not be committed to an alien life. That has undoubtedly happened in the case which I brought under the notice of the Department - a case which of itself, even if no other were likely to &#39;arise, would thoroughly justify my attitude. In that case, a little girl six or seven years of age was taken out of Australia by an Asiatic neither kith nor kin to her. She was taken a long sea voyage, and subsequently a long railway journey in India, by this man; and the thought of it is enough to make any parent&#39;s blood boil. Further, this man has committed the child to the &#34;care&#34; - Heaven save the mark ! - of his own people to be brought up in the faith of lslam. From the report of the Indian Government it appears tha t_ the people to whom the child has been committed are very poor and of low caste, and that her environment is such as to justify the Minister in taking steps to recover her. The honorable gentleman has given me a promise to that end, and I hope that by this time something has been done. I trust that the amendments I have foreshadowed will be accepted ; and I contend that we can hardly err in safeguarding the rights of Australian children in this respect. I do not propose, nor do I believe the Minister proposes, to do anything to prevent the legitimate transfer of children from Australia to conditions that are not in any way detrimental to their welfare. Wherever it can be shown that the conditions will not be detrimental, there will be no difficulty in obtaining a permit ; but in all cases there is a duty on the Government to see that, at any rate, the interests of the children are reasonably safeguarded. </para>

                        <para>.- I take this opportunity to thank the ex-Minister and present Minister, and officers of the Department of External Affairs, for their prompt action in regard to the particular opera company whose circumstances have been brought under notice. It is a pleasure to address oneself to a Bill that really represents the desire of the whole House. Had a measure of this kind been in existence, the operatic manager responsible for the misfortunes of the children would not have been able to escape proper punishment. The one case mentioned by the honorable member for Perth is sufficient to stimulate us to prompt measures; but we must be careful not to go too far. At first hearing, I have an idea &#39;that the amendments suggested by the honorable member may, perhaps, somewhat tie the hands of the Government; but, in any case, this point can be considered in Committee. I am delighted at all times - and I know that in saying this I voice the opinion of every member - to take part in any effort to safeguard or rescue the child life of Australia. The Commonwealth, unlike any other country in the world, has granted pensions to the old throughout the length and breadth of the land, and has endowed each human being with the rights of citizenship; but the importance of taking care of the old-age pensioners, important as they are, is small in comparison with the importance of taking care of the children in view of their great potentialities. I trust that this Bill is only the forerunner of further legislation of a more comprehensive character embracing every child in Australia. I am quite in agreement with the suggestion which has been made by the honorable member for Darling Downs, and which, I hope, will be carried into effect in Committee, so that no aborigines may find themselves in the unfortunate position of those children in India. I have always regretted that a representative band of Australian aborigines has not visited Europe, and I have still hope that some such company as I saw display their intelligence and power of tracking in Melbourne may find its way to the Old Country, where, I am sure, they would rival in attraction Buffalo Bill&#39;s Wild West Show. From my reading of the Bill, I am glad to see that there is nothing to prevent such an enterprise being carried out under proper conditions. As I say, I thoroughly indorse this measure, even if it only helps a few, in the hope that it will be followed by further legislation designed to render the safekeeping of every Australian child a sacred trust. </para>

                        <para>. - This Bill heartily commends itself to me as a measure of justifiable interference in the interests of the weakest of the community. Such legislation is not only justifiable here, but in the older parts of the world, where the authorities are less prone to interfere in such matters. In England, if it were not for the pressure of legislative work, there would be a similar law, but probably going much further, so as to embrace what is known as the &#34; White-slave traffic,&#34; which is claiming the attention of humane people all over the world. I had hoped, when I heard df this Bill, that its scope would be such as to prevent the introduction of that traffic into Australia. I do not know of cases personally, but I have seen reports of experts at Home, stating that New Zealand and Australian girls have been decoyed by bogus contracts, theatrical and otherwise, to Buenos Ayres, Johannesburg, and Paris. I hope the Ministry will see their way to make this Bill more restrictive, so as to stop any person, under any circumstances, from taking persons away under any contract, verbal or otherwise, in such circumstances as I have indicated. </para>

When I was Minister of Education in the State Government of Victoria, similar contracts were brought within my knowledge in the course of my official duties. There is a State law which compels all people who engage children in any avocation to have them properly educated if they are under school age or have not passed the standard. This law, of course, means that all contracts are submitted to the Minister ; and engagements with the opera manager mentioned, or one of the same name, were made the subject of very careful scrutiny by the State Department. During my term of office I had interviews with parents who had signed agreements, and who, I am sure, had not the remotest idea of what those agreements meant to their children. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that in some cases that was so ; but, either from self-interest or an awakening of proper parental feeling, some of them desired to have the contracts cancelled. I always used my utmost endeavours and exerted all my influence with the people who run these companies to secure the freedom of those who had entered into these contracts, but we have recently been faced with an added danger in the fact that these children having been taken to other parts of the world have there fallen upon very grievous times. It would be well to make this measure as far reaching a,s possible. I agree with the Minister that the case brought under notice by the honorable member for North Sydney will be met under the clause which provides for a contract being defined as any agreement or arrangement to perform any work. I feel that there are a large number of young people who from time to time are leaving Australia under contract to enter upon some business arrangement, but who have little or no knowledge of what that contract really means. I agree with the honorable member for Darling Downs that all these contracts should be filed in the office of the Minister of External Affairs, and I hope the Minister will take care to have that matter dealt with. The Department should have complete control of all these engagements entered into by young citizens of the Commonwealth. We owe a duty to these young citizens. It is our business not only to protect them while they are here, but, if we find they are going away, to take the place of the all too-careless parents or guardians by seeing that they have some idea of the business they are going to undertake. </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to add my congratulations to those already offered to the Minister and the Government for introducing this measure, and to express my appreciation of the work that has been done in this very laudable direction by the honorable member for Perth. I think the House is unanimous in its desire not only to protect the young life growing up in the community, but also to see that it is not expatriated from Australia under conditions tending to its degradation. I am personally acquainted with the efforts made by the honorable member for Perth to unearth the case that he Has referred to. The parent of the child in question lived in one of the northern districts of Victoria, and the honorable member, after gaining some knowledge of what&#39; had taken place through the medium of the Western Australian press, took the first opportunity of visiting the district and thoroughly investigating the matter. The result was the measure which he circulated earlier this session. I believe the clause dealing with contracts is a broad one and covers not only theatrical, but other occupations. It should be broad. So far we have devoted the whole of our attention to seeing that only a desirable class of people enter Australia. It is time that we took action to prevent desirable young life being taken out of the Commonwealth un3er unfavorable conditions. That phase of the question has been brought under the notice of the House by the honorable member for Perth, and the Government are to be congratulated upon having so speedily introduced a measure dealing with it. I have very much pleasure in extending a hearty support to the Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- Is the Minister satisfied with the definition of &#34;aboriginal native&#34;? I think in the Sugar Bounties Act 1906, the term &#34; half-caste &#34; is used and defined. It is very difficult for a Minister to decide the preponderance of blood in any person. </para>

If the Minister thinks it is necessary to reconsider the definition and put it right, even in another place, I shall be satisfied, but I do not think he can be altogether satisfied with it as it stands. It might be improved by adding the words &#34;and includes any half-caste.&#34; </para>

                        <para>.- These definitions run through several Acts. I think. I was asked last year, when the Electoral </para>

The general interpretation given is that the preponderance of blood determines the question. It would be just as well before a final alteration is made in this case to consult the drafting department, so that there may be no difference of interpretation in this measure from that of other Acts. If we put in the words &#34; and includes a halfcaste,&#34; what will be the definition of aboriginal native? It will be necessary to get a definition of half-caste, which may be a quarter or an eighth caste, or such a caste as would require a cast in the eye to see it. I am against what may be called myopia in these matters of correct interpretation. </para>

                    <para class="block">The first paragraph of my amendment embodies my contention that the proposal of the Government is not sufficient to protect children who may be taken out of the Commonwealth to take part in theatrical or other work. In nearly every case, the difficulty of ascertaining the existence of  a  contract will be sufficient, in my opinion, to nullify the effect of the clause as it stands. It is the duty of the State to investigate every case in which it is proposed that a child shall be taken out of the Commonwealth by persons other than its parents. I admit at once that many <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> cases would occur, but that fact affords no sufficient reason why we should not legislate to prevent possible outrages on children. We can readily conceive of cases in which children might be taken out of the Commonwealth by persons other than their parents for a reason that would not bear investigation. My amendment would undoubtedly strengthen the measure, whilst it would create no hardship. If, for instance, a relative wished to take a child out of Australia for a holiday, there would be no difficulty in obtaining the necessary permit. I would remind the Minister that it is customary, in some countries, to require a person who is going abroad to obtain a permit, or, in other words, a passport. I do not wish to provide for a passport in all these cases ; but I do ask for that which will protect children from being taken away if their welfare is threatened. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret that I cannot accept the amendment. I. recognise the object at which the honorable member is aiming, but fear that the amendment would carry us further than is necessary. Where there was no agreement or contract to work, there would be no justification for the Department stepping in and preventing the children of white parents leaving the Commonwealth in the company of a parent or relative. How would it be possible for us, in the absence of an agreement or contract, to refuse a permit? We must have some kind of suspicion upon which to take action. </para>

                            <para>- The amendment would not improve the position in that respect. In the case of a verbal contract, the Minister would know nothing of it, and  would have to grant a permit, as a matter of course. The Minister ought only to have the right to prevent a child being taken out of the Commonwealth where there is reason to believe that it is being taken out under a contract or arrangement which ought not to be made. Under this Bill, as it stands, the Minister has a right in every such case to interfere, and, that being so, I hope the amendment will not be pressed. If it were carried, the result would be that the officers of the Department would be called upon every day to grant permits, and, ultimately, they would be issued as a matter of course. </para>

                        <para>. - I join in the commendation of the zeal displayed by (he honorable member for Perth in this matter; but I think that we ought not to impose upon personal liberty restrictions that are not justified. Bit by bit, we are cutting down the liberty of the individual, until a man will not know where he is. The principle of this Bill is that a man who is a suspect shall not take a child out of the Commonwealth ; but if this amendment be carried, it will alter the whole character of the measure.&#39; In the case of every child being taken out of the Commonwealth, perhaps, on a holiday voyage, it would be necessary to obtain a permit. If such a provision be inserted, people will be fettered and bound in every way. lt would gradually reflect on the character of our people, and I am sure that the honorable member would be the last to intend such results. Therefore, I hope that he will not press an amendment which does not seem necessary to give effect to the. policy of the measure, and violates what should be an underlying principle of legislation, that the remedy must be proportionate to the acknowledged disease. The amendment seems to go beyond all bounds, and is not in keeping with the Bill, which is based on the supposition that something is wrong. An uncle who takes a child of seventeen out of Australia should not be looked upon as if he were the wicked uncle of the &#34; Babes in the Wood,&#34; when he may be merely obeying a natural instinct. </para>

                        <para>.- I drafted the amendment on the understanding that the word &#34; child &#34; would mean a child under the age of sixteen years, and still think that we should be justified in requiring a statement of intention from any person other than a parent who proposed to take such a child out of Australia. I fail to see that the provision would impose hardship on relatives taking children to New Zealand for a holiday, because all that it would be necessary for them to do would be to state their intentions to an officer of the Department of External Affairs, and to obtain a sort of passport, such documents being in common use in countries quite as highly civilized as our own. However, I do not wish to put honorable members in a false position, and, with the Government, and some of the legal luminaries of the Opposition .against me, I see no chance of carrying my amendment. Therefore, I ask leave to withdraw paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> though I must insist on paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b.</inline> The intention is to require the Department to consider the granting of permits to women, the mothers of children, whose fathers were white, who are being taken out of the country under the domination of Asiatic step-fathers, or Asiatics with whom stepmothers have formed an irregular connexion. I propose that the Minister should not allow the emigration of such children unless he is satisfied that they are not being taken to an alien condition of life, that is, a condition of life alien to persons of European races, a phrase used in my measure which ran die gauntlet of the criticism of those who assisted me with their legal knowledge in its drafting. </para>

                            <para>- That cannot be done under ordinary circumstances, but there are many cases in which a child is taken from its mother and cared for by the State. 1  think that the Minister sympathizes with my object. The case which I have already brought under notice justifies inquiry by the Government, and the prohibition of emigration where there is the least doubt concerning the child&#39;s welfare. It must be remembered that the child is helpless. I trust that the Government will recognise the need for the latter portion of the amendment. </para>

                        <para>. -I sympathize with the object of the honorable member for Perth, and have already given a great deal of thought to this matter in consultation with one of the Crown Law Officers. The position of the child of a woman living a depraved life, who is about to be taken out of Australia to an even worse environment, calls for sympathy, but is difficult to remedy by law. The conditions of child life in Australia are under the control of the States. The Commonwealth cannot interfere to prevent the continuance in Australia of what it is being asked to prevent abroad by prohibiting emigration. A child in Australia, living with its mother in the company of Asiatics, would be in nearly as bad a position as if in India, but the Commonwealth could not interfere. In such a case as has been referred to, if an appeal were made to the State authorities, they could do nothing, because the mother was feeding, clothing, and providing a home for the child. </para>

                        <para>.- Those who oppose the amendment are, considering more the rights of the mother, while I am regarding the rights of the child. I am somewhat surprised at the attitude of the Minister, because it was, to a certain extent, on account of the objection he raised to the corresponding clause in my Bill that I withdrew it in the hope of some improvement by the Government. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister pointed out that the clause as it stood was a defect in my measure, and I was quite content to withdraw it so that it might be amended. We are showing considerable hesitation in grasping a nettle that will have to be seized sooner or later  -  I mean marriages between white women and Asiatics, which we have too much of in Australia. I do not look at this matter from any narrow, bigoted point of view as a member of a superior race. I am well enough acquainted with the history of the races of the world to recognise that even amongst the so-called inferior peoples there are many points we ought to admire and imitate. But my reading and observation point to nothing but deterioration when the East and the West come together; and the case I have cited is more than justification for the amendment. The Minister reminds us that this woman has formed a respectable connexion with a respectable Asiatic. The man may be quite respectable from his own standpoint; but the fact remains that he has made an irregular alliance with this woman, having entered into a Mahom- medan contract of marriage with her, before some Mahommedan resident in this city; although he has a native wife living in India. In this way he obtained control of the White Australian child whom he has taken to his own country. </para>

I am certain that no Minister would use the power proposed, except in cases where he was absolutely certain that the father or mother was mentally or morally unfit to safeguard the child&#39;s interests - that it would be put into use only in such extreme cases as have been cited. I am sure that the Minister is in full sympathy with the desire of the honorable member for Perth.

                            <para>- The Minister will have to do it. The provision that the child shall not be committed to an alien life, applies more particularly to such cases as I have already indicated, where it is frankly and openly proposed by an alien, who has formed a connexion with a white woman in this country, to take the child of that woman by her previous white husband to his country, there to bring it up amongst his own people and apostatize it to his own faith. That is a state of affairs clearly alien to the life of an Australian child; and if that is shown, it ought to prevent the granting of a permit. Some kind of instruction is necessary to the Minister who has to administer this measure. A large amount of discretionary power will be left to him, even with this amendment; but, as the Bill stands, it is all discretion and no instruction, in circumstances where a very definite limitation is absolutely necessary. </para>

If half-castes are engaged in maritime pursuits, this amendment would prevent them from entering into engagements for more than twelve months. I agree with the honorable member for Perth that in the case of a full-blooded aboriginal native there should be some obligation to return him to the district from which he is taken. There should be a limitation of time, with a proviso that in exceptional cases the Minister shall have the right to extend the term. </para>

                        <para>.- No doubt this clause will be very effective in administration, but I question the desirableness of giving to officers the very large powers for which it provides without providing for some control over them. This clause will enable an officer pf the Department of Trade and Customs, at his own sweet will, to board any vessel. That is all very well. There cannot be much harm in an officer asking for facilities to board, &#39; or to search, a vessel, but I think we are going too far in giving an officer power to call upon the master of a vessel to muster his crew and passengers in order that they may be inspected. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence to endeavour to expedite the settlement of the question relating to the Toowoomba rifle range. I have shown him a reply which I received to a request made to the Department in this matter. For some years efforts have been made to obtain a suitable site for a rifle range at Toowoomba, but difficulties have been raised by the State authorities, and now difficulty is being experienced in connexion with the police authorities. The range at present is so defective that rifle practice cannot be properly carried out. That condition of affairs has prevailed for the last four or five years, and I therefore ask the Minister to press this matter on the State authorities with a view to obtaining a solution of the difficulty. The matter is exceedingly urgent, otherwise I should not have brought it before the House. </para>
