As this is probably the last sitting which I shall be able to attend before I take my departure, I desire to state the business which the Government think is urgent and ought to be transacted this session. All of the measures on the notice-paper are important, and the Government are of opinion that their consideration will not occupy very much time. With the exception of the contentious measure now under discussion, they include the Sugar Bounty Bill, the Excise (Sugar) Bill, the Constitution Alteration (Legislative Powers) Bill, the Defence Bill, and a small Naval Defence Bill, which accords with the views of both parties, and is, therefore, not contentious. </para>

The list of measures also includes the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, the Lighthouses Bill, the  Patents,  Trade Marks, and Designs Bill, and the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill. There is a number of other small Bills which the Government would like to bring forward- I refer to a Judiciary Bill, a Tariff Anomalies Bill,  a  Penny Postage Bill, and an Oil Bounty Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Oh, yes. These are small Bills. The Navigation Bill has been before the Parliament for six years. I am sure that honorable members on both sides recognise it is a non-contentious measure. We shall be very pleased if it passes safely through the Senate and reaches this House before the Parliament is prorogued. I should be very glad indeed to see the Bill put through both Houses this session. For the most part, these are small measures, and I venture to say that when honorable members opposite come to see and deal with them they will find that they can be disposed of in a very short time. Experienced Parliamentarians know that immediately the end of the session is in sight an enormous amount of work can be speedily dealt with, and I feel sure that that will be our experience this year. During my absence, my duties will fall upon the Attorney-General, and may I ask honorable members of both Houses to extend to him the consideration and courtesy that they have been good enough to show me. I thank the Opposition, and honorable members generally, for the uniform courtesy and kindness which they have invariably extended to me during my term of office. </para>

                    <para>.- The Prime Minister's opening remarks were naturally somewhat personal, and, therefore, I at once take the opportunity, on behalf of the Opposition, of wishing him <inline font-style="italic">bon voyage,</inline> and a very beneficial result from the interval he will enjoy before resuming his labours here. At the same time, let me say that we desire that this Parliament shall be associated with the message of congratulation that he will convey to the people of South Africa upon having attained in the councils of the Empire a position of authority equal to that already enjoyed by ourselves and by the other Dominions. We trust that he will also express our confidence in the future of that great country. Having regard to recent events, happily concluded by the union of all its Provinces, which have probably passed through a greater variety of grave dangers, during the lifetime of our  cwn Commonwealth, than any other part of the earth's surface under the British flag, we trust that their new record may be one of unbroken peace and prosperity. We both anticipate and pray for them such a development as shall assist us to insure permanent peace to the Empire, based upon the closest union of all its races and Dominions, and guarantee their advance upon the high road of progress as one people. We, with difficulties of quite a minor character compared with theirs, encountering only political antagonisms or the misunderstandings and trials necessarily associated with the settlement of a new country, cannot, without much reflection, appreciate all that has been accomplished in that new Dominion. But that gives us great hope for its future. We may congratulate ourselves upon the fact that the coming Conference of the Empire will no longer be hampered by the inclusion of separate sets of representatives from each South African Province. Next year, for the first time, the whole of the self-governing peoples of the Empire will meet as Dominions in the Mother Country. It is needless to add more, except that I trust the Prime Minister will convey to the people of South Africa, in his own effective manner, an assurance that this is no expression of mere lip friendship, but a simple and sincere welcome into the home circle. We regard them as brothers, as joint heritors with us, of the Empire of which we are devoutly proud, and as a permanent pillar in its support. We look forward to the manifold tasks of civilization in that Dark Continent being enormously furthered by the union of the white peoples making that vast territory their habitation which offers magnificent opportunities for the fruitful labour of those who are, or will become, sons of the soil. </para>

                    <para>.  - I regret that the Treasurer has not given us a little more information in regard to this Bill and the finances generally. It has always been the practice for the Treasurer in introducing a Supply Bill to take the Committee into his confidence, to speak of the revenue prospects, to intimate what revenue has been received, and to compare the returns with those anticipated when the Budget statement was delivered. The honorable gentleman, however, seems to have ignored all precedents. He merely threw the Bill upon the table, and saying, " There is nothing new in it," moved a resolution. That is neither convenient nor customary. I wish also to complain that no opportunity has been given to the House to discuss the Budget statement delivered by the Treasurer a month ago, as well as the papers then submitted for our consideration. Ours must be a very contented House. The whole financial position of the country was placed before us in the Budget statement, the debate on which was adjourned a month ago, and we have not yet had an opportunity to make any reference to it. Would the Treasurer expect such treatment from the Government if he were in Opposition? I think that we have been treated very cavalierly - I was going to say contemptuously </para>

                        <para>- I wish that the honorable member would not make irrelevant interjections. The consideration of the Budget is one thing and the discussion of a temporary Supply Bill is quite another. I have waited for a month to speak on the Budget, but no opportunity has yet presented itself. Having regard to the fact that the Prime Minister is leaving <inline font-style="italic">to-morrow,</inline> and to the other business that remains to be considered, I do not propose to-night to deal with the general finances of the country, and will reserve any remarks I may have to make until the debate on the Budget is resumed. By that time, no doubt, we shall have forgotten the speech made by the Treasurer, and will have to turn to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to refresh our memories. The debate upon the Budget ought to be initiated within two or three days of its delivery. That is the universal practice which should have been followed. I protest against the Treasurer throwing the Budget on the table of the House, and a month after affording honorable members an  opportunity to discuss it, and then only under cover of a motion for the granting of temporary Supply. There is one question which I have waited, an opportunity to discuss, and upon which I cannot postpone my remarks any longer. I refer to the projected Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. The sum of .£5,000 has been placed upon the Estimates in this connexion : but we have not been told the way in which even this small sum is to be expended. </para>

                        <para>- That statement is absolutely reckless and inaccurate. The Labour party are now in power and they are doing nothing. Its members are like "dumb driven cattle." The Government are not treating the country fairly by placing the small sum of ,£5,000 upon the Estimates in connexion with this important project. That money is really not required for any preliminary .purpose. A proper survey from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta has already been made,- and plans and estimates of the work have been obtained. We have sufficient information upon which to let a contract for the construction of the line, and yet we are now told that an expenditure of. .£5,000 is necessary upon preliminary work. I wish to know exactly what the Government intend to do. We have been told by the Minister of Home Affairs that this ,£5,000 is required to defray the cost of preparing plans prior to the introduction next year of a measure authorizing the construction of the railway. But we have never had that statement authoritatively made by the head of the Government. For the Government to place on the Estimates the small .sum of £[5,000, with a foot-note setting out that the estimated cost of the work is ,£3,988,000, is unprecedented. They are not dealing with the matter in a practical way. </para>

                        <para>- Why has the Bill not been introduced this session? Is all the "stuff" which appears upon the business-paper more important than is this great project? If Ministers think so, why do they not say so? No reason has been assigned by the Government for this unwarrantable delay. If the work be a desirable one, why should its initiation be delayed, I have a right to ask that question. There must be some reason for delaying the undertaking for a period of twelve months. The Northern Territory Acceptance Bill has been submitted for the approval of Parliament. There has been no delay in regard to the proposed transfer of that Territory. Why, then, should the construction of the transcontinental railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, which was the crucial question of the general elections in Western Australia, be retarded ? The representatives of the Labour party told the electors of that State that, if they were returned to power, they would build that railway, and that, if the party with which I am associated were retained in office, it would not be built. </para>

                        <para>- It was not. The honorable member is absolutely in error in that statement. We did secure approval of the vote for £20,000 for that survey. We also provided for the construction of the line in connexion with the agreement for the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth, thus affording the South Australian Parliament an opportunity of redeeming the promise which was made on its behalf immediately prior to the advent of Federation. But I do not wish to touch upon that question, because I might say something which would not help me. If a railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta will be a good project next year, it must be an equally good project now. Next year the finances will not be in a better position than they are at the present time. Nor will the season next year be better than is the present season. </para>

                        <para>- I never said anything of the kind. It seems to me that delay is a favorite device of persons who have not decided what they are going to do. I have been accustomed to that class of politician. They say, " Let us put it off till to-morrow, because we do not know what to-morrow will bring forth. Let us promise to do it next year, and when next year comes we can say that we fully intended to do it, but something has happened in the meantime, and we do not feel able to do it until the following year." In regard to a great project like this, which affects the whole of Australia, and is bound up with the federation of the States, it is absolutely wicked that all these years should have been allowed to go by without the railway being begun. It is still more wicked that now we have the opportunity of doing the work, having this year  £4,000,000  of revenue more than we had last year, the matter should be delayed by them for another year. It is simply trifling with the matter, and not worthy of a progressive or enterprising Government. We have heard a great deal from honorable members opposite about the work. They made it their one cry. They said, " The party who were opposed to us have not done this work. Put us into power, and we will do it." They have been put into power, and we find that the work is not to be done now, but is to be put off until next year. I cannot understand this trifling, this indecision, this want of enterprise. One would have thought that they would seize the opportunity to associate their names with something that is useful to the country, instead of which they are associating their names with drastic legislation, which is imposing burdens upon people, annoying and disturbing everybody, doing no good, and not connecting their administration with any enterprising work. It is not statesmanship or enterprise to put off till next year what ought to be done at once. It would have been done at once if the electors had kept us in power. We should not have come down to the House, and said, " We expect to get only £1,000,000 from the land tax," if we knew that we would get over £2,000,000 from that source. I am very disappointed with the action of the Government in delaying this great project for no purpose or reason whatever. I am surprised that' the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, and also the honorable member fpr Coolgardie, should allow this to take place. The members of the Labour party who represent Western Australia in this Parliament have gone all over the country times out of number promising what they would do, and all we now get in fulfilment of those promises is the assurance that something will be done next year. Many things may happen between this and next year, and the Government may then say that they are not able to carry out what they fully intended to do at this date. The policy of the Government in this matter involves an unnecessary delay, wastes time, loses a good opportunity, does no good to any one, and is not likely to bring credit upon those associated with it. The Government have lost an opportunity of showing the people of Western Australia that they intended to fulfil the promise which was dangled before the eyes of the people to induce them to enter Federation, and has been dangled before their eyes by the Labour party ever since. I must express my regret that the delay has occurred. The action of the Treasurer in throwing these temporary Supply Bills on the table, and giving honorable members no information regarding them, is not conducive to the public interest. There never has been an occasion like the present, where, for more than a month, the finances of the country have been before honorable members, and an opportunity has not been given for us to discuss, them. </para>

                        <para>- I clearly stated to the House that the Government intended to bring forward a Bill next session to provide for the construction of the railway. The Government do not take such a light view of the matter as the right honorable member apparently does. We do not believe that a work involving an expenditure of £[4,000,000, and the construction of over 1,000 miles of railway, should be undertaken without considering the questions of gauge and manner of construction. Not only the gauge of the railway has to be decided, but plans and specifications will he necessary. ^ </para>

                        <para>- I admit the value of reports, but it is more important to get an agreement between the parties concerned, if that is possible, before we commence the construction of such a large work as is contemplated. That is only one point, but the Government mean to undertake the construction of the line, and they recognise that in its construction there is involved a financial policy into which no Government with any self-respect, or with the interests of the people at heart, would plunge without knowing exactly where it began and where it was likely to end. The right honorable member for Swan is taking a light-and-airy view of the position when he says that if he had remained in power he would have commenced the work with pick and shovel, without considering the expense. That cannot be done. </para>

                    <para>. - It is hardly to be expected that after spending half-a-day in entertaining the Dutch officers, honorable members should be in a very serious mood. I can readily understand that the entertainment has created a sort of lucid interval of cosmopolitanism in the Labour party, and that they are not quite prepared to settle down to local affairs. Notwithstanding the too conciliatory manner in which the Leader of the Opposition has treated the somewhat flippant statement of the Prime Minister in the form of congratulations upon the general results of the South African Union, I venture to think that the statement of the Prime Minister was unworthy of the occasion. He ought to recollect that there are in this House a number of honorable members who represent distant States, and who have been attending almost since the commencement of the session at half-past  10  o'clock in the morning, and remaining till  11  or  12  at night, on the distinct understanding that the session was to terminate at an early date in order to allow the Prime Minister to go to South Africa. But now we find the honorable gentleman practically waving his pocket handkerchief to this Parliament, and throwing before it a whole sheaf of business which is to occupy us for the remainder of the session. I wish to protest, as a member from another State who has been coming over regularly every week, and sitting here from  10.30  o'clock in the morning until late in the evening, against this treatment. If we are going to carry out the programme, which the Prime Minister has flippantly put before us, we shall be continuing our work in this Parliament right up to the end of December. In that event we shall have been led into this practice of early morning sittings on the understanding that the session was to close at an early date- </para>

                        <para>- I shall be satisfied if we rise in December of the present year, if the complete programme which the Prime Minister has laid before us were undertaken. It is easy for the Prime Minister, who is going off on a holiday, and is naturally looking forward with some pleasure to the reception which awaits him in South Africa, to talk in this fashion. But it is not treating this House fairly. Just look at this programme. It is very easy to say, " Here are a few short measures which can easily be dealt with." We must remember that in any event we have to wait until the other House has dealt with that 'very controversial subject, the land tax. Then we are asked to deal with various other " short" questions. First of all, we have the Naval Appropriation Bill. Then comes the Sugar Bounty Bill. That is a Bill which I do not hesitate to say will raise the whole question with regard to sugar. There will be a very long debate in this House as to whether the statutory arrangement by which the bounty, which works in conjunction with the Excise, and was to be gradually reduced, is now to be fixed. There will be a debate on the Tariff affecting sugar, which, ' so to speak, will revive the whole fiscal question associated with the Excise and the bounty. Then we are asked to dispose almost in a breath of the Constitution Alteration Bill. But we know that that question is going to raise the whole question of State rights. Does the Prime Minister really suppose that the members of this House are going quietly to pass a Bill by which it is proposed to submit to the people a question as to the advisableness of handing over to the Commonwealth the most treasured amongst the rights of the States, and so pave the way to a condition of unification ? I wish to tell the honorable gentleman that a Bill such as this will occupy at least a week in this House. Then we are told that the Defence Bill is " a very short matter." Perhaps it is. There is also the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill. The Prime Minister has not thrown the slightest light upon that question. </para>

As honorable members know, p. very serious legal question has arisen over the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill which is estimated to cost this country  £11,000,000  of money. Yet the Prime Minister waves his handkerchief as he leaves these shores, and says that it is a matter that can be dealt with " shortly " by this Parliament. I have no doubt the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill is a " short " measure, and it is possible that the Bill amending the Patents law and the Lighthouses Bill are also "short." But the Northern Territory Bill will revive the whole question as to whether or not the Commonwealth is justified in taking over this Territory, and also another point as to whether we ought to take it over  until we know definitely that the Commonwealth is going to have the absolute right to direct the course of the railway. The Prime Minister has not thrown the slightest light upon that matter. Instead of that, he has told us that his Attorney-General has given a different opinion from that given by legal authorities in South Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I have not any intention to do so, except to say this - that we know that the opinion of very eminent counsel in this State has been taken, and that his view is of course more valuable than that of the Prime Minister's adviser, who has expressed an opinion on the contrary side. I think that we are entitled to have some clearer and more concise statement as to what business is going to be taken before the close of the session ; because I am sure that no one in this House thinks that the programme mentioned by the Prime Minister is really going to be dealt with. In fact, the honorable " Labour " member for Maranoa laughed at the statement, and said, " How long are you going to keep us here ? " The honorable member, of course, realized the farce of putting a programme like this before the House at a time when we are supposed to be getting ready to close the session. We were asked to sit at half-past 10 in the morning for a particular reason. If Parliament is going to sit for another two or three months, so as to carry us on till the end of the year, I do not think it is fair to this House that such lengthy sittings should be continued ; and if the Prime Minister intended anything of the kind, I venture to tell him that he induced us to agree to those sittings on false pretences. </para>

                    <para>. - I must confess to have been very much disappointed at the statement of the Prime Minister with regard to the course of business. I understood that he intended to announce a programme for the remainder of the session which would take us at the very latest into the beginning of next month. Instead he has enumerated a programme of about twenty measures, some of them of overmastering importance - certainly some of them measures which affect the future destinies of this continent in a way that perhaps no other measures have heretofore done. But the Prime Minister is going away. </para>

                        <para>- I assure the Prime Minister that I am not wrong. If he will look at the list of the measures that have been announced, and are not yet on the business-paper, and will add them to those which are on the paper, he will find that there are eighteen or nineteen at the least. Who expects Parliament to rise at the beginning of next month, if it is in the meantime to dispose of a programme of that kind? </para>

                <para>I sympathise to some extent with the statement of my colleague, the right honorable member for Swan. I think that the work to which he has referred should proceed as speedily, and is, at any rate, as urgent, as the taking over of the Northern Territory. In my, judgment, the transcontinental railway is as much a part of the general Australian defence scheme as the Defence Bill itself is. The Northern Territory Acceptance Bill is also a part of that scheme. They are both parts of the general defence scheme, and should proceed together. At least, if there is to be precedence of one over the other, I think the Western Australian railway should take precedence in point of importance and urgency, as well as on the ground of its relation to the scheme for the nation's defence. It is even more important , than the taking over of the Northern Territory. It is of no use for the Commonwealth to take over the Northern Territory, or to think of doing anything with it in the matter of defence, until the railways are built; and, therefore, to delay those projects is to delay the real consummation of all that is desired. I thought that the Prime Minister would have curtailed very much the legislative programme for this session, we on this side having intimated our desire to close the session as soon as possible after he had left these shores. I have to congratulate the Prime Minister on his departure for South Africa on such an occasion ; but it occurs to me that he has overlooked one little duty. I hope the Prime Minister will not take this suggestion  amiss; but it seems to me that before he left he might have invited Parliament to send a kindly letter of congratulation to our sister Dominion over the sea, considering that she is now entering on a new system of self-government - a system which we hope will bring the South African people all the blessings it has brought to us. It is not too late now to forward such a communication. </para>

                        <para>- There is another matter to which I should like to call attention. One great question which has intimate connexion with the defence of Australia is the question of filling our great empty spaces; in other words, I refer to immigration and land settlement. I should like to know from the Government what steps they are taking with a view to meeting this great national need? Are the Government doing any more than advertising for the purpose of getting people, of our own kith and kin preferably, to come to Australia, to people this vast virgin continent ? It can no longer be said that there is no land available in Australia. In a book issued on the authority of the Ministry for circulation abroad, with a foreword by the Minister of External Affairs himself, there is expressed the hope that people from overseas will be attracted to this progressive country. </para>

The Minister of External Affairs, in the book to which I refer, has shown the absolute fatuity of an attitude of that kind ; because it is there stated that land is available, and particulars are given of our good social conditions, and so forth. We are told: in this publication, of great areas available for settlement, of social conditions that are all that can be desired - in short, that here is the El Dorado for the thousands of struggling hungry people of the older countries, and that the sooner they come here the better it will be for all concerned. I congratulate the Minister on coming back to a sane view of what are the conditions in our bright Australia. In the book, we ate told in' these words of our social conditions - </para>

                    <para>There are none of the hardships attendant on congestion of population or severity of climate. The Australian in every section of the community is enabled to lead a comfortable and healthy life, and if he is ambitious to succeed in any avocation he is perfectly free from conservative conventions peculiar to older countries. In politics, every adult, male and female, has equal privileges, and the laws of the country are framed for the benefit of all alike. It would be absurd to affirm that there is no poverty in Australia, but it can truthfully be said that the number of absolutely destitute persons forms a comparatively negligible proportion of the entire population. No poor rate is levied in any part of the Commonwealth, for there is practically no pauper class to need it.  . . . Taxation in Australia is extremely light in comparison with other countries, and in the case of farmers is practically insignificant. </para>

It blocked up the right-of-way, and the honorable member talked from it twenty to the dozen. He has just now made a statement for which there is not a tittle of justification. I am entitled to explain, in view of the statement which has been made, that what I did say was, that, whatever sweating there was before in the Post Office, it was, on the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Power,</inline> still going on under the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the present Postmaster-General, and that instead of the economic salvation they expected, things were not one whit better. That is a very different statement from the twisted statement which the honorable member has just made. </para>

                        <para>- I shall be glad if the honorable member will do so. He will not find that I said any such thing as he has just attributed to me. One of the things which honorable members opposite are saying throughout the length and breadth of Australia is that there is no land available for settlement in this country ; that the land is all held by land monopolists, and it is impossible to do anything in the way of immigration until very drastic legislation has been passed, and that that can only be brought into operation by Labour members in both the Federal and State spheres. </para>

                        <para>- No; the Minister, in making these statements, refers generally to Australia. We are continually hearing that no land is available for settlers, except at exorbitant prices, which put it beyond the pale of any small capitalist who seeks to get enough for himself and his family. But here the Minister says that there is plenty of land open for settlement - land that has been cleared, repurchased, subdivided, and is now ready for closer settlement - and the price is no more than <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> to£5 per acre. </para>

This is a fair and accurate representation of the state of affairs in Australia at the present moment. I have no quarrel with the Minister for issuing this pamphlet. We are getting the truth from his lips, and it is time that we had it, because the country has been saturated with lies during the last month or two; they are being circulated broadcast over New South Wales today. Now we have the answer to them from the mouth of the Minister of External Affairs in the Labour Administration of Australia. At page 35, speaking of land which is not improved, and which may be at some distance from railways, he says it is wise to leave all such land alone -  and secure an area of partially improved land such as is made available under closer settlement schemes in all the States. </para>

                <para>This is not the statement of myself, but of the Government, and, moreover, so far as I can judge, it is an absolutely correct account of the position of affairs in Australia.

                    <para>Large areas of Crown lands are available for selection in places, and farms may still be obtained under easy conditions, though most of the land of the best quality and nearest to the railway has been selected. Pioneering work would have to be done on these Crown lands now available before a farm could be evolved , but these disabilities were just as apparent to a great many of our present-day  farmers,  when years ago they drove their pigs in the primeval forest through which men had scarcely trod, much less built roads or laid rails. </para>
                    <para>In the North Coast portion of the Eastern Division, where 98 per cent, of the 4,000,000 occupied acres are given over to pastoral and dairying pursuits, there still remain 1,195,580 acres of Crown lands, and large areas of this, particularly among the head waters of the coastal rivers will, as facilities for transport increase, come under occupation as mixed farms, with dairying predominating. In the South Coast, though nearly 3,000,000 acres of Crown lands are unsettled, it is largely inaccessible country. </para>
                    <para>On the Tablelands, which occupy nearly 26,000,000 acres of the Eastern Division, over 5,000,000 acres still remain in the possession of the Crown, and though for the most part inaccessible country, areas large enough for farms are frequently found by the more adventurous settler. </para>

                        <para>- No. I have always had an excellent opinion as to the Minister's thoroughness and his general sanity of view in regard to many matters. I venture to say that he knows quite well what he has issued. He knows that the information contained in the book is true. The honorable member for Indi knows that too, only it does not suit him to admit it. </para>

As to the States, the purport of the book is that there is ah abundance of land available on easy terms, and waiting only the advent of keen brains and strong arms to settle upon it an independent yeomanry, who will be able to defend it in the future, and to fill it with a happy and contented people. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member does not know what he is talking about. If he turns to the official records of Western Australia, he will find that of the land made available for settlement last year, over 1,000,000 acres of good land, near railways and well watered, remain to-day to be taken up. The honorable member for Corangamite knows nothing of any part of Australia save the Western District of Victoria. That to him is a little world. I would remind him that Australia is a big place, and that even if a few men have obtained possession of the broad rich acres in which he is so much concerned, he need not imagine that they represent all Australia. At all events, I refer the honorable member to the Minister of External Affairs for information as to what land is available for settlement. </para>

                        <para>- In this official pamphlet, circulating throughout the whole of the civilized world, and the cost of which this Parliament is to provide, we have the fact set out by the Minister of External Affairs that there are millions of acres available for settlement in Australia at the present time; that land is being speedily made available in every form of tenure, and that we want only people from the other side of the world to come here and make homes for themselves upon the soil. In other words, this is a statement to the effect that there is an abundance of land available in Australia ; that it is cheap, easy of access, splendidly fertile, well watered, and capable of producing everything from the products of the station to the small cultures of the market garden. This land is available to-day to any one who cares to come and take it up. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> hold, therefore, that there is 110 excuse for any delay in submitting a bold, forward, immigration scheme. I hope that this pamphlet is but the harbinger of such a scheme. I congratulate the Minister and ask him to take his courage in both hands and to place on the Estimates an amount in keeping with the" importance of this subject. There is no need longer to delay. Here are statements made on the authority of official departments in every State, and checked by himself, that there is an abundance of land available at the present time, and, therefore, we should cease for ever to argue in this Chamber that we need drastic legislation to make land available for the people. </para>

The Treasury officials omitted to comply with that undertaking, and set down the amount at £600,000. I happened to notice the error almost immediately, and advised the Leader of the Opposition of it privately. I wish, therefore, to say that when the Estimates-in-Chief come to be considered, it is not intended to ask for more than £300,000 by way of Treasurer's Advance.

                    <para>. - I have stated from the first that it is advisable that any ordinary borrowing from a fund of this kind should bear the usual burden of interest. But the honorable member for Parkes will recollect that before the Australian Notes Bill was introduced I stated that this advance should be regarded as an exception. Rightly or wrongly, it is an advance to enable us to keep faith with the States by paying them in accordance with the provisions of section 87 of the Constitution up to the end of the present calendar year. Whilst I accepted with pleasure the amendment under which the money derived from the Australian Notes Bill is to be constituted a trust fund, and whilst I agree that any money drawn from it should bear a specified rate of interest, I do not think it is necessary to make that provision in this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree with the honorable member, but it would be advisable to state the rate of interest in the Bill if we wish to start that principle now. There are other Trust Funds, and the purposes for which the money is to be used are carefully prescribed. That applies to the Australian Notes Trust Fund. The money in that fund may be invested in British Consols, Commonwealth or State stock, or may be temporarily placed on deposit in the banks. It would, perhaps, be better not to provide for the payment of interest in this Bill, but any other advance from this fund should, I think, bear the usual rate of interest. </para>

                    <para>. -  This Bill creates a Trust Fund into which any money that the Treasurer can spare may be put towards the cost of the naval unit. This is to make provision for the scheme of naval defence, to which all parties have agreed. The whole policy was agreed upon by the previous Government. The money may, of course, be used for any improvements of the ships that mav be determined upon. All the money proposed to be applied under this Bill is to be expended in accordance with the policy that was agreed upon by the previous Administration. We hope to have some revenue to apply to this purpose. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to call attention to the words at the end of clause 2 of the Bill, " towards the construction of a fleet for the naval defence of the Commonwealth." It is not often that an Opposition calls attention to the fact that, by the language proposed to be enacted, the Government is tying its hands in what appears to be an unnecessary fashion. If this is to be a Naval Appropriation Act, the term used in the title is as wide as could be chosen, and wisely chosen. No objection would have been taken if the terms of clause 2 had been made as wide as that title. There is always the possibility of some ancillary expenditure being required in relation to the naval service, and it might be both proper and convenient to meet that expenditure out of this Trust Fund. It appears to me that the Government should not be unduly restricted in this matter of defence. The whole House is at one in regard to it. It is not a party question. Anything, that will make for efficient administration and for promptitude in dealing with needs as they arise is desirable. From that point of view, it does not seem wise to include the words to which I have called attention. . </para>

                        <para>- That is quite right, but suppose that some other purpose becomes apparent, subsidiary to this but accompanying or forwarding it. If the words " towards the construction of a fleet " were omitted, the money would go to the Naval Defence account, and would be available for all the purposes covered by the title to the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that Parliament likes to know how the money which it votes is to be applied. We are appropriating this money for the purpose of the construction of a fleet. I should not like to see any alteration made in the Bill in regard to the appropriation of the money. If Parliament passes loose Acts, giving a free hand to the Government to do as it likes, the money may be diverted from the purpose that Parliament intended. We have determined to build a fleet for Australia, and I think that the appropriation of this money should be devoted to that particular purpose, and no other. If it is desirable to apply a portion of the money in some other way, Parliament should be tailed together and asked to alter the Act. I would not agree to give the Government <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> free hand as to the expenditure. </para>

The object of this provision is simply that we may have a big bag into which we can put the money, and out of which it cannot be drawn except for the specific purpose stated. I agree with the honorable member that the Bill ought not to be restrictive, but I do not agree that the words referred to ought to be struck out. These words mean, as was held by the previous Government of which I was the head, that the Commonwealth may have to be defended anywhere on the seas, subject to the direction of the Commonwealth Government or Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- As the honorable member for Balaclava has pointed out, the clause, as worded, will very much tie the hands of the Commonwealth Government. It might be very well contended, when it was proposed to send the large vessels - which are being paid for by the Commonwealth - out of the Commonwealth waters, that that was not for the defence of the Commonwealth, but for the defence of the Empire. I am well aware that the Prime Minister, personally, is anxious that the Government should have a free hand to use the larger vessels; and I draw attention to the fact that the British Prime Minister, in speaking of the number of <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts</inline> at the present time built, included the larger vessels built for New Zealand and Australia, and described them as not intended for merely coastal defence. I am sure that, if any contingency arose in which the Imperial Government asked for the cooperation of New Zealand and Australia in the defence of the Empire, we should be perfectly willing to lend the vessels for that purpose. </para>

                        <para>- Of course; I am not talking about the Prime Minister "playing boats" by himself. It is quite possible, however, that there might be some people who did not think imperially, but locally, and who would say that the phraseology of the clause limited the Government's action. I do not desire any limitation, but rather that the Prime Minister or the Government should have discretion. If the words objected to by the honorable member for Balaclava are retained, they might be thought to impose a limitation. I quite agree with the honorable member for Ballarat that if the clause stops at the word " defence," the latter words are not needed. The obvious purpose of the Bill is the naval defence of Australia, direct or indirect, through the Empire. If the Prime Minister thinks it desirable to retain the words, I ask him to stop at the word " defence," so as to do away with any equivocal words which might be used to impose a restriction on the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I think it wise, when initiating legislation of this kind, to say exactly what we mean; and I think that the Government and this Parliament mean that these ships are primarily for the defence of the Commonwealth. During the very recent, widespread, and, shall I say, vigorous discussion in the country, the Government, of which I had the honour to be the chief, held that we could not prescribe the waters in which the fighting or defending would take place, and that no imaginary line could be drawn which the ships should not be ready to cross for the purpose of defending the Commonwealth. In my opinion, these words, should remain, in order to show that this is a Commonwealth fleet ; and the Government of the day will have to take the responsibility of directing the vessels, subject, of course, in a great emergency, to the calling of Parliament together. If an imaginary line were drawn beyond which the ships should not go, a position too ridiculous for contemplation would be created. In my opinion, the words impose no limitation, while they inform the world that the fleet is intended primarily, and almost wholly, for the defence of the Commonwealth, though I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that, while the ships are defending the Commonwealth, they are defending the heart of the Empire. </para>

                        <para>- Very well; it applies both ways. The honorable member for Parkes has told us that the armoured cruisers for New Zealand and Australia are called <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts</inline> ; but I may say  that the most recent advice we have from the advisers of the King is rather in favour of smaller craft for the defence of this country. I am not, of course, in a position to reveal the actual advice ; but we are told that with smaller vessels we get more powerful defence for less money. Of course, I am now speaking entirely apart from any political leaning or bias; but we are advised that the powerful smaller craft would be more embarrassing to the larger craft. </para>

                    <para>. -The Prime Minister has not understood my point. In the endeavour to save the time of the Committee, I curtailed my observations unduly. I have not claimed that we should attempt to indicate in this Bill that this naval force is intended for any purpose other than the defence of the Commonwealth. I tried to point out that if a contingency arose,  which  we hope will not arise, and the question were asked whether these ships should be used for other purposes than the direct defence of the Commonwealth, objection might be urged by some members of this House that it would be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the provisions contained in this Bill. I do not wish it to be so. If the Prime Minister found that the Imperial Government were building a number of vessels specifically for " the defence of Great Britain," he would at once, if his attention were drawn to it, take exception to it on the ground that it ought to be for the defence of the Empire. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the question now. Whilst 1 do not desire that it should be indicated in the Bill that the object of building these vessels- is -the defence of the Empire, I wish its wording to be left sufficiently wide, so that the Imperial idea with which the Prime Minister seems to be imbued from time to time - if he will forgive me for saying so - might be given effect under this Bill. If the Government of the day proposed, at some future time, to join with New Zealand in assisting the British Fleet in the China seas, some members might say that that was beyond the power given in this Bill, since the appropriation was obtained for the construction of vessels " for the defence of Australia." The honorable gentleman is, no doubt, well aware that that great authority on defence, Admiral Mahan, has pointed out in a chapter of one of his books upon " the disposition of navies," that prior to the Japanese-Russian war, the naval base for the defence of Australia was the middle of the Indian Ocean. Since that war the point may be somewhat changed. There is a very popular opinion in this country that, in- order to defend Australia, we should have our harbors full of warships; but, according to Admiral Mahan, the naval base for the defence of Australia was, some time ago, at a point in the Indian Ocean. As the Prime Minister is well aware, defence at sea is quite different to defence on land. At sea the enemy is treated as an ocean bushranger, and we go out on to the highways of the ocean to meet and destroy him. </para>

                        <para>- Of course we should. Nelson went down to the West Indies to follow the French Fleet; and he went to the end of the Mediterranean to meet them at Alexandria. Our ships would have to go across the ocean too. If we limit ourselves in this Bill, when the time comes for sending the larger ships away in response to the wishes of, and in cooperation with, the Navy of the Imperial Government we may have members of this House raising the point that there is no power to do such a thing under this Bill. We have members of this House who are not so well  disposed  towards the British Empire as some of us are. </para>

Of course, we hope to make Australia a nation, if we can. but we want people for that purpose; and we want it done as part of the British Empire. I wish to convince the Prime Minister, seeing what his sentiments are, that it would be desirable for him to retain power in the hands of the Government to use these vessels either for the direct defence of the Commonwealth or its indirect defence through the British Empire. </para>

                    <para>.- I am not quite as much impressed as the Prime Minister appears to be by the fact that within the last twelve months there has been, apparently, a change of opinion in the advice tendered by some of the principal naval advisers of the Admiralty. The swing of the pendulum is almost regular. In one year the opinion is in favour of enlarging the ships, and in the next year in favour of concentrating their power. The Prime Minister is perfectly right when he says - and there, it appears, all the authorities are with him - that a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> in size, represents what is now considered an excessive development, and that the new antagonist of the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> though a very large vessel, is considerably smaller than a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> but with much heavier armament. These swings of the pendulum take place from lime to time. The Prime Minister is absolutely right when he ridicules the possibility of our drawing a line on the map and saying that a vessel that can operate within that area is defending Australia, and that the same vessel would not be defending Australia if operating beyond that line. No such line can be drawn. The oceans of the world are one. It is just possible that there might be a combination of forces of such a character that Australia's safety would be determined by naval conflicts taking place thousands of miles away from Australian ports. If that were possible, Australian vessels, as well as British vessels, and those of the Indian Fleet, should, for Australia's sake, be concentrated where the crisis will take place. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Of course the effective range even of the armoured cruiser now under construction, would be too limited to permit it to be transferred such a distance in time to take part in a conflict which might be brought about with forty-eight hours' notice. Where the decisive conflict will take place we cannot, and need not, know. We must provide the best defence in the best form we can, being satisfied with nothing less, and use it to the best purpose whenever and where- ever the emergency may arise. My object is to give the Government a freer hand to expedite construction in any way which may be considered necessary ; but having pressed my suggestion on the Treasurer, I shall not occupy more time in regard to it. </para>

                        <para>- What I said does not conflict with the statement made in the Imperial Parliament - that naval defence is subject to the Naval Discipline Act, and provides for the United Kingdom and its Territories. We also have territories, although they are not specifically alluded to. I venture to say that those responsible in rimes of emergency will give the provision a reading which will be in consonance with the traditions of our race, and the best interests of the Commonwealth and the .Empire generally. </para>

                    <para>. - On the whole, it may be well to let the Bill go through ; but we shall later require an amending measure to remove its limitations. There is already a growing trouble in connexion with the management of our land defence, because of the restrictions of the Trust Fund. The great bulk of our military requirements have to be supplied from the other end of the world; and when Parliament votes £100,000 for armaments or equipment of any kind, it cannot be sure of spending the money within the year, everything depending on the conditions of the factories at Home, which may be able to do the work off-hand, or may be so glutted with orders that they cannot meet our requirements for twelve or eighteen months to come. Therefore a Trust Fund is needed, into which the money voted could be paid, to make it unnecessary to get re-votes in succeeding years, a practice which needlessly inflates the Estimates, and often causes delay, because when the manufacturers are ready to execute our orders, it is found that there is no money available pending a fresh appropriation. A Trust Fund is needed for both land and naval defence, and while it may be well to confine these provisions to the construction of the Fleet, a Trust Fund will later be needed for its maintenance. The honorable member referred to the contemplated introduction of a Naval Discipline Bill as a supplement to the Defence Act. If I am any judge, the consideration of that measure will take some time. </para>

                        <para>- I hope so. We must have common standards of discipline, as well as of arms. While it is true that the Home authorities may be reducing the size of vessels of war, they are not likely to come down to vessels of the " River " class for the defence of the high seas. For many years to come we must be content to accept their suggestions. The tendency now is to reduce the size of the war vessels, making their armament heavier, though giving them less of it. Great speed is particularly aimed at, especially for the defence of the trade routes. As a naval expert has said, we need something which will catch anything, which will fight anything, and which, if the odds are against it, can keep out of the way until assistance arrives. </para>

                    <para>. - I second, with great pleasure, the motion, which will enable the Prime Minister, while conveying the congratulations of the Commonwealth Parliament, to place before the Union Parliament a few words which directly express the unanimous feeling and Imperial sentiments of both Houses of this Parliament., The Prime Minister needs no credentials.' He has authority to speak for this Parliament on these non-party matters at any time, and we shall willingly indorse what he may say. But this motion also gives honorable members an opportunity of associating themselves in a more personal fashion with a memorable event in the history of the Empire. </para>
