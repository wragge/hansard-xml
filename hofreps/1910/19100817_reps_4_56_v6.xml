                            <para>-We have realized that the system in vogue here is out of date, and in every State we are endeavouring to modernize it. At Hobart&#39; there is the most up-to-date system in existence, and the Sydney system is partly up to date, a large number of subscribers there being connected with the common battery board, which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Bell</inline> says is the most modern arrangement. In Melbourne, we shall endeavour to connect all subscribers with a common battery board in the new exchange, which has been building for some years past. I hope that it will be opened in a few months, and that the people of Melbourne will be served by the most up-to-date telephone system in the world. </para>

There has been some misconception as to the intention of the Government. From what has appeared in some London newspapers, it has evidently been thought that the Government wishes to subsidize certain Labour newspapers. I know how the misconception must have arisen. It is explained in a letter which I received this morning from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temperley,</inline> in which he says - </para>

As a matter of fact, what the words meant, and what I think honorable members generally understood, was that the policy of the Government was to give a subsidy to a cable service which would be independent - that is, independent in the sense that the conditions that are attached to the agreement under which most of the newspapers of Australia get their cable service would be left out, that every newspaper would be free to get its news  from where it liked, and that no prohibitions or difficulties would be set up in the way of newspapers starting anywhere in Australia. In that sense the word &#34; independent &#34; has been used, meaning a truly independent service. </para>

                        <para>- Not so far as I know. Up to 1895 there were two cable associations supplying news to the Australian newspapers. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily .Telegraph,</inline> and the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> comprised one group. The other group of newspapers which had a separate cable service was composed of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Evening News,</inline> and the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Register.</inline> Honorable members will see from these combinations that at that time - I do not say at present - there was a distinct cleavage in policy. Generally speaking, the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph,</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> were the Liberal newspapers, as against the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Register,</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Evening News.</inline></para>

                        <para>- No; they were subscribers. The Western Australian newspapers are subscribers just as the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> is a subscriber. The subscribers to the <inline font-style="italic">Argus-Herald</inline> Association were the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier,</inline> the Tasmanian Press Association, the Country Press Associations of Victoria and New South Wales, and the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian.</inline> And the subscribers to the other group were the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Evening Telegraph,</inline> the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Star,</inline> and the Western Australian <inline font-style="italic">Daily News.</inline> It will be seen that the newspapers whose proprietors were not shareholders in the Cable Association grouped themselves, very naturally, according to their general policy, and so we had two associations representing newspapers with somewhat different policies, and providing a separate cable service. </para>

                        <para>- It may have been, but I should say that the probability is that more news was provided under the old system, when two strong associations were in competition. In 1895, they decided to combine for business purposes in order to cheapen the service to both groups, and they formed an agreement, to the main features of which I desire to draw attention. It was a business agreement made with the intention of strengthening the newspapers, and enabling them to get a much cheaper service. </para>

                    <para>Complaint has been made that a daily paper which was recently started in one of the capitals was refused the cable service by the Association. When the Association was formed a clause was embodied in the agreement requiring that the unanimous consent of the whole of the parties to it should be obtained before any new daily paper established in Adelaide, Melbourne, or Sydney could be furnished with the cable news. This provision was part and parcel of a legal document, and had, of course, the force of law, and had to be carried out. But to meet the altered circumstances and conditions which the lapse of time has brought, this provision has, within the past few months, been waived by mutual consent of all parties to the agreement. Consequently, there is no bar to any paper obtaining the Association&#39;s cable news on terms to be arranged. </para>

                <para class="block">A clause, manifestly preventing the establishment of a rival newspaper by barring it from participating in the joint cable service, and saddling it with the heavy cost of maintaining unaided its own cable service, was recognised by the public as so serious a bar to public liberty that the Association themselves waived the requirement of the mutual consent of all parties. </para>

                        <para>- I am answering a question put by the honorable member himself, by pointing out the circumstances in which the proprietors of a newspaper would be placed in commencing operations. They would have to compete with a rival association embracing all the big daily newspapers of Australia, and would be called upon to bear, unaided, and with no prospect of securing the co-operation of others, the whole cost of a cable service. The cost of cablegrams is one of the chief items of expenditure to which a newspaper is necessarily put. The terms of the United Cable Association have been modified to the extent that the unanimous consent of all its members is not now required to an application for participation in their news. Such an application can be granted without the unanimous consent of all concerned, but terms must be arranged. The question of terms is, of course, most important. </para>

                        <para>- No proportion is stated. Applicants may obtain the service on terms to be arranged, but the actual terms are not defined. It is not suggested that the proprietors of a new newspaper should be allowed to come in, and to participate in this service on equal terms with those who had established it, but the terms, as I have said, are indefinite, and might be entirely prohibitive. </para>

I submit that the place where any modification of those charges and the conditions attaching to them can be discussed is in Committee of Supply. I am aware that some motions of this kind have been submitted in the House. For instance, the motion relating to the mail contract was so submitted, but to submit such a detailed motion as this in the House is to curtail our privileges. Our privileges are, as a rule, safeguarded by the terms of the motion itself, and if the terms of this motion were abstract or general I should not take exception to the course being pursued. But they are not. The motion fixes the conditions that should attach to the grant that is proposed to be made by the Government. <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> dealing with this point says - </para>

                <para class="block">Can any one say that the terms of this proposition are abstract or general ? It actually goes into details and determines the number of words per week that is to be sent, and the conditions to be subscribed toby those who seek to take advantage of trieservice. It may be said that this question will come up again, but in what way will it be brought up ? It will only come before us again, I presume, on the Estimates. Will all these particularities appear on the Estimates? They never do. The only place in which we may discuss the particularities of this motion is, I submit, in Committee, and I contend further that it should be preceded by a message from the Governor-General. </para>

                        <para>- I submit that the objection taken by the honorable member for Parramatta is supported by logic and convenience. If, as he contends, this motion is not to be followed by a measure to be dealt with in the ordinary way, it&#39; seems to me that it is really equivalent to a Bill, and will have the effect of committing the House to a series of details without giving it an opportunity to discuss them in Committee. If all the Government have to do, after passing this detailed motion, is to provide for the amount in a lump sum on the Estimates, it is probable that the matter will be passed over without that careful and detailed consideration which it demands. The honorable member forParramatta has pointed out that the conditions lay down very carefully the annual payments for the first, second, and third years of the service, and give actual details as to the number of words which newspapers shall have an opportunity of receiving through this medium. The standing order which the honorable member has read seems to be aimed at preventing honorable members being deprived of a fair opportunity to discuss such details in Committee, as we should be able to do if they were embodied in a Bill. I therefore think that the contention of the honorable member for Parramatta should be upheld, and that this motion should be discussed in Committee, if honorable members are to be given the privilege of a detailed discussion of it. </para>

                        <para>- I direct attention to the terms of the motion, which is clearly intended to get the sense of the House as to whether such a policy should be adopted. The carrying of this motion will not involve the appropriation of a penny of revenue. An appropriation will still be necessary to cover the expenditure required to give it effect. The objections which honorable members have raised are, therefore, without force. </para>

                        <para>- It was quite unnecessary for my purpose to have included in this motion a single word about the conditions. I might have stated in a general way the conditions which I thought should apply to the proposed subsidy, but I thought it right that honorable members should be treated with absolute fairness, and, therefore, the conditions to be attached to the grant of the subsidy have been included in the motion submitted to them. I repeat that the carrying of the motion will involve merely an expression of opinion by the House on the question of a subsidy for a cable service. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite true. The honorable member reminded the House that in connexion with the mail contract a similar course was followed, and that afterwards an appropriation had to be obtained in another form. I take it that before the Minister could spend threepence in connexion with the proposed subsidy, the amount would have to be appropriated by. Parliament. I do not know what course the Government intend to follow, but I presume that a vote for the purpose will be included in the Estimates. If that course is followed, it will be seen that the object of the honorable member for Parkes, as well as the honorable member for Parramatta, will be served, since an ample opportunity will be given to every member of the House to discuss the details of the vote before it is agreed to. If the Government decide to bring the matter forward in the form of a Bill, honorable members will remember that the Bill must go through Committee, and the same object would therefore be served at that stage. </para>

I understood you, sir, to say that the House has a full opportunity to discuss every part of the  motion, and to amend it as it sees fit. Will it be possible for that to be done when each speaker is limited to one speech on the motion ? Is it not necessary, if honorable members are to have a full opportunity to deal with the details of the motion, that it should be considered in Committee ? </para>

                        <para>- After this interlude, I shall resume my speech where I left off. In clause 10 of this agreement, there was an arrangement arrived at between the two associations, under which news was to be supplied to Reuter&#39;s Telegraph Company in Australia. That was modified by an agreement entered into later between Reuter&#39;s Company and the combined associations. That arrangement was a reciprocal one, under which the united cable associations agreed to supply Reuter&#39;s Company in Melbourne with all their news free for sale to whatever newspapers they pleased at their own price. In return for that, Reuter&#39;s Company undertook to place all their foreign service news in London at the disposal of the association&#39;s compilers in their London office. The next clause in the agreement is one to which I take the strongest possible exception. It is one which I think we are justified as a Parliament in doing all we can to prevent being carried out. if this combination is to be the only body supplying news to Australia. Clause 11 reads - </para>

I am pointing out that by the control of the newspapers, which are&#39; the sole source of public information, one unscrupulous man, according to Colonel Reay&#39;s evidence, was able to bring on the Franco-Prussian war, probably, one of the most unjustifiable of wars. And, if the sources of information may be controlled by an individual, or set of individuals, the same thing may occur again. </para>

                        <para>- I daresay the honorable member is giving us a little autobiography just now. Honorable members will see that this clause of the agreement is very binding, and one which, however desirable it may be in the interests of. the newspapers, cannot for one moment be contended to be in the interests of the public. I do not know that there is any other clause that needs particular reference. The agreement was originally for five years, but it was extended twice for a similar period, on 30th November, 1899, and on 3rd October, 1904, and at the time of the publication of the particulars was very nearly due for another extension. I gathered from a remark in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackinnon&#39;s</inline> evidence that the agreement would stand, at any rate, until the end of this year. </para>

                        <para>- Probably not; there is nothing in the agreement which states who would get the subject of the monopoly, and, as a matter of fact, it would be open to everybody. I am not complaining of a combination in order to establish a service, or of certain newspapers joining in order to get the best possible service for themselves. The point is that, in order to attain this object, those newspapers have combined in such a way as to prevent news coming to Australia from any other source, however desirable such news might be. </para>

                        <para>- That is probably true. I do not think we could have nearly as good a supply of news if there were no combination; but to have only one source is dangerous in the interests of the community. We have a precedent in Canada, where the Government, because, in their opinion, there was a deficiency in Empire news supplied by the one Association, gave a subsidy of ^3,000 a year, some six years ago, and a subsidy is still paid. At the present time there are two rival associations. Recently a second association has been established calling itself the Independent Cable Service Association. It is at present struggling along under great difficulties, because it is unable to get the support of any of the daily newspapers of Australia, with the exception of, I think, two. The others stand out because they are necessarily bound by an arrangement which was insisted upon by the combine when they became subscribers to its service. The agreements of the various newspapers with the Association naturally expire at different times, so that they have no opportunity at any one time of insisting upon different terms. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. The right honorable member is quite in error if he supposes that it is intended to bolster up any particular association. One of the strongest reasons for bringing forward this proposal is that at present there are two associations. If there were only one, it would be quite idle for us to talk about proposing the conditions and terms under which it should carry on its monopoly. But as there is a rival association, an opportunity is afforded for the Government to lay down conditions under which we think the public can be better served. </para>

They are purely in the interest of the public. </para>

                        <para>- They were distributed yesterday amongst honorable members. There are some copies on the table at present. The conditions which we ask the House to consent to are, first, that a subsidy, of  &#163;6,000  shall be paid - &#163;2,500 for the first year, ^-2,000 for the second year, and. &#163;1,500 for the third year. The reason for those different amounts is that any association - such as the association which has recently been started, or any new association - would necessarily be put to great expense at the beginning of its operations. Next, the cable service is to consist &#34;of news, electrically transmitted from oversea to the Association in Australia.&#34; Those words are used to provide for a wireless service as well as for an ordinary cable service. .The minimum number of words to be transmitted is to be  6,000  per week. The number of words at present sent out per day to such newspapers as the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> is about 1,100. Then we provide that - </para>

                    <para>At least 6,000 words of the cable service are to be transmitted in each week from Europe or America to Australia, by way of the Pacific cable, unless that cable is broken clown. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">It may be asked why we lay it down that a proportion of the news must be transmitted by the Pacific cable. The reason is that the Government are concerned in the control and upkeep of the Pacific cable. It is a State-owned line, so far as the Pacific portion is concerned. The Government are responsible for the loss which at present occurs upon it, and have to call upon the taxpayers to make up the deficiency. So that, in giving such a subsidy as this, it is natural for the Government to lay it down that at least  6,000  words of the service are to be transmitted over the Pacific cable, with a view to the loss being to some extent minimized. The fourth condition is - </para>

                    <para>The proprietor of any newspaper in the Commonwealth shall be entitled to become a sub scriber to the Association for the cable service on the payment of the annual rate applicable under Schedule A. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The schedule provides that the maximum annual charge in respect of metropolitan newspapers shall be- Sydney and Melbourne, .&#163;1,000 j Brisbane and Adelaide, &#163;750; Perth. &#163;500; Hobart, .&#163;300. The maximum annual charge in respect of newspapers in the chief provincial cities is to be &#163;200. The maximum annual charge in respect of newspapers in minor cities and towns is to be &#163;50. That is a rough table of charges based on the probable circulation of newspapers in the cities and towns so classified. I do &#39;not know that I need take up any more time upon the matter. The principles of the proposal are perfectly clear. If any one entertains the opinion that it is intended to bolster up any particular association or newspaper, I think that the conditions show that that is not the desire. The main object of the proposal is that the newspapers of this country shall be free to get their information from any source that may be available, and, further, that there shall be no combination having it within its power to prevent fresh newspapers from being established in any Australian capital or city if considered desirable. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member should try to Be as fair as I have tried to be to the existing Associations. He will see, if he looks into the matter more carefully, that all that is desired is to prevent the closing up of sources of information, the result of which might be to create in this country a most unhealthy and unsound public opinion. If no newspapers other than those now in existence can get a fair start, and if all the chief newspapers are practically compelled to be subscribers to one Association, there can be but one channel of information, and that, we hold, is an exceedingly dangerous thing. </para>

                        <para>- It would, as I have said, amount to the same thing. Substantially there are two Associations in existence. Assuming the case to which the right honorable member refers under this proposal of the Government, one of them would be receiving a subsidy of ^2,000 a year for three years, and the one that conformed to his proposal would be getting its press rates cheaper if it complied with certain conditions, which would probably amount to about the same thing. You would have to make an allowance in some way.  I have attempted to show that it is absolutely essential for the healthy government of any Democracy which has to depend on a sound public opinion that it should be free to get its information from any source from which it was obtainable, and that the prohibitory clause, to which I have referred, is so serious a barrier to the newspapers getting sufficient desirable information </para>

                        <para>- I do not think there is any real danger in that respect. We cannot complain of the kind of information which has been published up to. date by the Australian newspapers, nor do I think that any association likely to be formed, or to receive the Government .subsidy, will be less concerned in keeping up a high standard of news. We need not assume that less care will be exercised in the future in regard to the kind of information published. I do not know whether any undesirable cables are now sent from the Old World, but I do know that the newspapers do not print them. </para>

They stopped a paper from starting in Hobart in opposition to the <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> by that very provision in their agreement; and they have stopped other .papers throughout Australia, by that means making it a close corporation. When I was Premier of New South Wales, I could not get anything through this press giving an accurate account. They sent their own cables to England, which were not the class of cables that ought to have been sent. </para>

I spoke to the manager of Reuter about it a short, time ago, and he told me that he could not now make an arrangement similar to that which he had made with me at that time, because he had  entered into a combination with the associated press, or the Eastern Extension Company, so that they have travelled Reuter as well as the rest. </para>

                        <para>- Neither do I. It is making the service too much of a monopoly. I thought we were to have something fair. I think I am also right in saying that the originators of the associated press get their cables for nothing, because they make the other papers pay for them by subscribing largely. The only thing I regret in connexion with this proposal is that the Government do not provide more money, to insure a better service. </para>

                        <para>- No. I should not care who the man in charge was, so long as he was a good and straightforward man. I certainly think that the service at present is not controlled as much as it should be. Talking about cables that are picked, out to be sent here, does the right honorable member think the High Commissioner would send very strong Protectionist cables? Many things that he has said have been tinged with Free Trade. </para>

                        <para>- It might be altered after this debate. I think that the amount of subsidy proposed is too small, as the service now costs about, or not less than, ^12,000. The lowest rates should be charged to the country press. I do not know what rates are charged now, though I believe that there has been a reduction. At the last meeting of the Country Press Association a desire was expressed for the reduction of cable rates, so that the newspaper proprietors could get cable news direct.- </para>

                        <para>- The country press proprietors would be greatly benefited if they could get cheaper cable communication with London. Means should be taken, too, for the representation of both sides of public opinion in the cables transmitted from London. At the present time the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and&#39; the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> proprietaries appoint a person in England to send cablegrams to Australia, and he naturally sends what he thinks they wish to get. The matter might be managed better by a committee, which could easily get. men who would act independently, sending both sides of public opinion on any question. Now we do not get both sides. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Swan would join it if he could. I am surprised that certain honorable members have the impudence to talk as they do, or to hold up their heads after the last elections. The proposal is that the Minister shall control the sending of cable news, but I think that that work might be done by a committee, and that the subsidy might be increased. The Australian community should know what is happening on the other side of the world, and read both sides of every political question. I hope that the Minister will, on reconsideration, be able to propose a larger subsidy. The sum of &#163;4,000 a year would be little enough. An association might be able to add to that amount, and thus be able to give a good service. I understand that the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> has now a special cable service, which costs between &#163;8,000 and  &#163;10,000  a year. It will be a good thing for Australia if it gets a news service properly subsidized. This will destroy the monopoly which has hitherto existed, and the people will be grateful to the Government- for having brought that about* </para>

                    <para>. - The debate illustrates the grave inconvenience of conducting the business of the House by the method which has been adopted. The Minister tells us that we shall be able to discuss the details of this proposal when we. are asked to vote money to give effect to it. But, to all intents and purposes, the motion before us is equivalent to a Bill of so many clauses, one of which enables the Minister to modify, as he pleases, the conditions which have been circulated. The Minister is in no way bound to give administrative effect to these conditions. They are not incorporated in the motion in such a way that the House can deal with them, and, if it thinks fit, limit the Minister&#39;s power. A series of motions, dealing with a very complex question, has been put before us for our approval, without our having an opportunity to consider the subject in Committee, and to discuss every detail. If this practice is to be adopted often, it will seriously interfere with the liberties of the House by preventing that full and free discussion of legislation which is necessary. In modern communities, every Bill passes through three stages or readings, and is discussed in Committee. The third-reading stage gives an opportunity for a recommittal, should any matter have been overlooked. </para>

                        <para>- It may bc well for honorable members who arc supporting the Government; but when they were in Opposition they were not so ready to consider Ministers omniscient. I agree entirely with the Minister on the three main principles : as to the need for more cable news, cheap rates, and freedom on the part of the press; but I question whether the form the honorable gentleman has taken in dealing with this question is the best one. I quite understand from previous knowledge, confirmed by what the honorable gentleman says, that there has been, hitherto, an agreement between the leading newspapers of Australia to obtain news through Reuter, to have it condensed in England, and sent out here in Liebig form, for the information and edification of the Australian people; and, in order to obtain as much benefit from that news as is possible, they have not been as willing, as they might have been according to the great advocates of freedom on the other side of the House, to allow other people to participate in those benefits. I take it that what the Minister aims at is to break into that ring, and give the whole press of Australia an opportunity to share in this news. But I should like to ask him whether he is now assured that if he makes this more comprehensive, elaborate arrangement, with all these conditions, he will Induce the large newspapers to- come into it ? </para>

                        <para>- I point out to the Minister that it is quite possible that when all this elaborate arrangement is made the leading newspapers may still say, &#34; We want a number of cablegrams of our own, and we will have them selected for ourselves, and still preserve our own arrangement.&#34; If that does occur, I do not know that the honorable gentleman will have quite secured his purpose. He may say that he will have&#39; secured the news for all the newspapers of Australia, but will he have got at the nerve centre which the honorable member for Hume touched when he said that Reuter is under an arrangement with the leading newspapers of Australia to give them an exclusive right to their budget of news? </para>

                        <para>- Then I think that there is still less chance of the Minister being able to break into the arrangement which the leading press of Australia now  enjoys  ; because, if Reuter is a fertile channel of news, such as is desirable for the people of Australia, we may depend upon  it that the leading newspapers may, at any time, avail themselves of that exclusive use, and still preserve what is called a monopoly of the cable news ; and, therefore, the whole of this edifice, which the Minister is trying to erect, may tumble down, and be of little use, except to give the outside section of the press an opportunity of getting cable news from Europe and the rest of the world a little more cheaply than they did before at the public expense. I take exception to this proposal of the Government to contribute out of the people&#39;s pockets to help certain newspapers to improve their circulation and their news ; because we all recognise that every newspaper is a commercial venture. It endeavours to sell something which the public want, and we can always take it that the contents of a newspaper are not what the proprietors think best for the public, but what they think the public are anxious to have. </para>

                        <para>- That is what I said, and the honorable member is putting it. in another way, perhaps more generally than I did. A newspaper is essentially a commercial venture. It is considering itself in two ways. It is getting a circulation, and thereby it is securing a better chance of obtaining advertisements. What right has a Government, on general principles, to use &#163;6.000 of public money to give the public better news of what is going on in other parts of the world ? Surely it is the duty of the newspapers, if they are run for dividends=-and I do not blame them for that - to collect their own material ? If the Minister should fail to induce the leading newspapers to come into an arrangement by which they will have in their columns the identical cablegrams which appear in every country newspaper, he will merely have appropriated &#163;6,000 of public money to help the rest of the press to give better news than they gave before. That is subsidizing an industry. I do not see why the press should be subsidized more than any other industry. </para>

                        <para>- I think that my reasoning is sound. We are told on the one hand by the honorable member for Hume what the existing state of things was - that other newspapers which wished to participate in this exclusive method of getting news were not allowed to do so. On the other hand, the honorable member for Swan tells us that all that is altered. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; the honorable member will see the bearing which it has on my&#39; argument. If the Minister does not succeed with this scheme of making a bigger ring, so as to embrace the whole press of Australia, he will have spent <inline font-style="italic">/:6.00a</inline> merely to improve the cable news service of Australia. Unless he can show that by spending that sum he is likely to bring about a more universal participation in the world&#39;s news, then, I ask, whether he is justified in paying this bounty. Thai is my argument. I know that there are two or three members of the House who are interested in country newspapers, either by owning them or by having a share therein. I invite them to look at this proposal quite apart from the slight bias which that interest might give to their minds. The question is - Ought we to vote  &#163;6,000  of public money in order to improve the chances of circulation for the press of Australia unless we see that by its expenditure we are going to bring about a more universal diffusion of knowledge with regard to the world&#39;s affairs? </para>

                        <para>- That is what I doubt. If the Minister tells me, as I take it that he does in effect, that the Associated Press of Australia have said, &#34; We will not in any circumstances arrange for any other newspaper to participate in this arrangement,&#34; I think it is some justification for using the Pacific cable, in which  we  have a great interest, for the purpose of : getting news. I am willing to go as far as that. The honorable member for Hume said that the associated body made money by admitting others. If a man rents a house in the hope of subletting it, it is generally recognised that he is entitled to sublet it at a slightly higher rate than would merely compensate him for the rent which he pays, because he runs the risk of having part of the house empty. On the same principle, if a number of the leading newspaper proprietors of Australia embark on a scheme which costs them many thousands of pounds to get news, and they admit other people afterwards, I think that they are entitled to some consideration from the fact that they risked their money in the first place with the chance of having nobody to participate afterwards. Therefore, the point is - Has the Minister assured himself that the Press Association absolutely refused to admit other newspapers to participate in their news, even if willing to pay a fair and reasonable contribution towards the first expense? </para>

                        <para>- They will not tell me their terms; but I venture to think that the Minister ought to be able to procure the information. Whilst we are agreed as to the advisableness of the people of Australia receiving as much information as possible concerning the affairs of the outside world - because there is nothing more calculated to destroy insularity than a knowledge of what is going on abroad - I do not think we should be called upon to spend &#163;6,000 in this way until the Minister has exhausted all possibilities of ascertaining whether the present arrangement cannot be so extended as to cover all Australian newspapers. When that has been shown, I think that the House will be justified in making the proposed outlay, but otherwise the country should be saved this expenditure. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like, briefly, to combat one or two statements made by the honorable member for Parkes, who has just resumed his seat, and. if possible, to change his views on the subject. It is generally admitted that, to a large extent, partisan news is supplied to the existing newspapers. That is my experience, and I think it is the experience of most people. There has been for some years a tendency to conservatism, and hence the news sent to these newspapers is naturally coloured in that direction. We all know that a newspaper correspondent colours his work according to the tone of the journal to which he contributes. Coining to the question of what is done by the newspapers of the Association to which the cable news is supplied, let me say at once that it is not contended that Reuter has the power to make the service exclusive. The newspaper proprietors in the existing Association, however, have combined to secure one cable service, which is distributed amongst them, and with which they may do as they please. They disseminate the news received by cable amongst their own newspapers, and distribute the expenditure amongst them, with the result that the individual cost of the service is but a nominal amount. </para>

                        <para>- I do. And I admit, too, that the members of the Association do not confine the service to their own newspapers. They distribute messages amongst country newspapers. I speak from experience. They are prepared to sell the service to country newspapers, but subject to the right on their part to excise from it any messages that they do not desire to go to the country. They censor anything which, if distributed amongst provincial newspapers, would prejudice the prestige of the metropolitan dailies, as vendors of the most important information. I know that they have censored messages which country newspapers would have been very pleased to get, and which 1 make told to say it would have been advantageous for the country to know. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and those newspapers reach certain country districts the day after publication. They censor the telegraphic news, and will not allow some of it to be sent to the country press. That has been the great trouble. If the proposal of the Government be adopted, we shall have not only a greater variety of news, but a quicker service ; and, in view of that greater despatch, it is quite possible that the present daily newspapers will be compelled to take some of the information supplied by the subsidized service. I think, as a matter of fact, that they will patronize it. </para>

                        <para>- Because it will be carried over a shorter route. It is undoubted that this scheme will be of service to the general run of country newspapers, and I venture to assert that the combined influence of the country press is pretty well on a par with that of the daily press. If we give the country press increased facilities for publishing cable news, we shall add still further to its influence. There are many daily newspapers in New&#39; South Wales and Victoria, and there will be more if the facilities are improved for securing early cable news of special significance to Australia. I understand that it is the aim of the Minister that such news shall be supplied, and I have no doubt that in New South Wales at least  300  newspapers will proceed at once to avail themselves of this new service. What is known as the Independent Cable Service Company is air off-shoot of the New South Wales Country Press Co-operative Society, and is therefore directly representative of some  300  country papers which would at once participate in this service, and I suppose that about the same number in Victoria would take advantage of it. Indeed, I understand that there is already a movement to coalesce so far as the advantages of this scheme are concerned. Honorable members are often asked to view matters mI this kind from a non-partisan stand-point but such appeals as a rule have but little effect. If honorable members view this, matter from a non-party stand-point, if. they are really desirous of the effective distribution of early news of special interest to Australia, they will recognise that that object cannot be secured unless an effort is made to supply direct cable news to the people by channels . other than those through which it is now available. Under present conditions a new metropolitan* daily newspaper cannot be started. A. daily paper could not afford to pay- for a separate service, and, therefore, one could not be started in opposition to the present metropolitan daily journals since the latter would not share with any competitor their present cable service. The members of the Association do not mind selling to the country press, at a nominal sum, some of the cable news which they receive, but they will not sell to an outside metropolitan daily. Hence they have to a great extent a monopoly of public opinion. By virtue of the fact that they and they alone can afford to acquire this early cable news, they have <inline font-style="italic">n</inline> monopoly of public opinion, and that is the most pernicious influence that could be enjoyed by any monopoly. </para>

                        <para>- But many honorable members only received it to-day. The motion, instead of being submitted in Committee, where we could have dealt with it more freely, and probably, in- the end, with less delay, has been brought forward in the House, and the Minister in moving it has made a most interesting and useful speech. I had no conception that it was proposed to proceed with the motion immediately, and therefore did not follow the honorable gentleman&#39;s speech with the close attention necessary to enable one to continue the debate. It is all very well for the honorable gentleman to say that this is only a matter of &#163;6, boo. For whilst the amount is not large, the scheme itself marks a new departure. Ministers and those who support them, having adopted this precedent, will experience great difficulty in drawing the line fairly excluding similar experiments. We have to deal with this proposition on its own merits, but as marking an entirely new departure. If it be accepted, simply because some ground can be found for taking action in this particular instance, the question arises how many other interests are affected in the same way by private action, with which-, to be consistent, we ought to meddle by granting a subsidy, or in some other way ? </para>

                        <para>- It intervenes for the gain of some and the loss of others&#34;, by proposing a material alteration of this business. The statement that the present service is a monopoly has been challenged. I am not prepared, because I have not had sufficient time to examine the report of the Select Committee, and the evidence on which it is based, to judge whether it is a monopoly in any sense of the term. What I understand is&#39; meant is that there is a practical monopoly in cable news that may be upset at any moment, but cannot be easily competed with except by those who have at their back considerable funds. I may be mistaken, but am driven to draw that inference from the speech made by the Minister in submitting the motion, and the interjections of some of his followers. Except in that sense, I do not know that any monopoly exists in this case. If it be a monopoly only in that sense, there are certainly many illustrations to be drawn from our every day business experience which would justify similar intervention. In that fact we have the importance of this proposal. But no others are promised or hinted at. Why? I do not wish to labour the point; but Ministers would have dealt more satisfactorily with the House, and with those likely to make a critical review of this question, had they given us time to refresh our memories. Business is being pressed on in a manner that I have not seen previously employed. </para>

How can we bring ourselves up to date in order to deal with them? I feel the task extremely heavy already, and it is certainly added to by the action of Ministers in breaking novel ground by introducing at short notice a motion of this kind. Its object was elaborately explained by the Minister,  showing that he felt the gravity of the situation, and that he required time to put before the House the matured results of his examination of the question. That being so, what time should be given to us, since we are dependent upon the Minister for the greater part of the information we possess? Clearly we have here a great inequality. Do what we will, we cannot put ourselves in the same position of advantage as the Minister. We are very unfairly handicapped. </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">On the general question of the improvement and increase of the supply of oversea news there will be no difference of opinion. &#34; European and other oversea cable news&#34; is a very general phrase; but there is a little further definition lower down. However, so far, no exception need be taken. It is then proposed that Government assistance shall be given, and that at once affords ample opportunity for argument for those who foresee the consequences of the action. As stated by the Minister, circumstances go to show that a state of affairs exists which might be improved on; and from that he leaps to the conclusion that the improvement should be by some action of the Government. 1 shall not pursue that point, because, after all, I desire to reach two or three matters which appear to be more open to review. The Minister then proceeds to propose that the assistance shall be in the form of a subsidy, and that, again, is clearly open to argument. There are other ways of improving and increasing the supply of oversea cable news, and, of course, one of the first to suggest itself is simply to reduce the cable rates for press messages. The proprietors of journals are owners of a very important class of property ; . but, after all, it is private property, held by private persons, and managed in private interests. That is a statement which applies equally -to the press of all parties and of all denominational colours - they are private enterprises, in private hands, carried on to further private aims or private advantage. Consequently, a reduction in cable rates would be the broadest, and, using the word in its natural sense, the most Democratic shape that Government assistance could take. </para>

                        <para>-On that point the Minister is informed, whereas I am not. I could not say off-hand what <inline font-style="italic">the &#163;A,</inline> 000, or the ,&#163;2,500 in the first year, would accomplish in that way. But even if it were more expensive, the course I suggest has the great advantage, first of all, of being absolutely unrestricted and non-partisan, and, next, of involving no Government responsibility, direct or indirect, for any of the news transmitted. I shall not labour those points, though both are well worthy of consideration. Unless the monetary expense is out of all reason, there can be no doubt that the simplest form in which this House could give effect to the desire of the Minister would be by a reduction in the rates - allowing the people of Australia and all interested persons to take advantage of those rates to the extent they find desirable in their own interests. </para>

                        <para>- It would be much easier&#39; for those outside the existing organization to form a new one, and I should say it would be much harder to maintain any special advantage which&#39; the existing combination enjoys. My suggestion is certainly, as I have said, the manner most suitable for Government action since it makes the least discrimination, and points to no suspicion of bias in the interests of any parties. At the same time, it would encourage, I take it, such a development in the transmission of intelligence as might make up any loss occasioned in the first instance. For whatever the public have become familiar with, or accustomed to, they at least would share the advantages to be obtained from any extension of the cable news service. </para>

                        <para>- As I have said, I do not know whether it is a monopoly or not. On looking at the report of the Senate&#39;s Select Committee, I find this organization so defined on the ground that it has the only source of supply of news from the other side of the world.. There could be as many organizations as people choose to form, but because there is only one organization, the Select Committee call it a monopoly. True, it stands alone, but not as a monopoly in the sense in which that word is generally employed, namely, to indicate a body that is so entrenched that it is secured from rivalry except after an alteration of the law, or by some special agency outside the power of other organizations. In the present instance, it is open to anybody and everybody at any time to form another news organization ; and, at present, the only advantage is that of the people in possession and position. Plainly, the short and straight road, if the House is satisfied that Government assistance should be given, would be by a reduction of the rates. That might be still more limited by indicating in a general way that the reduction was made to obtain news of advantage to, and desirable for, Australia, apart from particular interests, classes, or sections. However, I do not wish to dwell on that any further. If we must go further, and adopt this form of subsidy which the Minister favours, we next find ourselves face to face with the conditions which it is suggested should be imposed. These are worthy of being discussed in detail, but I shall not attempt to do so. I come at once to the principal point contained in the third condition, which is that at least 6,000 words of the cable service are to be transmitted each week from Europe or America by way of the Pacific Cable. This cable is selected because we are partners in it, and, at present, in spite of the growing business are still paying towards its deficit, created, not by its actual working day by day, but by providing a sinking fund for renewals. I believe I am correct in saying, roughly speaking, that the Pacific Cable is now paying more than working expenses, or ordinary charges. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so, but the information is limited to that of Australian interest. Then, the motion provides that the Government shall impose such conditions as may be necessary to secure that the public obtain the fullest possible benefit from the subsidized service. I dare say that what the Minister had in his mind was the fullest possible encouragement that could be given to the use of the service for this particular purpose, but it is also capable, whether intended or not, of being read with condition No. 7, by which the matter sent is restricted to information of Australian interest. I ventured by interjection to&#39; indicate that this opened up another side to the question which we cannot ignore if we would. If we adopted the alternative of simply reducing the rates we should have no further responsibility, since everybody would stand on the same footing; but when, instead of thus throwing open the doors,  we limit the subsidy to a particular Association of interested persons, subject to such conditions as we think fit to impose, it at once creates a responsibility in us for the cable messages to be encouraged. The Government show this when they limit the High Commissioner to matters of Australian interest ; and, whether we like it or not, if we enter this field of action, taking an active part in the business, either by creating or supporting one special organization and that alone,, we cannot escape responsibility for the character of the messages sent. I have no desire to see questions of. this sort forced on our consideration in Parliament, but, if we must consider them, let us seek for the broadest and least contentious ground. </para>

                        <para>- As I said before, if we simply lowered the rates for press messages we have no responsibility whatever in regard to those messages, but if, instead of lowering the rates, we offer a subsidy to one organization, laying down conditions as to its methods of work, we cannot stop short with the requirement that it shall send 6,000 words a week. We are subsidizing it to send that number of words, and become, as a Parliament, responsible for the use made of that power. If the Government do not think so, why do they put in that intimation to the High Commissioner that he is only to send matters of Australian interest? </para>

                        <para>- The Government are right to keep it in, because it recognises the responsibilities that they are accepting. It seems to me that a similar qualification should be applied to those 6,000 words - that they should relate to the public affairs of the Empire. The only case to which the Minister was able to point as a precedent for the course he is proposing to follow, of subsidizing an organization, was in Canada, and there the arrangement was completed by the condition imposed by the Canadian Government on the subsidized organization that the messages must relate to Empire news ; that the 6.000 words which the organization is to send per week should be confined to cables relating to the public affairs of the Empire. If they want to send messages about the private affairs of distinguished society people, or others, let them send them at their own expense. They are entitled to send them as news, but it is no advantage to Australia to encourage the use of the cable for those purposes. So I could point to a variety of subjects with which, if they choose to deal by cable, in the exercise of their freedom, as caterers for the public, that is their business, and not ours. </para>

                        <para>- There are two points involved. So far as I understand, what is done in regard to the High Commissioner&#39;s messages, for which the Government pay press rates, they make arrangements with him as to what he shall send, and it goes to every one. Then there is the requirement that there must be 6,000 words sent, and for these we give a subsidy to a special organization. I contend that those words ought to be limited to news of the Empire in the largest sense, and more particularly its public affairs. Under public affairs, I include production, industries, and commerce, as well as news of the Parliaments, and matters of interest of that kind. What I exclude are sporting news, which we are not interested in subsidizing, the extravagances of multi-millionaires, the horrors of murder, catastrophes in out-of-the-way corners of the world, and so on. For instance, we have had columns of the adventures of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Crippen,  and his pursuit. Those are matters of news, which if the press choose to supply them, I suppose they know their own readers. It is their business, not ours. But surely there is more than enough news about the Empire, which ought to be known in Australia, and which it would be to the advantage of Australia to know. We ought to get that in the 6,000 words. At present, it appears to me, entirely from a non business stand-point, that the frivolous and sensational side-issues of European and American life receive more attention than they deserve; while certainly the serious, deeper, and graver subjects that affect the interests of Australia, bound up as they are with those of the Mother Country, South Africa, and Canada- </para>

                        <para>- As a rule, but at times very comic. If the honorable member  refers to any advances in the movement, or alterations in its platform, those, of course, are serious; but any ludicrous little accident to a Labour man, or a member of any other party, would probably be cabled out, while a solid speech full of important matter, and deserving of every consideration, would often be ignored. We cannot pretend to cope with these vagaries, or revise cables, but when we establish a particular organization, subsidize it exclusively, and supply news, we are entitled to ask for matter of some serious import to the Commonwealth. We get it now to a large extent, but we desire to be assured of more. That is no limitation of the motion. I have no ambition to father a particular amendment, and if the Minister will shape one in any form which on the best information he can obtain appears to him wise, I am prepared to fall in with it. But we have the responsibility and cannot evade it. If we stipulate for a certain amount of cable news, and give certain concessions for it, we ought to put the most important and valuable news first, and leave the less important and valuable to be sent independently of the  6,000  words. </para>

This motion is another illustration that if you once leave the safe ground of public interests, simply lowering the cable rates and allowing everybody to do as he pleases - if you go beyond that, pick and subsidize your organization, and fix the number of words to be sent, you are at once drawn, whether you like it or not, into a certain responsibility. Honorable members might add condition to condition until in the end the whole thing might become a Government sub-Department. Once you start on this line there is no given point at which you are required to stop.

                        <para>- I know it is not new, and simply call attention to the obligations which it brings with it. We can only get the fullest possible benefit from the subsidized service by asking ourselves what news Australia wants from London. It wants, I take it, news of the Empire, of real progress on the industrial, manufacturing, and commercial sides, and also some acquaintance with the political interests and developments of the Mother Country, which are coming much closer to our own than they were a few years ago. If we are to have this organization, and fulfil what appears to have been the conception which the Government had in their minds when drafting the motion, that seems to be a necessary condition. I am sorry there is not time for me to do more justice to the subject. Of course the Minister comes here, as he should, master of his subject, and has given an extremely clear exposition. All I can do is to take it up at an hour&#39;s notice, and add these comments. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think any members of the Opposition can charge the Government with making very much of a new departure in this proposal. Had the Government gone on those Socialistic lines of which we have heard so much, they would have proposed to arrange for a Government supply of cable news from the Old World to this side of the globe. This is a kind of intermediary scheme in keeping with what has been done in a number of countries, although it is somewhat of a departure in the line which has been taken up. The subject is associated with the education of the people and as Governments in Australia take up other branches of public education, they are justified in interposing in this matter also. I do not think anybody is satisfied with the kind of cable service which Australia now has. and no one should grumble about the small amount which the Government are proposing to expend over a. period of three years in order to encourage the  setting up of an improved, or rival, cable service. Those honorable members who believe so strongly in the principle of competition ought to hail with satisfaction this proposal of the Government to increase competition. </para>

                        <para>- It is part of that evolutionary development which the Labour party recognise is the only way to achieve ultimate success. It is worth while considering how we get the miserable epitome of news that at present appears. The honorable member for Ballarat has very properly referred to some of the samples that we read. Any one who looks at the cable news daily will see quite a number of things which it is astonishing that the newspapers bother to print at all. It has become quite a standard item of the cable service that the High Commissioner had a dinner. Seeing that everybody expects a dinner every day, I do not know that it should be of sufficient importance to cable out from the Old World that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid dined. Any kind of sensational crime fills the columns of the papers, but we know practically nothing of important events in the Old World unless we take the trouble to read the papers when they reach us by mail. What happens at present is that practically one man, or two at the most, edit all that comes here. This man sits in an office and gets, say, an advance proof sheet of the London <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> which, of course, has its own service to collect news. He marks with a red pencil the matters which he thinks of first importance, and with a blue pencil those which he thinks of secondary importance. This is passed on to a sub-editor, who, knowing the number of words  required  for Australia, picks out sufficient. This is then typed and cabled out, The news comes out to a close combine, which permits the proprietors of country newspapers to have only part of it. The proprietors of the metropolitan dailies of Victoria will not allow the country press of the State to receive the cream of the cables. Under this arrangement the big city journals get cable news at very little cost. On a former occasion I read the statement in a leading article of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> that there is no interference, and that any newspaper proprietor can get cables. But at the half yearly meeting of the company controlling that journal it was stated by the  chairman  of the board of directors, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Randall</inline> Carey, that they had succeeded in renewing the arrangement for another five years, which would render it practically impossible for another newspaper to enter into competition with them, except at the cost of establishing a special cable service of its own. </para>

I had in my possession the document in which it was published. It is generally known that a newspaper cannot join the Association except by the permission of those who form it. Of course, any one can start a fresh association, and the Government is desirous of making it worth while to establish a rival to that now existing. To this end it proposes a subsidy of &#163;6,000. The present Association gets most of its news from the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> reports, and the cablegrams which are sent out are Conservative in tone. We have to depend for our news from the Old World on what one man chooses to tell us. * </para>

It must not be forgotten, too, that censorship is exercised over what appears in the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> and the other London dailies. The effect of news on the public, or on the share market, is carefully studied. The American Press Association represents some 200 newspapers, which publish statements of occurrences within the British Empire which are never found in the British newspapers. To be told half the truth is more misleading than to be told nothing. </para>

                        <para>- It may be coloured, and it is often sensational. My point is that, owing to the censorship in Great Britain, we are not fully informed of the happenings in the world at large. The average reader is glad to find sensational matter in his newspaper. But we should  encourage the transmission of news of importance. Were it proposed to grant a perpetual subsidy, we should do well to consider the difficulties suggested by the last speaker. But we have before us only a proposal for the granting of a subsidy to encourage the development of a new industry, or the supplying to Australia of better news than can be obtained under the present restricted service. </para>

                <para class="block">Some honorable members may regard these as proper commercial methods, but they result in the community getting less news of the world than it should have. We have been trying to interest our people in our association with the Empire, and to do this more fully our citizens should be informed of what is happening abroad, especially where the news is of interest to Australia. At present much of the news sent out is mere rubbish. Notwithstanding the cheapness of the cable service .to the newspaper proprietors, who have found out the value of the co-operative idea, they have not had the enterprise to improve the service. I believe that there is a widespread demand for news of a different character from that now received. Rapid developments have taken place in the Old World of which we should be fully informed, and any proposal to effect this result should be supported. &#39; </para>

                        <para>- The desire for news of importance is increasing. Education in the large sense is spreading, and more thinking is being done, especially since Federation. Even the man in the street&#39; is disgusted with much of the news that is cabled to the newspapers. The Australian Democracy is not interested in learning that some one of whom they know nothing has obtained a divorce, or has attended a banquet. Such information does not interest Australians to any extent, but they are interested in learning of our relations with Germany, of developments in India, or other matters associated with the relationship of the Empire to the Continent of Europe. All such matters are read with increasing interest, and I think that if this proposal leads to an improved cable service the Australian public will rejoice, and say that at a cost of  &#163;6,000  per annum it is decidedly cheap. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister has not -extended to us that consideration to which we are entitled, in asking the House to discuss this motion before many of us were aware even of its appearance on the notice-paper.  1  confess that I had not seen it until this morning, and I complain of the hurried way in which we are asked to deal with what is undoubtedly a new departure. I do not think this undue haste will lead to the question being dealt with more speedily than it would be if we were given time to obtain the information that we need. I had to appeal to the Minister of External Affairs, during the luncheon adjournment, to tell me exactly what the Government proposed.&#39; I wished to know whether the Government themselves were to receive the contributions of newspapers taking advantage of the proposed new service-in which case the State would make money out of the venture - or whether some other course was to be followed. The exact intentions of the Government are not clearly shown in the motion, although they may perhaps be inferred, and  1  learned from the Minister that the Association selected to do this work is to receive not only the Government subsidy, but the contributions of subscribers to the service. There is no justification for the haste which has been shown in pressing this . motion through the House. The request made by the Leader of the Opposition for the adjournment of the debate ought to have been agreed to. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member himself, as he admitted, was not really prepared to speak when called upon to do so, and thought that some one else should have filled the breach. He would have been heard to better advantage if more time had been given him for the consideration of the motion. I do not believe in injurious monopolies, and certainly do not favour an injurious press monopoly. The newspapers receive cable messages at rates below those extended to the general public, and they should do nothing to exclude others from the benefits conferred upon them in that respect. It may be argued, however, that any private organization should be free to make its own terms in regard to obtaining and disposing of news. That is quite a common occurrence. When a man has a good business, he is not prepared to let every one into it; but when a substantial concession is made to the press in the matter of cable charges, in order that the public shall be supplied, at a reasonable cost, with adequate news, we have a right to see that no monopoly injurious to the public is created. The difficulty of which complaint is made by honorable members opposite might have been overcome without granting a subsidy. The Government of the Commonwealth, &#39; having a voice in the control of the Pacific cable, and complete control of the land telegraph lines, might have induced its partners to agree that nothing in the shape of a press monopoly injurious to the country should be allowed to exist in connexion with it. I have no doubt that those who in the beginning constituted a preserve or combine would meet the wishes of the public, especially when they knew that if they failed to do so, voluntarily, compulsion might be resorted to. We know that what was at one time said to be a close preserve, has changed considerably during the last two years. I understand that any newspaper may now obtain the Association&#39;s cable news if it likes to contribute what is required. </para>

                        <para>- One member of the Association is not, I understand, charged more than another. My plausible friend, the honorable member for Darling, has complained of the character of the cable news that is published in the Australian press, but he overlooks the fact that newspapers which have to cater for all shades of public opinion are members of the existing Association. That being so, his argument falls to the ground. We know that the metropolitan daily newspapers in this State have differing political views. Would the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> run in double harness if under the existing arrangement favoritism were shown to one side or the other ? We may rest assured that the proprietors of those newspapers do their best to obtain fair news, and the news which they disseminate is not opposed to what .one reads when the Old World newspapers are received. There is, in my opinion, no cause for complaint in regard to the news of the world published in the morning newspapers  here. I understand that a Labour newspaper, the publication of which was commenced in Adelaide quite recently, found some difficulty in getting into the press cable syndicate. </para>

                        <para>- It is satisfactory to have that assurance. Another question that I desire to ask relates to the selection of the association to which this subsidy is to be paid. If several make application for the nomination of the Government, which is to receive it? Then, again, what guarantee shall we have that the association selected to receive the subsidy will transmit cable messages that will meet the news requirements of the general public of Australia? It may send out news unacceptable even to the Ministerial party. The whole scheme is an attempt to do by means of a subsidized private agency that which, if it needs to be done, should be undertaken by the Government. If this step is necessary, it would be far better to appoint a Government officer at Home rather than a private press agency, to transmit news to Australia, but I expect he would find a difficulty in obtaining it. I do not approve, however, of the adoption of that course, for I believe that the news requirements of the people are best catered for by those enterprising persons who make it a business to collect and disseminate information of interest to the public. We have no guarantee that the position will be met under this scheme. It may be met from the Ministerial point of view, if an association that will cater for their particular interest is appointed to do this work. Even if such an appointment be made, however, I do not think that an association, working from the other side of the world, is likely to do much good for the Labour  party  in Australia. The Labour party have promised, however, that a Labour newspaper shall be established in each of the State capitals, and, apparently, those newspapers are to secure their cable news at the expense of the State. Why can they not stand upon their own foundation, and obtain their own news without asking the State to provide it for them? I am inclined to favour that all newspapers be allowed to participate, on fair terms, in the news sent over the public cables, at specially reduced rates. I do not wish to interfere unduly with private enterprise, but I can well understand that it is fairly  difficult for a newspaper to make a start if it has to pay considerably more for its cable messages than others doing the same business have to pay. I should be glad to obviate that difficulty, not by granting a subsidy, but by making regulations in regard to the transmission of press messages over our cables. </para>

                        <para>- We have no information as to the class of people who are to be selected to supply this oversea news, or as to what their political views are to be. As a matter of fact, I do not observe any strong political leaning in the messages from the Old World that are published in the newspapers to-day. We are advised of movements in Imperial and Continental politics, and I have not observed any colouring in the press messages now published. I admit that I have assumed that news so published is selected with care, and based upon fact, and I have not . discovered anything to lead me to believe that I am mistaken in that assumption. I repeat that the Government should not have forced this motion upon the House before we had had an opportunity to speak to those mostly interested in it, and that we are embarking upon a new principle, which must prove unsatisfactory. </para>

                    <para>. - Having sat on the Opposition benches for nearly ten years, I have some  sympathy with the contention of the right honorable member for Swan that time should have been allowed for considering a motion of this kind. I am not so far removed from my experience of the disadvantages with which an Opposition has to contend as to lack sympathy in that regard, but I should like to remind the honorable member that this question does not come before us to-day for the first time. It has been engaging the attention of many people, and certainly ought to have been engaging the attention of honorable members on both sides, for a considerable time past. This is not a matter of a grievance of the Labour party, but a grievance of the general public, who feel that their interests are not properly catered for by the present combination. That feeling secured expression in the appointment of a Select Committee by the Senate in the last Parliament. Before that Committee witnesses were called representing all the interests concerned, including the present Association; and it was open to all to set forth their views. We have now the report of that Select Committee; and we must remember that it is not a matter of opinion, but a matter of evidence, though the finding was certainly in the direction in which the Government are now moving. </para>

                        <para>- Those newspapers found that by combining their services they could secure cheaper cable news ; and I take no exception to that; but one of the conditions of the association was that the combined service should be their special property. It is said that it is open to any other newspaper or newspapers to establish an independent service; but the conditions that the Association helped to create were wholly in their own favour, and against any opposition of the kind. In fact, they established a preserve so close that, according to the evidence before the Select Committee, a majority of the members could not extend the service to any other publication, because the rules demanded the unanimous consent of every party to it. We are told by honorable members opposite that this condition is not now in force. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, this shows how close and binding the combination was; and if the condition has been relaxed, it is only in response to the pressure of public opinion. The Association did agree to admit other newspapers on certain conditions. It has been stated) and, I believe, correctly, that some of the first promoters of the Association are able to reap profit - that newspapers which join are called upon to pay a rate so high that the original members of the Association not only obtain free news, but also reap monetary gain. Further, the newspapers which did not originally belong to the combination have now, when admitted, to agree, under a severe penalty of&#163;1,000, not to publish news from any other source. </para>

                        <para>- That does not make the condition less unjust, and the principals have the right of determining the kind of news sent, the other participants having no say in such matters. One objection that has been made to the Government&#39;s proposal is that its object is to provide news for Labour journals. I do not think, however, that that allegation can stand the test of investigation. The proposal of the Minister stipulates that the news obtained shall be supplied, not only to Labour newspapers, but to every newspaper in the country, which so desires, on equal terms, whether that newspaper represents the extreme of Labourism or the extreme of Conservatism. That is not so under the present monopoly control of the cable. The Association now determines the conditions under which the service shall be used, and the particular class of newspapers that shall use it; and there is no power to compel any alteration of that determination. A newspaper which is antagonistic, either commercially or politically, to the Association, is entirely at its mercy. The honorable member for Parkes claims that practically all the great newspapers are commercial concerns which endeavour to meet the needs of the community. So far as I can gather, however, those newspapers are something more than commercial propositions, seeing that they endeavour to control and determine the politics of Australia. </para>

This Newspaper Association, as I say, aims at dictating the policy of the country, and it is one of the healthy signs of the independence of our national life and thought that the community, at the last general election, refused to be drummed into a particular line. However, the fact cannot be denied that the aim of those great publications, particularly those which control the Press Cable Combine, is partly commercial and partly to determine the politics of this country. That being so, they colour the news, and take only what is acceptable to their particular policy. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member has better information than I have he can give the House the advantage of it when he speaks. My contention is that the news transmitted by cable is of a character that suits the Conservative political tastes of the combination that controls the service. Consequently other papers which have nothing to do with determining the character of the news sent, but which receive their news from that source, are helpless. They have to take the information, coloured as it is, or leave it. There is no other source from which they can get it. I should like to refer honorable members to some interviews and press criticisms which appeared at the time when the English delegates to the Conference of Chambers of Commerce visited Australia a little while ago, and particularly to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Albert</inline> Spicer with regard to our cable service. He pointed out how inadequately Australia was served in this respect, and it was a matter of surprise to him&#34;, as a leading Englishman both in the commercial and political world, that this should be so. He declared in the course of an interview that justice was not done to the Liberal party and the Liberalism of Great Britain per medium of the doctored Conservative news transmitted to Australia by cable. That appeals very strongly to me as a reason why we should be no longer satisfied as a community to receive our news of happenings in the Mother Country from this politically tainted source. We should be in a position to supply the thinking people of Australia, particularly as we are more Liberal than Conservative, with full and correct news of the trend of politics in the Old Country. It is impossible to get that kind of news from the existing cable combine and under existing conditions. In the interests of the people of the whole of Australia, and of correct information with respect to the trend of events in the Old World and in America, the Government are doing wisely in submitting a proposal to subsidize a company that will be formed to battle with the great octopus syndicate to which I have referred, and provide Australian readers with the kind of information of which they are now deprived. I am asked if we can guarantee that we shall get that information. To my mind there is no doubt about it. It is hardly likely that another&#39; company will enter the arena simply to cater for the news which a big company already supplies. If a new organization wants to obtain a footing, <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> must strike out on new lines, and there are ample opportunities for it to do so. I, for one, have no fear that that particular need of Australia will not be amply catered for. Another aspect of this proposal calls for. attention. We have what is known as the All-Red cable service, one of the aims and purposes of which is to bring cable communication between Australia, Canada, and the Mother Country directly under British control, and as far as possible under the control of the Governments representing those portions of the Empire. We have constructed a cable between Australia and Canada, and the deficiency, on its working is guaranteed by the Governments of Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. . Thai: cable service has had considerable opposition to contend with on the part of the Eastern Extension Company, as was only to be expected, seeing that the new service is cutting into the special preserves of that company. For some years past there has been a deficiency on the working expenses of this section of the cable of from ,&#163;60,000 to &#163;^80,000 per annum, and to this we have to contribute in common with the other guarantors. Although we have reduced the cable charges for the purpose of securing a larger and cheaper measure of European news for Australian purposes, the existing press combination has entered into an arrangement with the Eastern Extension Company that practically takes from the Pacific Cable all the revenue that should come from the reduced charges that we have instituted, and gives it to the. private company. This shuts out the line which we are subsidizing and endeavouring to build up into an All British line. As an evidence of the extent to which this is done, there was recently an event in San Francisco quite close to the point from which our line starts - an event which, although not very creditable in itself, excited a great deal of interest.  1  refer to the late boxing contest between Johnson and Jeffries. A very large section of the community here was on the <inline font-style="italic">qui vive</inline> for the latest returns and fullest particulars of that event. The press combination to which I have referred sent over our guaranteed All-Red cable line only about half-a-dozen words, simply intimating who the victor in the contest was, while it sent messages to the extent of about 2,000 words across Canada, and across the Atlantic to Great Britain, and then <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> India to Australia by the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s lines. Consequently our cable, although located in a special position of advantage, was used only to an insignificant extent, whereas the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s service was utilized to the extent of about 2,000 words to convey this information to the Australian people. I am glad, in the interests of the All-Red route, that the Minister makes it one of the conditions of the proposed subsidy that it shall be paid for messages sent over the cable for which we are responsible, and any deficiency&#39; on the working of which we have to help to make up. I am asked if I claim that there is an understanding between the Eastern Extension and the Pacific Cable services. There is not. They are rivals, and their rivalry is strong and pronounced, but my information is that there is a very close understanding -between the <inline font-style="italic">ArgusHerald</inline> Press Cable Combine and the Eastern Extension Company. There is pretty fair evidence that that understanding does exist, because the Cable Combine could get their news equally as cheaply and also get it quicker per medium of the Pacific Cable if they desired than through the Eastern Extension Company ; but the instance I have given shows that they do not choose to do so. I am further informed that, as the outcome of a recent arrangement with the Eastern Extension Company, the Cable Combine are getting, or will very shortly get, their messages sent here, not at ninepence per word as laid down in the agreement with the Government, but at threepence per word. That is arranged in this way : The messages are transmitted from London with Australia as as their objective, but they have what are called drop services at half-a-dozen points in India and Africa, and the cost of  the whole service is so distributed that the ultimate charge for the message when it reaches Australia is reduced to that extent. </para>

                        <para>- Not at all, but it shows how a great combination like this can make it practically impossible for a single newspaper proprietary, or even a fairly considerable combination of proprietors, to fight it. It would not be possible for the  present cable syndicate to have such a cheapened service unless the Eastern Extension Company was in sympathy with, if not an active participant in, its doings. A new association for the collection and cabling of news from the Old Country would scarcely be able to make such favorable terms for the transmission of  messages  at the Australian end as the, <inline font-style="italic">HeraldArgus</inline> combination has made. </para>

                        <para>- Fortunately this matter is controlled by the Government, and not by the  President  of the Country Press Association. The extent of the Cable Combine&#39;s monopoly is well known in New South Wales. A daily .newspaper could not start in Sydney unless it was prepared to pay for a special cable service. Not many months since an evening paper there negotiated to secure the benefits of the new service recently established, but its proprietary was told that if it published any messages beyond those supplied by the Combine, it would be called upon to forfeit the sum of ^1,000. That newspaper has been reconstructed, and to-day is publishing the news flashed across the Pacific cable, with the result that its readers get information of interest and variety sometimes twenty-four or forty-eight hours before it appears in the other newspapers. I have been told that particulars of the recent disastrous floods in Japan were published in that journal a couple of days before they appeared in the other newspapers. It is important that the people of Australia should have early information of what is happening elsewhere, and that news should not be suppressed because it does not suit a particular policy. We should be fully informed of the political movements in the Mother Country and  elsewhere. We know that the news which we now get is censored to some extent. Furthermore, as the honorable member for Macquarie has pointed out, important news is often kept back from country newspapers until the metropolitan newspapers have published it. As conductor of a country daily newspaper, he has had wide practical experience. The Government proposal prevents the confining of cable news to a circle of newspaper proprietors, and gives to all the benefits of the cable service without respect to party politics. The publication of news obtained from this source will not prevent the publication of news from any other source, and the arrangement will place the struggling newspaper proprietors of the country on the same footing as their city competitors. The proposal is not to favour a few publications, Labour or anti-Labour, but to give all newspaper proprietors the maximum amount of information, and liberty to use it. The Minister&#39;s proposal is well worth the consideration and support of all who are opposed to monopoly. This is the only way of dealing with what is undoubtedly a monopoly. Some honorable members opposite have attempted to limit the news which is to be sent to information of purely Australian interest. If the Minister listens <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the suggestions which have been made in this direction, he will frustrate the end which he has in view. The object should be to get as much general news as possible for Australian readers, and to break down the present Conservative monopoly. The limitation which has been suggested would play into the hands of the present Combine. It would not achieve the purposes which, according to the Committee which investigated the matter, should be held in view. </para>

                    <para>.- The supporters of the Ministry who are trying to justify this proposal have spent their time in traducing the present cable service, which is undoubtedly an admirable one. Our newspapers cannot afford to devote more than a certain amount of space to the publication of cable news, and it is necessary that as much variety as possible should be given in what is cabled from the Old World. I do not say that the present system could not be improved, but, according to the report of the Select Committee which sat last year, the weekly average of the words sent to the combination increased from 1,500 in 1906, to nearly 5,000 in 1909. </para>

                        <para>- Yes <inline font-style="italic">; the</inline> increase was gradual. The total expenditure of the Association for the three and a-half years ending 9th June, 1909, was &#163;51,786, and its income - receipts for cable news sold - &#163;30,805, leaving it to seven newspaper proprietors to pay the balance of &#163;20,981. The cost of collecting and distributing the news apart from the cost of cabling is very considerable. The Reuter Association has <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> system of coding which is very complete, and enables news to be condensed in London and expanded here in a manner which greatly reduces expense. The Association is able to collect its news from the most approved sources in London. I understand that it has the control of advanced proof sheets of the principal London newspapers. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that evidence to that effect was tendered to the Select Committee. Reuter also has agencies in different parts of the world, and has built up at tremendous cost in the large centres of Europe special means of acquiring information. That being so, wc shall not only require to subsidize cable messages in order that we may obtain news in competition with the existing Association, but will find it necessary to have a means of collecting, coding,, and receiving that news in a way that will successfully compete with the work of Reuter&#39;s great coding company. </para>

                        <para>- As the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, this proposal to subsidize a new service involves a very considerable responsibility. If the Government take upon- themselves the right to exercise a censorship over the 6,000 words per week to be transmitted, they will have to adopt some means of giving that news to the public, and I can scarcely conceive of any way of doing that other than by a national newspaper. If that is what is intended we ought to be informed of it. </para>

A new service would not only supply more information, but would probably tend to moderate the charges of the present Association. </para>

My own experience is that country newspapers can obtain messages from Reuter - and I am speaking now not of daily newspapers published in country towns, but of those published once, twice, or thrice a week - at a rate that is scarcely more than one-fifth of the maximum rate in the schedule to the motion. </para>

                        <para>- They are not. As a matter of fact, the cost of transmitting the cable messages over the land wires is the biggest handicap that country newspaper proprietors have to face. I know that from actual experience. My impression is that if this subsidy be paid the new service will not be availed of to a very large extent by proprietors of newspapers published once or twice a week in provincial towns, although it may be largely availed of by the dailies df the metropolis and the large provincial centres. It is possible, indeed, that the subsidy will be mopped up by a few newspapers published in large centres of population. We should, if possible, use our powers in this direction to bring about a system of competition that will tend to extend the news that Australia should undoubtedly obtain as a part of the Empire. If the Parliament can do that to advantage it should do so.- </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable member. If the Government think that the  &#163;6,000  proposed to be expended will make good the difference between failure and success on the part: of any rival newspapers that it is proposed to publish in the metropolitan centres of Australia they are making a very big mistake. A much larger subsidy will be necessary, if there is to be any substantial competition with the existing service. </para>

                        <para>- It may have that effect, so far as newspapers published in the cities are concerned ; but, according to the figures appearing in the schedule, it is not to be assumed that the Association&#39;s charges to subscribers are excessive. The real difficulty is that those who wish to start a rival newspaper are not allowed to readily join the Association. That is a very serious difficulty, and should be dealt with if a reasonable way of dealing with it can be devised. </para>

                        <para>- As to the contention that it is a monopoly, there is another view to take. A monopoly becomes injurious when it acts in restraint of trade. But honorable members will agree that, with the advent of new type-setting machinery, the quantity of general news, as well as the volume of cable news published, has been of a very substantial character. The difficulty could have been best met by tackling the problem of the Pacific Cable Board. We have what is substantially a cable of our own, and are already paying  &#163;20,000  out of the deficiency of  &#163;60,000  annually sustained in respect of it. The Government should have attacked that deficiency before bringing in legislation of this character. We have our own postal and telegraph services throughout Australia, and I think that the Government would be justified, under existing conditions, in exerting their powers in connexion with those services to compel business messages to be sent over the Pacific cable. That would tend to wipe out the deficiency, which is, after all, one of the real questions that ought to be tackled. We compel telegraphic business to be carried over our own lines, and as we have a monopoly of the telegraph business of Australia, why should we not take care that our own business communications with the Old Country are made over our own cable? </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but I understand that Reuter has so complete a system of coding that, so far, no company has been able to compete with it. That is a matter into which the Government should inquire. The Government ought to do all that is possible to wipe out the present deficiency in respect of the working of the Pacific cable. If they did so, there would be some reason for voting a very big subsidy, if &#34;necessary, in order to reduce the cost of cable messages between London and Australia. That is a direction in which the Government might well step. They should use their powers to broaden and liberalize communication between Great Britain and Australia; but let them do so in a way that will leave all of the advantages open to the whole press of Australia. If the Government become involved in a scheme which will mean their exercising a censorship over the news transmitted by cable from London, that news can be distributed only by the publication of a national newspaper. If the Government are to determine what shall be the character of the news to be sent from London to Australia - news, such as was indicated by the Leader of the Opposition, of which we ought to know - it will be necessary to circulate the news. It .is not possible for the Government to compel newspaper proprietors to circulate certain news ; and, under the circumstances, the Government having undertaken the duty and responsibility of seeing that a certain class of news is telegraphed, it will be necessary to establish a national newspaper. </para>

                    <para>.- I regret the haste the Government is showing I did not have an opportunity of hearing more than a small portion of the speech of the Minister this morning, and, not having previously seen the report of the Senate&#39;s Select Committee, I am placed somewhat in a difficulty in dealing with the question. The proposal is for a subsidy of &#163;2,500 for the first year, &#163;2,000 for the second year, and &#163;1,500 for the third year, to be paid to an association on certain conditions laid down in detail ; but I did not hear from the Minister anything as to who were to form the new association, where it was to be formed, or any particulars of the kind. We have, therefore, nothing beyond the fact that if this motion is carried, some association will be formed, it is supposed, to comply with the conditions and receive the subsidy. One of the. conditions is that the number of words to be transmitted oversea shall be 6,000 each week. I do not know whether the Minister thinks it wise to impose that limit, seeing that in one week there may be much important, acceptable, and instructive information, while in another week there may be a dearth of news, and, in order to make up the 6,000 words, it will be necessary to telegraph a lot of rubbish or padding. Many statements have been made, especially by the honorable member for Calare, as to a grievance on the part of the public in rel n.tion to the cable news supplied by the present Associated Press of Australia. When that honorable member was speaking, I interjected that I had heard nothing of such a grievance having been formulated ; and it does appear strange that, seeing a Select Committee of the Senate sat for a considerable time, no witness was called outside the representatives of the newspapers, the telegraph companies, and Government officials, to state any case there might be on the part of the general public. Had there been such general dissatisfaction in the general community as has been stated, I think we should have found them represented before this Select Committee appointed by the other branch of the Legislature. We know that very often in the case of Select Committees and Royal Commissions, some members dissent from the findings of the majority ; and I have had some experience myself in this connexion. Although there might be an equal number of the members of the Select Committee or a Royal Commission on either side, yet, on the casting vote of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline><inline font-weight="bold">chairman,</inline> the finding of the majority is quoted as the finding of the inquiring body. While that does not apply, perhaps, to the present case, we find that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> not only dissented .from the finding, but gave their own opinions at considerable length. </para>

                        <para>- If that be so, it is for the Minister to show how those gentlemen &#34; dodged &#34; the question. I saw this report of the Select Committee for the first time during the lunch hour, and, from a hasty perusal of it,  1  think that Senators Chataway and Pulsford, in their minority statement, show a close grip of the question ; and their remarks are well worthy of consideration. It has been stated, particularly by the honorable member for Macquarie, who is a representative of the country press, that there is great dissatisfaction on the part of country newspapers with the service supplied by the Association Press of Australia. I may point out, however, that immediately the Select Committee was appointed by the Senate, some 800 circulars were sent out to the country newspapers of Australia, inviting information and suggestions, and that only ninety replies were received, and that of those ninety, less than one-fourth expressed dissatisfaction. I think this fact pretty conclusively meets the statements of the honorable member for Calare as to the dissatisfaction of the public, and also the other statements as to the supposed dissatisfaction on the part of the country press. I have always been led to understand - and I am glad to find .myself supported by the honorable member for Wimmera, who has had considerable experience as- a newspaper proprietor in Victoria, that the great difficulty under which country newspapers suffer is not in regard to the charges made for the cable news, but in regard to the cost of transmitting that news over the Australian wires. That this is so is borne out by the evidence given before the Select Committee, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> pointedly puts it - </para>

                    <para>The most marked, and probably the most useful, point brought out by the inquiry, is that the cost of telegrams over Australian wires is more burdensome to the country press, and probably to the metropolitan press as well, than the sum that would be charged for the supply of oversea cable messages. Evidence in this direction was given by representatives of both the Victorian and New South Wales Associations. </para>

                <para>If honorable members look through the evidence, they will see that the representatives of the Press Associations in both Victoria and New South Wales amply justify the position taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> who continued - </para>

                    <para>Reuter&#39;s manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins,</inline> said - &#34; It is the heavy wiring charges which prove crushing to a country newspaper.&#34; He further said - &#34; Only yesterday I was waited upon by a gentleman from the country who has a biweekly newspaper. He was anxious to publish cables, which, so far, he has not been able to do. I quoted him the ridiculous sum of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> per year for the right of copying them, but he could not pay it on account of the wiring charges.&#34; </para>
                </quote>
                <para>It will be seen, therefore, that it is not the cost of the cables, but the wiring charges, that place the country newspapers in such a disadvantageous position. There is one point in connexion with the majority report of the Select Committee to which I should like to call attention. On different occasions, in connexion with Select Committees and Royal Commissions, we have reports drawn up in a way that is scarcely creditable ; and this is not the first time I have referred to the matter. For instance,&#39; in the report of the Select Committee on the cable service, under the heading &#34; Power of Monopoly,&#34; signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> now Minister of Defence, we find, as a justification for this portion of the report - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>It was stated by a retired newspaper proprietor that whilst the rate for press cables was 3s. 6d. per word, he was then charged <inline font-style="italic">&#163;128</inline> per annum; when cable charges dropped to is. 4d. per word, he was paying &#163;125 per annum; but when they dropped to is. per word, the association raised its charge to him to ^175 per annum. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">This, of course, is put forward with the distinct object of discrediting the Associated Press. But if we look from one end of the evidence to the other, and through the appendices, we find no statement of the kind by any &#34; retired news- . paper proprietor.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- How does the honorable member know that it is true? I should like to put the honorable member on his oath, and see whether he would say so then. He was very quick the other day in casting a slander on all the dairymen in my district, which I had to refute - a statement which he dare not make on oath, any more than he would substantiate this one on oath. </para>

                        <para>- I have not had sufficient time to go through the evidence. It is also pointed out in the next paragraph of the report, that there are none of the elements of free bargaining in the present position; and that a dissatisfied newspaper has no recourse but to submit. I am surprised to see, for the first time, a report from honorable members, all of whom occupy a position amongst the Caucus party, objecting to a state of affairs in which there are no elements of free bargaining. I always thought they were opposed to free bargaining. Are there any elements of it in the conditions laid down in the new proposal ? Schedule A gives a list of the maximum annual charges to be made. In respect of metropolitan newspapers, they are as follows :  - Sydney, &#163;1,000; Melbourne, &#163;1,000; Brisbane, &#163;750; Adelaide, &#163;750 ; Perth, &#163;500; and Hobart, &#163;500. The maximum annual charge in respect of newspapers in the chief provincial cities is to be &#163;200, and in minor cities and towns, &#163;50. Certainly, those are maximum charges ; but who is going to fix the real charges? </para>

We have heard a good deal in regard to monopoly in this matter, and statements have been made that it would be absolutely impossible for anyone to establish another cable service for his own use, or for the use of himself and others. But in the report, honorable members will find that witness after witness admitted that a new service might be established without very much difficulty.

A great deal has also been said in regard to the Associated Press of Australia representing only one side in politics.

                    <para>Yes. I became connected with the <inline font-style="italic">Geelong Times</inline> newspaper, and remained its proprietor until June of this year - covering a period of some 23 years. In 1885 and 1886, and previously to those years, the charge for cable service was&#163;128 per annum. This was at the time when the press cabling was at the rate of either 3s. 6d. or 4s. a word. The&#163;128 fee prevailed, I think, until 18S8, when it was  reduced to &#163;100 per annum ; in the meantime, the Cable Company had reduced their charge to about 2S. 3d. a word for press messages. </para>

                    <para>Of course, I am speaking from memory. In about the year 1900, when press messages were only required to pay is. 4d. per word, the telegraphic cable service to us was increased to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;125</inline> per annum, and it remained at that until about three years ago, when we were made to pay an extra ^50 per year - or in all <inline font-style="italic">&#163;175 -</inline> although the Cable Company had reduced their charge in 1902 to is. per word. It will thus be seen that, notwithstanding the lowering of press messages by cable by over 400 per cent., the charge to us was increased by 75 per cent. It has been stated before your Committee that the association&#39;s service includes Inter-State items. That is perfectly correct, but so paltry and insignificant were these items that a newspaper proprietor would hardly place value upon them at all. In my own case, I rarely used the matter supplied, and when I did so, it was only done in order to fill up. Newspaper proprietors throughout the Commonwealth stand in the not very enviable position of being completely under the control of the &#34; Combine,&#34; a capitalistic monopoly which has the power either to raise the price for the service to such an exorbitant extent, or refuse to sell the service; and therefore it follows that the association could crush out of existence any desired journal. It is no argument to say that that power has never been used. </para>

                    <para>The fact still remains - it could be done, lt exists. It puts a dangerous power in the hands of a monopoly such as the United Cable Service Company is. With such a possibility hanging over their heads it will be difficult for your Committee to get newspaper proprietors to give evidence, for fear of reprisals. If it were possible to get behind the Combine&#39;s figures, showing the receipts and expenditure yearly, I venture to assert that those papers forming this Combine are getting their cable service free, besides making considerable profit out of the business. </para>

                    <para>It has been slated in evidence before yOU Committee that the service is now superior to what it used to be. This statement I deny. The best service I ever had during my ownership was during that period when Reuter&#39;s Company were supplying cable news in opposition to the services obtained privately by <inline font-style="italic">The Argus</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">The Age</inline> - and then it was only a &#163;100 a year fee, while the press cabling cost, I think, 2S. 6d. per word. During my long connexion with Reuter&#39;s people, it is only fair and just for me to say that I always received at their hands every consideration and invariable courtesy. </para>

You are the first newspaper man who has appeared before this Committee who has expressed any regard for the public interest. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackinnon,</inline> you may be aware, distinctly refuses to reckon that the public have any interest in the matter. He regards it as simply a business concern. Do you agree with that? - I hope I may be excused from offering any comment on what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackinnon</inline> may have said. 779. He distinctly said that it was purely a matter of business. You say that &#34;in your opinion a new combination for cabling purposes could be -formed. But is it not the case that it would be practically impossible to give effect to such an idea owing to the fact that the agreements of the newspapers with the Press Association expire on different dates? - I have already expressed the opinion that it is practicable&#39; to give effect to the idea. I will now go further, and say that if we sent a cable message to our agent in London, and also a message to our bankers, we should be furnished with another service in 24 hours. We can therefore contemplate the situation with perfect equanimity. </para>

My sympathy is with the proprietors of country newspapers, of whom I know a good many in New South Wales. I have come to the conclusion, from chance remarks which I have heard from them, that they deserve better treatment than they are getting ; but 1 think that it is not the cost of the cable service so much as the cost ot telegrams that creates difficulties for them. </para>

                        <para>- Such contradictory statements have been put before us that it would be only fair to give honorable members more time to investigate the matter. In voting public money to subsidize private concerns, we are entering upon very dangerous ground, and taking a step which should not be taken until after the fullest inquiry. </para>

                    <para>-- * address myself to the motion, not because of my sympathy with either the metropolitan or the country press, but because it is my duty to consider the interests of the taxpayers. On every former occasion when a subsidy or bounty has been proposed, Parliament has been asked to spend the money in regard to which it acts as the trustee of the taxpayers to assist deserving industries needing support ; but is the press of Australia so impoverished an institution that it needs assistance from the public revenue? Our press already enjoys many benefits at the expense of the general community. The ordinary taxpayer must pay duty on everything he uses in life, and on the coffin in which he is buried; but newspaper proprietors may import all their materials of trade, with the exception of ink, free of duty. Furthermore, it is admitted that the richest corporations in Australia are those which control newspapers. Within the last few years, a Melbourne gentleman left an enormous fortune, which had come to him through his connexion with the press of this city. If we grant the proposed subsidy, each of the electors whom we represent will have to pay his share of it. Do honorable members intend to spend public money in bolstering up an institution which not only does not require assistance, but is  already  more successful and prosperous than any other ? </para>

                        <para>- All that is proposed is to make a special grant, the benefits of which are to go solely to the press of Australia. The Minister may think that at the present time the community does not get as much cable news of the right sort as it should get, but he does not propose to interfere in that matter. Notwithstanding the granting of this subsidy, the newspapers will be at liberty to publish what they please. Murderers can be held up to the emulation of morbid minds, and unedifying Court proceedings may be made the mental pabulum of those who can only be harmed thereby. </para>

                        <para>- Obviously it is in the interests of the metropolitan rather than of the country newspapers. The maximum annual charge to a Sydney or Melbourne journal is to be  &#163;1,000  ; to a Brisbane or Adelaide journal,  &#163;750  ; to a Perth journal,  &#163;500;  and to a Hobart journal,  &#163;300;  while to a journal circulating in any of the chief provincial towns it is to be  &#163;200.  Our chief provincial towns have populations not exceeding  50,000,  while the population of Sydney, for example, is about  580,000.  Is it fair tc charge only  &#163;1,000  to a newspaper which not only circulates in a city with a population of  580,000,  but also, by means of railways run at the Government expense, over a very large area of the State, and to charge  &#163;200  to a newspaper whose circulation is confined to a city like Bendigo or Ballarat ? </para>

                        <para>- The proposal of the Government places the country press at such a great disadvantage, without taking into account the cost of telegraphing which it has to bear, that obviously, then, it is intended to benefit some metropolitan newspaper. I have looked round to endeavour to discover which of the metropolitan journals the Labour party wishes to help. It has given the mental services of the Attorney-General to the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> who writes as a member of the staff. </para>

                        <para>- An excellent thing, because the articles which the Caucus contributes through him are answered in the leading articles, which causes Labour supporters to read their rebuttal. The contributions of the Attorney-General are headed, &#34; The Case for Labour, by  W.  M. Hughes &#34; ; but as was suggested by a gentleman who was a brilliant member of this House some time ago, the heading should read, &#34; The Case for Labour and  W.  M. Hughes.&#34; In my opinion, it is the case for the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> and W. M. Hughes that is mostly considered, the case for Labour finishing a bad third. I refer to the matter merely to show that the Labour party can have no interest in benefiting the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> further. Is it the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> that the party wish to benefit? I do not believe that it is the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> and I am convinced that they do not wish to help the impoverished exchequer of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> To what paper, then, is this subsidy to be given? To any one who looks at these facts and at the terms of this undertaking, it is admittedly to be given to a metropolitan newspaper published in a certain interest, and not in the general interests of the community. This subsidy must be for the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker.</inline> It must be to put the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> on its legs. </para>

                        <para>- What deeply grieves me is the knowledge that this grant, at the expense of the taxpayers of Australia, rich and poor alike, is to go into the coffers oi a newspaper that has already provided a living for many a man who is doing well out of the Labour movement. I am not referring to the honorable member for Darling in that connexion, but I hold that the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> is not deserving of our support. It is mendacious in almost every line of its contents. </para>

We must be very careful to see that any newspaper that reaps the subsidy proposed shall at any rate conduct its advertising operations upon ordinary straightforward lines. There ought not to be any black list in any paper that reaps a benefit from this subsidy. No dealer, manufacturer, agent, or distributor, should have a man calling on him and making the statement, &#34;If you do not give us an advertisement, you will not get our readers to buy your goods.&#34; That must be stopped if we are going to pass any such legislation as is now proposed. There, must be no blackmail. </para>

                        <para>- I am proposing to do so, and shall deal on the motion for the adjournment with the other question that has been raised. The electors who returned me to this House have intrusted me with a duty, and I think that they will be satisfied with the manner in which I am discharging it. I come now to the question of safeguards in respect of this legislation. It is well known that a number of newspapers are run on lines similar to those just suggested. It is extremely well known that one weekly newspaper in Australia is in the habit of coming out with a full-page advertisement&#39; at certain fortunate periods of its existence. Such methods as these should receive no support from a House that exists as a trustee of the public purse. We must see that safeguards exist in this legislation to insure that the people of Australia shall have a fair thing so far as they can obtain a fair thing out of a proposal to pay the funds of the Commonwealth into the pockets of party organizers. Further, I think that the news that is sent out by cable should be on the lines suggested by the Leader of the Opposition. If there is any objection to be offered to our present cable service it is that we have in it too much sensationalism and too little serious news. .  1  admit that in journalism one cannot expect a journalist to be an altruist. A journalist runs his paper for profit, and he will provide exactly the sort of news that his readers demand. I do say, however, that the Commonwealth should not waste public money in providing reports of this or that judicial proceeding of an unsavoury character, of this or that murder case, of a fatal accident, say, in California, or any other matter of merely sensational and passing interest. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. Nor ought we to have news of the kind that we have been reading lately in respect to the doings of a certain individual who is now charged with murder. The cable messages have been crammed full of his doings, and a number of other cases of undesirable messages might also be given. Pick up a newspaper when you will and you will find that a good deal of its news is in respect of sensational matter that is not in the interests of the mental well-being of the people we represent. That being so, we ought to be careful to see that any additional matter that we subsidize shall be in the interests of our people. That is all I ask, and all I hope that the Government will see fit to grant. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot see any. I find that the press in Australia is infinitely more numerous per head of the population than the press of the Old Country. For instance, per one million of the people there are five daily newspapers in the United Kingdom, as against nearly sixteen in Australia. Of weekly, bi-weekly, and triweekly newspapers, the average per million in the United Kingdom is just on 60, as against nearly 183 in Australia. </para>

This additional information shows pretty conclusively that the press of Australia, taken as a whole, is a fairly prosperous institution. It is extremely prosperous in the big cities. </para>

There is absolutely no check on the Association, and what is described as the maximum may be claimed from every newspaper in Australia. Whilst a Bathurst newspaper will pay &#163;200 per annum to supply 20,000 people, the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> with the opportunity of circulating throughout New South Wales, and especially amongst 580,000 people in its immediate neighbourhood, will pay only &#163;1,000. The larger newspaper will pay * only five times as much as the smaller one, whereas it ought to pay twenty-seven times as much on a mere population basis, and, indeed, twice as much as that again, when we consider its infinite opportunities for circulating throughout the State as a whole. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friends opposite are always full of suspicion of capitalistic enterprise; and here we are dealing with an Association which will have absolute authority to charge anything it likes up to the maximum. According to remarks which honorable members opposite have so often addressed to this Chamber, such an Association will charge a great deal more than the maximum if it has the opportunity, and, at any rate, according to them, it is only human nature for them to charge up to the maximum. To this consideration I direct the earnest attention of those who are seriously concerned about benefiting the country press of Australia, and not trying to rush through a project which has no other immediate object than putting the money of the people of Australia into the pockets of an organ that works night and day in the interests of the Labour party. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear that the Government are so reasonable, but they were not so considerate in connexion with the Australian Notes Bill. I can only ask why we should not have proceeded with that latter measure to a finish instead of interpolating this motion,  about which there is no great urgency? The Government have declined to give permission to honorable members on this side to examine the evidence taken before a Select Committee, and to consider the motion in the light of the speech of the Minister; in fact, they have declined to extend the ordinary courtesies of debate in connexion with this proposal above all others. Why do they make an exception in this matter, as compared with infinitely more important matters of Government business ? </para>

The Minister in charge of the motion will recollect that, ever since I have been in this Parliament, I have been an earnest advocate of the Pacific Cable, as opposed to the interests of that great monopoly of which he, at one time, was an ardent champion in this House. </para>

Let me remind you that this is a proposal to specially subsidize the Pacific Cable, which now practically sends no press messages one way, the bulk coming over the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company&#39;s line. The whole question is whether the Pacific Cable shall be encouraged without reference to the other line, and encouraged in the way the Government propose. </para>

                        <para>- With great respect, sir, I think you will find that what is proposed is a subsidy to the Pacific Cable. One of the reasons for which the subsidy is being offered is to support this is against another and competing company. That is the very purpose and intention of the Government&#39;s proposal, and the words <inline font-style="italic">&#34; via</inline> Pacific &#34; are expressly stated in the third clause of the motion. It is strange to me to find the Minister, who has always fought every effort to subsidize the Pacific Cable, and to reduce its charges, particularly its terminal charges over the land lines at this end, and who has, time and again, resisted any concession of the kind, now showing a complete reversal of form by specially subsidizing the Pacific . Cable Company. </para>

                        <para>- The whole charge was never proposed to be put on South Australia, and the honorable member always resisted any proposal to cut down the terminal charges of the Pacific Cable. I do not want to pursue that matter further, but I am entitled to make that reference, because, for a long time past, I have stood almost alone in this House on the question. I think the only supporter I had when making that fight for the Pacific Cable Company was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> the ex-Leader of the Labour party. </para>

                        <para>- I am not getting my own way. I am getting the Government way, and, as usual, it is the wrong way. There is a right and a wrong way of going about all these matters, and my honorable friends, somehow or other, seem always to choose the wrong. Why have they departed so fully and radically from the agreement as suggested by the Committee of the Senate, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was the  chairman,  and the majority were Labour members? 1 do not know why this complete departure from the recommendations of that Committee has been made, but it seems to have been coincident with the advent of the party to power in such dominating numbers. One wonders what influences have been at work to so seriously modify the report which appears over the signatures of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce, Senator Givens, Senator Findley,</inline> and the other Labour senators who formed the majority of the Committee. The Committee, in the first place, recognised the precise suggestion made by my leader this afternoon that the subsidy should be conditioned by the collection of news relating solely to the Empire, and not be for general newspaper news, such as we are in the habit of getting over the cable. It is also suggested in the report that the High Commissioner&#39;s office should be utilized for, the collection and despatch to Australia of Empire news. That is practically the suggestion made this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition. </para>

                        <para>- Whatever may be the merits of the suggestion, it is made by the Committee, and yet when it was put forward again by the Leader of the Opposition to-day, the honorable  member  for Calare warned the Minister to beware of &#34; any suggestion coming from the other side.&#34; That emanated not &#34; from the other side,&#34; but from the honorable member&#39;s own side. It. came from his present leaders, who put it forward as one of the conditions to be observed before any subsidy should be paid. Moreover, they, very rightly, before any subsidy or anything else is undertaken, approach the question of an efficient cable service. Their first recommendation is for the completion of the All-Red cable route by laying down the Atlantic cable section,  and  the Canadian land line, the result of which, they say, would be to make possible a substantial reduction in the charges tol press cables. Here, again, the Government seem to be beginning at the wrong end in precisely the same way as they have done in connexion with the Post Office charges. The primary requirement of the public in connexion with all these Government functions is an efficient service. The very first thing asked for by the newspaper proprietors who first approached the Government and the Committee, was an efficient service. I have no time to deal with the report <inline font-style="italic">iti extenso,</inline> but I should like to quote the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robert</inline> McMillan, who went into the matter very thoroughly, as follows : - </para>

                    <para>We want a complete cable from Australia across Canada, across the Atlantic, and back again to Australia by the Red Sea. If we are going to make it a commercial concern, we must have an alternative route. That is a strong point with the Eastern Extension Company to-day. They have an alternative route, so that if one breaks down they have the other. Imagine my depending upon the Pacific cable for my news ! The Canadian-Pacific Route service comes over the Rocky Mountains, and in a terrible storm the cable might break down. I would then be left&#34; absolutely without messages, whereas the Eastern Extension Company have an alternative route, and can keep up the supply. In any discussion as to forming a cable service, there must be an alternative route, because as a newspaper proprietor with big interests, I should not be dependent upon a single line over the mountains. </para>

                    <para>The Pacific cable which was going to help us so much is nothing but a sham, because my cable message goes from here to Vancouver by that service, and then it is handed to the Canadian Pacific Railway, by whom it is handed to the Atlantic Cable Company. So that my message from this country is delivered in London by the Atlantic Cable Company, which is a private concern, whose interest it is to damn any State-owned business. So that this Pacific cable is merely one link in the necessary chain. You gentlemen cannot do a thing that will help us pressmen so long as you have only one link in the Imperial cable service. </para>

                        <para>- Then, shall we say a subsidy for the benefit of newspapers, and to provide a cable service for newspapers? What is the difference, so far as our purposes are concerned ? Is the honor-  able member going to subsidize an association if he should find that it does not provide another cable service at all? The very purpose of the motion is to get an additional cable route for certain newspapers which are now supposed to be put out of court by the monopoly which it is said the existing newspaper proprietors have. The whole intention of the proposal is to break down the existing route, the existing service, and the existing newspaper monopoly. Does the Minister deny that? I do not think he will Or can, for he has said it himself, and every  speaker  on that side so far has said the same. I am merely pointing out that we are going to subsidize a service which, on the authority of those who are agitating for it, will be of no use unless a great deal more money is spent on it. The witnesses point out that to make the Canadian Pacific service useful it would be necessary to expend another  &#163;500,000  on the Canadian land line, and at least another  &#163;500,000  on the Atlantic section of the cable. In other words, before it is worth anything to the newspapers as a reliable and independent source of information, you must spend a million more in completing the service. According to the evidence of persons concerned, the proposed subsidy will not be worth much to them. They say that they could not rely on messages coming over the Pacific Cable, and that  &#163;1,000,000  should lie spent in making that line safe and secure, and providing an alternative route. I cannot find that a subsidy was asked for. </para>

This proposal has been rushed forward in such a way that I have not been able to thoroughly examine the evidence of the Committee, but I cannot find that witnesses have done more than suggest a cheaper cable service.

                        <para>- No; my only desire is to see the Pacific Cable a success. What is first needed is an efficient service. Some years ago I begged <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, who was then Leader of the Government, to modify the present terminal charge of 5d. a word. A cable message is conveyed across the Pacific for a very small sum. </para>

I speak warmly, because I had to fight this matter for years. In New South Wales, I strove to prevent the taking of the very foolish action which put the Pacific Cable on a non-paying basis, and has prevented it from overtaking its losses since. To-day the Government do nothing to make the cable a success and encourage its use by the public.

                        <para>- As a matter of fact, he went on to say that at a cost of &#163;2,000 or &#163;3,000 they could get a supplementary service to the present one which would give them from 200 to 300 words a day. Therefore we are actually going to give a subsidy to the extent of providing a free service of 200 br 300 words a day. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> said that that would be the cost of a supplementary service, but that a. completely independent service would cost much more. He figured out the cost of a service, giving 300 words a day, at over &#163;5,000 per annum on the basis of cable messages being transmitted at the rate of is. per word. Since then the rate has been reduced to 9d. per word, so that a purely independent service would now cost about &#163;4,000 a year. In other words, we are to give a subsidy equal to about 60 per cent, of the total cost of an independent cable service. The Government are going to give a supplementary service to the extent of 200 or 300 words a day to the press of the Commonwealth, and the press are not asking for it. All they ask for, according to his evidence, is an efficient Pacific Cable and reasonable land line charges. </para>

                        <para>- That may be; but the Government must remember that when they have granted the subsidy they will still have this further liability to face. The representatives of the country press distinctly say in their evidence before the Select Committee, that unless they can get an efficient service they cannot undertake the work. The Government will, therefore, be met with this additional charge over and above the subsidy they have in contemplation. That is not the way to help the Pacific Cable. I do not think that, as a National Parliament, we have any right to subsidize individuals without at the same time paying some attention to the success or otherwise of the Pacific Cable service. That ought to be our first care. If we make that efficient, then, on the authority of these representative men, who are well qualified to speak, they want nothing more.

                <para class="block">I  subscribe entirely to that doctrine. That is the point at which we ought to begin. Let us give, first of all, a complete, efficient service, and then reduce the terminal charges. If we did that, the newspaper proprietors would not ask for a fraction more, and we should have, at an early date, another independent competing service. It does seem to me that the Government are forcing this subsidy on the people concerned, instead of doing what the people themselves suggest as an alternative. There are some further references in the report with which I do not wish to weary the House; but I suggest that honorable members should carefully examine it. If they do, they will find that the proposals of the Government set aside this report, which was framed by four of their own party. Why the change has come over the scene I do not know. I can only suggest that those in power are now expected to do something in return for the support they have received from newspapers outside the Association, and Labour papers in particular. Our cable services are not completely satisfactory. I am not here as an advocate for the present condition of affairs. It&#39; might be improved. There is nothing so important in these outposts of the Empire as a full and free circulation of news in relation to all that affects Imperial interests. I have before to-day suggested that the Government might very well arrange for a column of news concerning the doings of the Empire, to be sent every day over the Pacific Cable for dissemination in Australia. But whaf are the Government doing here? They are imposing no condition as to the kind of news that is to be transmitted. Are honorable members going to agree to a subsidy of &#163;2,500 a year, and to the transmission of messages over the Pacific Cable practically free of charge for these newspapers, without our having some voice in determining the class of news that is to be received? For instance, are we going to subsidize cable messages such as those relating to the Jack Johnson light, and other matters, to which the Leader of the Opposition has alluded to-day? The logical corollary to a proposal of this kind is that we should use the High Commissioner&#39;s office in London to supervise the news that is to be sent, and restrict messages to matters relating to the interests of the Empire in its world-wide relations and the interests of Australia in particular. If the Government do that, I shall be disposed to look with approval upon any such proposal. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it is, and so long as it pays for its own news in its own way, the matter has nothing to do with any one else. But it has to do with these newspapers when they find themselves confronted with Government charges, which, as I have said for many years, are extortionate, and ought not to be imposed. If we put down the terminal charges from 5d. to1d. or 2d. per word, we should have such an accession of business over the Pacific Cable portion of the line as would convert it from a nonpaying into a highly payable undertaking. We owe a duty to the Pacific Cable, irrespective altogether of the way in which the enterprises of newspaper people are going to be affected. I can find nothing in the evidence which suggests that a subsidy should be paid ; but I find suggestion after suggestion that an efficient service should be given at a cheap rate, and then the newspapers will be able to &#34; gang their ain gait&#34; without special consideration. </para>

                    <para>. - I join with other honorable members in protesting against this motion, or new business of any kind, being sprung on Opposition members without the slightest warning, while important measures, which we have been led to believe would be dealt with as nearly as possible in their order on the business paper, are set aside. We have a right to protest against thus being taken at a disadvantage, precluded, as we are, from giving any consideration to the proposal submitted. This motion has been flung nn the table, nobody knowing until this morning that it was to be submitted. The Government, after professing to be most anxious to proceed with measures of primary importance, have, without any request or desire on the part of the Opposition, voluntarily thrown these aside for the purpose of introducing proposals which are certainly not of an urgent character. Honorable members on this side are thus called upon to deal with questions at a moment&#39;s notice which they have had no opportunity of looking into. Of course, there is a reason for this course of action ; hut that reason does not appear on the surface; it has not been mentioned by the Minister, or by any honorable members opposite, but has been carefully kept in the background, although it is well known. This motion is an absolute contradiction of all the professed principles of the Labour party, and is a flat negation of their Socialistic platform. It is a proposal for insuring against financial loss a private Capitalistic company engaged for its own profit in catering to supply a commodity for other private Capitalistic enterprises run also for their own profit; in short, the primary purpose is to insure that Capitalistic syndicate against loss in a new venture in opposition to an established venture. Here we have a professedly Socialistic Government, representing a Socialistic party, proposing to subsidize with public moneys a private Capitalistic syndicate which is being formed, or . has been formed, purely as a private profit-making speculation. This is further evidence of the inconsistency so characteristic of the Government since the 13th April last; but they, of course, will have to answer to their constituents. It cannot be alleged&#39;, on any ground of public necessity or policy, that a proposal of this kind is needed. Thu only pretence in its favour is so farcical p.rid transparent as to deceive nobody. It is said that the object is to have cable news disseminated under a subsidy for the purpose of educating the public ; but, as a matter of fact, the country press argument is a mere stalking horse. The real intention was disclosed first by an interjection from the honorable member for Calare, secondly, in a speech by the honorable member for Robertson, thirdly, in an extract which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Standard of Empire,</inline> to which I called attention in the form of a question some days ago, and, fourthly, by a statement in the evidence submitted to the Select Committee. All these point to one reason, and one reason only, why this proposal to subsidize a private venture is brought forward in this hurried way. </para>
