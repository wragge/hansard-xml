                        <para>- The matter has been receiving attention recently. It is intended that the proclamation shall be issued sufficiently early to allow the first payment of invalid pensions to be made on 15th December, and a second before the new year, and regulations are being prepared accordingly. Applications may be made at once to the Commissioner for Invalid and Old-age Pensions, or to his deputies in any of the States. It is the intention of the Department to recognise, as far as possible, the certificates already issued to invalids in some of the States, though probably the payments will be different, because the Commonwealth Act is, generally speaking, more liberal than most of the State Acts. When the proclamation bringing into force the invalid sections of the Act is issued, a proclamation allowing the payment of old-age pensions to women at the age of sixty, instead, as now, at the age of sixty five, will be issued. A general outline of the intentions of the Government in this respect was given by the Treasurer in his. Budget speech. </para>

                            <para>- I have received several communications from persons desirous of applying for invalid pensions, and therefore I ask the Acting' Treasurer if he will make some public announcement as.: to where application forms may be obtained. As only seven or eight weeks will. elapse before the invalid provisions of the law are brought into effect, application forms should be available at once. If they are not, many persons eligible for invalid pensions will be unable to receive them on the first date of payment. </para>

The Government has stated that it will pay invalid pensions on a particular date, and reduce the age limit at which women are eligible for pensions, and these reforms will bc brought about years before they would have been achieved had the public had to rely on my honorable friends opposite. </para>

                            <para>- Of that I do not pretend to judge, but in case a use which suggests itself to me this morning should be made of the alleged rumour, I thought it necessary to make this statement. A simple allusion to the facts of my own choice of my present position and the generous acceptance of that intimation by the members of this party, will put the canard in its true light. During a political life which has associated me with four or five Governments, I have never yet had a personal dissension within the Government or party with which I was connected. </para>

                            <para>- True. I was only saying this by way of preliminary, so that I might not appear to be reflecting on the past. I have been more generously treated than I deserve by every party and Government with which I have been associated, and in particular since my association with our present party now on these benches. I have met with nothing but kindness and courtesy from them as Ministerialists or as an Opposition from the first until now. </para>

The motion on the notice-paper relating to the question, in the ordinary course of events, would have been called upon last Thursday, and the announcement of the Ministerial policy would then have been due. </para>

                        <para>-  s Government deeply sympathizes with all men who are receiving only small wages, and recognises that wages ought to be increased so as to meet the increase in the cost of living. I would impress upon my honorable friend the fact that the Ministry have been in office only for a few months, and that most of our time has been taken up in focussing Bills for the consideration of the Parliament. It is useless to attempt any great departmental reform at the present moment. We can only hope to furnish small remedies and to palliate troubles until there has been a complete departmental reconstruction on business lines from top to bottom. This Labour Ministry has inherited the accumulated evils of centuries of stereotyped red-tape. The whole of the Departments are submerged in an ocean of clotted, decaying, knotted red-tape. Until the system is re-organized, heads of Departments must be hopelessly waterlogged, and Ministers are almost as helpless as animated rubber stamps fog-bound on a shoreless sea. </para>

Has the honorable member taken notice of the fact that the Minister of Home Affairs has described the present Ministry as hopeless and helpless in the matter of reform ; as being waterlogged, bound hand and foot, and unable to do anything; and whether, in those circumstances, he does not think it is time that he looked elsewhere for Ministers and guides to this country? </para>

                        <para>. - The importance of the Bills now before us is such as to demand an expression of opinion on the part of honorable members with respect to the powers asked for in them. In dealing with matters of this description we necessarily invite a review of the Constitution under which we are being governed. We are practically asked by these proposals to look at the fundamental provisions of our instrument of government, and to see whether its underlying principles are those best adapted to the well-being of the people of Australia. The keynote of the whole of our Constitution is found in the first few words, where it is stated that- </para>

                    <para>The words " indissoluble Federal Commonwealth " indicate the underlying principle of this instrument of government. Under a Constitution such as we have, we have now to consider not a question of Commonwealth rights or State rights, but the question of Federalism. The question is now raised whether we are going to maintain a Federal Constitution or start off on a course of Unification. That issue is raised by these Bills. </para>

The Constitution in all its provisions looks to an indestructible union composed of indestructible States. </para>
                    <para>Our union, then, is distinctly Federal in its nature, and, being Federal, was distinctly and specially adapted to meet the needs of the Australian people. The Australian Constitution did not arise from a mere academic debate. It arose from the conditions of the Australian people at the time. The British people have a genius for government; and the method by which they proceed is always to examine the nature of the problem, and then, out of their practical experience, to devise a form of government best adapted to the needs of the situation. The Federal principle was mooted early in Australian history. In  1847,  Earl Grey, in a despatch, suggested a form of Federal union. He contemplated a central authority to consider " questions which, though local as respects the British possessions of Australia collectively, are not merely local as respects any one of those possessions." Fifty-three years elapsed before the objects of that memorandum were attained. Earl' Grey desired to have common regulations for " the conveyance of letters and the formation of roads, railways, and other internal communications traversing any two or more such Colonies," together with common duties and common commercial regulations. But the time for Federation was not ripe ; Australia was then moving towards the separation of the continent into distinct self-governing areas. For a period of fifty years the energies and activities of the Australian people were devoted to building up their local States under the full powers of government they possessed ; and, obviously, their attention being thus directed, the broader question of national' union was not urgently pressing on them- </para>
                    <para class="block">Yet, as time went on, the necessity for closer union was becoming every day more apparent in the minds of Australian statesmen. There were six different colonies of common origin treating each other as hostile countries. Yet certain questions arose which indicated the need for closer union. The three points on which the States could combine for common action could not have been better stated than they were by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes in his resolutions of  1891,  as submitted to the Convention - </para>

                    <para class="block">These four general propositions were accepted by the Commonwealth in  1900,  and the underlying principle was the formation of a Federal union which would meet the practical needs of the time - bring together the Colonies in closer bonds as regards trade and commerce, open up the highways, establish defence, and thereby create a National Government. What was essential for National union was delegated to the National Parliament; but the States were left as sovereign bodies. National needs demanded a sovereign National Parliament. Local needs demanded sovereign State Parliaments. I may say at the outset that I always have been, and always shall be, an enthusiastic supporter of all that tends to Federal union. It was realized that there should be a real and permanent union; and the only question was how that should be attained. The answer was a union arising out of our own needs, and not slavishly following the model of any other country. It was decided, however, that the union should be based on the American model ; and it is idle for honorable members to sneer at that model, and contemptuously call it a " Yankee Constitution." That Constitution was devised by Alexander Hamilton, who is recognised by all authorities as, perhaps, the greatest political genius the world has ever seen. But how did he proceed to solve the problem? He first investigated the troubles in his own country, realizing the necessity for a national union under a constitution which, while it would give full and complete play to local conditions, would, at the same time, create a union so strong that, in the conflict of nations, it would be able to hold its own. He succeeded ; and the result is to-day one of the most powerful nations in the world. But Australia did not slavishly follow the American model, though we adopted the underlying principle, creating two sovereignties - that of the Commonwealth and that of the States. Our Constitution delegates to the National Government as much power as is absolutely essential for the preservation of a Federal union. To that end the statesmen of the day thoroughly investigated the needs of Australia, and, as a matter of fact, gave greater power to the central authority than is the case in the United States. Further, they recognised the necessity of a more elastic Constitution, and although our Constitution is rigid so far as concerns the preservation of the principle of Federalism, it is sufficiently flexible to be an instrument adaptable to the changing needs of the people. The Federal principle of the American Constitution is clearly described by Chief Justice Marshall in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Gibbons</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Ogden -</inline></para>

                        <para>The genius and character of the whole Government seems to be that its action is to be applied to all the external actions of the nation, and to those internal concerns which affect the States generally ; but not to those which are completely within a particular State, which do not affect other States, and with which it is not necessary to interfere for the purposes of executing some of the general powers of Government. The completely internal commerce of a State, then, may be considered as reserved for the State itself. </para>

For instance, power was given to the Commonwealth to deal with old-age pensions, industrial disputes extending beyond a State, and other matters, which indicate the growth of a Democratic national spirit, and a desire to deal with social problems that was not dreamed of when the Constitution of the United States was framed. </para>

                            <para>- We distinctly recognised that the Constitution was not necessarily so complete or perfect as to be incapable of amendment. No Constitution ought to be so rigid as to render it impossible of expansion and development in order to meet changing needs and conditions. A Constitution is an instrument of government intended for the people, and the people are not, or should not, be subordinate to the Constitution ; and, therefore, we have greater powers of amendment than are to be found in the United States. Speaking of those very powers, Dicey says - </para>

                    <para class="block">It will be seen, therefore, that the Constitution is of a flexible nature, giving the national authority power to deal with problems as they .arise, provided, as Dicey points out, that amendment is the result of the deliberate voice of the nation. Before any alteration is made in the Federal Constitution we should, however, closely investigate the evil alleged to exist, and then ask ourselves whether it presents a case for an amendment - whether the problem is national or local.

                    <para class="block">That is, when there is a Federal Government and certain problems arise, we have to ask whether those problems are national, or whether they are such that the States should deal with them. If they are matters with which the States should deal, the answer is clear, if they have become national, and the Federal authority has no power to deal with them, the answer is- equally clear - an amendment of the Constitution must be sought. It was never the intention of the Constitution that we should take such a drastic step as an amendment of the Constitution simply because one or two "States have refused to pass some local law. Where in a State Wages Boards do not exist, the question must be asked, Is the absence due to a defect in the State Constitution? If the ground is taken that a Legislative Council will not pass the necessary law, that is not a reason for the amendment of the Federal Constitution, the proper remedy being to amend the State Constitution so that an essentially local matter may be dealt with by the local authorities. Professor Woodrow Wilson speaks very clearly on the subject when, referring to the conditions in the United States, he says - </para>

                    <para class="block">If a State Government is not capable of dealing with matters essentially local, and does not respond quickly and easily to local public opinion, its Constitution should be altered, so that the ready expression of popular opinion may be obtained. The mere blocking of a social reform by a State Parliament is not justification for the alteration of the Federal Constitution. The chief reason why some honorable members opposite ask for the extension of our Federal powers is, not that that is necessary because uniformity is essential, but because reforms are being blocked by some of the State Legislatures. There must be stronger justification than that. There is also a danger of overloading the National Parliament. If we continue to increase the powers of the Federation, this Parliament will be as overburdened as is that of the United Kingdom, or the Congress of the United States. I am informed that, in  1905, 309  Bills were introduced into the British Parliament, of which only twenty-three were passed. In  1906, 383  were introduced, and fifty-eight passed ; in  1907, 336  were introduced, and fifty-six passed ; and in  1908, <inline font-style="italic">412</inline> were introduced, and sixty-nine passed. When power' is unduly centralized a grievous wrong is done to the people, as necessary reforms -are delayed. With some such system of decentralization as we have, probably most of the legislation to which I have just referred would have been dealt with. At present, however, it is alleged that it is difficult to get the British Parliament to legislate adequately for the local affairs of Scotland, Ireland, England, or Wales. We do not desire a central authority so over-weighted as to become an inefficient instrument of legislation. The problem is how lc adjust the relations between the central and local powers in order to secure the best government. McConachie, in a work on <inline font-style="italic">Congressional Committees,</inline> speaks thus of the congestion of business in Congress - </para>

                            <para>- Nor must the State power be destroyed. Whenever it can be shown that a problem of government can be better dealt with by a National than by a State Parliament, it is proper for the National Parliament to act, and that the Constitution be amended if necessary. But all these matters must be considered apart from party politics and partisan feeling. A disappointed party which cannot get its way in a State Parliament has no right to try to alter the Constitution to effect its object by means of the Federal Parliament, irrespective of its suitability to be dealt with as a national problem. If the wide-sweeping powers now asked for are vested in this Parliament, the tendency will be to paralyze its usefulness. Legislation is being more and more increased, the modern tendency being to define powers and make rights, duties, and obligations more clear by statutory enactment. The attempt at the solution of economic problems by legislation is becoming more common. This shows the need for preserving the Federal principle.

                    <para>To-day we are asked to amend the Constitution in five distinct particulars : -as-to trade and commerce; corporations ; combinations; and trusts; industrial powers and the nationalization of monopolies; and we must ask in each instance if a case has been made out for the proposed transfer of power from the States to the Commonwealth. As to trade and commerce, have any practical difficulties been shown justifying a transfer of power? One of the objects of Federation was to remove all hindrances to Inter- State trade, and they have been swept away. Has any difficulty been experienced during the last decade in providing for freedom of trade between the States? Speaking from experience, I say that the only difficulties of administration we have had have been in regard to trusts and combines, with which we cannot deal while their operations are confined within the limits of a State. We are not now asked merely to deal with that difficulty, but to sanction the transfer of all power regarding trade and commerce to the Commonwealth. So little friction has there been in regard to </para>
                    <para class="block">Inter-State trade that the Inter-State Commission has not yet been brought into existence. The last Government introduced a Bill to provide for its establishment, not because of difficulty in respect to Inter-State freedom of trade, but because we thought that it might fulfil the function of the British Board of Trade, in helping manufacture and trade and production, and that it might advantageously be endowed with certain industrial powers. When it is asked what are the practical difficulties that demand the transfer from the States to the Commonwealth of the whole of this wide range of power, no sufficient reply is forthcoming, lt is true that trade and commerce can be treated as a whole, and that it has been bisected, but while that division is artificial, as has been said, it is certainly logical. If it were shown to be necessary for the proper control of trade and commerce to extend our present power, I should be agreeable to such an extension, but that has not been done. </para>
                    <para>We are told that we should make this change so as to bring ourselves into line with the Dominion of Canada. As a matter of fact, the Canadian power in this regard has not been fairly stated. It is correct to say that the Dominion Parliament has power, under section 9.1 of their Constitution, to regulate trade and commerce, but the provincial Legislatures have also vested in them the exclusive power to make laws relating to municipal institutions, shops, saloons, taverns, and auctioneers' and other licences, in order to raise revenue for provincial, local, or municipal purposes, the incorporation of companies with provincial objects, property and civil rights in the province, and, generally, all matters of a merely local or private nature in the pro-  vince. The result of the interpretation -of the Canadian trade and commerce power has been to make it approximate to that under the Commonwealth Constitution. Here are a few decisions by learned Judges, as given at page 555, of Lefroy's <inline font-style="italic">Legislative Power in Canada,</inline> in regard to the meaning of " regulation of trade and commerce ' ' - </para>

                    <para class="block">These cases indicate that the Canadian power is not as wide as that sought by this proposed amendment of the Constitution. If it be agreed to, the Commonwealth will, apparently, be empowered to take over and regulate all private businesses and trades, and also to deal with navigation, and the regulation of State railways. It will have full and complete control of all these agencies, so far as they are instruments of trade and commerce. The Government are asking for a wider sweep than Canada apparently, possesses, and a comparison with the Canadian Constitution is, therefore, not in point. </para>
                    <para>When we look at our own Constitution we find that not only have we power to deal with trade and commerce "with other countries and among the States," but that we have powers to make efficient all the agencies of Inter-State trade and commerce, and that no difficulty has arisen in connexion with them. A man in one State can enter into a contract with a man of another State by means of our uniform post and telegraph services, and when such a contract is made, the regulation of the transport between the States is a matter entirely under the control of the Commonwealth, whether it be by railway or by means of navigation. As to the terms of the contract there can be no. difficulty. The whole position in regard to the law of contract as between a citizen of one State and a citizen of another State is clearly understood. Nor can there be any difficulty regarding the terms of payment. The Commonwealth can make laws in regard to currency, coinage, and legal tender, bills of exchange, and promissory notes. We have established an Australian note system, and we have complete power under the Constitution to deal with banking. We have legislated to provide agencies for enforcing judgments obtained by citizens in one State against citizens in another State, and we have power to make laws with regard to the service and execution of civil processes, and with regard to bankruptcy. No difficulty has yet been pointed out in regard to any of these matters, to justify the transfer of this broad power to the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>As to our power to deal with corporations, I should like to see passed as soon as possible a uniform Companies Act. When I held office as' Attorney-General, instructions were given for the preparation of such a measure; but it was impossible at the time to define the exact constitutional position. The Commonwealth Government could not say definitely what powers it possessed in this regard, but these were clearly laid down subsequently by the decision of the High Court in <inline font-style="italic">Huddart, Parker, and Co.</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Moorehead,</inline> 8 <inline font-style="italic">C.L.R.</inline> In giving judgment in that case, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins pointed out what the Commonwealth powers are with respect to corporations. He said that he would not care to attempt a final exhaustive definition, but he pointed out, - amongst other things, that there was no express power on the part of the Commonwealth to incorporate companies ; such power as it possessed was an implied power. May I frankly confess that I should like to see the Commonwealth vested with express power, and also with power to deal with the dissolution of companies ? We do not need such a wide power as is asked for in this Bill, but I should certainly like to see the Commonwealth given clear power to regulate the formation of Australian companies, so that the incorporation of a company would leave it free to carry on its operations all over the States, just as any Australian citizen may do. We should have power to enable State corporations to be converted into Federal corporations, and we should also have power to define their status and their capacity, and to regulate the terms of their dissolution. There should be one uniform winding up throughout Australia, so that Australian creditors, may all be dealt with on the same basis. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the question of the regulation of trusts and combines. This Parliament, in my opinion, should have complete and adequate power to deal with combines and trusts, whether Inter-State or Intra-State. My experience in administering the Australian Industries Preservation Acts has convinced, me of the necessity for an alteration in that direction. In the first place, there is no difficulty in the way of the amplication of our power arising from existing laws, since the States have passed no laws on the subject. They have taken no action for the regulation of trusts, but the Commonwealth has done so. When I held office as Attorney-General, it fell to my lot to have to administer for the first time the Australian Industries Preservation Acts. A great many cases were brought under the notice of the Department, and the vast majority of them were of a purely Intra  state  character, and the Commonwealththerefore could not deal with them. It is very easy for a trust to evade the operation of the undoubted Federal law. Combines, at times, are an evil, and wherever combines of that nature exist there should be power to deal with them. There are many articles of consumption dealt with by combines which go beyond the confines of aState, and the exercise of the national' power is, therefore, called for. My own experience in this respect is entirely in accord with that of the honorable member for Angas. When the second" Deakin Government were administering the Australian Industries Preservation Acts, proceedings were instituted against Messrs. Huddart, Parker, and Company, to ascertain exactly what were the powers of the Commonwealth, as well as to deal with an evil which was believed to be in existence. The case was decided, the Commonwealth powers were defined. That trusts are of themselves an evil may best be shown by a quotation from the judgment of a United States Judge in the Northern Securities case. At page 339 of Ripley's <inline font-style="italic">Trusts, Pools and Corporations,</inline> the following quotation is given : - </para>

                        <para>When competition is left free, individual error or folly will generally find a correction in the conduct of others. But here is a combination of all the companies operating in the  Blossburg  and Barclay mining regions, and controlling their entire productions. They have combined together to govern the supply and the price of coal in all the markets from the Hudson to the Mississippi rivers, and from Pennsylvania to the Lakes. This combination has a power in ils confederated form which no individual action can confer. The public interest must succumb to it, for it has left no competition free to correct its baleful influence. When the supply of coal is suspended the demand for it becomes importunate, and prices must rise. Or if the supply goes forward, the price fixed by the confederates must accompany it. The domestic hearth, the furnaces of the ironmaster, and the files of the manufacturer all feel the restraint, while many dependent hands are paralyzed and hungry mouths are stinted. The influence of a lack of supply or a rise in the price of an article of such prime necessity cannot be measured. It permeates the entire mass of the community, and leaves few of its members untouched by its withering blight. Such a combination is more than a contract ; it is an offence. . . . In all such combinations, where the purpose is injurious or unlawful, the gist of the offence is the conspiracy. Men can often do by the <inline font-style="italic">combination</inline> of many what, severally, no one could accomplish, and even what, when done by one, would be innocent. . . . <inline font-style="italic">There is a -potency in numbers when combined</inline> which the law cannot  overlook  where injury is the consequence. </para>

The third Deakin Ministry also introduced an amending Bill. So far as the national power is inadequate to cope with the evils, I am quite prepared to support an amendment which will make good the deficiency. </para>

I cannot see my way to go the whole length which the Government asks us to go in these measures. They are not seeking power to deal only with disputes of an Inter-State nature or to grapple with evils where industries extend beyond one State, but are asking for power to deal, not merely with , every little matter of every possible kind relating to industrial conditions, but to industrial matters generally of the widest possible scope. That power, together with the wider power over trade and commerce, and all the incidental powers, mean taking over a large and undefined extent of jurisdiction from the State authorities, and I cannot see my way to go to that extreme. </para>

If the attempt succeeds it will lead to an undue centralization of authority, congest the Legislature, and make administrative action impossible, while many of those social reforms which are sought will not be as well accomplished as they could be if certain of the powers which are now sought to be transferred were left wilh the States. Wherever a case can be made out for national action, I am prepared to transfer the necessary powers to the Commonwealth, but in this instance no justification has been shown for the transfer of most of these powers, and, in the circumstances, I cannot see my way to support the measures in their entirety. </para>

                        <para>. - I regard the measure before us as one of the most important ever brought before any Legislature in the Commonwealth. I am prepared to give every credit to the framers of the Australian Constitution. Our Federation arose after a great deal of agitation at various periods in Australian history. I believe it is quite fifty years since the proposal was first mooted by William Charles Wentworth, and the agitation which eventually resulted in Federation, died out from time to time for periods of about ten years. In 1890 the Federalists were brought together, not for the purpose of building up the Federation which has since arisen, but for the purpose of providing a better method of transferring the military from State to State, mainly in order to crush a rebellion amongst the workers in Queensland. There was at the time a big strike in that State, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes was requested, I believe by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, to" allow the New South Wales troops to be taken to Queensland to put down what was believed to be an incipient rebellion. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes pointed out the impossibility, under the State laws, of ordering the permanent troops in New South Wales to go to Queensland. I believe this is a bit of secret history, which has not yet found its way into any publication, but it was generally known in Sydney at the time. When it was found that it was impossible to transfer New South Wales troops to Queensland, the Federal movement received another impetus, and a Convention was arranged. The outcome of that was a Constitution, which the Democracy of Australia would not accept. If that Constitution had remained intact, I do not believe we should have had Federation to this day. But there were in Australia a number of true Federalists, and amongst them were the men who originated the idea of calling a Convention of delegates, elected by the several States on the one-man-one-vote basis. The idea was that ten delegates from each State were to form a Convention and draw up a Constitution. In the contest for positions on the Convention there were very few Labour candidates. I think there were ten of them in New South Wales, but I am not sure about the numbers in the other States. At any rate, the only Labour man elected was ex-Senator Trenwith. My own opinion is that it was owing to the rejection of the Labour candidates for the Convention that we have the very liberal electoral sections in the Federal Constitution. If a large number of Labour candidates had been elected to the Convention, I believe the majority in that body, representing as they did the Conservative element, would have become alarmed at the prospect, and insisted on some restrictive franchise, which would have prevented the Labour party from gaining anything like its present strength. But those gentlemen builded better than they knew. They reasoned with themselves, " If we can win in the Convention election, and only one man can be returned by the Labour party, we have nothing to fear from one man one vote." Thus the one-man-one-vote principle found its way into the instrument of union, and its presence there largely influenced the people of Australia in accepting the Constitution. Seine honorable members regard the Federal Constitution as something sacred, which should not be interfered with - except when they want to alter it themselves. They had no objection to altering it last year. The Constitution was not a sacred document then. </para>

                            <para>- As the honorable member suggests, they wanted to alter it in a manner which would possibly have bound the majority of the Commonwealth to the will of the minority. I do not regard the Constitution as a sacred document, that must not be interfered with. I think it is there, fortunately for us, to be altered, generally speaking, the moment the majority of the people of the Commonwealth desire, that it shall be altered. I regard as a mistake the provision which demands for an alteration a majority of the States as well as a majority of the electors of the whole Commonwealth, and I hope the time will come when we shall alter it so as to allow the majority of the people to rule, whether the majority is in a majority of the States or not. However, restricted as it is, the section which provides for the alteration of the Constitution gives the majority of the people of the Commonwealth considerable sway. I was interested to hear my honorable friend the member for Hindmarsh yesterday. He made an eloquent speech, but there was a great deal of " hifalutin " in it. I do not think any particular nation can claim to be much superior to another. I am an internationalist. </para>

                    <para>But the honorable member for Hindmarsh is too much of a parochialist. He can see no good in any other nation than the British, and referred in most opprobrious terms to the Americans. It is quite right that we should have due self-respect and pride in our race; but that should not blind us to the virtues of other nations. Throughout the world one will find some good in every nation. In the realms of music, art, literature, and science are to be found representatives of the highest type from all nations. I claim that it is our duty to keep an open mind, and if any nation can suggest a means whereby we can remedy the wrongs of mankind or improve our conditions, we ought to adopt it. </para>
                    <para>The framers of our Constitution looked to the American model and adapted a great many of its provisions. Its basis is American, the main difference being with regard to the election of Senators, who, in the United States, are elected by the State Legislatures. This is an anachronism, but the Americans of the time, the ex- Britishers, ex- Frenchmen, and others - who helped to draw up the United States Constitution, did what they believed to be the best in their day, and it was a tremendous advance upon the Constitution of the Old Country. The honorable member for Hindmarsh talks about the virtues of the unwritten British Constitution. There is no doubt a great deal in the genius of the British race for self-government, but that genius, which showed itself in demanding the Great Charter from King John, has allowed its powers to slip away until at present we find the Old Country ruled by members of the wealthy classes. The honorable member said that all that was required was to abolish the House of Lords, and to carry out two other reforms. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, he said that three reforms were necessary. The fact remains, however, that these reforms cannot be carried into effect owing to the existence of the House of Lords. The honorable member further scorned the idea that we could graft on to British political institutions what he called the " Yankee Constitution " we now have. The honorable member loses sight of the position iri which the people of England have allowed themselves to be placed by the gradual filching away of their powers. In times gone by the people used to elect their own representatives, but that privilege was gradually taken away, until now, I believe, a person has to reside eighteen months in one house before he can get a vote. We can all realize how that operates, seeing that people, and especially the working classes, move about so much. At the present time, out of a population of  40,000,000  in Great Britain, only about  7,000,000  have the vote, whereas in Australia, out of a population of over  4,000,000  the franchise is enjoyed by  2,000,000.  As I said before, I am an internationalist. </para>

In Australia, as elsewhere, we are face to face with the fact that industry has undergone a considerable change during the past hundred years. The man who at one time plied his avocation and completed an article of manufacture from start to finish has practically disappeared. Labour-saving inventions have taken away his occupation, and he is to-day, in hundreds of instances, employed in performing one simple operation, such as feeding a machine in the process of manufacture. And the capitalists of the world are rapidly getting full control of all the machinery, and eliminating competition in regard to the disposal of products, more particularly the food-stuffs of the people. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Darling Downs sees no reason for the proposal to nationalize monopolies. The honorable member, I suppose, cannot see that monopolies exist, but he must have a very short memory if he has forgotten the cable news of not very long ago, to the effect that a meat trust has been formed in America, and has succeeded in monopolizing the sale of beef. Like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, this Beef Trust does not sell directly to consumers, but to retail distributors, and the result in America was that as much as is. 5d. per lb. had to be charged for chops. The retail butchers had an idea that redress could be obtained by appealing to  President  Taft to remove the protective duty of 25 per cent., and thus allow them to obtain supplies from Argentine. But what did the Beef Trust do? They obtained control of certain preserving factories in the Argentine, and where they could not obtain control of existing factories, they instituted factories of their own. The result was that they obtained as much control in the Argentine as in the United States.; and it was found impossible to protect the retailer and the public from their operations.

If men go out on strike and half starve themselves, directors of great companies are not affected one bit ; they are not called upon to deny themselves a single creature comfort, and the price of shares is unaffected. I venture to say that the strike of the 1,000,000 people in the United States did not reduce the price of the shares of the trust one penny. I may be told that I go far afield for my facts, but the world is so small nowadays that the trust in America has endeavoured to get control of the production of beef in Australia. Only this morning a cable message appears to the . effect that the price offered by a trust - English or American - for a certain station in Queensland is not deemed sufficient. </para>

                            <para>- I dare say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidman</inline> would be a prominent member in any combination, because he has already organized a kind of trust in the Bovril Estates Company. In my opinion, if things go on as they are, it will not be very long before there is a big meat combine in Australia. As a matter of fact, even now if an individual or a small company tries to send a cargo of beef from Australia to the United States, they would find that all the refrigerating space in the vessels to New York had been taken up by, I believe, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Kidman. I remember reading some time ago an article written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Fox, formerly of the editorial staff of the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> in which it was stated that, although meat is so dear in Canada and the United States, it was impossible for any person to send a cargo from Australia for the reasons that I have just stated. It might be suggested that another line of steam-ships might be established, but I ask where the capital is to come from? To use a homely expression, "dog does not eat dog," and the capitalists are not likely to start a rival line. If an individual were to attempt to embark in the trade he would meet with a similar experience to that of the owner of the barque <inline font-style="italic">Laura,</inline> referred to in the following newspaper extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> of the 25th September, 1909 :- </para>

                        <para>The enormous powers wielded by the coal vend have just been strikingly illustrated by the case of the barque <inline font-style="italic">Laura,</inline> which has been refused a cargo of coal at Newcastle. The position is almost incredible. The coal trade of the northern district is very depressed, the mines are working less than half time, yet a little vessel like the <inline font-style="italic">Laura,</inline> which only requires 550 tons of. coal, is unable to secure a supply. The <inline font-style="italic">Laura,</inline> since she was purchased about two years ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peter</inline> Burrows, of the firm of E. D. Pike and Company, of this city, has been engaged in the timber trade, carrying hardwood from New South Wales to New Zealand, and bringing back cargoes of pine. During the whole of this time she was only twice diverted - once on a trip to the South Seas on a three months' time charter, and once with a cargo of naphtha and kerosene to Suva. She may, therefore, be regarded as a regular trader between Australia and New Zealand. The <inline font-style="italic">Laura</inline> was recently chartered by the owners from Messrs. Redpath and Sons, of Christchurch, New Zealand, and she arrived at Newcastle from New Caledonia on Monday week to load coal for Lyttleton, New Zealand. The vessel has now been lying idle at Newcastle for nearly a fortnight without any prospect of being permitted to purchase or load coal. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peter</inline> Burrows, the owner, applied to the charterers' agent - the Hetton Coal Company Limited, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkins</inline> is the manager - for a cargo, but was informed that instructions had been received from the coal vend that the <inline font-style="italic">Laura</inline> was not to be loaded, as <inline font-style="italic">she</inline> was not included in the list of vessels authorized to be loaded by collieries connected with the vend. </para>

                    <para class="block">If it were found possible to raise sufficient capital to furnish a vessel, in all probability the shipping combine would prevent a supply of coal, or in other ways make the venture absolutely profitless. Further, if a cargo of meat were taken from here to New York or elsewhere in America, the beef trust would do just as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company do here - the cargo landed, they would lower the price of meat temporarily, and the enterprise would fail. That furnishes the best of reasons why we should appeal to the people for power either to nationalize a monopoly entirely, or .to start business in opposition to it. </para>
                    <para>As business men, we must realize that should we nationalize monopolies, we should have to adopt business methods, and that in competing with an established monopoly we should find ourselves confronted with the opposition of a section of the public. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company was a grievous monopoly, which used to charge 9s. 4d. per word for transmission of messages from Great Britain. An agitation was set on foot by merchants who succeeded in getting Great Britain, New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Canada, and New Zealand to spend  £2,000,000  in laying the Pacific Cable; but some of those who were foremost in the agitation for a Government line still continue to do business with the company. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; the rate was reduced to 4s. 9d., and then to 3s. a word ; but there are .merchants who are not grateful for what was done by the Government, and still continue to do business with the company. As a consequence, our share of loss on the Pacific Cable is today about  ,£50,000  per annum. The annual loss is diminishing, and it would disappear altogether were business men as a whole to support the Government enterprise. I have heard of a case in which the  chairman  of a co-operative dairy company is selling his cream to an opposition concern because he can get a slightly higher price for it. We are faced continually by the selfishness and greed of human nature, and are all of us more or less selfish, but it is our duty to protect the community against this selfishness. If the Commonwealth gets the new powers which are asked for we shall probably be unable, because of the cost, to buy out a monopoly like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which, I saw it stated the other day, would expect  £6,000,000  for its property, while the millers would ask  £10,000,000  more. We must be careful that we do not load our national business enterprise with an enormous interest burden such as the borrowing of  £16,000,000  would entail. Therefore, it will pay best to start in opposition to the company. If we are going into the business of supplying the public with goods we must conduct our enterprises on such lines that prices will not be made any higher. Should we desire to compete with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, we should be met with ingratitude such as I have instanced in connexion with the Pacific Cable. After we establish a national sugar refinery, and reduce the wholesale price of sugar, we shall find some ungrateful business men who will desert the national refinery, and patronize the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which previously extorted money from them. </para>

                    <para>Those who suggest that if the Labour party had the power it would nationalize industries right and left are either misleading themselves or the public. We shall have to proceed slowly, and on safe lines, and to bring any monopoly to its knees, must so conduct our business as to supply the public with goods at reasonable rates. In my opinion, State .enterprises should be self-supporting. No doubt, some day, Communism may come about. In some cases, even now, it is found more convenient, instead of charging each householder for the quantity of water he uses, to levy a general rate on the community, and this system may be extended to the supply of other things. Indeed,  at Rome, because of the high price charged by the bakers, it is suggested that the municipality should supply bread. </para>
                    <para>In Sydney, one man fixes the price of butter, and elsewhere there is a bread trust. Any man who undertakes to drive a baker's cart must sign an agreement not to start in business in the district within two years after leaving his employment, while the bakers have agreed among themselves to charge so much per loaf, the millers refusing to supply those who charge less than the stipulated price. These are every-day facts in Australia. If the Parliament were to use at once the supreme powers for which we are asking, it would soon find that many industries are not yet ripe for nationalizing- Honorable members have asked what is a monopoly. I would define a monopoly as a business whose directors have succeeded in eliminating competition, and when that happens, the Federal Parliament, or the State, or the municipality, should interfere. But if we undertook enterprises without due consideration and the application of strict business methods, we shall lose ground, and private enterprise will be given a longer lease of life. </para>
                    <para>There is one important fact upon which I desire to lay great stress. lt is well known that certain capacities are often inherited, and, when cultivated, their possessors acquire pre-eminence in some walk of fife. Thus we have born musicians, born artists, born poets, born inventors, and born farmers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Farrar,</inline> who produced the Federation wheat, was a born farmer, whose work was of great service to his race. The born inventor, too, can be of great use to the community. The born financier, however, does nothing except for himself. The millionaire, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Patten,</inline> who recently retired after a successful corner of the cotton market, having made £4,000,000, said that he owed his fortune to strict attention to the rule of arithmetic that two and two make four, but he rendered no such services to humanity as those of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Farrar.</inline> The ambition of a man like Pierpont Morgan is not to distribute wealth, but to control it. He, I understand, possesses about £200,000,000. If any honorable member were to earn £I,000: a year, and save every penny of it, it would take him a thousand years, if he lived so long, to amass ,£1,000,000. Yet Pierpont Morgan within a brief lifetime has amassed £200,000,000. There is something wrong with our political economy when it makes such a thing possible. I wish, in conclusion, to quote a short passage from Ruskin, who has in eloquent, keen, and analytical language described the people who become rich and those who remain poor -  </para>

                        <para>. - Whilst I am opposed to the proposals of the Government, I must at once admit that I prefer the course they have adopted in this instance to that of attempting, by indirect means, to accomplish that  which  the Constitution does not empower us to do directly. Those who are opposed, as I am, to the provisions of this Bill must, at least, concede the fact that the Government are adopting a straightforward course in selecting this method of giving effect to the desires of their party. The people are to be asked whether these amendments are, or are not, desirable, and I shall have something to say later on as to the effectiveness of the mode adopted for obtaining the will of the people. The Constitution may be amended by the Parliament, but any amendment made by us must be submitted to a referendum of the people, and must secure their approval and the approval of a majority of the States before it can become law. The extent of our power of alteration under section 128 is a question with which I shall deal later on, and it is certainly one of very great importance. T hold that it was never intended that  .'in  alteration of the Constitution should be such as would be calculated to undermine or destroy the instrument itself. Any one unacquainted with the facts, when  listening to the speeches made by the Attorney-General, the honorable member for Flinders, and members opposite must have imagined that those who took part in the Conventions of  1891, 1897,  and  1898  were groping in the dark, and knew nothing of the circumstances of the Federations then in existence. As a matter of fact, we had before us the information that is available to honorable members at the present time. It would be idle, of course, to deny that we have not profited since by our experience of the working of the Commonwealth Constitution; but the fact remains that many members of the Federal Convention were fully cognisant of and familiar with the terms of the Constitutions of the United States and the Dominion of Canada, as well as those of the Germanic Confederation. In connexion with every clause in the Constitution Bill those authorities were constantly consulted. Some honorable members, however, insist upon referring to these several Constitutions as if the members of the Federal Convention were not familiar with them when they drafted that under which we are now working. Although we could not say what would be the interpretation placed upon the language that we employed in granting power to the Federation to deal with trade and commerce, and industrial matters, we knew how far we wished to go. The Government proposal would carry us altogether too far, and would mean an invasion of the arena which was deliberately reserved to the States. The Federation, we understood, was to be a Union in which the States would control internal matters, whilst the Commonwealth would control all matters of national concern extending beyond the limits of a State, and, therefore, incapable of being dealt with by a local Government. It seems, however, quite clear that the Labour party are working in the direction of destroying the States, and gradually bringing about, step by step, a unified form of government. </para>

                            <para>- If we take away one by one the powers of the States, it will not be long before little will be left to them. If the people vote at the referendum for these amendments of the Constitution, we may depend upon it that the increased powers of the Commonwealth will soon be called into requisition. This desire for centralization nowadays is an extraordinary development, more especially in view of the fact that it is expressed for the most part by those who were opposed to Federation. The Labour party, as a party, were undoubtedly opposed to the Federal Union. They feared that Federation would destroy their power and influence, but finding that they were mistaken and that it has increased it, they now believe that Unification, with a central Government controlling the whole of the affairs of Australia, would tend to their greater advantage and benefit. The experience, not only of other countries, but of Australia itself, has not shown that centralization is desirable. New South Wales was the parent Colony, but it was not very long before the settlers in the Port Phillip District, which now forms part of Victoria, made a demand for self-government, and that demand was followed by another from that part of Australia now known as Queensland, which was also granted. For many years there has been a strong agitation for a division of Queensland into three States, so that there is undoubtedly a movement towards decentralization in certain quarters. Many of the people feel that a central Government could not well control the thousand and one details of administration affecting the life of this widely scattered community. If we take all these powers from the States, leaving them only the power to legislate in regard to the lands, the mines, and the education of the people, we shall, I believe, take a step in the wrong direction. Honorable members opposite say, " We have no such idea in our minds," but if the Commonwealth Parliament is vested with these increased powers, we may be sure that it will soon be called upon to exercise them. At every election many local questions now dealt with" by the States will be made the subject of controversy, and we shall be called upon to deal with all sorts of purely State matters, such as the licensing of hotels, hawkers and others, and the whole business of buying and selling and trade and commerce in all its details. If these Bills, be carried, we shall have power to deal with all those matters, and a power once secured is generally exercised. We shall be asked to redress trifling grievances all over Australia, and I certainly think that these proposals go too far. Local self-government and the national control of matters with which the local government cannot deal was the foundation of the Federal system, and that which we all desired. </para>

                            <para>- I have referred to the unsuitability of a unified form of government for Australia, and pointed out that at one time New South Wales had control of most, if not the whole, of this continent, but that separate States were formed because the people were dissatisfied with the way in which the affairs were managed by the central authority. I think that is the general opinion, and suppose that honorable members opposite would not argue that it was advisable for a Federal Parliament meeting in the southeastern portion of the continent to attempt to manage the whole of the affairs, local as well as national, of Australia. It was never intended that it should. Ministers here at present may not intend to use such an authority if it is given to this Parliament, but once it is given the exercise of it will be forced upon us, as time goes on, by dissatisfied constituents and dissatisfied people in the States. Therefore, if we do not want the Commonwealth to exercise the powers now exercised by the States in local matters, the best way to prevent if is not to give it those powers. The honorable member for Hindmarsh yesterday made very disparaging observations regarding our Constitution and Federal Constitutions generally, but I think he should have thought well before he made use of such drastic observations. I. do not believe there is any reason to be dissatisfied with the working of this Constitution. The only dissatisfaction I have felt is due to the actions of honorable members opposite, and those who send them to this Parliament. From the very beginning, they have been dissatisfied with the Federal powers under the Constitution, and have been trying by one means or another to invade the arena reserved to the States. That is the reason why the High Court has had to decide so often against the action of this Parliament in passing legislation close to, or overstepping the border line of State and Federal powers. I blame * honorable members opposite for the whole of that. </para>

I would ask honorable members why Federation was established. Why was it desired by the people of Australia ? Why did the States give up some of their powers, without any pressure, and of their own free will? They gave the Commonwealth nearly all the powers it possesses, some, I believe, coming from the Imperial Parliament. Those powers were given up voluntarily by the people of Australia so that this Parliament should be brought into existence. I read the other day the answer to those queries in a leading journal, published in this city. I altogether concur in the reason given by that publication in the following terms - </para>

                            <para>- The question I asked the House was : " Why was Federation desired, and why did the States give up some of their powers?" I was about to answer that by quoting the opinion of some one who gave the necessary information. I can answer the question without the article, but it seems to me that what I was about to read is only an answer to the question that I put. However, if you, sir, are against me, I shall say no more about it. The reason why the States federated was that there were many matters in which a united Australia was interested, and regarding which a united Australia could do what the States could not do for themselves. It was in order that a Parliament should be brought into existence that would attend to all matters of general or national concern for the whole ot Australia, that the States agreed to federate. They never agreed to do so in order that their internal affairs should be interfered with, or that their land settlement, and other matters, which they thought they could manage altogether for themselves - such as their businesses of buying and selling, licences, and general internal economy and management - should be controlled by the Federal Parliament. It seems to me, however, that, having federated for national purposes in regard to defence, Customs and Excise, and external affairs generally, it is now desired to use the instrument the States then brought into existence in order to intrude on the local arena, and control those matters which the States had no idea of parting with or of giving control of to any one else. I have often said in this House, and must say it again, that the efforts of the party opposite - whether they call themselves the Labour party or the Caucus- Socialistic party, have been always in the direction of invading the arena of legislation reserved to the States. They have got so far now that, perhaps without intending it, they are travelling on a course which, if followed a little further, will destroy altogether the autonomy of the States. A good deal has been said during this debate with regard to the State Upper Houses. When any argument as to the power of the States to do everything necessary is driven home, we are at once confronted wilh the statement that the Upper Houses will not allow reforms to be made. I had a good deal of experience with a nominee Upper' House, in which the numbers were limited, and afterwards for many years with an elected Upper House, and I never found them unreasonable, nor do I think they have been, taking their acts altogether. </para>

                            <para>- They did not always ; but it is not reasonable to expect them always to agree with what is put before them. If they do not pass all the legislation that is proposed to them by the Lower Houses, it is at once assumed that they are an obstruction. They are there, however, for a certain purpose; they are elected for the most part by the people, and they exercise their rights. I do not believe that the acts of the Upper Houses of the States, taking them altogether, have been injurious to the people of this continent. When we say that the States have self-government, and can alter their own Constitutions, it is not a fair argument to say that the Upper Houses block the way. The people may try to get their legislation passed, and may abolish the Upper Houses if they like, or may try to do so. When they do not try to do it with any persistence, it is not fair for honorable members to say that the Upper Houses are an obstruction. If they are an obstruction, why do the States not try to do away with them, or alter their Constitution ? The people should try to do so, and when they have persisted in. the effort- </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members opposite represent only one-third of the electors of Australia, so that I do not see that the honorable member is correct in that assertion. The Bill proposes to ask the electors to say ' ' Yes ' ' or "No" to four proposed amendments of the Constitution, which provide for giving the Commonwealth full control over trade and commerce, both external and internal - over all foreign and State corporations - over monopolies and combinations in relation to the production, manufacture or supply of goods or service, and the control of all industrial matters, including employment and the wages and conditions of employment, and also including the prevention and settlement of disputes. Those four intricate and difficult questions are to be asked in one referendum; and I submit that that is not a fair method. In my opinion, the questions ought to be placed before the electors separately, in view of the possibility that the people may be in favour of one or more of the proposals and against the others ; yet, as now proposed, they must swallow the whole or refuse the whole. As I have indicated, the questions are not closely related ; and, according to the notice I have given, I shall test the question in Committee as to whether they shall be voted on by the people as a whole or separately. If the powers mentioned are to be taken over by the Commonwealth, what will remain to the States? The administration of the lands, I suppose, will yet be with the States Governments, although even that power may be removed if the lands are taxed in the way proposed by members opposite. The mines of the country, also, may be placed almost in the same category, and also education ; but there, again, we are faced with the possibility of the powers even in regard to these being taken over by the Commonwealth, if not by direct means by indirect and roundabout methods. Altogether it appears to me that by proposals such as these the States will lose a great portion of the self-government that they now enjoy. The result of our taking over the control of industrial matters will, I think, be that we shall, in part if not wholly, establish similar conditions and wages all over the Commonwealth ; and I do not know that such a state of affairs is advocated by any one. In those parts of the Commonwealth where the climate and other circumstances render work more arduous, surely those employed are entitled to more consideration than are those who earn their living in the more temperate and agreeable places; no one will say that a worker at Port Darwin should not receive higher wages than a worker in the salubrious climate of Hobart. Of course, unless something be done to equalize wages and conditions, it will be impossible for a State, where the wages are high, to compete industrially with States where the wages are low. In the case of my own State, for instance, .several industries have gravitated to Victoria because of that very difference. I have this session asked this Government whether they can suggest a means by which industries may be kept within States instead of being removed for the reason mentioned. </para>

                            <para>- I am not prepared to admit that, but will the honorable member deny that wages are higher in Perth than in Melbourne, and that, in consequence, the boot industry and the tobacco industry have been destroyed in Perth and have been removed to the east? I do not think that similar wages and conditions all over the Commonwealth are practicable, but something will have to be done to meet the difficulty I have indicated. The late Government made a proposal by which, if Wages Boards, or the State authorities, acted in any way prejudicial to the interests of another State there was an appeal to a Federal tribunal, with power to settle the matter; but that proposal did not become law. At present the Commonwealth has control over all trade and commerce and industrial matters except within a Stale ; and the question now is whether the internal affairs of the States are also to be handed over to the Commonwealth. It certainly was never contemplated by those who framed the Constitution that it should be used as an instrument for invading the arena of the States. For my own part, I should be very chary, indeed, unless with the consent of the States, in doing anything which could be construed into a breach of faith with the people of the States, seeing that they have treated us so generously, and have so trusted us, in endowing this Parliament with such large powers under the Federal Constitution. It has been said that the powers of the Commonwealth are inadequate in regard to the matters mentioned in the Bill ; but let me quote from Bryce again, in. his book, <inline font-style="italic">Studies in History and Jurisprudence.</inline> At page  493,  dealing with the Australian Commonwealth, he says - </para>

                    </quote><para class="block">Vet we are told that the Commonwealth powers are inadequate. In the course of the debate, the amendments already made in the Constitution have been continually referred to ; indeed, too much has been made of this phase of the question. What has been said is not <inline font-style="italic">apropos,</inline> because none of the alterations made up to the present are of much importance or encroach on the powers of the States. There was no principle involved, for instance, in changing the date of the Senate elections from December to April ; and, as to the taking over of the State debts, there was already power to take over  £200,000,000,  and the amendment merely enabled us to take over an additional  £50,000,000.  There was really no change in principle involved in that amendment, the principle having already been adopted in the Constitution in the power to take over the  £200,000,000.  In any case a majority of the States were in favour of the alteration, and, had it not been for misrepresentations, I believe the whole of the people would have acquiesced. Those amendments afford no justification for the attitude of the Attorney-General, and others, who appear to hold that, as we have already made some amendments, we might as well make more. As to the referendum, my own opinion is that no large number of people will be induced to vote in the absence of any agitation or excitement. As a matter of fact, out of two and a quarter millions of electors on the roll, nearly  1,000,000  of the electors did not trouble to vote at the last general election; and yet it is proposed to spend  £40,000  on a referendum at a time when there is not the political excitement of a general election, and when it is therefore likely that even a greater number will not take the trouble to go to the polls. The proposal only shows the lengths to which the Labour party will go. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- The honorable member and his party represent only one-third of the electors of the Commonwealth, and they do not care whether one-third, or a lesser proportion, vote so long as their proposal is carried - to that end they are prepared to destroy the Constitution and the sovereignty of the States. If honorable members opposite are of opinion that the present Constitution is out of joint, why do they not take the straightforward course of agitating for a new one? They prefer to destroy it by degrees, taking away from the States first one power and then another. In this way the sovereignty of the States will be gradually destroyed. Section  1.28  says that the Constitution shall not be " altered " except in a specific manner. What is the meaning of the word "altered"? Does it include repeal ? Can we repeal the Constitution under the powers of section  128  or the Imperial Act and substitute another Constitution for it? There are those who say that the section empowers us to do what we like with the Constitution, but if we cannot repeal it, the question must be asked, how far can we go in that direction? Ls the Imperial Act which covers the Constitution of no avail? It sets forth that the States "agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under the Crown." The Union was agreed to by the people and the Legislatures of the States, and can the States be coerced, by four States out of six, and the powers reserved to the States be taken from them by force? The result of the proposed legislation can only be to destroy the Federation. It would be better to keep the Federal compact inviolate. I deny that the Constitution is out of joint, and see no reason for the drastic proposals which have been put before us; but, were it thought to be out of joint, the best way to provide for its amendment would be for the Parliaments and people of the States to agree as to what alterations should be made, instead of allowing, by the vote of a chance majority, consisting of only a small percentage of the electors, a new and un-Federal Constitution to be foisted on the people, contrary to their wishes and subversive of the Federation into which they solemnly entered. </para>

                        <para>.- This  ls  one of the most important debates which has taken place in this Parliament. I understand the opposition of those who are afraid of any alteration of the Constitution, on the ground that it may have results which are not intended; but honorable members opposite should not contend that the Constitution is unalterable, because those of them who took part in the framing of it were prepared then to admit that, as time went on, alterations might be found to be necessary. Great credit is due to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton and those who helped him to frame the Constitution. They were not afraid of subsequent alterations, their concern being the creation of a nation. The Leader of the Opposition, speaking in this debate, pointed to the map which hangs on the wall to draw attention to the lines which divide State from State; but the object of the Federal Convention was to create one Government which should rule this island continent from ocean to ocean, and its members achieved it. I hope that there will never be anything powerful enough to break up this great union. The Attorney-General, in introducing the Bill, rose to the occasion, and made a speech worthy of the measure. I have not yet heard his statements answered. The position is this: After nearly ten years of experience we are finding an alteration of the Constitution necessary to enable the people to give effect to their wishes. Some of these they expressed at the last election. The Commonwealth needs power to legislate in regard to industrial matters and for the nationalization of monopolies. The people, in giving a majority to the Labour party, required it to introduce a measure providing for a referendum on this question. I do not think that our opponents can be in earnest. If a referendum is taken, the questions submitted to the people should be simply and plainly stated. </para>

                            <para>- I am not in favour of the proposal of the right honorable member for Swan. Our chief object is to gain .the power to legislate in respect of industrial matters and for the nationalization of monopolies. The people of Australia are indebted to the Leader of the Opposition for the work which he has done for them at various times, but when he stated that the nature of these alterations would ruin the Federation, I was forced to interject that his remarks seemed to me like a funeral service.  His  reply was that these measures would bring about the funeral of the Federal power. When he spoke like that, he was not the same Deakin that we knew some years ago. My knowledge of the honorable member for Ballarat goes , back to the holding of a Conference at Corowa many years ago, and I thought that he would have stood by the Federal position, instead of being a champion of State rights. It must not be forgotten that it was those who now constitute the Opposition who proposed the first alterations of the Constitution, namely, those respecting the Financial Agreement and the State debts, while they intended to refer to the people two other questions very similar to those which we wish to refer to them. When this referendum is being discussed, I hope that those who speak on it will confine their remarks to the subject-matter of the proposal, and not dwell on the danger of giving the Labour party power to carry out the legislation which they desire to pass. I hope that honorable members generally will rise to the occasion, and not try to belittle this party. Nothing is gained by personal abuse. I have seen that from an experience of elections extending over the whole course of my life. It will be the members of the Labour party who will have most to do in forming a public opinion regarding the questions at issue in this instance, because the public press will do the work for the other side, and whip us all the time. I hope that the whipping will not deter us from the proper performance of our duty. The object of the attempt to split up the questions to be submitted to the people seems to be to give some honorable members an opportunity to claim that they are in favour of new Protection, and allow others to say that they are opposed to it.- </para>

                    <para class="block">If our honorable friends opposite are really serious in their professed desire to bring about these changes, they will allow the Bill to remain as it stands. The chief measures of a Government have never yet been defeated at the second-reading stage, and so-called attempts to test the feeling of the House on an amendment to a motion for the second reading of a Bill are usually made to induce the people to believe that those responsible for them are the only men carefully watching the political life of the country. I cannot understand why an attack should be made upon us for proposing an alteration of the Constitution. A Constitution that would not permit of amendment would be most undemocratic. There are amongst the Opposition some who assisted in framing that under which we work, and they used to tell us that ft was undoubtedly Democratic, because it could be altered at any time at the will of the people. As I understand that an arrangement has been made to take a division within the next few minutes, I shall not detain the House any longer, although I regard such a measure as this as one of first importance, deserving full discussion. However, since such an arrangement has been made, I am prepared to bow to the will of the House. I sincerely trust that both measures will be put through as quickly as possible, for I am sure that the country is thirsting for the amendments of the Constitution which are now proposed. </para>

                        <para>. - I have twenty minutes within which to discuss the far-reaching questions which these Bills involve, and I shall try to compress my remarks within that space of time, so that a division may be taken at the hour arranged. My speech, I hope, will be a study in condensation. No one can overstate the importance of these proposals. I entirely agree with the Acting Prime Minister when, in the course of his able speech in moving the second reading of this Bill, he said that the proposals involved were by far the most important questions with which the Parliament has yet had to deal. It seems to me that if they are carried there will be scarcely a State function that is not invaded, or a State power that is not potentially destroyed. This industrial power will ramify into every nook and cranny of our industrial and social life, and there will not be an aspect of our social concerns that will not be profoundly affected. The control of the lands under these provisions will be liable to be taken from the States. Let that be understood. You may not begin to nationalize your mines - you may not begin to appreciably regulate the conditions of mining - without also appreciably regulating the conditions of land tenure which are precedent to mining operations. I cite that as a simple illustration, and the same may be said with regard to your railways, your shipping, and your sugar industry. The Labour party propose to deal with the sugar industry, and, possibly, to nationalize it. If they do, they must deal with the lands devoted to the production of sugar-cane. Thus we may find the States stripped of every power left to them under the Constitution as it stands. It will be impossible to confine the scope and range of the powers that are proposed to be taken. I ask myself, as I have been doing throughout this debate, what necessity is there tor amendments so drastic, so far-  reaching, and so fraught with consequences to the future integrity of the States. I am told in an airy fashion by the honorable member for Hindmarsh to look for an answer to the decisions of the High Court. When I examine them, I find that all that the High Court has had, perforce, time and again, to tell us, is that we are dabbling with matters which the framers of the Constitution never intended us to touch, and that certain acts on our part have been <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> What is the High Court for if not to confine us to our proper ambit, and to limit us to the proper exercise of our true Constitutional powers? Surely that Court is to act as much by prohibition as by the conferment of privilege? There seems to be an underlying presumption, however, in the minds of honorable members, that, no matter what we do, if the High Court refuses to agree with us, we must take further power so that we may do just what we please. That is not Federation. We might as well have no High Court if we are not going to observe the limitations that it imposes. We had better at once revert to a complete unitary system such as the honorable member for Hindmarsh desires. In that he is quite logical, and always has been. He has been for Unification first, last, and always, and therefore his argument can be readily understood. But we reach other considerations when we come to view the necessity for these drastic proposals in the light, say, of the speech delivered the other evening by the honorable member for Flinders. </para>

I should like here to answer the honorable member for Flinders, who declared that he believed the people had deliberately chosen that the experiment of regulating <inline font-style="italic">wages</inline> by a Federal tribunal should have a fair and full trial. Therefore, he said, we should give power to that body which could best do the work. </para>

                            <para>- "Best" was the word used by the honorable member, but "effectually" will do just as well. Might I suggest that that really begs the whole question, and turns us back to the consideration of what power can and ought to control those matters, and what power can do so most effectively. That really does not bring us any nearer a solution of this matter, and so we push back to a consideration of what is wise and prudent rather than what the people intended when this instrumentality was brought into existence. With regard to these interesting questions of jurisdiction, when we see the High Court dealing with this question and that, and, on the other hand, observe the industries of the. country rolling on undisturbed, growing in volume and importance, and making the people infinitely more prosperous than they were, it does seem to me that we really can -afford a great deal of this legal experimenting without seriously affecting or modifying the prosperous condition of the country. I always feel that the Commonwealth is like that Roman knight of old, who, clad in armour, turned and said, as the shafts hurtled about him, " Did a leaf fall ?" It seems to me that what is transpiring in the High- Court from day to day, more particularly with regard to industrial matters, affects and modifies the great courses of public prosperity just about as much as the falling of a leaf would do. In one sense, the Federation itself is an artificial creation. I agree with the honorable member for Flinders that these artificial distinctions do not count for much, and that some of them seem to be absurd. But, on the other hand, he will recollect that in one sense the Federation itself is an artificial creation, in that it represents an arbitrary division of powers, and none the less arbitrary because it happens at the same time to be logical and sequential. We come back to the broad consideration of what is wise, and prudent, and best to be done, so that we may get greater efficiency out of our Government, and bring it in the most beneficent way close to the industrial life of the community. The starting on one side of the boundary or the other of an engine does not matter very much, so far as the totality of the business portion of the country is concerned. I come back to the question, What is the real necessity for these far-reaching proposals? What is the trouble that makes them necessary? Will their rejection cause trouble; or, if the trouble be present, will the powers now proposed to be taken to the Commonwealth completely cure it ? In other words, will the sum of the general advantage be increased by the Federal acquirement of these further industrial powers as proposed by the Government? Where are the abuses that these proposals are intended to cure? When I look for them, what do I find? Wages steadily rising all over Australia, no strikes, perfect peace so far as we know, within the industrial arena ; the condition of the workers, in particular, easing with the passing of every day, and all because of the multiplication of those local ameliorative agencies that have done such infinite good within the spheres of State activity. And so honorable members go on. They assume the necessity when they make these propositions now before the House. The honorable member for Flinders told us, also, what I think is an undoubted fact, that our Federation is so shaped that we have actually weaker powers than has almost any other Federation. So far as the <inline font-style="italic">Quantum</inline> of our powers goes, I think that that is so. I agree that they are few in number, and perhaps less than those of any other Federation. But I hope that my honorable friends will not forget that in nearly every Federation of which we know the instrumentalities have all been shaped so as effectually to achieve the objects which they have had in view. Nearly every other Federation has been shaped under pressure from without. Ours, on the other hand, has been shaped on entirely prudential considerations, with n perfect absence of pressure. There- '' fore, there has been no need for us to create such a great central authority as has been found absolutely necessary in other cases. Every one knows, for instance, why a strong centralized Government is needed in South Africa. There they have native problems that are tremendous in their import, and which must and can only be dealt with by a strong central power. Then they have a dual language, and all the educational problems arising out of that dual language and that dual racial relation. On the top of it all there is a very small white population - only a handful to hold that vast continent and control the destinies of all that native life. One sees at once why their Constitution has been established in an entirely different way from our own. In Canada we have the problem of two races living side by side under the one Constitution, the very thing which the honorable member for Hindmarsh said could not be done. It is being done to-day in Canada, where the French and British populations work side by side under a common instrument without, so far as we are aware, the slightest trouble. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite aware that it is not, and that is one of the illustrations I propose to use. My great objection to the Government's proposals is that they profoundly disturb the balance of the Constitution. That balance will have to be redressed if they are carried. So the Leader of the Opposition was quite right when he said that this was only a beginning. Carry these proposals and you must go a great deal further. You cannot stop here. To do so would make your Constitution lopsided, and absolutely undemocratic. To put it in a nutshell, if the Federal Government are to have potential control, through the trade and commerce clause, and through the proposals for the nationalization and regulation of monopolies, over all these State agencies and State powers, what about your Senate? What about your parliamentary control ? One of the main objections of the Acting Prime Minister to this Constitution is that it is undemocratic. The Labour party opposed it violently at the beginning of things, because of its undemocratic character. An equal State Senate, they said, is an anachronism in a democratic community, and so it is if you consider it from the point of view of con- trolling the whole or the main portion of the powers of the country. Yet they almost went beside themselves, in the early part of last year, with rage, fury, and violence, in their opposition to a proposal to put the financial proposition of the States and the late Government into the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, that is what they said. They said it was laying the " dead hand " of the Constitution on all the future, but that proposal related only to the apportionment of the  finances -  a question of whether the payment to the States should be  25s.,  or some other sum, <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> Is that half as important as putting the mines, railways, shipping, lands, and industries of Australia into the control of this " dead hand ' ' ? Honorable members opposite strained at a gnat, and are going to swallow this camel. They are about to put all these instrumentalities into the control of an undemocratic Senate. That kind of thing cannot last. </para>

They may rest assured that, as sure as they are sitting there, the people will reverse the judgment of that day and bring about a very different order of things. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member will believe me, I have no wish in the matter ; but I am concerned as an Australian Democrat as to how far the party opposite are going to place all the instrumentalities of this country under the control of a Senate, based on the equal representation of the States - a thing they are never tired of denouncing from the house-tops  as  undemocratic, and out of keeping with the spirit of the times. Let me ask the Government what corollary  propositions  they have to make to those now before the Chamber. It has been incontestably shown that they are introducing proposals which will take from the States, if desired, nearly all those things .which make up their Statehood, taking them from Constitutions which are relatively democratic, and placing them under a Constitution which the party opposite themselves declare to be absolutely undemocratic. So, I. say, that they must redress the balance of the Constitution before very long. I admit that, as the Acting Prime Minister very properly pointed out, the Federal, character of a Constitution does not depend upon the number of powers which are taken over, but it does depend upon the nice balance and adjustment of those powers. As set forth by the honorable member for Angas, in his memorandum, it depends upon whether those powers are self-sufficient and effective in their use. I apply that test to these proposals. In my judgment the Labour party cannot get what they want in the way they are proposing. It has been asseverated by the Acting Prime Minister, and by the Leader of the Government, who is now on his way to South Africa, that they are not going to take these industrial powers from the States, but that all they are asking for is concurrent power. It seems to me that concurrent powers exercised effectively must lead simply to concurrent confusion. Take as an illustration what happened during the Newcastle strike. Just when that dispute was on the point of settlement the engine-drivers of Victoria stepped in and appealed to the Arbitration Court to be joined in it. The result was to put that settlement back for some time. </para>

                            <para>- No, No, but it might have done. It was only owing to the good sense of the Judge here that it did not. That kind of thing, if multiplied will have a deterrent effect on the settlement of these disputes, and, in fact, prevent settlement. You cannot have two bites at a cherry in this way, and the concurrent powers, referred to by the Government, will ultimately resolve themselves into the supreme controlling power of the Federation over all those matters which are now left exclusively to the States. </para>

                    <para>At the same time, I admit that things have been somewhat altered by the recent decision of the High Court, and it is just as well to come squarely up to the situation as we find it to-day. Even since last year things have happened which greatly modify the industrial situation, and I admit that since the common rule has gone there has gone with it the effectiveness of that paragraph in the Constitution which provides for " the settlement and prevention of industrial disputes." You cannot prevent industrial disputes unless you have power to make general awards. In the absence of that power, I admit that the operation of the arbitration clause would tend rather to the multiplication than the settlement of disputes. So it comes to this, that we have to look at the situation anew, and meet it in the light of recent happenings. I, therefore, am prepared to go a step further than we otherwise would have gone if that rule had not been taken out of the Constitution. For all practical purposes that provision is a dead letter, so far as the preventive side of it is concerned, and, therefore, something must be done to restore it. In doing that we may still preserve the line of demarcation between what is Federal and what is State. Why interfere with the State Courts, which are doing their work well? Why take power to interfere in the settlement of disputes in the light of local circumstances and surroundings? We ought to be content when we take sufficient power to control all matters which have become Federal in their character by the Inter-State ramifications of the industries affected. So, to sum up this view of the matter, I am proposing an amendment which will represent the views of this side of the House on the question of industrial control now proposed by the Government. I move - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That after the word "That" the following words be inserted: - "in the opinion of this House the industrial provisions of the Constitution should not be altered except to regulate the conditions of employment in all industries that are Federal in operation or which cannot be effectually regulated by any one State; further enabling the Inter-State Commission to prevent and remove unfair competition between the same industries carried on in different States." </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>As I view it, the amendment simply strikes a purely Federal line, as the course which should be followed by the Federal Parliament and Government. It leaves State instrumentalities intact, and as complete in their powers as they are to-day, wherever they are organized, to deal with all matters of purely domestic concern in the light of local circumstances. After all, the fundamental idea of the Federation is to take over the control of, shall I say, purely national industrial matters, in which every member of the community is equally interested, wherever he may reside throughout the length and breadth of Australia. But by the same reasoning all our purely local and domestic concerns should be rigidly excluded from the Federal sphere and left to the control of the State agencies. The amendment, therefore, strikes a clear line of demarcation between Federal and State industrial functions - a line which would lead us, not into confusion as the proposals of the Government undoubtedly will, but out into the broad, open Federal path. It will make our course as clear, and open, and plain as we leave the course clear, open, and plain for the various States. In this way the State power will implement the Federal power; the Federal power will implement and complement the State powers. We shall thus get an effective exercise of industrial power, which I hope, as we all do, will lead to industrial peace in the future of this great continent. </para>

                        <para>. - I am not quite certain that I understand the full meaning and purport of the amendment, or exactly what its effect may be. I understand, however, that it will not have the effect of, in Committee, limiting the action of those who, though they may vote for it, may favour effective control by the Federal Parliament, not only with regard to the settlement of disputes, but in regard to the regulation of all industrial conditions in all classes of industrial matters, which are not of the merest local kind and exclusively subjects for the States. I take it that it will be open to us to consider those matters in Committee. </para>

                            <para>- That is an extremely vague definition. The point is, what is the precise meaning of the amendment? If it means, as I interpret it, to give this Parliament complete and effective control of that class of industrial matters over which, previously, it was given an arbitration control, then probably we shall be enabled to go as far as I desire to go in Committee. Whether it means that or not, I am not quite certain; but that is the way I read it, and, certainly, that is the kind of limitation I shall be prepared to support. </para>

                <para class="block">The late  Speaker  held on former occasions, when a statutory majority was necessary, that it was sufficient to have a statutory majority on the third reading.  I  am not here to interpret what is the meaning of the Constitution, but I take it that, on an occasion like this, when there is no division, I should certainly certify that the necessary statutory majority had been obtained. I take it that, as there was no division called for, the necessary numbers were here. However, whether the House deem that sufficient or whether or not it is sufficient is not for me to say. There was no division called for, and I declared the motion carried. </para>

                        <para>-  I take it that there is only one official way of determining the number of members who vote on a particular measure, and that is by officially recording the number. Whether that is required in this instance is another question. There was no call for a division; and the  Speaker  declared the second reading passed. What procedure the Attorney-General will now adopt I do not know, and it is for him to determine; but any steps he thinks necessary, in order to place on record a fact which may be of importance, will receive no opposition from us. </para>

                        <para>-  I submit that this discussion is out of order, as fresh business has been called on. The matter should have been settled prior to the taking of the vote. All that can be done now is for the  Clerk  to state in the official record that the second reading of the Bill passed in the affirmative. The statutory affirmative majority can be shown by taking a division on the third reading, which is the only stage at which that is necessary. </para>

                        <para>-  I submit that no further action is needed now. The Constitution requires that there shall be a statutory majority for the passing of any Bill for the alteration of the Constitution. In the House of Commons, after a Bill has passed through its three readings, the motion is put, " That it do now pass." Our Standing Orders, however, provide that the passing of the Bill is to be taken to occur when the third reading is affirmed, and, therefore, a statutory majority is necessary only on the third reading. At this stage the  Clerk  will merely enter on his record that the second reading was passed by a majority. </para>

                        <para>-  I submit that the discussion of the constitutional position now is out of order, you, sir, having ruled that the Bill has passed its second reading. As honorable members have left the chamber since the question was put, it would be impossible to say now how many voted in the affirmative. Certainly the  Clerk  has no power to enter on his record that a certain number took part in a division, when you stated that the question passed in the affirmative without taking a division. </para>

                        <para>- I am not to be taken as having given a ruling on this subject, because I have not done so; but the question raised by the Attorney-General seemed to me to be of sufficient importance to warrant the waiving of the ordinary rules of procedure to allow of its discussion. There was no call for a division when I took the voices, and therefore I declared that the Ayes had it. When the motion that the Bill be now read a third time is put, I shall, following the practice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Holder, order the bells to be rung, so that I may ascertain the number of those voting in the affirmative, and give my certificate that the question has been carried by the statutory majority. </para>

The Minister of Home Affairs called loudly with the "Ayes " when the question, * That the motion be agreed to," was put a few minutes ago, yet he voted with the " Noes." I cannot say whether or not pressure was exercised on him, but <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> view of the practice which usually obtains in Parliament, and the long statements that have been made this morning regarding the consistency of Ministers, I should like to ask whether it was competent for the honorable member, after calling with the " Ayes," to vote with the "Noes"? </para>

You apprehended the difficulty that might arise, because some one might give notice of a motion and keep it standing on the notice-paper all the session, thus preventing honorable members from discussing the subject referred to. If I had moved the motion I could understand your objection to my discussing it, but it is still merely a notice of motion. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is quite right in saying that the notice of motion does not become a motion, and the property of the House, until he moves it, but if he gives notice of a motion and I permit a discussion of it now, another discussion of the same matter could take place when it was called on. The Standing Orders distinctly provide that no question once dealt with shall be dealt with again in the same session. The honorable member must not anticipate the discussion of a motion set down on the notice-paper unless he withdraws it. </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to make a personal explanation. More than a fortnight ago I made an arrangement with the honorable member for Grampians to pair with him on any division in the House during my absence. I had accepted an invitation from New South Wales to assist the Labour candidates at the recent general elections there ; but was detained here a week longer than I expected. During my absence in connexion with the elections the arrangement with the honorable member for Grampians was evidently overlooked. This was due to some inadvertence, and while wishing to acquit the honorable member of all blame, it is only right that I should explain how my name came to be omitted from the divisions which took place on the Land Tax Assessment Bill. </para>

                            <para>- The papers were forwarded to us' by the representative of the Commonwealth in Great Britain. Even supposing some of the statements referred to by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports appear to be a little exaggerated, they would only act as an antidote to the scandalous libels circulated on the Continent. The officers of the Department take all reasonable precautions to secure that every statement published in any sense under their authority is absolutely accurate. Necessarily the information as to land available and so forth has to be obtained from the States - it would be impossible for any one man to know all the facts - and that information has, of course, to be accepted. It would be impossible to follow up every misstatement that may be made, but definite instructions have been issued to prevent the issue of any exaggerations. However, if the exaggerations are in favour of Australia, 1 do not think we need kick up such  a  dust. </para>
