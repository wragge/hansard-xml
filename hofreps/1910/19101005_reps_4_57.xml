            <para>- I wish to call the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs to an advertisement which appeared in yesterday&#39;s newspapers, headed, &#34; Department of Lands and Surveys, Perth,  23rd  September.&#34; The advertisement points out that there is in Western Australia, surveyed and open to selection,  550  blocks aggregating  643,000  acres, serviceable for wheat-growing or sheep farming;  323  blocks, aggregating  102,000  acres, serviceable for fruit, sheep, and cereals ; and  240  blocks, aggregating  37,000  acres, suitable for dairying, fruit, root crops, and stock. I draw the honorable gentleman&#39;s attention also to a statement made on the date I have given by the Minister of Lands for Western Australia, to the effect that  1,000,000  acres of land have been surveyed for settlement in that State, but have not yet been sold. Will the honorable gentleman see. that these facilities for settlement are advertised in London, so that the people there who need land may come to Australia and get it? </para>

            <para>- The regulation referred to has been in force since Federation, and applies only to cases in which new lines have to be erected. It does not affect  99  per cent. of the telephone subscribers, new subscribers usually paying only for a year in advance, and after that half-yearly in advance. But where the Department has to erect poles and lines for the convenience of a single subscriber, the Deputy PostmastersGeneral are empowered to demand two, three, four, or five years&#39; rent in advance, according to the cost of the work. No new regulation has been issued, and I am surprised that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> should publish such an article as that referred to. </para>

            <para>- The question just asked by the honorable member for Bourke required the preparation of a return giving minute details, involving great care and expense. Formerly, such information always required to be asked for in the shape of a return, instead of being obtained in answer to a question, but our practice seems to be becoming more and more lax. The authority of the House should be necessary to any request of the kind. </para>

          <para>. - I propose to ask the Committee to amend this clause by adding, after the word &#34; land,&#34; in line  5,  the words &#34; to the extent of  25  per centum or more;&#34; by inserting the same words as a consequential amendment in subparagraph i. of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c ;</inline> by striking out sub-paragraph ii. of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> and by adding to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> a provision that the owner shall also be paid an allowance of  10  per cent. upon the improved value mentioned in the paragraph for compulsory dispossession. The clause, then, as amended, will provide that where there is an undervaluation to the extent of  25  per cent. or more, the Commissioner may apply to a Justice of the High Court, who, if satisfied that there has been undervaluation to that extent, may make the declaration necessary to clothe the Commissioner with the powers set out in the clause, and the Commonwealth may then acquire the land for that price, plus  10  per cent. upon the whole value, whatever it is. </para>

            <para>- To some extent, we are. Practically, that was the arrangement in the case of the Cheviot estate. Honorable members will see that an important change is to be made in the clause by these amendments. Formerly, it was not necessary to prove any particular amount of undervaluation, and the intention to defraud need not be shown. It was a sort of Scotch verdict of &#34; not proven.&#34; The clause, as it will be amended, will require the Commissioner to prove only the one fact, that there has been, whether wilfully or not, an under valuation of  25  per cent. or more. That will then place the Commonwealth in the position, subject to the Constitution, of acquiring the land by paying  10  per cent. above, not the unimproved value, but the value of the land, whatever it is. </para>

          <para>. -The clause will be considerably improved in some respects by the amendments suggested by the Attorney-General, but in other respects, if I apprehend the effect of the amendments correctly, it will not be improved. I had on the margin of my Bill a note to insert in sub-paragraph i. of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> the words &#34; to the extent of  25  per cent.&#34; after the word &#34; has.&#34; That is to the same effect as the amendment foreshadowed by the Attorney-General. As, however, this is a rather unnecessary clause, we ought to make it as little drastic as possible. I call it unnecessary because South Australia has no such provision. I understand that New Zealand has it, but I have not been able to find out the number of cases in which it has been put into operation there. I believe there have been some purchases. I have heard of one or two cases in which the Commissioner has suddenly jumped on a man by offering  10  per cent. on his valuation and taking the land over, but I cannot say, from any research that I have been able to make, whether it has been found necessary in New Zealand to put the section into effect. In South Australia, in order to be sure about the matter, I asked the Taxation Department whether they have had many cases of sales of land under the Act owing to the tax being two years in arrear. There, under the Taxation Act, they have power to do what municipal corporations can do when rates are in arrears. They may make application to the Court for the sale of the land, but I believe that in only one or two cases has it been found necessary to take that course owing to the extent to which the tax was in arrears. If that is so, it shows that this clause is really unnecessary, because the other remedies were action in Court for the amount, or distress upon the goods and chattels of the defaulting taxpayer; and in all cases except one or two, where I believe the land was derelict, the ordinary provisions for the recovery of debts, coupled with the power to ask for sale, have been found thoroughly effective. They are always effective in the case of municipalities, which have had legislation on this question </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Ibr fifty or sixty years - indeed, before any land taxation was imposed in Australia. That being so, I regard this clause as unnecessary ; and if read in connexion with the Lands Acquisition Act of 1906, as it must be, it is likely to lead to a good deal of embarrassment. This clause must be read in connexion with that Act. </para>

            <para>- Yes; sub-clause / says that when the proclamation declaring the compulsory taking of the land is put into force, the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act apply as far as they are applicable. That will mean the dislocation of the terms of wills and deeds of trusts. This power is not vested in an ordinary freeholder as denned by the Bill, but, under the Lands Acquisition Act, in a wide category of persons with subordinate interests, who are regarded as owners for the purposes of the Act. Whether we may have to amplify &#34;owner&#34; under the Bill to meet the requirements in regard to the Lands Acquisition Act, I cannot say; but it is quite clear that we can upset settlements by applying that Act; and to the extent to which settlements are destroyed we shall be obliged to make compensation, and to bring into force a whole host of provisions necessary in acquiring lands for public purposes. Under this Bill, however, all that is clearly unnecessary; and it is a great pity to interfere with settlements and other interests under the circumstances. If the clause be not excised its terms ought to be cut down as much as possible; and I suggest that after the word &#34;Act&#34; the words &#34;wilfully with a view to evade taxation &#34;be inserted. Unless the Commissioner thinks there is attempt at evasion, he should not ask a Court of Justice to declare for compulsory purchase. If this provision is not required for the purpose of recovering the tax, it ought not to be introduced merely as a penal clause for punishing people for doing something that does not involve injury to the State. All the justification that we find for the amendment of the AttorneyGeneral is that there may be undervaluation to the extent of 25 per cent. ; and if there be such undervaluation the declaration must be made, however innocently the taxpayer may have acted. </para>

In Customs matters the Department cannot check values which are at the place of export. It should be necessary to show that the undervaluation is wilful with a view to evade taxation ; and the Attorney-General himself saw the necessity for altering the clause, only his alteration, instead of curing the defects, puts aside altogether the necessity of raising the question of wilfulness or evasion.

          <para>. - I do not know whether honorable members are yet fully seized of what the amendment of the Attorney-General really means ; but it seems to me that the honorable gentleman&#39;s proposal removes the last rag of decency from a measure already sufficiently drastic in the way of spoliation. The valuation of land with all improvements, in some districts, and under some circumstances, admits of innocent error far exceeding 25 per cent. ; and this fact is known to any one of experience. I do not say that this applies to all cases. <inline font-style="italic">In</inline> the case of city lands it rarely applies, though sometimes it does ; but in the case of some country lands it applies frequently. If there be room for error in the case of lands for which there is a market value and price with the improvements, there is infinitely more room in the case of what we call the unimproved value - when we have first to ascertain the improved value, and then subtract that very vague and indefinite thing called the unimproved value. The original provisions of the Bill were sufficiently drastic, the assumption being that every land-owner whose valuation differed from that of the Commissioner was a rogue. But an opportunity was given to prove that he was not, and that opportunity is now to be taken from him. In all cases in which there is a difference of  25  per cent. in regard to that very indefinite thing, the unimproved value of land, between the valuation of the land-owner and that of the officer appointed to make a valuation, the land-owner is to be deemed a criminal, and his land is to be taken from him, without a chance being given to him to show that he did not wilfully undervalue his land. Were it not for my belief that the clause will in all probability be declared unconstitutional, and may drag down the measure with it, I should regard this as an extremely serious matter. No doubt, as the Minister of Trade and Customs interjected, the Customs Act imposes on the man who imports goods at a certain valuation the onus of proving that that valuation is correct ; but the value of goods is always definite, and easily ascertainable from invoices. Honorable members on this side can only protest - but we must protest as strongly as we can - against violent injustice done in the name of taxation. I hope that the amendment of the honorable member for Angas will be carried, or, at all events, that the opportunity will be taken by those on this side to express their opinion of this kind of legislation. </para>

          <para>. - I am at a loss to know how to please some honorable members. I have brought down a proposal which more than meets the suggestions made to me, and now further suggestions are put forward which, if adopted, would virtually disembowel the measure. We have been told that the effect of the tax will be to depreciate land values by from  50  to  70  per cent., and to create chaos in the real estate market. If honorable gentlemen opposite believe that, they should be glad to accept my proposal, which enables landed proprietors to unload on the Commonwealth at their own valuation plus  10  per cent. Personally, if I could sell whatever land I might own at my own valuation plus  10  per cent., I should consider that I was doing remarkably well by the transaction.

I  ascertained to-day from the Minister in charge of the New Zealand legislation that the Government of the Dominion did not continue the provision under which estates had to be resumed at  10  per cent., in addition to the valuation, because the Cheviot estate cost &#163;400,000, and it was afraid that it might be asked to purchase five or six others. It had not the option which we ask for. Every one must know what his land is worth to him. </para>

            <para>- I turned towards the honorable member for Hume because 1 thought that he was taking a special interest in this matter. Contrasting the methods of this Government with those of the last&#39; in regard to vital measures, I am bound to say that the advantage is with us. The honorable member must know perfectly well that the Government have a majority. I am doing my very best to meet objections from every quarter ; but the Government must stand by a measure in which it believes, regardless of whether or not the Opposition believe in it, and I am endeavouring, as well as I am able, to put the case from our stand-point. Surely the Opposition do not expect me also to put their side of the case before the Committee. In my opinion, the effect of an acquisition of the land will be to acquire only, as set forth in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e,</inline> the estate of a person who has made an undervaluation. My honorable friend has spoken of the position of trustee estates, and I have already said that my opinion is that what will pass will be the estate of a beneficiary, whatever that is. </para>

            <para>- And, in doing so, the honorable gentleman turned almost completely towards his own party for at least ten minutes. If we advance arguments from this side of the Committee, it is only fair to expect the AttorneyGeneral to address his reply, partly, to us. It may be that he wished to address the honorable member for Hume, whom, as the third party in the House, he is entitled to try to convince, in order to turn the scale, in the event of a division. The issue under discussion is very simple, and really reduces itself to a question of whether or not some evidence shall be required to. show that an undervaluation is wilful. The provision proposed by the honorable member for Angas, which the Attorney-General has spent a quarterofanhour in endeavouring to show to be unnecessary, was really contained in -his Bill as originally introduced. In sub-clause 2 of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> he will find the very principle for which the honorable member for Angas is contending. </para>

            <para>- That is for the Committee to determine. The AttorneyGeneral provided in his own Bill that one of the conditions of forfeiture should be that the Justice was &#39; 1 not satisfied that the undervaluation was not made wilfully.&#34; That was an adoption of a method of procedure pioneered in Commonwealth legislation by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> C. Kingston. The Attorney-General provided that there must be an element of. wilful misrepresentation to satisfy the Justice ; but that provision he himself has since struck out. The honorable member for Angas now says to the honorable gentleman, &#34; Your first thought was right. There should be an element of wilfulness in this offence,&#34; and he therefore proposes to replace in the Bill the clause which the Attorney-General originally had there. </para>

I refer to this matter to show that the Attorney-General addressed his arguments to his own party to convince them, not that the amendment, as proposed by the honorable member for Angas, was wrong, but that he himself was wrong in the first place, and was now seeking to do that which was right. The question is whether we are going to compel people to be dragged before a Court with respect to an alleged undervaluation, and, as the honorable member for Flinders has contended, to empower a Judge or magistrate to forfeit a man&#39;s land at 10 per cent, over his own valuation, or 15 per cent, under the valuation made by the Crown, without some evidence of its being wilfully or knowingly done? </para>

            <para>- It must do so. In the clause we have the word &#34;shall,&#34; not &#34;may&#34;; and a magistrate will be a mere automaton,- controlled by this statutory power. In the case of a man who has valued his estate at &#163;10,000, whereas the Government say that it is worth &#163;12,500, the Government now propose, not that they should take over that estate at their&#39; officer&#39;s valuation of &#163;12,500, but that they should take it over at &#163;11,000, 10 per cent, over the owner&#39;s valuation, or, roughly, 15 per cent, under the valuation of the Government&#39;s own officers. The AttorneyGeneral did not seem to understand the argument advanced, by the honorable member for Flinders. He said that, in a case of alleged undervaluation, a man would receive 10 per cent, on the proper valuation. The whole contention, in regard to value, is, however, that that advance would be 10 per. cent., not on the real value, but on the alleged undervaluation. Under the Customs Act the real value is taken. </para>

            <para>- There is no parallel between the circumstances of this clause and those of the section in the Customs Act to which the honorable gentleman has referred. In the case of goods there is an ascertainable value, concerning which experts will agree ; but the position in regard to land is altogether different. I do not know that the AttorneyGeneral has had much practice on questions of land values, but in resumption cases - and I speak with a great deal of experience - half-a-dozen experts will sometimes give widely different valuations, differing, in some instances, to the extent of 50 per cent. It is strange that an attempt should be made to introduce into this Bill a drastic provision of this kind, which assumes that we are dealing with dishonest men. There are, doubtless, plenty of dishonest men in the world ; but it is a fair rule of life to presume a man to be honest until it is proved that he .is dishonest. In a Bill of this kind, which deals in a comprehensive and drastic manner with the principal form of wealth in this country, it hardly becomes us to begin with the assumption that every land-owner is dishonest, and to throw upon him the onus of showing, not that he is not dishonest, but that he has not undervalued his land, however innocently. This amendment is really a proposal to reinstate a provision of the Bill as originally introduced, and which the Attorney-General has .had time to discuss and to consider with the members of his party. I think I can say that, if he is prepared to restore the clause to the form in which it stood as introduced, the honorable member for Angas will not press his amendment. If that is done a land-owner will have an opportunity of showing that he has not made a dishonest valuation in the return submitted by him to the authorities. </para>

          <para>. - I appeal to the Attorney-General to withdraw this clause. Its object is, presumably, to secure correct valuations, and there are already in the Bill penal clauses providing for the punishment of any person who sends in a false return deliberately understating the value of his land with intent to defraud. Any one who does that will be liable, on conviction, to have his land forfeited. If he does any other acts, or neglects to do certain things, with the intention of evading the tax, he is also liable to conviction and his land to forfeiture. Those provisions being already in the Bill, there is no necessity for this clause. </para>

            <para>- It is a penalty, because  he may be living on his own property and - working it as his business. He may be in the city and may not want to sell the land&#39; at all. It may be essential to him to carry his business on in that particular spot where he has the goodwill of his business; but under this clause the Commonwealth can take the whole of his property from him and thereby deprive him of his means of livelihood. If that is not a penalty I do not know what is. If what the AttorneyGeneral is aiming at is a correct valuation, the whole of the machinery of the Bill is directed towards that end. A man sends in his return, and it is the duty of the Commissioner immediately he receives it to go into it and see if it is correct. If the Commissioner does not think it is correct, he assesses the value, and that assessment stands unless the owner successfully appeals against it. There you have the complete machinery to obtain a correct assessment. In this case, the whole procedure is stopped beforehand. The man is not allowed to get to the Appeal Court to see if his valuation is correct or not. The matter is taken out of the hands of the Court altogether. As soon as the man sends iii his assessment, the Commissioner, if of opinion that it is 25 per cent, lower than it ought to be, does not try to have it corrected, but takes steps right away under this clause for the purpose of depriving the man of his land. The clause is evidently not for the purpose of getting a correct assessment at all. </para>

            <para>- It is not an appeal at all. The owner sends in what he thinks is the fair value of his property ; but, without getting it assessed by the Commissioner and heard by the ordinary Assessment Court, he finds the matter taken clean out of his hands, and an application made to the Court for the enforcement of these provisions. The Attorney-General is by no means following the New Zealand proce-dure in this case. In New Zealand the man sends in his return to the Commissioner, who assesses it. If the owner be dissatisfied, he can go to the Appeal Court, and the Court assesses the value. After the value has been assessed by the Assessment Court, and evidence heard on both sides, the Commissioner may, if dissatisfied, come in and attempt to acquire the land. If the Commissioner is of opinion that any land has been fixed by the Assessment Court at less than its capital value, he may give notice to the owner that he requires the owner to consent to the capital value being fixed at a sum specified in the notice - being the sum which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is the fair value of the land - and that failing such consent being given, after the notice, the Commissioner may recommend the Governor _ to acquire the land on behalf of His Majesty at that sum. The owner may consent to the capital value being fixed at the sum specified in the notice, or at any other sum agreed to by him and the Commissioner. If there be no consent by the owner, then the land may be acquired. On the other hand, procedure is given to protect the owner where he is not satisfied with the value of the land as fixed by the Assessment Court. He may give notice to the Commissioner requiring the amount to be reduced to the amount specified in a notice, or requiring the land to be acquired on behalf of His Majesty at the sum specified in the notice. That is an entirely different procedure from what the Attorney-General contemplates. </para>

            <para>- As a rule, preambles are not put into clauses. The Attorney- General wants to conceal the fact that what he is really after is the acquisition of lands. The preamble is intended to convey the idea that the clause is put into the Bill only for the purpose of protecting the revenue, but paragraph <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> reveals the real intention of the clause. The object is that, if the State Government does not require the land, the Commonwealth shall acquire it, and sell or lease it as it thinks fit, and thus initiate a Federal land policy. The Attorney-General stated during the debate that under this clause he was exercising the power of acquiring public lands. He cannot support the constitutionality of this clause upon that power, because he is not exercising in it the power of acquiring lands for public purposes. </para>

In a great many trust estates the land is vested in the trustee who holds it as an estate of fee-simple. Under this clause, if a trustee quite innocently undervalues to the extent of  25  per cent., power is given to the Commonwealth to acquire the whole of the estate in fee-simple. </para>

          <para>. - I wish to ask the Attorney-General, not as a member of the Opposition, but as one who is iri favour of a certain class of land taxation, if he has well considered this clause. I do not intend to present the legal aspect of it, but I have thought from the very first that it is unconstitutional. The country certainly declared in favour of land taxation, and of land taxation up to 4d. in the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;I</inline> and it would be a pity to have any provision in the Bill which is unconstitutional. If the Attorney-General is not very careful there will be every inducement for the High Court to throw out this clause and with it the Bill. </para>

            <para>- This is not an optional purchase of land, but compelling an owner to sell it. In my opinion, the High Court will take the view that it is not a voluntary purchase, in view of section 51 of the Constitution, which is -  (xxxi.) The acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws : </para>

        <para class="block">If we take a man&#39;s property whether he consents or not, it is not a purchase; and I ask the Attorney-General to weigh&#39; the matter well before he approves such a provision. With the honorable member for Angas  I  do not think that a man should be punished unless he wilfully does something wrong. What the amendments of the Attorney-General are I do not know ; but I think it would be foolish if he proposes a clause which will have the effect of punishing a man for an act which is not a wilful act. The unimproved value is very difficult to ascertain, be he as honest as he may. I think I know as much about land as most people, and I feel sure that in estimating the unimproved value, I should sometimes find myself very far out in my reckoning.  I  scarcely know what course must be taken to ascertain the unimproved value; but  I  can quite conceive that a person may innocently be 25 per cent, below the true figure. I rose mainly to express my emphatic opinion that the clause is unconstitutional. We have no power under the Constitution to deal with land after we have got it. We cannot sell it to immigrants. </para>

            <para>- Before the Bill was introduced I talked over the subject with the Prime Minister, and I told him what I am saying now. I have heard it stated that some arrangement is to be made with the States to take the land over under their laws; but I can see no power that we have to that end under the Constitution. &#34;We may depend there will not be &#39;wanting money to fight this Bill; indeed, in my opinion, this Bill will be fought as no Bill has ever been fought in Australia. Every technical point that can be taken to the High Court will find its way there ; and I think I am safe in saying that hundreds of thousands of pounds will be readily found to support the views of the opponents of the measure. On this ground alone we ought to be most careful not to insert any doubtful provisions. I desire these opinions to be placed on record now, because I am firmly convinced that it was not the intention of the framers of the Constitution that we should take into our hands lands for purposes such as those contemplated in the Bill. I speak as a member of the Federal Convention knowing what the feeling there was, and I can say that this clause was intended merely to give us power to acquire lands required for carrying on the government of the Commonwealth. The sub-clause was deliberately surrounded with conditions to prevent our taking anything unduly from the States; and as the members of the High Court Bench are aware of the facts, the AttorneyGeneral will do well to reconsider the clause. The penalties are very severe, and should be sufficient, without providing foi the compulsory taking of land. There may be those who say I am wrong in my view, but such views ought to be expressed, if there is any idea that the Bill is placed in jeopardy. </para>

            <para>- We must all admit that this is not essential to land taxation. It is a matter upon which men, irrespective of their views on land taxation or any principles associated with this measure, can unite. This is an entirely separate question, only indirectly associated with land taxation. The object is to penalize an owner who, in the opinion of some other persons, has undervalued his property by more than a certain percentage. What is the evidence brought against that owner? The evidence of professional and Crown valuers, given- on oath, who are subject to no penalty, however extravagant their estimates may be. The necessities of their employment lead them to lean to their clients, and to fix a valuation as high as their conscience will allow. This they do professionally, being subject to no penalty ; so we have the owner, with all these extreme penalties hanging over his head, pitted against men who are acting simply in a professional capacity, and who differ much among themselves in their business calculations, as valuers notoriously do differ. That being clear, I have here two illustrations taken from the State of which the Attorney-General is a representative. I quote them because they are within the experience of a man of standing known to myself. In one instance, that of a suburban area, he placed the unimproved value of his vacant land at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;25</inline> an acre. This was set down by the Government valuers at  &#163;40  an acre; and on this they insisted under examination and crossexamination. The result was that the Judge visited the spot, and decided that  &#163;25  was a fair valuation. Here was an error on the part of the sworn Government valuers of more than  25  per cent. ; yet on their side there was no risk and no penalty for an honest mistake. The second illustration is one which the Attorney-General may recognise, because it attained some repute. Again it was a question of suburban land, in North Sydney, valued by the owner at  &#163;4  a foot. The Crown valuer and another authorized sworn valuer assessed the land at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;9</inline> a foot. There was a great deal of cross-examination, and in the end the sworn valuer, who had been called in, offered the proprietor in Court <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> a foot, which was promptly accepted. The Judge, not deterred, visited the land with the experts, and, after examination, fixed the value at  &#163;4  a foot; by this time the gentleman who had agreed to purchase at &#163;6 repudiated his bargain. In this case we have an error of over  100  per cent., upon evidence given, no doubt, in good faith. The land- valuers assessed the value to the best of their ability, but, of course, leaning to the side of their clients&#39; requirements so far as they honestly could. We have to face the fact that in these cases the scales are not evenly weighted. If those who support the higher valuations ran any risk, measurable, with those of the owner, there would be an element of equity, which&#39; at present is conspicuously wanting. We have valuers whose official reputation is not injured when they fix the highest possible value in a sanguine mood, pitted against a man subject to extraordinary penalties if he undervalues his property. </para>

            <para>- We know from our own experience that they differ continually. The two cases I have given are illustrative of many. What we have really to consider is how we can make the sanctions and penalties for true and false evidence anything like equal, so that those who value on the one side shall have the same measure of liability as those who value on the other. Unless we can achieve this, there must be hardship. </para>

            <para>- My complaint is that honorable members opposite are not trying to do so. They put on one side professional opinion, with no liability, and on the other the opinion of a man who, having everything at stake, is also subject to a heavy penalty should his valuation be 25 per cent. below that of the person who values for the Government. However large any holding may be, its owner must be a weakling compared with the Crown, with its inexhaustible purse, and power to heap evidence on evidence. The provision is one with which no fair-minded man should wish to be associated. None of us would like to exercise the authority here given. Valuations are opinions, they are estimates, and often assumptions. The AttorneyGeneral should at least accept the suggestions from his own side, to make the scales of justice fairly even, instead of weighting them heavily against the owner of the land. </para>

          <para>.- I am sorry that the Attorney-General will not accept the amendment of the honorable member for Angas, because it is wrong to punish for acts which have not been done wilfully. It must be remembered that the differences in the valuations of experts, to which reference has been made, occur in regard to the valuing of land with all its improvements, and if experts vary as to the value of land with its improvements, they must vary far more in regard to the unimproved value of land. According to the definition clause -  &#34; Unimproved value &#34; in relation to land means the capital sum which the fee-simple of the land might be expected to realize if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> seller would require, assuming that the actual improvements thereon, or appertaining thereto, and made by the owner or his predecessor in title, had not been made. </para>

            <para>- Exactly. The first difficulty that arises is as to the improvements appertaining to the land. Had an amendment proposed by the honorable member for Richmond been agreed to, owners would have had some idea of the allowances to be made in respect to improvements, but the definition I have read is so wide that great difference of opinion will exist as to whether drains, embankments against inundation, and other works of that kind, are improvements appertaining to the land whose value is under consideration. In regard to these matters alone a <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> error of at least 25 per cent. may be made. It is also provided that -  &#34; Value of improvements &#34; in relation to land means the added value which the improvements give to the land at the date of valuation, irrespective of the cost of the improvements. </para>

            <para>- Yes. Apparently, the honorable member has not read the provision under discussion, which, if the unimproved value of land is understated, allows the Commissioner to apply to the High Court, and if the Justice is satisfied that the owner has understated the value to the extent of 25 per cent., the land may be acquired by the Government. It is not necessary that the understatement should be wilful. Before a man can value his land, he will have to come to a decision, not merely on questions of fact, but on questions of law arising out of the facts. There is nothing more difficult to value than country land, in regard to which a great many things have to be taken into consideration. I have known experts to undervalue as well as to overvalue. The price which land will fetch at auction often depends on the  number of persons present at the sale, and on the position of those who want certain blocks. I have known land on which a reserve price of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> an acre has been put to bring &#163;8 an acre. I concur with what has been said as to the probable unconstitutionality of this part of the measure; but, apart from that, I do not think that these powers should be exercised unless it can be proved that there has been a wilful understatement of value for the purpose of evading taxation. </para>

          <para>. - The provision under discussion is one of the thumb-screw class. The Bill, as introduced, bristled with injustice, and none of its provisions are more unjust than those under discussion. Apparently the Attorney-General desires to make the clause more generous in one direction and more unjust in another, penalizing the man who makes a mistake, whether wilfully or otherwise. He told us that the Minister in charge of the New Zealand Land Tax legislation had informed him that the Dominion had ceased to apply its powers of resumption, because it feared that it might have to resume too many estates like the Cheviot estate. Apparently, the AttorneyGeneral looks forward to such a prospect with pleasure, which gives ground for the suspicion that the principle of land nationalization is disguised in this proposal. If the New Zealand Government did not wish to resume a large number of estates, why should the Commonwealth be in a hurry to do so? In my opinion, there is no power to take over this land. The Labour party appears to be anxious to get the last drop of blood from every landowner who possesses property of which the unimproved value exceeds &#163;5,000; but these provisions may come back like a boomerang, and injure those responsible for them. If we on this side cannot carry the Amendment of the honorable member for Angas, we can protest strongly against the proposal of the Government. The desire of the Government ought to be to get, not an abnormal, but a fair average, valuation when these assessments are made. Under the conditions laid down by the AttorneyGeneral that will be almost impossible. When the Government of South Australia were dealing with an amendment of the Land Taxation Act they were informed by the New Zealand Government, that they had abandoned this very principle, because it was impracticable and unworkable, and because land there was more frequently over-assessed than under-assessed. Instead of bringing about something approaching uniformity of assessment, it led to the opposite result. It was found that one man was paying on an assessment 25 or 30 per cent. more than his neighbour, and that he was paying, according to the admission of the Department, more than he ought to. simply because of the fear of the penalty that was hanging over his head. The penalty under the New Zealand Act, however, was as nothing compared with that for which this Bill provides. The Government cannot expect to have for some time a fair and satisfactory assessment. That is not likely to be secured until trained officers have been obtained, and until the whole system has been placed on something like a practical and scientific basis. Meantime, there will be penalties exacting enough without this additional penalty of taking away from a man his home and his land, because of a mistake that may have been innocently made. In the experience of every State Government having a taxation Department it is infinitely more difficult to obtain a fair assessment in Australia than it is in New Zealand. In the Dominion there are not such variations as obtain in the Commonwealth. Here, in 100 assessments we may have land that is from 100 to 300 per cent. more valuable than other land not more than a quarter of a mile away. Experience in the Courts shows that valuations of land often vary from 20 to 60 per cent., and another point to be remembered is that for taxation purposes a man is not supposed to have an assessment made at the top market price. The true principle is to get a fair average value - to determine the value of the land, not to-day, but over a given number of years. The Attorney-General knows that that principle is recognised in the Courts in connexion with State and municipal assessments, and I sincerely hope that he will accept the amendment and not introduce into the Bill machinery that will very often penalize men when they are quite innocent ofany wilful misrepresentation. </para>

          <para>. - I hope that since the Committeehas thoroughly ventilated its opinion upon this clause we shall have an opportunity to get to a division. The points at issue are perfectly clear. There have been intruded into this discussion questions of constitutionality that are quite irrelevant. Nothing is more certain than  that the clause is constitutional. Otherwise the lawyers opposite would have told us so long ago. If the Opposition were only half as sure as the honorable member for Hume is that the clause is unconstitutional they would have been twice as quick as he has been in saying so. In any case, the honorable member for Hume need have no fear that the measure is imperilled in any way, even if the clause is unconstitutional, it is clearly severable from the Bill, and in no way, therefore, is the Bill as a whole jeopardized. We have the power to do what we propose, and we ought to exercise that power. The honorable member for Wakefield has spoken of the injustice of this procedure, but if it be an injustice to ask a man to take for his land 10 per cent. more than he has said it is worth, then injustice is something with which we have never become fairly acquainted. This is hot a penalty clause in the proper sense of the term. It is merely a method of insuring that reasonable care will be taken by a taxpayer in estimating the value of his land. I freely admit that one valuator may say that land is worth <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> per acre, while another declares that it is worth <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> per acre. But if a man asked me how much I wanted for some land that I possessed, I should know what I wanted, and if he said, &#34; Will you take anything less ?&#39; &#39; I should be able to tell him at once what my decision was. Every man is in the same position. We may not know how much another man&#39;s property is worth, but we know how much we believe our own property to be worth, and we are asked to state in these assessments what we believe is the honest value. </para>

The trouble in this country is not that land is too cheap, but that it is top dear - not that people charge 25 per cent. too little for their land, but that very often they ask 25 per cent. too much for it. We merely ask that a land-owner shall put a fair valuation upon his property. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member for Gippsland has been speaking as if the question of unimproved value were something new. It was the unimproved value which he said at the last general election he was in favour of taxing, and I point out that it is idle for a man to be in favour of a land tax if he is not in favour of making such a tax effective. It is well known that evasions are not easier under the Customs Act than they will be under this measure ; yet they go on with some regularity, and occasionally we hear of very substantial cases. Section 161 of the Customs Act deals with those honest and honorable gentlemen who are at some loss to put down the real value of the goods they import, and who resort to faked invoices. </para>

            <para>- I do not deny that; but my contention is that when a taxpayer has said that his land is worth a certain price per acre, the Commissioner should be entitled to acquire it on paying an extra 10 per cent. I do not blame those who were returned here in opposition to land taxation for endeavouring to defeat this Bill, but I do blame those who, although returned to support the principle, are ready to emasculate the Bill by omitting from it provisions that will make it effective. I emphatically declare this to be one of the most salutary provisions of the Bill - to insure that the assessment made byevery individual taxpayer shall be an approximately fair assessment of the value of his land. If a man values his land at a certain price, and will not sell it at that price, he must have an idea that it is worth a great deal more, and has undervalued it, because he desires to pay less taxation than he ought to do. The honorable member for Parkes said that this amendment merely repeated the wording of the sub-clause in the Bill as originally introduced. That is true in one sense, but not in the proper sense, because the clause will be so modified by the amendment which I have foreshadowed, that practically its whole purport will be entirely changed, and to retain the whole of the sub-clause would be to defeat the purposes of the section. In reply to the honorable member for Wakefield, I would say that New Zealand abandoned this principle for a reason quite different from that which he gave us. To begin with, the principle in the New Zealand Act differed from this in an essential particular, in that, when a price had been fixed which the owner would not accept as a fair valuation, the State had to take it at its own valuation if it were lower. In view of the existence of large estates like the Cheviot estate, worth  &#163;400,000,  the New Zealand Government were a little timid at going on. We are not in that position. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fowlds,</inline> the New Zealand Minister of Education, who is well versed in the Act, declared that there was no more effective method of securing sound assessments of the true value than such a provision as this. It is perfectly fair and constitutional, in keeping with the whole aim and scope of the measure, and amply justified by precedents, and I hope the Committee will accept it. </para>

          <para>-- I wish to enter my protest against the clause, and express the hope that the amendment of the honorable member for Angas will be carried. The Attorney-General says the clause is constitutional. I pointed out before that I believe, if it is put to the test, the High Court will probably rule it out as unconstitutional. I gave some reasons on that occasion, and do not intend to go into the point again. I see no necessity for the clause. The Bill contemplates self assessment. Is it likely that the Commissioner will recommend the taking over by the Commonwealth of a. property away back from all communication, simply because the owner undervalues it? What would be the use of it to the Department if it was taken over? Consequently, the man away back will be able to undervalue his property almost with impunity, whereas another man, close to a city or means of communication, although he may make the most honest calculation possible, runs the risk of having his property taken by the Commonwealth at his own valuation, plus  10  per cent., if the Commissioner thinks the unimproved  Value  is  25  per cent, more than his estimate. Therefore the man will be given  15  per cent, less than the Commissioner&#39;s estimate. We do not want to penalize a man unless it is clear that he has wilfully undervalued his land. Where it is not proved that a man had a wilful intention, his land should not be taken from him at  10  per cent, above his valuation. He should be given at least a fair price for it in accordance with the Commissioner&#39;s estimate, but before any land is taken away, the owner should have the right to have the matter tested by appealing to the Court, or submitting it to arbitration. It is unfair and un-British to penalize a man if he has not intended in any way to defraud the revenue. The Attorney-General seems to think that this is a matter of buying and selling - that because a man has a piece of land, and knows what he wants for it, he should be able to put down its unimproved value at once. That contention evades the whole issue. The question is not what a man wants for his land, but what its unimproved value is. If the Attorney-General knows anything about the lands of Australia, he will know it is most difficult to accurately assess the unimproved value of countless pieces of land. I know of blocks of land which I would not be surprised to see one man value at  &#163;2  an acre, and  an  equally competent man, but with no better reputation as a valuer, at  &#163;4  an acre, unimproved value. The unimproved value of a block of that fine land which is now selling at such high prices in Victoria would be probably what the land would bring if it were in its native state, supposing all the other improvements were in the locality. But one man would say it would bring  &#163;&#91;20,  another  &#163;25,  and another even  &#163;35 an  acre, without  an  axe being put on to it. That shows that it is extremely difficult to get at the exact unimproved value. It would be very easy for plenty of people to honestly value their land  25  per cent, below the value the Commissioner would fix.It is unnecessary to put in a clause like this, because it is contemplated that we shall have  a  Commissioner to assess the land  as  soon as such a thing is feasible. To come suddenly upon people, and treat every one as being out to defraud the revenue, without proving him guilty of any intent in that direction, is unjust and uncalled for, and practically unheard of in British legislation. It seems, however, that the Government are out to hit the land-holder. They want to go back to a certain class of the community, and say : &#34; We were after such and such scalps, and we have secured them.&#34; That seems to be their whole anxiety. It has long been apparent to the Opposition that it is futile to appeal to the Government on grounds of justice and fair play. The Government say they do not want to do anything unjust, but they take fine care, when easy ways of modifying their own measure without materially injuring it are pointed out, not to adopt any of them. Heaven knows that the measure, when first thrown on the table, was crude, and anomalous, and harsh j in fact, the harshest Bill ever promulgated in connexion with land taxation in Australia. </para>

          <para>.- The clause, and, in fact, the whole Bill from its very inception, has received a marvellous amount of opposition. During one period of the discussion there were fourteen members sitting on the Opposition side, and seven of them belonged to the&#34; legal profession. Every one of those gentlemen is a direct opponent of the measure, and yet they ask the Government not to include a penal clause in the Bill. Every sane man in Australia would laugh at the Government if they did not insert a penal clause in a Land Tax Bill to deal with people who attempt to break the. law. </para>

            <para>- I do not know what the&#34; Attorney-General said, but members of the Opposition have been anxious the whole of. the afternoon to defend those who would break the law if they got the opportunity. The Attorney-General, on the other hand, has been endeavouring to so frame the Bill as to prevent people from breaking it. All our laws - criminal and otherwise - contain penal clauses, the object of which is to deter people from breaking them. The object of this clause is similar, and it would be absurd for this Parliament to pass a Land Tax Bill without it. We cannot help noticing where the main opposition to the Hill is coming from. All those who have been so anxious to remove this penal clause to-day have used their best endeavours to prevent the passage of any land taxation measure whatever. The clause provides that the owner shall furnish a return of the value of his own land. That is only a reasonable request to make to those of our citizens who own land. We have heard a great deal about the difficulty of making valuations. In my occupation, and in positions that I have occupied in New South&#39; Wales, I have had to obtain valuations of land. The valuers I have employed have been respectable business firms, and I have been sometimes in doubt whether they have not been in collusion with one another to arrive at the same figure, because their valuations have been so near to one another. No one outside this House would believe that a man who owns land does not know the value of it. Such a supposition is absolutely ridiculous and not within the realm of reason. The AttorneyGeneral has made it very plain that no honest person need fear this clause. Honorable members who have taken part in the discussion of Tariff questions must realize that severe punishments are necessary if the revenue is not to be defrauded. We make laws against the commission of murder in order to deter people from that crime ; and we must have punishment in the case of a land tax in order to secure fair returns. I do not know whether the legal gentlemen opposite are looking to future business in their efforts to make this clause vague and uncertain ; but my opinion is that if the desire of the Committee be to prevent litigation, the punishments must be severe. It must be proved to the satisfaction of the Minister of Customs that there is an attempt to defraud ; and surely we may take it for granted that such an official will perform the duties of his office in a lenient and just way. </para>

            <para>- I think I do, for I have been obeying the law all my life, and have never got into trouble. The Attorney- &#34; General is only doing his best to. carry out the will of the Parliament and the country. Honorable members opposite seem to have in idea that we on this side desire to punish people simply because they own land. That idea is altogether erroneous j all we desire is to protect the honest&#34; land-owner against the dishonest land-owner, and all honorable members who believe in land taxation, no matter on which side of the House they sit, should assist the Government in their efforts to that end. The Leader of the Opposition referred to suburban land valued at so much per foot, but, in the vast majority of cases, suburban allotments will not come within the scope of the operation of the Bill, and, therefore, the honorable gentleman&#39;s illustrations are Ml beside the point. It is essential in a measure of this sort to provide against the actions of evilly-disposed persons. The disposition to grumble at paying taxes seems, in some cases, to be innate ; and as persons who own large areas are generally covetous, the grumbling is all the louder on their part. When a man gets a few acres, he usually wants more; and this is one of the reasons for the introduction of a Land Tax Bill. In my opinion, the best interests of the country will be served by supporting the AttorneyGeneral, because, unless we secure the revenue, our legislation will be nothing more than a farce. </para>

None of the critics of the clause has taken &#39;any objection to the most drastic provisions against undervaluation. If the honorable member looks at clauses 65 and 67, he will see that there are penal provisions sufficiently drastic to enforce this land tax. For instance, there is a fine of &#163;500, with triple taxation and even forfeiture. </para>

            <para>- We on this side contend that there is ample provision in the Bill for punishment for dishonest undervaluation, without taking a man&#39;s property from him at a slight increase on his own valuation. The honorable member seems to be under the impression that this compulsory method of acquiring land is only to be brought into operation in cases of dishonest undervaluation ; and if dishonesty were the test, there would not be the same strong objection to this part of the Bill. We must remember, however, that the honorable member for Angas proposes that, before this clause operates, there shall be proof that the undervaluation is wilful. Is the honorable member for East Sydney in favour of the amendment to that end? He has said that noone can object to the penalization of the dishonest, and no one is objecting ; but wecontend that this clause should not be brought into operation merely because a man makes a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> mistake. There may be a mere error of judgment to the extent of 10 per cent., or even 50 per cent. Such a mistake is not necessarily wilful or dishonest, and if the honorable member for East Sydney is convinced of that, I claim his vote for the amendment of the honorable member for Angas, who wishes to make it a condition that an owner shall not be deprived of his property until it hasbeen proved that his undervaluation waswilful. A mere mistake, without <inline font-style="italic">metis re a,.</inline> is not to be sufficient. </para>

            <para>- As the clause originally stood, the onus was on the landowner to prove that his undervaluation was not wilful. In revenue cases the onus of proving innocence is sometimes cast on the defendant, but that gives him the opportunity to avoid forfeiture by stating his source of knowledge. Had the clause been allowed to stand as it was, it would not have been so manifestly unjust. The provision now before us amounts to a refinement of&#39; cruelty and injustice, men who are compelled to value their land to assist the Crown being made liable to its forfeiture for an undervaluation, even if innocently made. I object to the clause on three grounds: first, because I believe that it is unconstitutional ; secondly, because I regard it as contrary to the principles of natural justice; and, thirdly, because &#34; I consider it unnecessary for the enforcement of land taxation. None of us objects to the imposition of heavy penalties for wilful undervaluation; but surely the penalties provided by clauses 65 and 67; under which wilful undervaluation is punishable by a fine of .&#163;500, the levying of treble taxation, and forfeiture of the land, are sufficient. In view of the existence of these penalties, can any member of the Labour party say that the Bill, even without clause 44, would not be equipped with all provisions necessary for the punishment of dishonest valuation ? </para>

We should not force land-owners to overvalue their properties to avoid the risk of forfeiture for undervaluation. The Attorney-General, if he refuses to take the advice of the honorable member for Angas, will be sinning against light and reason, and will render the Bill open to attack in another place. </para>

A great deal of fuss was made about the effect of the proposed tax on the numerous properties which are said to return only 2 per cent, on their value, it being stated that the Government was proposing to confiscate the whole profit, and to reduce the owners to bankruptcy. What would be easier under this provision than for these land-owners to undervalue their estates to the extent of 25 per cent., and to let the Government take the land at in per cent, on their valuation? If they did that, they would lose only 15 per cent, of the value of their properties, and could unload them on the Commonwealth. It might be said that the Government would not buy them; but it would have to do so for the sake of its own reputation. Having heard the burden of their song, I think that the singers will be found chirping on this side. </para>

            <para>- Then will the honorable member be satisfied if he can send some one else to gaol? Is that the be-all and end-all of his political existence ? It is a fine Labour aspiration. All that the honorable member wants, it seems, is to put some one under the lash of the law. How that will help those who are suffering to-day I do not know. It is not my desire that any law-breakers shall escape. A man who wilfully breaks this law should pay the penalty ; but what we are seeking to do now is to defend the man who honestly undervalues his land from having it taken from him because of that mistake. I see no reason why we should impose such a penalty. When the AttorneyGeneral attempts to put it into operation, he will find himself, with his limited Federal powers, in a sea of difficulties, and will be the first to wish that he had never meddled with it. Those who have no thought but a selfish one in this regard could wish him joy, in a political sense, of all he obtained from it. When he puts it into operation the troubles of the Federal Government will begin. The Bill provides for other penalties that are severe enough without our going the length of declaring that a man&#39;s land and home shall be taken from him - and that is what the Government propose - in the case of an undervaluation. Let such a man be punished adequately for his offence. </para>

            <para>- I am opposed to this clause as being wholly unnecessary. Punish a man for whatever wilful fraud can be proved against him, but why go further, and take away his land ? Are not the Government satisfied when justice has been done? If the other penalties are not considered sufficient, make them more drastic, but why pass such a provision as this? Those who have had any experi ence know that undervaluation and overvaluation of land is an every-day occurrence. The lands of Australia to-day, on the whole, for shire and municipal purposes, are rather over, than under, valued. The reason for that is obvious. The shire taxation is limited in extent. In New South Wales it is based upon the unimproved value, and the limit of the tax is  2d.  in the&#163;1. There is, therefore, a tendency, it seems to me, to place a high valuation on the land. No reasonable ratepayer would object to the valuation being to the uttermost farthing for municipal and shire purposes, because he knows that if the valuation of the land comes down to any extent, there must.be a corresponding increase in the rates. In these circumstances, there is no incentive to be constantly appealing against the undervaluations and overvaluations on the one side or the other, as long as rough justice is done.  Many of the lands within the jurisdiction of shires to-day are, on the whole, I believe, overvalued rather than undervalued. </para>

            <para>- Let me give an illustration. I have a small block of land, the unimproved value of which is fixed today at &#163;30 per acre. I believe that that is an over-estimate, but I do not complain, for I think the tax, based as it is on the unimproved value, is fair and very low. Half-a-mile away, and fronting the same main road, there is land valued at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> per acre. It is not, in my judgment, worth half that amount, yet the shire taxation is being paid upon it on that basis. Here we have already at hand a basis of assessment for the Federal Government. They have no independent machinery, and, in all probability, the shire valuations will be taken as a basis for the imposition of the Federal tax. If a man paying the shire land tax to-day on a small block of. land, at the rate of&#163;100 per acre, should honestly say, &#34; This land is worth only&#163;50 per acre,&#34; and value it for the purposes of this Bill at that rate, he will be liable at once to lose his estate if it is big enough to come under the Federal tax. This provision has nothing to do with honest land taxation. The Bill provides many other penalties for undervaluation. In one part it is declared that if a man undervalues his land he shall be regarded as having committed a fraud until he proves the contrary. There is nothing British about that provision. The onus of proving that he has not committed a fraud is thrown upon the land-owner. </para>

            <para>-No, it is in addition to the penalty with which we are now dealing.I suggest to the AttorneyGeneral that, by allowing the penalties already in the Bill to remain, and not pressing for this, he will stand as good a chance of having the lands of Australia fairly valued, and of securing a full measure of taxation out of them, as he will do if this clause be passed as he proposes. I fail to see the object of this provision, unless it is designed as the beginning of a large scheme of land nationalization. Does the Attorney-General imagine that a man would submit to a penalty of, say,&#163;500 and the payment of treble taxation, and yet continue to wink at the law? </para>

          <para>.- I should like to put one aspect of the matter before the Attorney-General. I am of the opinion of several members of the Opposition, that the clause is very drastic indeed, and will mean endless litigation on the part both of property owners and the Commonwealth. As practical men, we do not want to rush any individual into the Courts and subject him to expensive litigation, simply because he is a land-holder. I do not think any honorable member on this side wishes that. If there are any who do wish it, they are very few. I should like to show the Minister how a man could undervalue his estate, and at the same time not do it wilfully. In fact, at the time of making the return it would be the real value. In the Western Riverina and western portions of New South Wales and Queensland, there are times when the land is practically valueless for pastoral purposes. We have seen that happen many times. I know one man who went to Western Queensland with &#163;70,000, and left Barcaldine railway station with nothing but his swag, so that he did not make much money by taking up land. Suppose the owner of a property had a successful year this year, and land in that district was at a good price; that then a succession of droughts began, and every year the land depreciated in value. Suppose, then, that when the owner put in his assessment at the end of the financial year, a good spring suddenly followed, and the value of the land rose by, say, 100 per cent. Would the Minister say that that man had wilfully misrepresented the case to the Commissioner, and would he then step in and take the land from him at that price? </para>

            <para>- There are two words - &#34;shall&#34; and &#34;may&#34; - to the use of which, in Acts of Parliament, I take great exception. The Attorney-General, I know, desires to do what is just. He wants to rope in those who are dishonest ; and if he kept the clause as it stood originally in the Bill, I think every honorable member would be more satisfied. It is not mv desire to punish an honest man ; but I think we all desire to punish the dishonest man. The same arguments as have been used to-day were used when the clause in the Customs Act, allowing the Crown to take goods at their invoice price, plus 10 per cent., was being considered. We were told that the Government were becoming trading merchants, and would do this, that, and the other. I think that there have been only three cases of action taken under that section of the Customs Act. I appeal to the Attorney-General to do as the honorable member for Parramatta suggests. If we find that the clauses are not drastic enough, it will be within the province of the Government and Parliament to make them more drastic. </para>

          <para>. - I hope that the Committee will come to a division on the question, which has been argued at great  length. I suggested some amendments in the clause, entirely with the view of meeting objections that had been outlined at an earlier stage; but I find that my attempt at amendment is treated with the utmost disdain and scorn. I am now told that I have made the thing infinitely worse than before, which is, of course, most unsatisfactory for me, and, apparently, worse for the Committee. The honorable member for Maranoa spoke about the position of persons with pastoral holdings which are subject to a depreciation of value owing to droughts. A man always knows what the value of his land is. If his land is worth very little, he will put down a very small amount in his return. If it is worth a lot, he will put that down&#39;. After the drought of 1893 had gone over this country, the honorable member knew to within a little what his own property was worth. It may have been worth only one-fifth of what it was before the drought came; but, whatever it was, he knew it. Let him, therefore, put that down in the assessment paper. </para>

            <para>- That argument applies to all classes of land. The value of land used for agricultural or pastoral purposes depends entirely on the extent to which it meets those purposes. If you cannot get any grass on land on which you are running sheep, you have to feed them or drive them off. The question is, what is. the position of the owner of land in those circumstances? If a man has a piece of land, and a drought comes, and he has no grass, the capital value of the land is depreciated ; but he knows it, and nobody knows it better than he does. He can say, &#34; My land is not worth one-tenth of what it was five years ago.&#34; There may be plenty of cases where that applies. We are only asking the owner to say what his land is worth. I know many cases where, during drought 5&#39;ears, if a man could have got 10 per cent, above his own valuation, he would have been the happiest man in creation, and glad of the chance to unload his estate. I have never yet known a case where a big squatter or pastoral owner was not influenced by one of two things. Either he had confidence that the present was a mere passing phase, and that good times would come again, or he had abandoned all hope and was seeking to unload. If he is seeking to unload, this is the best chance he has; because he has only to put his own valuation on the land, and we will give him 10 per cent, more for it. The honorable member for Maranoa has stated that we desire to do justice. I hope we all have that desire, however our views may differ as to the means. There is, I know, a strong desire on the part of honorable members on this side to do justice; and one of the most effective refutations of the ridiculous statements that are made from time to time in the press, and by some members on the other side, that those on this side come here with their minds made up, and have no opinions of their own, is to be found in the fact that criticism of amendments put forward by the Government comes quite as frequently from this side as from that. I am prepared to strike out the word &#34; wilfully,&#34; from subparagraph ii., of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> and then to retain the sub-paragraph. That will, I think, meet most of the objections urged against the clause, .and is going as far as, and perhaps a little further than, I ought to go. I have no other desire than to protect the revenue, and compel people to realize that it is a very serious thing to undervalue their land without some good cause. If that amendment will meet the wishes of the Committee, I am prepared to consider it. If the honorable member for Angas will withdraw his amendment, I shall move my prior amendments, and then move to amend sub-paragraph ii., as I stated. </para>

            <para>- I understood the application of the term to be to the amendment; but, at any fate, if the clause is passed without that amendment, it will practically amount to a &#34; metaphorical disembowelment &#34; of the landowner. The honorable member for Maranoa has told us that the Attorney-General only desires to &#34;rope in&#34; those who are dishonest; and we give the AttorneyGeneral credit for that desire. But that is exactly what is asked by honorable members on this side, who support the amendment of the honorable member for Angas. </para>

            <para>- The suggested amendment does not meet the case so effectually as that proposed by the honorable member for Angas. Honorable members have expressed a desire not to unduly penalize or harshly deal with any persons under this Bill; and the suggestion that this is a step in the direction of land nationalization has also been mildly repudiated. But if we are to accept all those statements as sincere, our obvious duty is to support the amendment of the honorable member for Angas, which aims only at justice being preserved. It has been pointed out that the clause as it stands, or even as amended in the way suggested by the Attorney-General, will still have the effect of unduly penalizing many landowners who, in perfect good faith, may send in a return undervaluing his land to the extent of even more than 25 per cent. Under the clause as we have it, such landowners are not only liable to have their land compulsorily purchased, but are subject to further drastic penalties under another portion of the Bill. Under the circumstances, we ought to seriously consider the advisability of accepting the amendment of the honorable member for Angas, which makes the clause apply only to those persons who wilfully undervalue their land for the purpose of evading taxation. Surely the mere fact that a person may innocently make an undervaluation should not subject him to the drastic penalties provided? </para>

            <para>- The amendment of the honorable member for Angas is better. Evidence should be given to show deliberate intention on the part of a land-owner to undervalue his land for the purpose of evading taxation; and, if that is the desire of the Attorney-General and other honorable members opposite, I call their attention to the fact that ft is what the amendment of the honorable member for Angas secures. Assuming that we have the right to impose land taxation, I am just as eager as honorable members opposite to see that there is no intentional evasion; but  I  am also anxious that no injustice shall be done to a person who innocently happens to make a mistake. </para>

            <para>- I fail to see the consistency of honorable members opposite. The honorable member for Parramatta raved as usual about the injustice perpetrated on the land-owner, but the records will show that honorable members on this side who have had to deal with land-owners and their interest have always acted justly. It is an insult to infer that we are here for the purpose of persecuting men who are on the land; we are here in order to pass an equitable and effective measure of land taxation. If honorable members opposite had their own way, this land taxation would not be effective - just as it failed in New Zealand, and there required amendment on the lines suggested by the AttorneyGeneral. The honorable member for Maranoa has talked about the injustice heaped on the man in the western districts of Queensland j but he must know that in the north-west of New South Wales, and the portion of Queensland to which he referred, the lands are under leasehold, and will not come within the operation of the Bill. Even assuming that there are some lessees who have the right of purchase, and who may come under the Bill, what is the value of their land in drought-stricken areas? Does the honorable member mean to tell me that values are going up and down according to how the rain falls? </para>

Pastoral land is assessed, not on the annual producing power, but on the average producing power ; all the disabilities are taken into consideration. In the shire assessments such a liberal allowance is made for the prevailing conditions that the difference between the assessed value and the actual value in the market is very striking. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member would so frame this measure as to leave loopholes big enough for a motor car to drive through. I warn the AttorneyGeneral that the party behind the Government has a mandate from the people to impose a land tax which shall effectively apply to those who should be called on to pay it, and that it is our duty to see that Ministers do not in a weak moment yield to the wiles of the Opposition, and its appeals for sympathy for the man on the land. The honorable member for Parramatta and others have referred to the penalties in another part of the Bill as if they were sufficient, although those honorable members know that those penalties do not cover the set of conditions provided for by the clause. The object of the clause is to prevent men from wilfully undervaluing their land, the Government being permitted, where an owner has sought in this way to evade legitimate taxation, to acquire his property for the good of the people. That is a fair provision. In New South Wales to-day, when land is resumed by the Government, and a Board of Arbitration is appointed to determine its value, a mass of interested evidence is submitted, with a view to increasing the price which the Government has to pay. Men are always ready to inflate values when the Government wishes to buy, and to undervalue when the Government intends to tax. Our duty is to see that fair taxation is paid, and to prevent the evasion of just responsibilities. No doubt, honorable members opposite are ready to insert in the Bill provisions which would render it useless, and would do harm to the party responsible for it. I am with the Attorney-General in regard to the striking out of the word &#34; wilfully &#34; in sub-paragraph ii. of paragraph c, though after what has taken place this afternoon, I shall watch carefully the proposals of the Opposition. </para>

          <para>. - According to the honorable member for Gwydir, land should be valued, not on the basis of its production in the year of valuation, but on its average productivity ; whereas, according to the honorable member for Maranoa, a man valuing after a series of droughts might make his valuation too low, and after a series of good seasons might make it too high. The Attorney-General seems to think that if land had decreased in value by the time that the valuation was called for, the owner would be justified in writing down the value, and that the Government would accept such a valuation. These differences of opinion show the difficulty of determining the unimproved value of land. The Attorney-General defended the proposal before the Committee by referring to the section in the Customs Act under which, if an importer has wilfully and grossly undervalued goods liable to <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, the Government may take them at an advance of 10 per cent, on the valuation; but it must be remembered that, while it is possible for an honest importer to prove his <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> and the value of the goods, it is never possible to prove the unimproved value of land, there being always land, even in suburban areas, whose value it is very difficult to get at. To show that valuations may honestly vary beyond the 25 per cent, margin provided for, let me instance my own experience. Within recent years I have bought land in three of the suburbs of Sydney. Within the Kurringai Chase shire, I have 100 acres which is notoriously overvalued, notwithstanding the statement of the honorable member for Gwydir that shire councils invariably undervalue. The New South Wales Act restricts shire councils to a rate of 2d. in tlie <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> on the unimproved value of land within their boundaries; but as that did not give a sufficient revenue in the Kurringm Chase shire, values there were deliberately inflated, with the consent of the taxpayers of the shire. Were I to value my land there for the purposes of this Bill, I should fix a much lower value than that on which the shire levied its rates. I have other land at Bondi, in the Waverley municipality, which I bought for ^720, and which within two months afterwards the council valued at over &#163;1,000. </para>

            <para>- No; the holding in question consists of five or six allotments bought at auction. Were I valuing the land for the purposes of the Bill, I should declare the valuation to be ,&#163;720, which is what I paid for it ; but if the Government accepted the municipal valuation, which is more than 25 per cent, higher, my land would be liable to forfeiture, although my valuation was given in perfect good faith. </para>

            <para>- The clause does not provide for that being done. I have another block of land on the Narrabeen Lagoon, which I purchased for 17s. 6d. a foot, and for which I was offered <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> a foot immediately afterwards. Were I to value that land for the purposes of the tax at tlie price which I gave for it, the valuation would, no doubt, be accepted, but I should be giving an undervaluation. We are making a mistake in asking the owners of land to value it when, if we are to have a national system of land taxation, we should have a national system of land valuation. </para>

            <para>- It could not be levied before the 30th June next. But we might get an honest assessment which would serve as the basis of future State or municipal assessments. According to the honorable member for Gwydir, some of the shire councils and municipalities undervalue. That is true of Tasmania, and to a large extent of Victoria, but it is notoriously untrue of New South Wales, where many of the municipalities have very much overvalued their lands. </para>

            <para>- We are dealing with the whole of the lands of Australia. Provisions like those in the clause will do gross injustice. The work of valuation should not fall on the landowners. The Government should make an independent valuation, and preserve to the owners the right of appeal. The honorable member for Gwydir is quite wrong in thinking that that would necessarily mean a three years&#39; postponement. </para>

            <para>- The honorable gentleman is no judge of the question of relevancy. I am endeavouring to show that the Attorney-General&#39;s proposed amendment will act with great injustice on many people, and I am suggesting an alternative. The Attorney-General&#39;s desire is to push this clause through Committee, within three minutes of the adjournment for dinner. I do not care whether he does or does not. For my part, he could have had the whole Bill a fortnight ago, for it will do the Government no good. The proposed alteration will not improve the working of the Bill, but I leave it to the Government to do what they can with it. </para>

          <para>.- I am prepared to accept as an improvement upon the original proposals of the AttorneyGeneral, the proposition now made by him. I do not think that the omission of the word &#34; wilfully &#34; will make any difference, but if the honorable gentleman thinks it will, I have no objection to its being left out. When we come to clause  65,  we may endeavour to shift the burden of proof from the owner to the Government. Meantime, will the Attorney-General consider whether it would not be better to strike out that clause? The question of resumption where forfeiture will result is not to be raised by an undervaluation of less than  25  per cent. I beg leave to withdraw my amendment. </para>

          <para>.- I am not sure that I understand the effect of this amendment. I think it would be better if the words  &#34;10  per centum &#34; were not qualified by the words, &#34; by way of an allowance for compulsory dispossession,&#34; because, in the next paragraph, we to a great extent incorporate in this clause, the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act of  1906.  If I am not mistaken, there are in that Act provisions for compensation for the compulsory taking of land, so that the effect of these words would be to make the addition of  10  per cent.cover all allowances for compulsory acquisition. We may, therefore, be cutting down to some extent the effect of the incorporation of the Lands Acquisition Act. </para>

            <para>- I think that there ought to be an addition without any remission of compensation. This amount of  10  per cent. should simply be a margin given by the Commissioner to cover the possibility of his making an error of valuation. It is quite a different thing to say that this  10  per cent. is to be a sort of commutation of the amount to which a man would be entitled under the Lands Acquisition Act of  1906. </para>

            <para>- We are not properly dealing with clause 49. The question, &#34; That clause 44 as amended be agreed to,&#34; was put to the Committee, and those voting with the &#34; noes &#34; took their places on this side of the chamber. There was no opportunity of hearing what you were saying. Every honorable member sitting on this side fully believed that we were proceeding to a division on clause 44, and it would be a denial of justice to the Opposition to allow this clause by misadventure to be passed without a division.I venture to say that no one on this side was aware that you had passed from clause 44 to other clauses. Some one has said that the call for a division was withdrawn.  I  could understand an honorable member, who had moved an amendment, withdrawing a call for a division uponit; but we were dealing with a clause in respect of which every honorable member had an interest and a right to demand a division. The great bulk of us were totally unaware of what was being done by you. We shall suffer a denial of justice unless you enable us, sir, to have our votes recorded on a clause on which we desired to divide. </para>

            <para>-  On the point of order, I would like to explain that before we adjourned for dinner, it was agreed that we should have a division on clause 44. When the question was put, a few minutes ago, &#34; That the clause as amended be agreed to,&#34; several honorable members of the Opposition cried, &#34;Divide.&#34; I was amongst the number.  I  wished to go to a division, but at least five or six honorable members on this side said that they did not. The result was that, although neither I nor any one else that I know of asked that the call for a division should be withdrawn, the  Chairman  himself, from what was said, thought that there was a withdrawal of the call.  I  do not think the question was properly put. </para>

            <para>-  The question might have been put again, and then the voices would have been taken one way or the other, but there was some confusion as to what really occurred after that point. In justice to the  Chairman  as well as to members on the other side, I must say that at least five members particularly asked the honorable member for Darling Downs and myself not to take a division on the question, although it had been arranged before the tea hour that there was to be a division. </para>

            <para>-  Upon the  Chairman  putting the question &#34; that the clause as amended stand part of the Bill,&#34; those on this side cried <inline font-style="italic">&#34;Aye,&#34;</inline> and the honorable member for Darling Downs and the honorable member for Angas cried &#34; No,&#34; whereupon the  Chairman  directed that a division should be taken. The bells were rung, the honorable member for Balaclava and others came in, and went over near where the honorable member for Angas was sitting. I think the honorable member for Parramatta was also there or thereabouts.  I  said, &#34; I have amended the clause to suit you, and now you call for a division.&#34; I was addressing my remarks more particularly to the honorable member for Balaclava across the table, and he said &#34; No division,&#34; or words to that effect. The  Chairman  then said, &#34; Is it the pleasure of the Committee that the call for a division be withdrawn?&#34; or words, to that effect. The  Chairman  understood, and  I  understood, that it was withdrawn, and  I  am sure honorable members on this side were under the impression that there was to be no division. It did not matter to this side whether a division was taken or not, but when, through some blunder or misunderstanding on the other side, honorable members sitting there do not get what they want, it is of no use for them to blame the Government or the  Chairman.  In the circumstances, no further time ought to be lost. Honorable members on the other side have made their protest, and the position is clear. </para>

            <para>-  I watched the whole affair, and I think the Attorney-General has given a very correct statement of what took place, but a large number of members on this side, in consequence of the noise in the chamber, did not know what you were doing. They have been deprived of their right to a division which they wished to insist upon, and which they would have had if you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> had known their feelings. </para>

            <para>-  I submit that, under the Standing Orders, it is impossible to go back. Those sitting on this side of the House, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> distinctly recollect hearing those on the other side of the House, who had called for a division, withdraw that call. We also clearly heard the  Chairman  ask whether it was the pleasure of the Committee that the call should be withdrawn, and it was withdrawn. During that time, or immediately afterwards, a number of honor able members who- sit on the other side of the House came in. They were not in the chamber when the call &#39;was withdrawn. Three clauses have been passed since then, and, in the circumstances, it is impossible to go back. </para>

            <para>-  I wish to make a personal explanation, as I may be primarily responsible for the difficulty that has arisen. When the last amendment was proposed by the Attorney-General some honorable members called out &#34; No,&#34; and I went up to the honorable member foi Angas and the honorable member for Darling Downs, and suggested that there should not be a division on it. I understood that the division was being called foi on an amendment in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> of clause 44, and I called out &#34; No division.&#34; I did not know that you had directed a division to be taken on the clause itself. I thought it was on the amendment. I, therefore, take any responsibility there is for any mistake that has happened ; but it would be only reasonable to allow those who wished to do so an opportunity of voting against the clause. </para>

            <para>-  I wish to make a personal explanation. I did not object to the withdrawal of the division on clause 44, hut I did not hear you put the question that it should be withdrawn, nor, on account of the noise, did I hear you putting the subsequent clauses. I had a small amendment to move on clause 46, but have had no opportunity of proposing it. There <inline font-style="italic">seems</inline> to have been a misunderstanding for which nobody is to blame. It was caused by the disorder in the Committee. We ought to have some opportunity of testing the whole of the clauses that have since been put. I should be very pleased if the Attorney-General would agree to recommit clause 46. His offer to recommit clause 44 will not do what I require, as that matter has been threshed out, and I did not care very much whether we divided on it or not, as I knew we should lose on a division. </para>

The clauses have been put through by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> when there has been such disorder in the Committee as prevented honorable members from hearing what was going on. The disorder is nothing unusual, as it occurs during every division, and I submit that the proper thing to do is to secure order before business is dealt with.

            <para>-  I rise to order. There was so much noise and confusionthat I was shocked when it was ascertained that the division was not being proceeded with on clause 44, and that the subsequent clauses had been actually put without my hearing them, or realizing what was being done. They were all put while the discussion was going on as to whether there should or should not be a division on clause 44. I strongly object to such a drastic clause, on which there was so much criticism and difference of opinion, being allowed to go through without a division simply because some one, thinking the division was on an amendment, called &#34; No division.&#34; Every one of us most strongly objects to clause 44. </para>

          <para>.- The amendment just passed was clearly necessary, because <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> did not in the beginning declare that trustees are acting in their representative capacity, and, as in every other taxation measure, that they could not be liable beyond the value of the estate. We have now to get rid of another anomaly. Under this clause, if a mistake has been .made by a person deceased, whether intentionally or not, the executors are to be mulct in treble the amount of the tax ; and that is very unfair. A dead person cannot, of course, be called as a witness; and yet, for an act which may not have been wilful, his executors are punished as though it had been wilful. By a subsequent clause, if a man wilfully evades taxation there is the penalty of treble the amount; and that is very fair, because the taxpayer is alive to reply to the charge. ,But such a penalty is not fair in the case of executors, seeing that the only person who could explain that an omission was not wilful cannot give evidence. I suggest that the words &#34; shall be treble the amount of the difference between the tax so assessed and the amount actually paid by the taxpayer and &#34; be struck out. This simply means that&#39; in the case of evasion during the lifetime of the taxpayer, his execetors shall be liable lo the full extent of the tax had the evasion not taken place. As a matter of fact, I do not believe that any harm would be done if the clause were altogether omitted, first because there is always a remedy against the estate, and, secondly, the remedy inures against the executors and administrators. There is no need for the clause except to accomplish something that is bad, namely, the apparent desire of the draftsman to impose a fine of treble the amount of the tax. </para>

          <para>. - The suggestion of the honorable member creates a sensible distinction between the estate of a deceased person and the estate of a living one. We cannot convict a dead man of having wilfully done anything; and, therefore, the words at the head of the clause, &#34;whether intentionally or not,&#34; seem very appropriate to the circumstances. The honorable member says that the estate ought not to be taxed to treble the amount of the difference, which is one of the penalties set forth in clause 65. If the honorable member will allow me to consider the matter and see how far we can safely go, I shall do so in the light of his remarks. </para>

          <para>. - Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> provides that no lapse of time shall prevent the operation of the clause. It will be impossible for trustees to wind up estates in land unless there is some means of obtaining a certificate from the Commissioner that he has no claim. If the trustees distribute an estate with the chance of a charge of this kind, they will be liable either to the Crown or to the beneficiaries. There certainly ought to be limit of time of, say, one or two years. Under the State Act of Victoria, trustees, before they proceed to distribute, must advertise in certain newspapers and in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> that on and after a certain date they are going to do so; and in this clause there is no provision to protect them in any way. Under the circumstances, I do not know how trustees are to close an estate in land, because, it may be, ten years afterwards the question could arise whether in any preceding year the estate had been undervalued. </para>

            <para>- If this is  a;  charge on the land, then the people who buy are in a difficulty; but what I am pointing out is that the trustees, unless they have a certificate, will not be able to distribute an estate, seeing that before doing so they have to satisfy all claims. A charge should only be on the land until it is parted with, because a purchaser will have to ask if there is any charge on it, and no trustee can prove that there has not been undervaluation, and great difficulty will thereby be caused in conveyancing. Unless some alteration is made in the clause, there will be much complication without any special good resulting. The Commissioner should be able to determine within twelve months whether land has been properly valued. </para>

          <para>. - By way of reply to the honorable member for Balaclava, let me say that, so far as a trustee is concerned, once an estate has been distributed, his liability ceases. As for those who acquire trust estates, it is proposed to amend clause 52 in a way which will meet their case. -The clause contains the proviso that no charge for land tax shall be of effect as against a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> purchaser for value who, at the time of purchase made due inquiry, but had no notice of the liability. I propose to amend the clause by adding a further proviso to the effect that persons shall be deemed to have made due inquiry who have made inquiry of the Commissioner. The man who buys <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> and for value land which has formed part of a trust estate, or any other land, will not, if he has made due inquiry, that is, inquiry of the Commissioner as prescribed, be liable for the tax. The tax is a charge <inline font-style="italic">in rem,</inline> and not <inline font-style="italic">in personam,</inline> and therefore a trustee&#39;s liability will be extinguished once he has got rid of the trust estate. </para>

          <para>. - I am pleased that the Attorney-General intends to move an amendment for the protection of <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> purchasers for value. I would point out, however, that if the proceeds of an estate are in the hands of trustees, they will be unable to part with them until they get a certificate from the Commissioner that they have no liability in respect of the tax, and he is not bound to give such a certificate. If the AttorneyGeneral would agree to an amendment similar to that proposed by the honorable member for Gippsland, enabling trustees to compel the Commissioner to give a certificate, that would probably meet the case. After the distribution of an estate creditors ran file a suit in equity and follow the assets into the hands of the persons to whom they have been distributed, and if trustees in an estate in which three of the beneficiaries lived in Australia, and the remaining five abroad, distributed the estate, the portions of the Australian beneficiaries could be taxed, but those of the beneficiaries living abroad could not be, which would be unfair. Either there should be a limit of time, or the Commissioner should be compelled to give a certificate. </para>

          <para>. - I had made a note of an. amendment to the same effect, which I intended to move; and I welcome the ample way in which the AttorneyGeneral has dealt with this matter. There is an addition which the AttorneyGeneral might consider. Under the clause as it stands, there is no provision for notice to the lessee that there are arrears of taxation. The clause provides that where a taxpayer makes default, there shall be a remedy against the lessee to the extent of any money payable by him to the taxpayer that may still be in his hands. He might part with those moneys ; but I think that the liability would still remain. It is only fair that he should get notice from the Commissioner that his landlord - the taxpayer - has not paid the tax. There is a provision to that effect, if I remember rightly, in the South Australian Act; and I suggest that after the word &#34;occupier,&#34; the words &#34; one mouth&#39;s personal notice by the Commissioner,&#34; be inserted. </para>

          <para>. - This clause declares that the tax is to be a first charge upon the land taxed ; that it is to have priority over all other encumbrances, and that, notwithstanding any disposition of the land, it shall continue to be liable, in the hands of any purchaser, for the payment of the tax, so long as that tax remains unpaid. The proviso exempts a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> purchaser for value who, at the time of purchase, makes due inquiry, but has no notice of liability. That, in substance, repeats the terms of the Real Property Act of New South Wales; but a doubt arises as to what is &#34; due inquiry.&#34; The honorable member for Gippsland has given notice of an amendment dealing with the point, and the honorable member for Angas has also done so.

        <para class="block">The effect of my amendment would be that, unless the Commissioner, six months after the tax became payable, and, consequently, a charge upon the land, registered that charge in the State in which the land was situated, the charge would not remain. That would overcome the difficulty pointed out by the honorable member for Balaclava. We are dealing with Federal conditions, and it would be rather hard on a person selling land in a distant State to be obliged to write to the Department at the Seat of Government to ascertain what charges under the Land Tax Assessment Act remained unpaid. We have one of the most expeditious systems of land transfer in the world, and we ought not to impose any obstacle to the prompt transfer of property. I pointed out to an English visitor within the last twenty-four hours that a big transaction in real estate might be settled here, and the transfer given, within two hours, as long as the parties could get to the Registrar&#39;s office and ascertain whether there were any registered charges or notices of trusts. If a man happened to be transferring land in Western Australia, and had to write to the Seat of Government to obtain information as to the non-payment of land taxation, there might be a- delay of a month in obtaining a transfer, and I think that such an amendment as I have stated should be accepted. In the next sub-clause it is provided that the Commissioner may register such a charge; and that shows that it is considered that it will be possible for him to make the necessary arrangements to have it registered. I do not feel strongly on this question, but I think that such an amendment as I have indicated would meet the wishes of the Committee. My object is to see that land transactions are not delayed owing to unregistered charges of the Government resting upon property. </para>

          <para>.- An amendment has just occurred to me in consequence of a suggestion made by the honorable member for Balaclava. It illustrates one of the many difficulties that arise in connexion with legislation of this kind. This clause purports to impose the land tax as a first charge upon the land, in priority to all other encumbrances. In some of the State Acts various charges are made a first charge upon the land. In Victoria, for instance, the expenses incurredby the Government in grants for wire netting are so treated. </para>

The Constitution provides that where a law of the Commonwealth is inconsistent with the law of a State the Commonwealth law shall prevail ; but that has no reference whatever to a proposal of this kind. If the Commonwealth had the power to make laws creating, for instance, first charges upon the lands of the Commonwealth, then, of course, anything that the Commonwealth Parliament declared to be a first charge upon the land would take priority over anything which a State declared to be a first charge upon it. </para>

          <para>. - The amendment of -the honorable and learned member for Angas seems to render the whole intention of the clause entirely inoperative, or to hamstring it. It would have the effect of limiting the liability in respect of any land to six months. If the Commissioner did not know it within that time, and he could not register it unless he did know it, the land would escape liability. I do not think the amendment is right,  or in any way necessary. The amend- v... _ ment I suggested, that a person should be deemed to have made due inquiry who has made inquiry of the Commissioner as prescribed and been told by him that there is no charge, should be quite sufficient. I come now to the suggestion of the honorable member for Flinders, who seems to doubt either the wisdom or the right of this Parliament to make its land tax a first charge upon land, because there are other charges in various States. No doubt that is perfectly true. This will not destroy those charges. If we make the tax a first charge on the land, it will be a first charge, and all that will happen will be that, if other existing first charges come in conflict with it, they will be postponed. That is eminently proper. Does the honorable member suggest that we should postpone our right until the State right has been satisfied? I cannot agree to that. </para>

          <para>- - I do not think the Attorney-General quite heard my argument. If a first charge has been created on land in favour qf a State, that first charge is the property of the State. If we impose another first charge which takes priority of that, it becomes a first charge, not only on the whole of the land, but on the State&#39;s first charge, and therefore a charge upon the property of the State. That manifestly we cannot do. There is no use in our attempting to put in a Statute tilings which we cannot do. We have no more right to impose this tax as a charge upon the State&#39;s charge on land than to impose it upon any other portion of the property of a State. </para>

            <para>- Surely the AttorneyGeneral understands the position clearly. A piece of land may have as many encumbrances on it as you like. So long as they are made by the owner in favour of private individuals, this Parliament can impose a land tax as a first charge or. the land in priority to any or all of them, but this Parliament has no power to impose a land tax or anything else as a first charge in priority to a legally established first charge to a State, which is the State&#39;s property. Take an extreme case. Suppose that the charge in favour of the State was so great as to absorb the value of the land. Then that land in reality belongs to the State, and we are attempting verbally to say that we put a first charge, on that land in priority to the charge of the State, which we have no power to do. . 11 we attempt to make our tax a first charge in priority to all other encumbrances, weought at least to prevent the clause being altogether unconstitutional by making it subject to that to which it must be subject - namely, the existing property of the State in that land. </para>

            <para>- The Parliament of a State may, subsequently to the passing of this Act, create a first charge, in the exercise of its legislative authority, for any purpose it likes in favour of itself. If it does so, it exercises the same function as if it took a portion or the whole of that land compulsorily. The land becomes its property. We can, however, make a law saying that, until the State has made any land its property, and has therefore taken it out of the domain that we can touch, we impose a charge upon the land. </para>

            <para>- Not to take priority of the State&#39;s charge. We could give it priority over any other encumbrance. We cannot make any law to deprive a State of property it has acquired. For instance, large advances have been made from the Treasury of Victoria to municipalities for distribution amongst farmers with a view to buying wire netting. That is a debt due to the Crown, collected by the municipalities, and paid to the Crown, and the law under which the money was advanced made the amount advanced to each farmer a first charge upon his land. </para>

First of all, we have a perfect right to create a first charge which will supersede the right of a State under any existing State law, and, secondly, I say that only in a case where the State has acted under its powers and actually seized a property will a difficulty arise. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member has his opinion, and has expressedit. I assume that he will admit that there is a difference between&#39; a charge and a&#39; tax. It is a question whether &#34; tax &#34; in the section means &#34;charge&#34;; that is to. say, whether there is no real fundamental distinction between the imposition of a tax and the right to do something in furtherance of a penalty in reference to the collection of a tax. Surely that must be arguable? I submit, further, that if the honorable member be right, there is no necessity for the words he proposes, because the Constitution imposes the limitation, which must be read into the words of the clause as it stands. The proposed words are either a dangerous attempt to limit our powers, or they are superfluous; and in either case they cannot be accepted. </para>

In the South Australian Act, it is provided that the tax shall be a first charge, but that cannot supersede any Federal charge that may be made prior, nor could any Commonwealth charge supersede, any charge payable to the State if the latter be first in time. </para>

The Crown of the State and the Crown of the Commonwealth have equal rights in this matter, because, in the Excise case and in some American cases, it has been held that the powers of taxation are independent - in other words, that the States have independent powers and the Commonwealth has independent powers. We have, therefore, the Crown in two equal capacities ; and the first exercise of the capacity is the first charge. </para>

          <para>. - I  think it is very likely that the honorable member for Angas and the honorable member for Darling Downs have arrived at the correct conclusion; but it is quite inconsistent with the view of the AttorneyGeneral.  I  specially asked that honorable gentleman whether the object of the clause is to impose this Federal charge in priority to existing State charges, and I understood him to say, more than once, that that was the object. Of course, if the honorable member withdraws from his position now, there is no more to be said ; and I shall not press the amendment. I am inclined, on consideration, to agree with the view of the honorable member for Angas and the honorable member for Darling Downs ; but I hope the AttorneyGeneral will admit that, in reference to the cost of wire-netting, advances to settlers, and so forth, we are not attempting to make a Federal charge in priority. It would greatlyrelieve the constitutional uncertainty which surrounds a good deal of this measure if the Attorney-General would say. that such is the fact. </para>

          <para>.- The most amusing part of the utteranceof the honorable member for Flinders was that in which he asked the Attorney-General to state something that that gentleman has said it is not necessary to state. What difference would a statement make? The Attorney-General would be very unwise to make a statement at all ; he had better leave the matter as it is, and allow the Court to interpret the rights of the states. I see no necessity for the Attorney-General to embody the suggestion of the honorable member for Flinders in the clause, nor to make any statement such as is desired. </para>

        <para class="block">While the Attorney-General has resolved that inquiry may be made of the Commissioner, it will not be incumbent upon that officer to return an answer. In Victoria, rates are a charge on the property on which they are assessed, and it used to be the practice in connexion with land transactions to inquire of the clerk of the municipality in which the land was situated what amount, if any, was owing on it in respect of rates. In one instance, the clerk stated that nothing was due when there was really a debt of some pounds, and two or three years later the municipality sought to recover the debt from the purchaser of the land, who had been misled by the clerk&#39;s reply to his inquiry. Chi the case going to the Full Court, it was held that the clerk&#39;s certificate did not bind the municipality, and the purchaser of the land had to pay the rates. This was seen to be unjust, and the Local Government Act of 1903 contains a provision, of which my amendment is virtually a copy, requiring council clerks to reply to applications in writing, and the replies so given bind the municipalities. This provision seems to be a complement to the proviso just inserted by the Attorney-General. </para>

          <para>.-I cannot accept the amendment, because the proviso just inserted does all that should be asked. We do not wish to deter persons from buying land by reason of the fact that they may thus be acquiring concealed liabilities ; but as the clause now stands, a <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> purchaser for value who. has made due inquiry will be in the same position as such a purchaser is in other respects under the Real Property Acts of New South Wales and Victoria, and the Torrens Act of South Australia. When such a man has made due inquiry, and has been informed that the land which he wishes to purchase is not liable for taxation, he cannot subsequently be called upon to pay. </para>

          <para>.- I think that the Attorney-General ought to accept this harmless necessary addition to the clause, which will be of great assistance to solicitors  and  others interested in the transfer of land. Without some such provision, it may be impossible to obtain a reply from the Commissioner, while the public may be kept waiting for months  for  replies, to the great hindrance of business. The acceptance of the amendment would not weaken the Bill, and would greatly assist all who have dealings in land. </para>

If so, the settlement of land transactions in distant States will be  unworkable, and  the whole system  will  prove most cumbersome.

          <para>. - I submitted my amendment as a practical matter, and as the result of my experience as a solicitor in investigating titles when acting for purchasers. It is the duty of a solicitor when so acting to see that the title in question is free of all charges, and to make inquiries in respect of all .such matters. The Attorney-General says that the Commissioner may furnish a reply, but we desire that the Bill shall definitely provide that a reply must be made to such inquiry. Before a solicitor can advise a purchaser of land to settle, he must know whether the land tax has been paid, or he may desire to apportion it, in respect of the current year, as between vendor and purchaser. Under the clause as amended it is provided that &#34; due inquiry &#34; will be sufficient to clear a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> purchaser of responsibility for the payment of land tax, but he .would have to prove that he had made due inquiry, and might not be able to produce evidence that his letter of inquiry had reached the Commissioner. Under my amendment, if a solicitor acting for a purchaser wrote in due time to the Commissioner for a certificate, and it had not reached him before the day fixed for settlement, he would at once telegraph for a reply, and would be able to make sure that his inquiry had reached its proper destination. I cannot see what objection there is to compelling the Commissioner to answer an inquiry. I am quite willing to adopt the suggestion made by the honorable member for Flinders that the Attorney-General, in the event of his refusing to accept my amendment, should provide in the Bill itself for the Commissioner giving a certificate &#34; as prescribed.&#34; </para>

          <para>.- We might extend the clause to cover a class of case which arises chiefly through the operations of wills and settlements, where people will have to pay the whole tax, after paying out various annuities. The Attorney- General might try to relieve a man who has to pay all the tax in that way by giving him power to deduct a fair proportion of the tax from the moneys that he has to pay to the annuitants. A man may have an estate which brings in &#163;5,000 a year. He is the legal owner, and liable to pay the tax, but out of that &#163;5,000 he may have to pay &#163;2,000 or &#163;3,000 to different people in annuities. When he pays the tax, in addition to the annuities, his own income will probably have nearly vanished. I suggest the addition of the following words to the clause - </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>Provided that where a taxpayer is liable for the payment of a sum or sums of money charged upon the land in respect of which the tax is payable, such taxpayer shall be entitled to deduct from each sum so charged and payable by him as aforesaid an amount as contribution equal to the proportion which the said sum or sums bear to the full improved value of the said land after such sum or sums have been capitalized on an interest-bearing basis of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> per centum per annum. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That would work out in this way : Take an estate of the full improved value of &#163;150,000, and a taxable unimproved value of &#163;95,000. The man responsible for the tax, as the Bill now stands, would pay &#163;1,59315s.inland taxation. He has to pay an annuity of &#163;1,000 to A, and another of &#163;1,500 to B. &#163;1,000 capitalized at 5 per cent. would be &#163;20,000, which is two- fifteenths of &#163;150,000. Twofifteenths of the annuity of &#163;1,000 is &#163;133 6s. 8d. The annuity of &#163;1,500 capitalized in the same way represents &#163;30,000, which is one-fifth of the total improved value of the estate. One-fifth of &#163;1,500 is &#163;300. Therefore, the man who has to pay the full tax to the Commonwealth would be entitled to deduct from his payment of &#163;1,000 to A the sum of &#163;133 6s. 8d., and from his payment of &#163;1,500 to B the sum of &#163;300. The people in receipt of annuities ought to pay something towards the tax. It was never thought by many people, when making wills and settlements, that the man to whom the property was left, subject to annuities, would have to contend with anything like this. There will be many cases in Australia, where, after the annuities are paid, as they must be, and the land tax is paid, the owner of the land will have nothing left. My amendment will not interfere with any principle in the Bill; it will do justice; and I hope the AttorneyGeneral will give it favorable consideration. </para>

          <para>.- I should like to call attention to a matter germane to this clause, and to which the honorable member for Grampians directed my notice this evening. He said it was a pity that some allowance was not made in connexion with annuitants, such as the honorable member for Wilmot has mentioned. We passed in clause 29 a provision that where, under a settlement or a will of a person who had died before 1st July, 1910, there was a division amongst the relatives of the settlors, a deduction of &#163;5,000 could be made for the share of each beneficiary from the total assessment against the trustee. Thus, if the total assessment was &#163;40,000, and there were three beneficiaries of, say, &#163;5,000 each, there would be a deduction of &#163;15,000, and the tax would fall on the remaining &#163;25,000. The word &#34;share&#34; does not, I think, cover annuities, and it may be that the Attorney-General could comply with the desire of the honorable member for Wilmot by sufficiently widening the definition of the word. The value of annuities could be capitalized at 4 per cent. or 5 per cent., and the necessary deduction made. The honorable member for Grampians drew my attention to this point, and I ask the Attorney-General to look at the matter in the way I have suggested. </para>

          <para>. - We, in Australia, have always prided ourselves on the simplicity with which properties can be transferred under the various Land Acts of the States. Whenever property over the value of &#163;5,000 is cut up, any solicitor, before he can pass the title of any block, has to find out whether there is any liability or charge attached ; and if, as here provided, we make this tax a perpetual charge on the land, all sorts of transfers and mortgages will be tied up. This will increase the cost of preparing transfers, and of mortgages, even of small allotments, below the value of &#163;5,000, and will generally cause delay and trouble. I think the AttorneyGeneral might provide that, if no claim is made within three years, the purchaser or person taking the mortgage shall have a clean title. Unless an amendment of this kind is made great difficulty will arise, especially in distant parts of the country from which it will not be easy to communicate with the Commissioner in Melbourne or at Yass-Canberra ; and people who desire to have money in a hurry on mortgage will have to wait. . </para>

Clause 55 deals with other cases where there have been simply a shortage in the payment without either misstatement or undervaluation; and here, of course, there is a clear distinction. It is to meet cases where, through no fault of anybody concerned, there has been a short payment; and the clause is very necessary. </para>

            <para>- Honorable members opposite seem to think that the tax, and everything connected with it, are too much ; but I point out that, according, to the Acts Interpretation Act, the clause means that the penalty shall not exceed &#163;50 - it may be anything less. I may add that there is a similar provision also in the New South Wales Act. We are dealing with powerful companies, and we require pecuniary penalties sufficiently high to deter them from wrong-doing. </para>

          <para>. - I remember a case in Victoria in which a company, registered in New South Wales, opened a small office in Melbourne, and, under a similar law, was sued for and mulcted in penalties amounting to more than the whole of the assets of the company. If I remember rightly, that took place under an Act which provided that all advertisements in connexion with companies must set out the amount of the paid-up capital; and, there being an omission, an informer sued and recovered the penalty of &#163;10 a day, with the result that the company, through a sheer mistake, was completely ruined. </para>

            <para>- Then, that apparently was not known to the company. These offences are very small, and may arise from pure accident. The question was raised on a Bill recently before us, and a number of honorable members expressed a doubt asto whether, when a fixed penalty is mentioned as in this case, it has not to be enforced. A limit of&#163;10 a day would be ample. At the end of one hundred days, such a fine would have amounted to &#163;1,000, and not much harm would be done if the company omitted to register for that period. It must be remembered that the general public knows little of what we are enacting, not one man in a hundred reading our legislation. Since I left the State Parliament, I seldom read the measures submitted to it, or even the reports of its proceedings, and it is hardly likely that many members of the general public follow our proceedings very closely.

          <para>.- The clause is more important than seems to. be realized. Only yesterday my attention was drawn to it by a firm of solicitors, who said that it would very much hamper operations in regard to the development of certain mining leases in South Australia. Under the law of that State, an apportionment is provided for where a lessee has seven years of his term to run ; but future leases are left to the usual operation of the law of contract. My impression is that the High Court will have something to say about this provision, which does not seem ancillary to the purposes of the measure&#39;. Of course, where a leasehold has a sale value, it will be taxable. The provision may be constitutional regarding existing leases, but I doubt whether it can be made to apply to future leases. As the Opposition is willing to facilitate the consideration of the remaining clauses to-morrow, nothing will be lost by reporting progress now. </para>

          <para>. - The clause must be read in conjunction with clauses  26A  and  26B,  of which the former takes out of the operation of the measure all Crown leases other than perpetual leases, and leases giving the right to purchase. Clause  26b  deals specifically with the lia bility of lessees, both before and after the Act. Clause  59,  with which we are now dealing, relates to all other attempts to evade the Act, and whatever they may be, they are not necessarily those to whichthe honorable member for Darling Downs has referred. They seem to be covered by clause  26B;  and, in so far as they are not, this clause will apply. The clause intends, as far as possible, to place the incidence of the tax on the person who ought properly to pay it, and will not permit of any evasion, nor of any attempt to evade. </para>

          <para>. - I think that this clause goes, a great deal further than the AttorneyGeneral intends. Under the amendment, it will be retrospective and may, so to speak, rip up numerous contracts for the sale of land that have already been entered into. A person who has subdivided and sold part of his land will have altered the incidence of the tax, and the mere fact of his having done so before the passing of this Bill will make the contracts of sale absolutely void. We are going to give people opportunities to cancel contracts already entered into, and are making it an offence to enter into contracts that will vary the incidence of this measure before it actually comes into force. Surely it was never intended that we should pass retrospective legislation by which contracts in existence shall be declared void as between the parties who have legally entered into them with their eyes open. They are to be void if they interfere in any way with the incidence of the land tax, or relieve any person of liability to pay the tax, or to make a return under this Bill. Any one who cuts up an estate, and sells part of it, will be relieved of certain liabilities under this Bill; and all contracts entered into for the sale of that land can be voided. I do not think that the Attorney- General intended that that should be the effect of his amendment. Parliament, as a rule, is strongly averse to retrospective legislation, and I suggest that the Attorney-General should leave the clause as originally drafted. Any contract entered into before the passing of the Bill should be legal ; but the clause cannot be made too strong to deal with any person who enters info a contract after the passing of the Bill, with a view to altering the incidence of the tax, or of attempting to evade it. The clause, as proposed to be amended, will go further than any legislation of the kind of which I know. </para>

          <para>. - I am very ready to suggest that we should go home ; but it is very obvious that we must finish the Bill at some time. What I suggest is an arrangement whereby we shall finish the clauses as they stand in the Bill by dinner time to-morrow - that is, in about three hours - and take on Friday the recommittal and the new clauses, about which there can be very little discussion. That is an arrangement to which I think honorable members might come. We cannot go on for ever. I do not believe in sitting late- indeed, I am very reluctant to do so. This afternoon we wasted four hours on clause  44,  and discussed it long after there was practically nothing to discuss. I do hope that the arrangementI have indicated can be arrived at. </para>

          <para>.- It is impossible for one to pledge his word that honorable members will not speak on a matter, unless there is an absolute concert. We on this side will facilitate getting through the Bill by the time mentioned, but, considering the importance of one clause, I cannot pledge honorable members not to discuss it at greater length. The Attorney-General will remember that on two occasions where I said on behalf of others that, as far as. possible, we would terminate discussion at a certain time, we came to the exact clause mentioned by him at the time named. I would ask the honorable gentleman to accept an assurance of that kind. As far as I am personally concerned, and I believe I speak for the Opposition generally, we will facilitate the measure being passed through Committee by half-past 6 o&#39;clock tomorrow evening. </para>

          <para>. - I should like the AttorneyGeneral to understand that I take what he has said as being uttered in good faith. It is not a good thing to begin by imputing motives. I hesitate to commit myself with respect to any particular time for disposing of so important a Bill, though I have no wish to see it delayed one minute longer than is absolutely necessary. A measure like this, however, is far too important to be bludgeoned through without proper discussion, and I can commit myself to no course of action which would prevent fair discussion. Arrangements have, however, been suggested by the two members of the Opposition who have borne the brunt of the criticism. They have assured the Attorney-General that they will, as far as possible, facilitate the passage of the Bill, and that there will be no undue delay. I hope that there may be none. </para>

            <para>. - I should like to correct a misre port which occurs in this evening&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> in regard to a statement I made this afternoon in putting a question to the Minister of External Affairs. The newspaper reports me as saying that I &#34;had before me an auctioneer&#39;s advertisement concerning land in Western Australia. I said nothing whatever about an auctioneer&#39;s advertisement. I quoted the statement of. the responsible Minister of Lands in Western Australia, to the effect that there were  1,000,000  acres which had been surveyed and were awaiting settlement. How the reference to the auctioneer&#39;s advertisement crept into the report  1  am unable to say. </para>
