                        <para>.- Although we are nearing the end of the session, no satisfactory answer has been given to the questions which have been asked regarding the progress made in providing in Australia appliances for the .receipt and despatch of messages by means of wireless telegraphy, and some of the answers given have ' been so ridiculous that, it is surprising that Ministers made themselves responsible for them. Honorable members are entitled to more information than is available. Very shortly we shall be revisiting our constituencies, and shall then be asked what is being done in this matter, and the only reply that we shall be able to give will be that nothing has been done, because we have recently been told that contracts which we thought had been signed have not been signed. More than two years ago I called attention in this Chamber to the fact that Lloyd's had offered to install a wireless telegraph apparatus at Fremantle, or to assist the local Harbor Trust in doing so ; but the Postmaster-General informed me that he could not agree to the arrangement, because the Department intended to take the matter in hand. The people are therefore entitled to know why nothing has been done. Similar installations to that proposed to be erected here have been erected all over the world, and the steamers of very many companies are now equipped with wireless apparatus, as many as six such vessels having been in purports at one time. Vessels have been equipped at Home without delaying their departure for Australia, and, indeed, vessels have been built and equipped since we first ' voted money for the instalment of apparatus here. We should know, therefore, why the work has not been carried out. It is disgraceful that steam-ship companies with comparatively small capital should be able to install wireless apparatus on their vessels, and that this Government should not have provided for the receipt and despatch of messages at a Commonwealth' station. Messages can be sent from one steamer to another, and, if the receiving vessel is in port, ' can be then transmitted by our land lines, as was done recently, when a passenger wished to book seats for a theatrical performance; but a vessel at sea cannot, communicate with a Commonwealth station. The sum of ;£io,coo was voted in 1906-7 for the installation of a wireless station in Australia, and the amount was revoted in subsequent years. At present, <inline font-style="italic">£iS&gt;°°°</inline> is available for the purpose, and yet contracts have not, so far, been signed for the carrying out of the work. As a matter of fact, the community Has been humbugged from start to finish. On 12th October last, the Postmaster-General said that a Conference was being held in Fremantle between representatives of the Defence Forces, the Navy, his Department; and the contractors for the erection of wireless telegraphy appliances ; that the valuable advice of Admiral Henderson had been obtained ; that two sites were regarded as suitable ; and that the Department was waiting for the contractors to say which they would accept. The reply gives no reason for asking why the contractors should be asked to make a choice. They should merely have been told that the Commonwealth desired the erection of the appliances at a certain site. The changing of a site would have no practical effect on the value of the installation, because, to -move- ten or fifteen miles inland the centre of a circle having a radius of 500 or 1,000 miles would not appreciably affect the distance to which messages could he sent, or from which they could be received. On 21st October, the Postmaster-General slated, in reply to a question asked by- me, that he was aware that vessels had been equipped with wireless appliances during their ordinary stay in England on a voyage from Australia. When I asked who the contractors to the Commonwealth Government were,. I was told that they were " Australian Wireless Limited, 129 Pitt-street, Sydney, who we're a local company representing a well-established German company." Before I finish I shall show how " well established " that company is, and who the contractors are; and I think the information will not only astonish honorable members, but render them dissatisfied with the position. If a tender is put in for so important a work, inquiries should be made as to who the tenderers are, what they have to offer, and whether what they have to offer is worth accepting at any price. We were told that the tender was accepted because it was the cheapest; but my experience is that the cheapest is not always the best. It- was also stated that oversea vessels installed with the system have visited Australian ports, and that the contractors now have a station at Sydney operating under licence for experimental purposes. I fancy that if honorable members knew what that station is, they would laugh. I am told that there are a few private stations operating in Melbourne, some of them for 100 feet, and others, perhaps, for 100 yards; and, under the circumstances, considering that we require a station operating over a 1,200-mile radius, I do not see what this little experimental station has to do with the case. On the 8th November I asked the following questions, as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> page 5738 :- </para>

                    <para class="block">Why has that not been carried out? It appears to me that the whole thing is a muddle, and that the proposal was not intended to be carried out. For instance, it is stipulated that the contractors shall proceed with the work or forfeit ,£500; but, at the same time, the whole amount on deposit is only <inline font-style="italic">£100</inline> in the form of a " cheque, bank draft, or banker's certificate." It apparently is at the option of the contractor whether the document he deposits is of any value, because " in the form of a cheque " does not mean anything of value. In all the contracts that I have had to do with, the deposit had to be in the form of a bank's cheque, a deposit receipt, or something of value. Another stipulation is that the person whose tender is accepted will be required to enter into a bond in a form approved by the Postmaster-General, with two sureties, for the due performance of all the conditions; yet we are told eight or nine months after the tender has been accepted that the bond has not been completed. Then, I am told that there are many conditions in the contract absolutely impossible to carry out. One condition is - </para>

                    <para class="block">There is no such thing in the world as a system that is non-interfering at will : and the officers of the Department ought to have been aware of the fact. The question is whether this is a tender, a contract, an offer, or a recommendation. It is left to the tenderer to suggest the exact location of the station, and it is said that preference will be given to sites that are easy of access, adjacent to existing telegraph lines, and within easy reach of some settled township. That infers that a station might be built which was not within easy reach of a township. </para>

I know a little about specifications, but it has never been my luck to have such a document as that to sign. If it had been, I should not have finished the job yet. The Minister, or some one speaking for him, made the statement that the Telefunken, the German system accepted by the Commonwealth Government, had been used in fitting up 40 per cent, of the wireless stations in the world. That statement could have been made only to mislead the members of this Parliament, and I challenge the Minister or his officers to prove it. Ninety per cent, of the wireless telegraphy stations in the world are fitted with other systems.

                            <para>- No. They are using, the Marconi system. They cannot use the other. Lloyd's people, who asked for permission to establish their station at. Fremantle, have stations of their own all over Great Britain, and, in fact, all over the world. All the post-offices in Great Britain that are equipped are fitted with, the Marconi system, as are all the vessels and light-houses at Home. There are about, thirty stations in Canada. In view of that fact, it is a standing disgrace to us that we have not one station here. How can we compete with or get ahead of Canada if we are so behind her in such matters ?" We have been informed that 40 per cent, of the vessels of the world are installed with- the Telefunken system, but, in a calculation made on eight voyages across the Atlantic to Canada, the average number of communications upon each voyage was ten per day, and these were all Marconi. It has taken us in Australia about five years to do nothing, but, knowing that ships often went to England and came back fitted with wireless apparatus, I inquired how long it took to make the installation on a vessel. I was told that it took two days. When I said, " That is rather quick, is it not?" my informant said, " Well, say three days." The system usually installed on vessels operates over a radius of 400 miles, but when the climatic conditions are favorable the radius is extended even up to 1,000 miles. We were told the other day that a grant of ^2,000 had been allowed to the Sydney company - God knows what for. They have not signed the contract, and I suppose they have been promised the ^2,000 if they will sign it. We were told that one of the reasons was that they had to make some special earth connexions. I took the trouble, at great expense, to find out what the necessary earth connexions were, and found that they amounted to nothing. They are so trivial that those  concerned could not put a value on them. On a boat all the "earth connexion" necessary is made by connecting a wire with one of the girders, and in this case there is no more earth connexion necessary than is involved in burying a sheet of iron, copper, or other metal, or attaching a wire to an underground pipe. The regulations of the Postmaster-General of Great Britain provide that, before a wireless station can be installed by any private person in the United Kingdom, or on board a ship registered in the United Kingdom, a licence must be obtained. The regulation here is similar. Let me tell the House who the people comprising the " Australian Wireless Limited " are. They are supposed to be the people who have secured the contract. The information in my possession is as follows : -  25th October, 1910, Underwood-street. - This is a limited liability company registered on 15th December, 1909, with a nominal capital of £5,000 divided into <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> shares. </para>

                            <para>- I defy the Government to install in Australia such a system as this. It would be a standing disgrace to the Commonwealth if the Government installed here a system which is not approved or used by the British Government, and by which no British man-of-war would dare to communicate with our stations in time of trouble, or, indeed, at any time. </para>

                            <para>- I challenge the Government to install the Telefunken system in Australia. It is a disgrace to the Commonwealth that the Ministry that was in office when this tender was received was not protected and prevented from accepting it. It is a disgrace, too, that a proposal should be made to hand over to these people £^2,000 to induce them to go on with the work, in view of the fact that they have not signed the contract. I trust that the Government of the day will cancel the contract, and let the syndicate take what proceedings they, please. Let them prove that they are entitled to compensation. In any event, they could not be entitled to much, in view of the fact that they desire £2,000 to help them to carry out the work. Had they completed the work in a satisfactory manner, the Ministry might have said to them, " If you have lost money over the contract we shall be prepared to help you, subject to the approval of Parliament." </para>

                            <para>- No. By some kind of back-door influence they have been able to secure a promise of ,£2,000 to help them to carry on a contract that has never been signed. When a small amount is required for a postal improvement, or to provide for a country telephone service, provision has to be made for the work on the Estimates, yet these people, who have really nothing to offer, have been promised ,£2,000 if they will carry out a contract which they have not signed. Under the conditions the contract could have been cancelled within fourteen days of its acceptance, owing to the neglect of the tenderers to proceed with the work. If a small up-country contractor desired to delay for six or eight months' the carrying out of a .contract into which he had entered, what treatment would he receive at the hands of the Department ? I contend that the action taken in this connexion is most unfair, and that it would not have been sanctioned but for the fact that certain <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> and tobacco people are at the back of the movement. The people of Australia will be interested to learn how this syndicate worked their scheme, and how, in the first place, they secured any consideration whatever for their tender, in view of the fact that at the time they had no Australian rights in connexion with the system. The syndicate was formed to purchase the rights, and my information is that it is designed to exploit the Commonwealth. It has been formed really to exploit' a power which is vested only in the Postmaster-General. Under the Commonwealth Act, the Postmaster-General has the sole right to establish wireless telegraphy in Australia, and yet these people are to install a system which will not enable us to communicate with British vessels. The German Government are about to establish the Telefunken system in Samoa, and a number of the German war-ships have also installed the same system. On the other hand, the Marconi system has been adopted by the steam-ship companies to which I have referred, many of which may be called upon at any time to supply transports for the British Government. In the circumstances, it must be recognised that they would adopt only such a system as would work in harmony with that  adopted by the British Admiralty. It is unfair for us to ask the British Admiralty to co-operate with us if we are going to install the Telefunken system. If the authorities here consider that system the best, why was the Marconi system installed on the <inline font-style="italic">Parramatta</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Yarra?</inline> Apparently anything that is done abroad can be done well, but anything left to local authorities is muddled. Yet honorable members opposite profess to be able to manage all the affairs of Australia ! Today 90 per cent, of the business of the world is done by the Marconi system. An American system tried to get a footing, but did not succeed. Some time ago some information leaked out, and the authorities knew that the operator on one particular steamer must be responsible for the leakage. Inquiries were made as to who he was, and he was instantly removed from his position. We hope that trouble with other nations will never happen again, but should it arise, we should not like to have our wireless communications carried on by a foreign system in charge of foreigners. The Marconi system is the universal system. I ask the House to treat this matter seriously. I have not brought it forward as a party move; I regard it as of great importance to the interests of Australia. The present condition of affairs is scandalous, and, I trust, will soon be altered. </para>

                        <para>. - I am very pleased that the honorable member has moved the adjournment to bring this matter forward. As the result of the expressed wish of Parliament, my predecessor, on 14th September, 1909, called for tenders for the installation of two wireless telegraph stations. The specifications were drawn up by the officers of the Department, and draft copies submitted to the British Admiralty and to the Defence Department here. The alterations suggested by the Admiralty were two in number ; one was that to clause 25 words should be added making it clear that the conditions applied to both sending and receiving, and the other that in clause 26 preference should be given to a system which would emit a definite musical note. It has been stated in the press that this last provision was inserted by the officers of my Department in order to give the . Telefunken system a better chance, but it is the Admiralty that is responsible for it. I think that the House will be of opinion that the late Postmaster-General was justified in agreeing to specifications which had passed the review of the Admiralty and of the Defence Department. Among the conditions was one to the effect that the station at Sydney should be located between the South Head of the entrance to Port Jackson and Botany Bay, and another that the station at Fremantle should not be more than  s  miles from the Fremantle Post-office. Those conditions were submitted to both Admiral Poore and the Defence Department here, and special attention was drawn to them. The honorable member for Parramatta was Minister of Defence at the time, and a letter signed by the Secretary to the Defence Department was received by my Department, stating that the Department was satisfied with the specifications, and that they would meet its requirements, while the Admiral of the station, to whom a copy of the draft agreement was sent, through the Governor-General, replied - </para>

                        <para>With regard to the Sydney site, there would appear to be several good positions on either the North or the South Head. As regards height, North Head would be the better, but South Head would probably be more convenient, as the necessary power could easily be obtained from the existing tramway mains in the vicinity. </para>

I lay particular stress upon the fact that a member of the Board was an Admiralty officer. It recommended the acceptance of the tender of the Australian Wireless Telegraph Company. </para>

                            <para>- I should add that the Marconi Company asked, approximately, ^19,000 as the price for each installation, while the Australian Wireless Telegraph Company asked only ^4,100. In the face of that difference in cost, 'and of the fact that a representative of the Admiralty recommended.  the acceptance of the lower tender, would any Postmaster- General have dared to accept the Marconi tender in preference to the tender of the Australian Company? Further, the then Postmaster-General, before accepting, wrote to the English Admiralty asking whether there was any objection to this contract being entered into, and the reply was in the negative - there was no objection if the Australian Government were satisfied that the company could carry out the work. </para>

                            <para>- Whatever may have happened since, I was in no way responsible for what occurred at the time of which I am speaking ; but I can' say that had I been in the position of the honorable member ' for Bendigo, I should have done exactly as he did.  The honorable member for Bendigo accepted the contract on 4th April ; and when I came into office 1 ascertained that fact on inquiry. Not very long afterwards I went to Sydney, and there was waited upon by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hugh</inline> Denison. In this connexion, I am glad to have an opportunity to reply to what I think was rather an insinuation contained in a question put by the honorable member for Parkes as to whether one of the directors of the company was not a proprietor of the <inline font-style="italic">'Bulletin,</inline> and whether I had recently had several interviews with one of the directors. </para>

                                expressed his regret that the matter had been delayed so long - it was then May - and said he was extremely anxious to know when the company could get to work. On making inquiries, I found that some of the delay was due to the Admiralty. The Department was ready with its representative in the person of
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hesketh,</inline>
                                the Electrical Engineer; and in the presence of

                                I telephoned over to the Minister of External Affairs in Melbourne, asking him to communicate, through the Governor-General, with the Admiralty, with a view to expediting matters. This

                                did ; and in a very little while Lieutenant P rouse was appointed to represent the naval authorities at the Conference, and Captain Creswell to represent the military authorities. After the Conference I was greatly surprised to find that the military and naval authorities both held the opinion that there was no site within the area suitable from a defence point of view. From a commercial point of view, and in the opinion of the Department, the site was quite suitable.

                            <para>- The Government found themselves in a serious position in view of the report of die Defence authorities; and we took the step of asking what site would be considered suitable. Thereupon, a site at Pennant Hills, in the electorate of the honorable member for Parramatta, was suggested. The Department then consulted  the Crown Law authorities as to whether Pennant Hills could be considered within the specifications, and we were advised that it could not. Consequently, 1 take it, the Department could not compel the company to carry out the work there at the same price tendered in respect of another locality.</para>

                            <para>- The contract has not actually been signed, but it is there. It will be remembered that the Marconi company asked £19,000 for one station; and all the extra money asked for by the other company, in view of the changed locality, was £2,000, so that still there was no comparison between the tenders. The Government agreed to pay the other £2,000. Now arose, however, the difficulty as to the Fremantle site. </para>

                            <para>- They were not my specifications. It was necessary to have a site at Fremantle that would be suitable alike for telegraph and military and naval purposes ; and according to the specifications the contractors had something to say as to the locality. We requested the military authorities to be good enough to send some one to Fremantle to assist us in the selection; and Captain Creswell was again appointed. He was going to meet Admiral Henderson at Fremantle, and it was thought by the Government a good idea to seek the advice of the Admiral, especially as he was accompanied by Lieutenant Slee, who is a wireless telegraphy expert. All these arrangements were carried out, and a report was submitted to the Government suggesting two sites. The company, however, did not appear to be agreeable to accept either of these sites, and desired us to fix some other place within the area. </para>

                            <para>- The company said that neither site was suitable. Immediately we received that communication we consulted <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Crown Law authorities, and we were informed that we ought not, in the first place, to have sent to the company saying that we had fixed on two sites and asking them to select one, but that we should have written asking them what site they were prepared to accept within the locality. When they had nominated their sites, it would remain finally with the Postmaster-General to decide whether he would accept either of them. Immediately we got that  advice from the Crown Solicitor we gave the company seven days to tell us what sites they were prepared to adopt in this area. Strange to say, the period expires to-day, but when I left the office about 2 o'clock we had received no reply from them. We have now done all that we can possibly do, and within a day or two they must submit to us the sites on which they are prepared to erect the station. When they do that, it will be for us to say whether we will accept either of the sites which they name, or demand that they shall put up the plant where Admiral Henderson has suggested. </para>

                            <para>- The Standing Orders lay down a definite rule to guide us in these matters, but there seems to be growing up a danger of a tendency to disregard them. If extra time is to be allowed in this manner to certain speakers, other honorable members who may wish to speak later may be deprived of the opportunity, because the debate itself has a time limit, and must close at 5 o'clock. If we have Standing Orders we should carry them out, and not continually break them. I hope that what is now happening will not be regarded as a precedent. If it is the desire of the House that the honorable member should proceed further, I have no choice in the matter. Is it the pleasure of the House that the Minister be granted a further extension of time? Honorable Members.  -  Hear, hear. </para>

                            <para>- I have absolutely no interest in the company, and do not know its members, except <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denison,</inline> whom I met as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hugh</inline> Dixson, when he was a member of the South Australian Legislature. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wheeler</inline> has met me once or twice also. To my mind some of the blame must necessarily, and I think fairly, be attached - I do not like to say to what Department, but I do not think it should be to the Postal Department, which appears to have done all it possibly could. The great hitch that has taken place has arisen through the military and naval authorities stating that a certain locality would do to put up the plant, and afterwards saying that it was necessary to go outside that locality. That, to my mind, has been the cause of the trouble and difficulty, because I take it that immediately you go outside a contract and specifications, proceeding with the work becomes a matter of arrangement. </para>

The introduction of wireless telegraphy to the Commonwealth has been most unfortunately delayed. It is now about four years since the Government of which I was Treasurer placed  £10.000  on the Estimates for the purpose. I think the same amount was provided in the next year, and in the following year it was omitted by another Treasurer. It now appears on the Estimates again, and still nothing whatever has been done. I should have liked the Postmaster-General to be more definite as to whether the company, which has had the contract since 4th April, has done anything </para>

                            <para>- They have not, I take it, got the money yet. It has only been promised. At a time . when wireless telegraphy is so necessary for the safety of people travelling on the sea, this great Commonwealth, having' entered into a contract with a company to complete the installation in twelve months, finds that, after the lapse of nine months, not even the sites for the erection of stations have been fixed. The Postmaster-General has not been able to tell us that a single penny has been expended by the company towards carrying out their contract. There ought to be in the contract a condition by which such a state of affairs could be brought to an end at once. The company must surely have defaulted. The contract cannot be so drawn that the Government cannot cancel it when the company have let nine months out of the twelve pass away without doing anything, lt is ridiculous to tell practical people like the members of this House that a site cannot be fixed at Fremantle or Sydney in one day, to say nothing of nine months. The whole place has been surveyed. Every hill is shown upon public maps, and the exact position of every place in relation to North or South Head, at Sydney, or Arthur's Head, at Fremantle, is known. There seems to have been a want of definite action in this matter, and I must blame the Government, because we can look to no one else. They have been six months in office, and why, during that time, have they allowed the company to go on without doing anything to carry out the contract, when every one is most anxious to have the system established? The neglect in this matter appears to have been almost criminal. Ships now go Home without wireless telegraphy, and after a week or two in London return fitted with it. There is no difficulty whatever in the operation, and no reason why the work we have asked for should not be done at once. I think, although it does not apply to the present case, that a mistake was made from the beginning in being afraid to go ahead from the fear that we might not adopt the best system. The officers used to tell the Minister that some other system better than the Marconi might come along, but that sort of argument should not have been allowed to weigh with us. I hope, and believe, that superior systems will always be discovered. What we have to do is to adopt the best known system, and to proceed with the work in the knowledge that improvements can be made from time to time. The Postmaster-General appeared to be somewhat reluctant to state whether the Government or the contractors themselves had refused to sign the contract, or whether, the contractors had been asked to sign it. It would be interesting to learn how the contract was brought about, but the point that we have now to consider is why, having been made, it has not been carried out. We are also entitled to further information as to the reason why the company were promised an additional  £2,000,  and I hope that that payment has not yet been made. The time has arrived when we should put an end to this contract. The company has defaulted. Nine months have elapsed since their tender was accepted, and although they were allowed only twelve months within which to carry out the work, they have not commenced operations. The matter is of great importance to the travelling public, whose lives are at stake, and I hold that the Postmaster-General should cancel this contract before another day has passed. It </para>

                        <para>. - I should have been glad had the Postmaster-General made a definite statement as to the intentions of the Government in regard to this important matter. Until today, it was merely a question of which Minister was to blame, if blame was to be apportioned to any one. The contract was one of those ordinary undertakings, the money for which is passed by Parliament, the details of the work being left entirely in the hands of a responsible Minister. After passing such an amount on the Estimates, the average member of Parliament knows little, if anything, of what subsequently transpires in regard to the work, unless something goes wrong, and leads, as in this case, to the matter coming before the House. This question has been brought before the House so prominently that we shall all be at fault if, in the future, there is any blame to apportion. In the event of the work not being carried out in a satisfactory manner, the blame will rest, not with any previous Ministry, or with the present Government, but with every honorable member, unless we now obtain from the Government a definite statement as to their intentions. I regret very much the remarks made by the honorable member for Swan, for they seemed to me to approach ingratitude. We heard from the. Postmaster- General a most elaborate support of, if not an apology for, what was done by the Ministry of which the right honorable member was a member. The ex-Postmaster-General entered into a contract with some alleged firm, which the honorable member now describes as defaulters, and as quite unable to carry out a work which it contracted with the Ministry of which he was a member, to perform. </para>

In that view the right honorable member for Swan might well have refrained from dealing with the party aspect of the question. </para>

                            <para>- I never fail to listen to the right honorable member. The blame, if there be any, in the first instance, attaches to a previous Ministry for entering into a contract with a company which, up to the present, apparently has not attempted to carry out that contract. If the Ministry have any proof that the company is likely to proceed at once with the work, then that information should be put before the House, otherwise honorable members generally will be to blame for the regrettable delay, and whatever mistakes have occurred. Up to the present, however, we have had no definite statement. The honorable member for Fremantle has made a certain charge, and the Postmaster-General has made an elaborate defence of the contract entered into by his predecessor in office, as well as a defence of his own action in supporting the contract to the extent of promising the contractors an additional£2,000, which, in view of the alteration of the sites, seems to be a reasonable allowance. </para>

                            <para>- That is of no concern to me, since I have not had an opportunity to get at the details. I cannot say whether the alteration of a particular site, or the necessity for different machinery caused by the alteration, would necessitate a doubling of the contract price or merely a 50 per cent, "addition to it. I presume that the officers who guided the Minister in this matter knew what they were doing in suggesting that an additional sum of£2,000 was not too much to promise the company. The point I wish to emphasize, however, is that we have no information as to whether the contract is to be carried out; and I think that the House would be justified in asking for that information in fairly clear and emphatic terms. We do not desire to continue for another ten months in a position of regrettable inactivity, so far as the establishment of wireless telegraph stations are concerned. </para>

                            <para>- I did not hear such a statement; but the House has a right to demand that if not to-day, at all events before we go into recess, there should be a clear intimation either that the contract has been cancelled, or that the company is about to carry it out. I have had some bitter experiences of allowing such important matters to be left undecided during a recess. I' am sure that the Minister is conscientiously attempting to do his duty, and that the ex-Postmaster-General considered that he was conscientiously carrying out his duty. All Ministers, strange to say, hold the same view with regard to every action that they do, yet many of them have failed. The fact remains that we have had nine months of unnecessary delay in proceeding with this necessary and important work, and we should be lacking in our duty if we failed to obtain some such information as that which I have urged should be forthcoming. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Fremantle is to be commended for having brought this matter forward, and for the industry he has shown in getting to the bottom of what appears to be a particularly filthy slough. I do not know that in my parliamentary experience I have met with a more deplorable case of bungling than that which the honorable member has revealed. The Postmaster-General has thrown but little light on the subject, although he is to be congratulated upon the way in which he defended, not only his Department, but his predecessor in office. I do not think that the honorable member for Fremantle intended to attack the Department. He simply put before the House certain information, and asked that it should be supplemented. The Postmaster-General, however, has not complied with that request. We have no satisfactory explanation of the reason why 50 per cent, on the original contract is to be paid to the contractors simply because a departure to the extent of a mile or two has been made from the site originally selected. </para>

                            <para>- That is one of the mysteries which the Postmaster-General has not elucidated. I do not know whether the company, the officials of the various Departments concerned, or the whole of them are to blame. There is no doubt, however, that a muddle has been perpetrated, and that it has been continued for over three years, with the result that we are no further ahead to-day than when  we started. It is absolutely necessary that more light should be thrown on this* subject, so that the blame may be rightly apportioned. Some person or persons are deserving of more than ordinary punishment for the way in which this business has been carried on. The company may be a perfectly <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> one, but it is obvious that its members are not wireless telegraphy experts. I should like to know whether any inquiry was made by the Department as to whether the company had a manager, supervisor, or engineer possessing the necessary technical skill to enable the contract to be carried out. I should like also to know why some arrangement was not made with the naval and military authorities, in regard to the site to be selected, before the company had the work put into its hands. Had such an understanding been arrived at the company could have been consulted, and within an hour or two a site could have been fixed se as to enable the work to be proceeded with. The people of Australia have been waiting anxiously for some years for the establishment of wireless telegraph stations and the opening up of a system of communication with oversea vessels. That is particularly the attitude of the people of Western Australia. Fremantle is the front door of the Commonwealth, so far as European trade is concerned, but at present we cannot communicate with vessels coming to or going from our shores unless they are within sight. I trust that the Minister will realize the urgency of this matter, and give us at the earliest date means of communication such as almost every other civilized country now enjoys. </para>

                            <para>- If it is not correct, the Admiralty should not have recommended the installation of the Telefunken system here. I recognise the need for establishing wireless telegraph stations, and, if the Telefunken system is as good or nearly as good as the Marconi system, I think that it should be adopted, because we do not wish to give the Marconi system a monopoly. It should be possible, however, to have communication between a vessel fitted with Marconi appliances and a Telefunken station. </para>

                        <para>.- The exhaustive statement of the Postmaster-General relieves me of the necessity for making a lengthy review of the circumstances under which this tender was accepted by me. I realized the importance of the experiment in wireless communication which Parliament sanctioned last year, and, after consultation with my colleagues, called for tenders for the installation of two stations. I was advised by my officers and the Imperial authorities that it would be a mistake for the Government to become the patron of any particular system. The fundamental conditions of the tenders were, therefore, these - </para>

It seems to me not to matter how these mysterious wireless communications are effected, so long as their transmission is effective, and there is inter-communicability. The Admiralty, recommended that we must have an installation able to communicate with its ships, with the royal mail steamers, and any other vessels fitted with wireless telegraph appliances. The date fixed for the closing of the tenders was  22nd  February, and only five were received. The lowest was from the Australian Wireless Telegraph Company Limited, of Sydney, the price being , £4,150. The next lowest price was £7,000 </para>

                            <para>- I am not at liberty to mention the names of the unsuccessful tenderers. The next lowest price was £7,777 ; the next above it,  £9,317  ; and the highest price,£19,020; which the Postmaster-General has stated was asked by the Marconi Company. I am not an expert in wireless telegraphy, and, therefore, had to depend on the best advice obtainable. Accordingly, I submitted the tenders to a Conference consisting of Captain Creswell, who represented the Defence Department, Lieutenant Cheeseman, who represented the Admiralty, being appointed by the Admiral of the Station, and the Chief Electrical Engineer of the Postmaster-General's Department. It reported that the lowest tender met all the requirements of the Admiralty in regard to naval and military signalling, and complied with all the conditions and specifications. What option, then, had I but to accept it? But I took one more step. With the concurrence of my colleagues, I had a communication sent through the Governor-General to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, informing him that the lowest tender for two wireless telegraph stations had been submitted by a company in Australia, which proposed to install the Telefunken system. I stated the price asked, and desired to be informed whether the Admiralty knew of any objection to the acceptance of the tender. Had any objection been urged, I should have hesitated about accepting the tender, but the cabled reply - which the Postmaster-General has just placed in my hand - was in these terms - </para>

                    <para class="block">Under these circumstances, a Postmaster-General would have acted very recklessly in accepting any but the lowest tender. The impression that the Telefunken system does not allow communication with our ships of war or other vessels on the high seas is wrong. The tender was accepted subject to its compliance with the conditions of the Radio-telegraphic Convention, according to which all systems, however they may differ in detail, must be capable of inter-communication between station and station and ship and ship. </para>

                            <para>- Not in the least. It is believed that the Sydney company put in a very low price to obtain the first contract, in the hope of thereby getting an advantage in being called upon to do other work of the same nature later ; but, when new installations are needed, I take it that fresh tenders will be called for, and the most suitable tender accepted on its merits. There is no understanding of any kind that the Telefunken system shall be adopted for future installations. </para>

                            <para>- No ; because inter-communicability would be insisted on. The Radio- telegraphic Convention established the understanding among Governments that no system of wireless telegraph should be accepted which did not permit of inter-communication. I am glad that the honorable member for Fremantle has given the Postmaster-General an opportunity to explain the circumstances under which a tender was accepted, and to make it plain to the House and to the country that every precaution was taken. Nothing that human skill could have suggested was omitted by the Department. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that matter presently. The Department was not responsible for the delay which ensued consequent upon an alteration of site. Both the Defence Department and the Admiralty had no objection to find, in the first instance, with a site between South Head and Botany Bay. So sure were the officers of the Departments that a site between those two points was the best, that I could hardly persuade them to give the option of a site on the North Head. The Admiralty undoubtedly offered no objection to the South Head site. </para>

No doubt a lamentable error has been made in this respect ; but the Postmaster-General, either past or present, or the Government, cannot be held responsible. I have no doubt that the officers representing the Admiralty did their best. They were not aware of any objection, though one would have thought that, if any one was aware, it would be the Admiral on the Australian Station. Why change of opinion has taken place, I cannot say. </para>

                        <para>.- The House cannot be too guarded or jealous in regard to innovations of this character which affect so seriously the future of Australia. I listened attentively to the case submitted by the honorable member for Fremantle, and to the history of the case, and the practical repetition thereof by the Postmaster-General, and the honorable member for Bendigo. The whole question seems to be why this company is able to claim ,£2,000, or 50 per cent, on the original tender. The claim seems to be based on the alteration of the site. </para>

The case of the Postmaster-General is weak, inasmuch as, while he says no tender has been signed, he contends that the contract has practically been accepted. Under the circumstances, we do not know the exact position ; and there ought to be some finality, no matter what company may be concerned. An important question like this should not be tossed from pillar to post in order to meet the interests of any company, no matter what position that company may occupy in the telegraph world. </para>

                            <para>- The blame rests with somebody; for, undoubtedly, there has been a bungle. We are told that probably the lawyers may have to be called in to settle the question ; and, if so, heaven knows what the cost may be, for,, in a dispute about a mysterious thing like- wireless telegraphy, there is a grand opening for legal expenses. </para>

                            <para>- The Postmaster-General tells us that there is practically a contract; and, if that be so, and the contractors do not fulfil the conditions, the Postmaster-General ought to cancel the contract. I hope nothing will be done until there has been further investigation by the Postal authorities. There seems to be a doubt as to whether the right thing has been done in regard to the new stations; and it would be unwise, without proper inquiry, to step into the unknown simply because some one seems to prefer a certain system to one already in existence. -The Postmaster-General must be gratified that the subject has been raised, and that he has been afforded an opportunity of making an explanation ; but I must confess that, at first, the matter appeared to me rather " fishy." </para>

                    <para class="block">That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                    <para>I feel it a very great honour and pleasure to have an opportunity to place a Bill of this kind before the House. The principles embodied have been extensively canvassed during the last two years, and have, one after the other, secured acceptance in the minds of an ever-increasing number of the electors of the Commonwealth, and of members of this House. I may be permitted to remind honorable members that, when the right "honorable member for Swan introduced a Defence Bill in 1903, I endeavoured to secure the incorporation of  an amendment which, in essentials, embodied a provision which is now in the Amended Defence Act of 1909, and outlined the vital principles of the proposals in the measure -I now have the honour to lay before the Chamber. I merely point this out in* order to show how completely public opinion, both in the House and out of it, has changed during a comparatively brief period We may, therefore, assume that we have the amplest authority for this measure, and that it is, in the best sense of the term, a non-party one. I am pleased to note how, as time has gone on, those difficulties which divided honorable members in this House have one by one disappeared. We have now arrived at a <inline font-style="italic">rapprochement,</inline> so that, although I cannot say that every member of the House, or every elector in the country, favours this measure, it may be said, however, that no other has such an overwhelming support. In a speech made by me in  D903,  I referred to the defects of conscription as existing in continental . countries on the one hand, and to the dangers of a standing army on the other, in the following terms - <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> 1903, page 3095 :- </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>There "conscription" necessarily involves compulsory military service of a character that is destructive alike to the welfare of the nation and of the individual. It means that for a period of from three to five years their young men - the flower of their nation - are exposed to a most rigorous and senseless system of routine, which crushes out individual initiative, and subjects them to galling indignities and insults. In very many cases it results in the breaking of their spirits, and, in others, even goads them to suicide in  their desire to escape from its thraldom. From every stand-point the effect of that system is a most damnable one. It takes an appreciable number of the wealth producers away from their ordinary avocations, and throws upon the remainder the burden of supporting mem. It also creates a military caste, an evil above all things to be avoided. In Australia recently there has been an unfortunate tendency - perhaps owing to the Boer war - to exalt the military ideal. The trappings of war, the gilt lace, and other embellishments which the Minister for Defence affects to despise, but for which in reality he entertains the greatest respect, the clanking sabre and the tinkling spurs, offer great attractions to the rising generation, who are imbued with the idea that war consists of walking down Bourke-street in a very smart uniform. They learn only when it is too late that there are other duties connected with military operations which are not of such an alluring character. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Seeing that we were at that time embodying in our legislation the principle of compulsory service, I asked that the House should agree to a system of compulsory training. It was proposed by the Government that in an emergency every man between the ages of eighteen and sixty might be called to the colours, and I asked that some training should be provided, so that those summoned to fight for their country, should be something more than an enthusiastic mob. At that time, however, the idea found little or no favour.  .1  think that there were, besides myself, only two who supported it. As years have gone on, circumstances have compelled the attention of the community to the matter, and effected a most notable change in public opinion. It is now realized that a citizen soldiery is the most effective means of guarding one's country, and at the same time upholding constitutional and democratic government, which can never be firmly established when overawed or in danger pf being overawed by the power of a standing army. </para>
                    <para>I come now to the 1909 amendment of the existing Defence Act, introduced by the ex-Minister of Defence, the honorable member for Parramatta. He, long an opponent of this principle, became last year an enthusiastic advocate of it, and introduced a measure providing for compulsory training - compulsory service having long been the law of the country. Honorable members now on this side of the House, who were members of the Parliament last year, had the honour to point out that compulsory training, as introduced by the honorable member for Parramatta, was accompanied by . certain grave and almost fatal defects. As I showed at the time, there is nothing about compulsion in itself desirable, and that compulsory training, unless effective, was bad. It is worse than voluntary training if it carries us no farther. </para>
                    <para>The present law provides for the compulsory training of junior cadets between the ages of twelve and fourteen, and senior cadets from fourteen to eighteen, lt then takes a young man .entering his nineteenth year, and for two years subjects him to sixteen days' training, which need not be continuous. There is no effective provision for continuous camp training, without which it is almost hopeless to expect to turn a man into a soldier. That defect was pointed out at the time, as was a defect, perhaps, even greater - that after you had made a man a soldier, if two years' training could do it, you turned him adrift. An impossible and almost ludicrous condition of things was thus created, under which, after having spent your money on cadet training for him between the ages of twelve and eighteen, and during his nineteenth and twentieth years in making him fit to be a soldier, you turned him out just when he might be able to defend his country, with no organization to which he could attach himself. He became ah unattached, floating unit. No organization, no method of utilizing his services, was provided. He simply came up. when called upon, for one muster parade a year. That is the existing law. </para>
                    <para>It is true that the law has never been put into operation. The Act has not been proclaimed, and to-day remains in suspense in regard to that matter. Last year the Ministry availed themselves of the services of Field-Marshal Lord Kitchener, who was asked to advise the Ministry as to what needed to be done to defend Australia. He did this in his customary efficient and thoroughgoing fashion, and his report sets forth what is necessary in order to enable this country to be adequately defended. It is upon his recommendations that the Government have, to a large extent, framed this measure. The present forces consist of about 25,000 more or less trained men, scattered over the whole of this great continent. They have to defend the fixed fortresses, to form nuclei here and there for garrison and other duties, and to be available, should occasion arise, to be taken hither and thither to meet invasion. Such a force is numerically and in every other way unsuited to cope with a task of that magnitude, and has been uniformly admitted by every Minister of Defence for many years past to be most unsatisfactory, not from lack of - courage or efficiency to the extent to which it went, but from lack of numbers and equipment. Lord Kitchener gave the <inline font-style="italic">imprimatur</inline> of a soldier to the opinions of the civilians in this matter, when he said in Lis report, in paragraph 9 of his introductory remarks - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The conclusion I have come to is, shortly, that the present forces are inadequate in numbers, training, organization, and munitions of war, to defend Australia from the dangers that are due to the present conditions that prevail 5n the country, as well as to its isolated position. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">There we get a clear condemnation of the present system from the man who has had almost as wide an experience of actual war as any English soldier now living. He sets forth what he conceives to be the essential features of a satisfactory force. He declares that, first of all, there must be sufficient training; secondly, that this training must extend over a sufficient period of time ; thirdly, that a means must be devised whereby non-commissioned and commissioned officers can be trained; and, lastly, that there must be a means whereby that instruction can be applied to the Citizen Forces. To that end he recommends that Australia shall be divided into 215 areas. To each of these areas an officer is attached. There are to be instructional schools in which men are to be trained to be non-commissioned officers. There is to be a military college where men are to be trained from their youth upwards to become officers. Lord Kitchener points out, as is obvious to any civilian of us all, that an officer cannot be made in a day. He says it is of no use to have an officer unless he joins for a period of not less than twelve years. He must be taken as a youth and trained, and then he can be utilized. It is proposed to officer our Citizen Force by Australians trained in the Australian Military College. It has been decided to establish the college in a particular locality, and provision is to be made there for the most effective and up-to-date tuition of our Australian youths for the serious business of defending their native country. Lord Kitchener reported that, in estimating the strength of the land forces necessary to meet our requirements, the three principal factors that should be considered were - </para>

                    <para class="block">It is necessary to defend our vast continent with the material at our hands, and Lord Kitchener states that not less than 80,000 fighting men are required for the purpose. Under the existing system we have 25,000, and they are inadequately armed, trained, and organized. The ex- Minister of Defence, speaking of the possibilities of mobilization, said that the existing system would inevitably break down, and the same statement was made by his predecessor in office, the present Minister of Defence, and also by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing when he held that office. There can be no question as to the inadequacy of the present system, and we have now merely to consider what is to be put in its place. We have to remember that in quoting the opinions of Lord Kitchener we are quoting those of a practical man asked to give information about a matter that he understands as well as does any man living. He tells us that we require 80,000 fighting men, and, taking the Defence Act as his basis in constructing a scheme, he makes certain recommendations which, to a very large extent, have been embodied in this measure. I can the more readily ask the House to indorse those recommendations, because, speaking for myself, at all events, they are in accordance with views which, as a humble civilian, I have endeavoured times out of number to induce the House to adopt. None of them go far beyond the proposals that were made by the Fisher Ministry, which preceded the late Government. Dealing with the law, as amended by the Act of 1909, which provides that all male inhabitants shall be liable to be trained, from twelve years to fourteen years of age in the junior cadets, from' fourteen to eighteen years of age in the senior cadets, and from eighteen to twenty years of age in the Citizen Forces, Lord Kitchener reported - </para>

                        <para>While the cadet training is valuable as a preparation, it cannot, in my opinion, replace recruit training,' which is a necessary preliminary to the production of an efficient and trained citizen soldiery. For this reason, I class the 18-19-year men as recruits, over and above the peace establishment of 80,000 men, but liable to be put in the ranks in war. </para>

The experience of those connected with schools is that up to the age of fourteen a boy learns little and retains less, and it would be of no service to the lads were this training continued until they reach the age of eighteen years. But lads between the ages of fourteen and eighteen years are to form Senior Cadet Corps, which will have four whole-day, twelve half-day, and twenty-four night drills in the rear. I ask those who know what drilling means whether young men so trained will receive the equivalent of what is known as recruit drill? Certainly, they will not. </para>

If it is to be with school boys, I venture to say the danger cannot be very real or imminent. If it is to be with men who have just completed this amount of training, then it is to be with volunteers, and, by the honorable gentleman's own hypothesis, volunteers are useless, because his contention is that the volunteer system has broken down. </para>

                    <para class="block">It was the opinion of our party at that time that the proposal put forward by the then Minister of Defence stopped short just at the point- at which we should be beginning- to make soldiers of our men. Between the ages of eighteen and nineteen years a youth would be given recruit drill, and from nineteen to twenty years of age he would begin to realize that he was a soldier, as it were, in contradistinction to the ordinary enthusiastic citizen. But when we had brought him with infinite difficulty to that point, we said to him, under the existing law, '« That will do, old fellow. When the whistle blows or the banner waves, you will attend a muster parade if you do not feel well enough to join the militia." From what we know of our fellow-citizens, however, we may be sure that they would attend the muster parades, and leave the volunteer system to itself. The quotations I have made show that the conclusion which Lord Kitchener formed in this regard was perfectly plain, even to a civilian- that when you get your soldier - and you can only get him after recruit training - you should keep him, and fight your battles with, men between the ages of nineteen and twenty-six years. In the course of the speech to which I have just referred, I made the further statement, as reported on page 4469, that - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>After putting his men through various stages of training from the age of fourteen to the age of twenty years, and making them the material out of which soldiers can be made - for that is all that will have been done - they will not be available to fight if required to do so, because organization would be necessary, and no such organization is provided for in the Government scheme. The period of training should extend to the age of twenty-six years. The length of the period of training for those who are eighteen or nineteen years of age should be not less than sixteen days for two successive years. </para>
                        <para class="block">This party is completely in accord . with the principles for which this measure provides. We advocated them when in Opposition, and crossing the Rubicon has not altered our opinion. That -is a matter for congratulation, and although not unique in the history of Governments, it is still not so common but that one may make a note of it. </para>
                        <para>We come now to the provisions of the Bill, and I invite honorable members to obtain copies of the measure showing in black type the alterations made in the principal Act. We propose, first of all, that eight of the sixteen days' training per annum shall be spent continuously in camp, and that that training shall be undertaken from the ages of eighteen years to twenty-five years, instead of from eighteen to twenty years, as provided in the measure passed last session. In other words, we shall have seven years of continuous training instead of two, and those between the ages of twenty-five and twenty-six years must attend a muster parade. Under this system we shall secure a body of men who have been trained in some fashion from the ages of twelve years to twenty-six years, and who have been seriously trained as soldiers from the ages of eighteen years to twenty-six years. At the age of nineteen years they will have passed out of the recruit stage, and we shall thus have a body of  80,000  fighting men fitted both by training and by age to defend the country. I come now to the proposal to divide the Commonwealth into areas, and to the duties of area officers. These are very important. The area officers must have a thorough knowledge of all that goes to make up the art of military science. Lord Kitchener lays considerable stress on the necessity for obtaining for this work the best possible men. I do not hesitate to say that just as an educational system, no matter how admirable it may be, must depend for its success upon the capacity of its teachers, so we shall be unable to secure an effective system of defence unless we have as officers men who command the respect of those under them by virtue of the possession of the intellectual, moral, and physical qualities necessary to make a successful soldier. Lord Kitchener details as follows the work which the area officers will have to perform - </para>

                    <para class="block">We shall thus require nearly  300  of these officers, and upon their calibre the success of our future Defence Forces will largely rest. These are to be permanent officers, but it has been found impossible up to the present time to obtain a sufficient supply. Temporary appointments have, therefore, been made of men who will hold office until we shall have been able to train, by means of the Military College, a sufficient number to take their places. We desire to have our Forces officered by Australians, who have been trained in a College which it is the laudable ambition of the Minister of Defence shall not be less effective than is West Point, in the United States of America. The officer will undergo twelve years of training, so that he will be in quite a different position from the citizen soldier! If, however, he leaves before his period of training is finished, he will have to serve  his term as a citizen soldier as if he had never had training as an officer. The Government will spend a great deal of money in training officers, and it is only by a provision of this kind that it can enforce the contracts which it makes with them. Lord Kitchener recommended the charging of a fee of <inline font-style="italic">£80</inline> to each cadet entering the college, but we have decided that to do so would be to violate the principle of the measure, which is that promotion shall be from the ranks, and irrespective of social position. Therefore, no payment of any kind will be required. The college is to be open to all, and cadets, rich or poor, will be treated alike. Grants will be made to assist every brilliant and capable youth, no matter how poor. We wish to abolish class distinctions which have created caste distinctions. Hitherto, men have been prevented from becoming officers because of the mess charges and the cost of uniforms. The Government propose to supply all uniforms, from the rank of private to that of generalissimo. I strongly emphasize the fact that all promotions are to be from the ranks. </para>

                            <para>- All are to be from the ranks in the Citizen Forces. That is the principle of the measure. A commission in the Senior Cadet Corps, or any other corps, cannot be obtained except by those who have been in the ranks, or who have gone through the Military College, and no one can become an officer without passing examinations. These conditions, however, will not obtain until after a given period has elapsed, because, at present, we have not a sufficient supply of officers. The alterations proposed in the period of training amount to this : That whereas now sixteen days' training is provided for, without any provision as to how much must be continuous, we propose that there shall be eight days' continuous training in camp for the infantry, and seventeen days for the engineering, artillery, and other technical branches of the service. Those provisions will apply to the training of. all who are between their eighteenth and twenty-fifth years. To the usual exemptions, we propose to add the medically unfit, members and officers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth and of the Parliaments of the States, the Justices of the Federal and the State Courts, police and stipendiary magistrates, those employed in the police and prison services and in light houses, medical practitioners and nurses, persons who are not substantially of European descent, persons who have satisfied the prescribed authority that their conscientious beliefs do not permit them to bear arms, and persons engaged in any employment specified by the regulations or by proclamation. Exemption on the ground of religious scruples will not apply to training and service in the non-combatant branches. A person who has conscientious objections to war will be exempt from service in the field, but he will not be exempt from training and service in connexion with the medical or commissariat branches, or other duties of a non-combatant character. A number of petitions have been received from estimable citizens who have conscientious scruples to the bearing of arms, and with them I have every sympathy. But there is no logical reason why such scruples should not extend to other duties of citizenship. We know that many object to vaccination, and, in England, the nonconformists have resorted to what is known as passive resistance in giving effect to their objections to the provisions of the Education Act. </para>

                            <para>- We cannot allow such scruples to stand in the way of the clearly expressed determination of the majority that the duties necessary for the salvation of the nation shall be performed by its citizens, and, although we may exempt from the actual bearing of arms those who have religious scruples against engaging in warfare, we cannot exempt them from such duties as stretcher bearing, kitchen work, sanitation, and the like. But objection to training and military service are, in most cases, illogical. I see no difference between a man staying at home and baking bread which goes to feed an army and attending an army in the field to bake its bread, nor do I see any difference between the performing of occupations assisting noncombatants, without whom an army could not be kept in the field for twenty-four hours, and actually feeding an army in the field. Nor is there any real difference between feeding the fighting line and actually fighting there. It is proposed to amend the Bill to exempt students of educational and theological colleges. We take power to establish places for the breeding of horses, an ample supply of which is essential. We ' also take power to  exempt areas from the operation of the law. They are not irrevocably exempt, but are exempt as occasion may arise, owing to their isolated position, or some special circumstances. But the ideal is to enable every person throughout Australia to have an opportunity - and I put this forward as a privilege rather than anything else - of being trained, and so made, both mentally and physically, in every way more fitted to carry out his duties as a citizen. It is proposed to bring this Bill into operation by proclamation by ist January,  1911.  It is not proposed that the eighteen-year men shall come in this year, but that they shall begin to come in from July,  1912.  The training of the Cadets, however, will start from June of next year. The House is not asked to affirm the principle of compulsory service, because that has long been the law ; nor is it asked to affirm the principle of compulsory training, which has been the law for more than twelve months ; it is. merely asked to give effect to principles already sanctioned by the overwhelming majority of the last and other Parliaments, to give effect to recommendations submitted at the request of the late Government, by one of the first soldiers of the British Empire, after close investigation of the conditions and special circumstances of Australia. Those recommendations, in themselves, so far from being repugnant to this Government, are, the major portion of them, recommendations to which we were committed when in Opposition over twelve months ago. We, on this. side, therefore, are asked to affirm nothing to which we are not already committed ; and honorable members opposite are asked to do no more than to affirm the recommendation of that distinguished man who was asked by the late Government to make his investigations and report. </para>

                            <para>- I understood that to be the arrangement; and I was going to refer to the serious omission of the Minister in not dealing with the Naval Defence Bill, which 1 regard as the more important of the two. However, as the Minister requires us to discuss only the Bill relating to Military Defence, I shall proceed to do so. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>I confess to a certain amount of pleasure in regard to some of the clauses  and principles involved, and to considerable regret at some omissions. If honorable members examine the Bill closely, they will find that a good deal of care has been taken to insure that the Forces to be created in the future shall be efficient ; but that absolutely no attention has been paid to compelling efficiency in the existing Forces as they must be for some years. If we, for instance, cast an eye over the provisions relating to the efficiency of officers - which is one of the most important considerations we could possibly concern ourselves with in defence organization - we see what I cannot but regard as a serious omission. After all, the creation of brain takes far longer than the mere training of muscle. The creation of the brains of the Defence Forces is to be carefully safeguarded ten years hence by amendments which make it very clear that, so far as future officers are concerned, no promotions will be made until a certificate is obtained from the proper authority. I confess to a certain feeling of pleasure in regard to these clauses, because they are word for word as I myself drafted them in the last Parliament, with the wise exception that, now  we are to have a General Staff, that is regarded as the proper body to deal with promotions, and not, as I proposed in the last Parliament, the Director, as he was called in the Bill of that time, of the Military College, which I hoped to have made a sort of training Aldershot. These clauses, to my mind,  will be quite inadequate for the real needs of the Defence Forces, unless we have some guarantee that existing officers above the rank of major will prove their practical fitness for their present command within a reasonable time. </para><para>There is all due provision with regard to officers to be promoted above the rank of major, but what guarantee have we that those who now occupy the highest positions are fit for those positions, and are not keeping out fitter men ? In Committee, I propose to move an amendment - and I hope the Government will accept it, seeing that honorable members opposite supported a similar proposal in the last Parliament - guaranteeing that existing officers shall, within a reasonable time, prove their fitness in practical work - not in mere theoretical examination - for their present commands. </para><para>One of the troubles we have in considering defence problems in a House such as this is the difficulty in obtaining proper information from the Department. I do not think that Ministers realize, occasionally, the nature of the replies they give to honorable members who are seeking information. The other day, for instance, I asked the Minister representing the Minister of Defence what provision was made in the Imperial Forces, and in our Forces, to insure officers being medically fit to undertake the arduous duties of active service? I was given a reply with regard to the Imperial Service, which I have no hesitation in characterizing as, if not a falsehood, at any rate, a very impudent evasion of the truth. I do not, of course, charge the Minister with being cognisant of the fact; because, I suppose, he must take the reply that is given to him on a technical subject and hand it on to the Chamber. The reply given to me was that in the Imperial Service officers are examined for their medical fitness before active service commences. Now that statement, unless widely amplified, is absolutely false; for in addition to that examination, every officer, once every year, is tested in that regard ; and that practice has gone on ever since the Boer war,  when the unpreparedness, in physical respects, of certain officers led to difficulties in the conduct of the campaign. The system in vogue - which is one, perhaps, an ordinary member of Parliament might not be expected to unravel - is one of a confidential report from the regimental commander to the War Office once every year on a number of subjects, including physical fitness. </para><continue>

                            <para>- At any rate, that was the reply given to me in this Chamber. But the facts are diametrically opposed to the statement, and the House is very much trammelled when an honest desire to obtain information for the benefit of the community is thus shelved. If, as I should be very sorry to suggest, the Minister himself were guilty of such a practice, I can only offer my profound apologies to the Defence Department ; but I do not expect that, on technical questions, the Minister himself frames his replies. The reply given to me proves, either that the . officers who furnished it know nothing or very little of what goes on in the Imperial Service, or that, knowing what they should know, they denied the truth to a member of. this House. </para>

He looks serious; but it is very difficult occasionally to know whether he is in deadly earnest or merely indulging in a little idle persiflage.

                            <para>- I profess absolutely no opinion. It would not be fair for me, in a Chamber of this character, to pass any reflections on our officers, either individually or collectively. I have always endeavoured to avoid that proposition, but I think we should insist on the medical, as " well as the military, fitness of every officer i on the active list of the Commonwealth Forces. I sincerely hope that in the future provision will be made in that regard. </para>

After all, it would involve more labour than would be justified to apply that system to the rank and file of our Forces.

From a Ministerial explanation, given some time ago, it would seem that the Government do not propose to go much further than the mere training, on farms acquired for that purpose, of the horses required for the existing establishment. That is very good in its way ; but it does not go far enough. In time of war, the Australian Forces might be almost indefinitely increased, and the horses provided under such a system as that initiated by the Minister would certainly not be nearly sufficient to meet the expansion. </para><para>Let us look at the Defence problem from this point of view : Primarily, the land defence of Australia is, and always has been, approached by the Commonwealth on the assumption that the Empire's Naval Force will be sufficient to maintain the general command of the seas, and so save Australia from any greater risks than attacks by raiding expeditions. It is, however, possible to conceive of a temporary difficulty in which the Empire's Naval Force would have to be concentrated in European waters against the strongest section of the allied Fleets of the enemy. In those circumstances, if the combination of enemies included Japan, the command of the Pacific would pass for the time being, until the real crisis of the war was decided in Europe, into the hands of the Oriental power ; and Australia, for that period only, would have her back fairly and squarely to the wall. Every effort would, perhaps, have to be put forth by every Australian for the land defence of his country at that time. I say " perhaps," because I do not think that, even in those circumstances, one of the allied Powers in the East would worry much about attacking Australia until the main issue of the war had been decided. We must credit our enemies with a reasonable percentage of acumen ; and no Power in the East would be so foolish as divert his power from his main objective to attack what is, after all, a mere appanage, in a military sense, of the Empire, until the heart of the Empire's naval power had been destroyed'. But let us assume that an Eastern enemy were to refrain from adding her naval strength to that of the Empire's enemies in Europe- </para><continue>

If you, sir, deny me the right to discuss that proposition, I can only bow to your decision ; but I deeply regret that 1 have no power, when a Defence Bill is before the Chamber, to discuss the issues which it is essential for the Australian Legislature to consider in the sound interests of Australian defence. </para>

I do not think the contingency is sufficiently urgent to make it necessary for Australia to maintain, in times of peace, so extensive an organization as would be  required to cope with, such an onslaught ; but I unhesitatingly say that, as regards a question like horse-breeding, we ought to take steps, when we can do without more than trifling expense to the Commonwealth, to guarantee the breeding of a class of horses in Australia suitable for military purposes, and sufficient in numbers for all our probable requirements. </para><para>In Germany, the Government own stal-lions which they let out to approved mares, on condition that the progeny, if required by the War Department shall be acquired for military purposes at a fixed figure. The farmer knows what he is doing, the Department know what they are doing, and the result, generally speaking, is an increase in the military efficiency of the yearly supply of horses in the German Empire. That practice has been in vogue in Germany for a considerable time; and the results have proved infinitely more than worth the comparatively slight cost of the experiment. I say " comparatively slight," because the cost, although big in the German Budget, would be proportionately very small in the Commonwealth in comparison with our whole expenditure. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- The method I am describing obtains, certainly, in Germany, and also, I think, in Austria. The provision of a large supply of horses suitable for military requirements would have more than a defence value to Australia. If horse-breeding in Australia were to take such a direction as I have indicated, a very handsome profit would be returned to those engaged in rural pursuits. I do not see why Australia should not become eventually the horse emporium for the Military Forces of the Empire. The matter is worthy of the attention of the Australian people. </para>

                            <para>- The difficulty connected with horse-breeding in the MacDonnell Ranges country would be that of keeping the horses under sufficient supervision, because it would take a considerable number of acres to carry one horse. For training horses on the alleged Arabian system of allowing them to . run wild in the desert, certain sections of the MacDonnell Ranges country would, however, be eminently suitable. In good seasons, horses would live there, but God help them in bad seasons. Still, it is good, limestone country, where horses of a rather effective type could be reared. In Germany, they have a system of numbering similar to that followed in the breeding of race-horses. They know that such-and-such a breed of horse may well be put with such-and-such a mare, and the directors of the breeding establishment understand thoroughly what is required in order to produce horses for artillery, transport, cavalry, and other purposes. They know definitely what they are likely to obtain by crossing certain types of horses, and the result is that Germany now has a number of horses sufficient to meet the indefinite expansion that would be required by a great European war. I should like to see Australia, both for purposes of defence and for purposes of commerce, directing her attention to this question of breeding horses suitable for the military purposes of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- So far as I can ascertain, the only important difference between this measure and that which it is designed to amend lies in the fact that the Government are proposing to increase somewhat materially the duration of training of the rank and file of the Citizen Forces. I am personally very glad that such a proposal is made ; but I cannot help contrasting this advertisement of the Government's anxiety to provide a better defence for Australia with their extraordinary inertia in regard to the efficiency of the officers of the Commonwealth Forces. I was pointing out, before the dinner adjournment, that the blot upon this and the Defence Act of 1909 is that absolutely no precaution is taken to guarantee the existing officers of the Commonwealth Forces being really up to the most moderate military standard. In the citizen armies of other countries, like that of Norway - and I speak from memory, because this Bill has been rushed upon the House in a way that has made it impossible for me to obtain the figures- </para>

I challenge the honorable member to point to an instance where, as in this case, on the second reading of an important Bill being moved, the ex-administrator of the Department to which it re-relates has been refused an adjournment over one day to enable him to consider the speech made in submitting it. This conduct on the part of the Government cannot help us in transacting our duty in this Chamber. We cannot be expected to have at hand the details of our researches when this practice is indulged in by those who happen to be in temporary command of power. </para>

What are those powers that the Minister reserves to himself for the governance of the Department on some future occasion? Unless this House is to completely lose its -usefulness, it is entitled to know what use the Government propose to make of the powers of prescription which so lavishly decorate the Bill. </para>

There has been put into the more perfect English of the Ministry a provision dealing with persons who shall be exempt from military service. The language of the principal Act was unsatisfactory, or possibly not on the basis that would appeal to the most  earnest students of English grammar ! It has been revised by the Leader of the Government. A new series of clauses, making up perhaps the bulk of the measure, puts into different words the provisions of the Act. There are many omissions from the Bill, with some of which I have dealt, but, so far as the amendments are concerned, my honorable friends have merely exercised their ability to improve the verbiage and the grammar of that very effete measure which we are now tearing into the smallest of pieces ! No provision is made for a sufficient supply of area officers during the period which must elapse before we can train our own. Power should have been taken to obtain from wherever desirable officers competent to act as area officers while our own officers are being trained, and thus to initiate the sound home training, the need for which was so strongly emphasized by Lord Kitchener. Unless a sufficient number of area officers is provided at once, the Teal initiation of the Defence scheme must be deferred for years ; it cannot start right away, though the popular impression is that it will do so. </para><interjection>

I would send an officer or two to see the manoeuvres in France, Germany, America, and, lastly, in Great Britain ; because that country has lagged behind in aeronautics. I would give such officers a roving commission, instructing them to inform us, who are in the backwater of the river of scientific progress, of what is new, and to tell us what has passed from the experimental to the practical stage. The money spent on their salaries and travelling expenses would, perhaps, be among the most useful expenditure we could make on defence. </para><para>When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing was Minister of Defence, I made a suggestion that was not favorably received by him, though I think its adoption would economize the expenditure on the Permanent Forces, which are composed chiefly of the artillerymen who garrison our forts. My inquiries some years ago led me to believe that we could easily obtain the cooperation of the States in this matter, my suggestion being that it should be made a <inline font-style="italic">sine qua non</inline> to the appointment of the police that a man had served three years in the Permanent Artillery. There are - again I am compelled to speak from memory - about 3,000 police in Australia.  Only a small part of that number would be required for garrison work-, and the bulk could be enlisted as reservists. I have been informed by experts that in three years an officer can sufficiently train an artilleryman, who there after would always be capable of first-class work with very short periods of training. At present we have not even first reliefs for our gun defences, and the adoption of my proposal would make ample provision for the waste of war. Without some provision of that kind I doubt if it is worth while to increase the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> very materially, because the money which would be required for the upkeep of the extra men is needed for other services. We shall have starved the other services to provide relief for the harbor defences, which may, after all, never be attacked, because any serious attack is as likely to be by land. But the system ought to be used in order to -create available and competent reserves for garrison artillery work, because we shall require the reserves if the forts are ever attacked, and by this means we shall acquire them practically without expense. </para><para>When I spoke of economizing in the garrison defence vote I did not mean cutting down the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the existing force, but the giving of better service for the same money.  The <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> we already have is too small ; and I should be the last to suggest utilizing such a proposal in order to keep fewer permanent men. We must have, at least, our first relief permanently in occupation of these places. </para><para>This leads me to another consideration of first importance, namely, administering the Defence Department so that we may, as  far as possible, defend those places only that can be garrisoned conveniently by Citizen Forces in conjunction with the garrison artillery.

My only regret is that his action in forcing the measure on has prevented the ex- Minister of Defence from having reasonable time - and I call one evening reasonable - to consider the honorable gentleman's introductory explanation. It is unexampled that a Bill of this character should thus be forced through ; but, of course, we can do no more than enter our protest. The Bill when analyzed as closely as I have been able, seems to give no excuse for all this vaunting on the part of the Minister with reference to its possibilities. I can see what are mainly verbal amendments; for instance, a desirable increase in the training of the rank and file. But I see no provision for training existing officers, and no guarantee for the training in the immediate future, on a sane and sound basis, of the rank and file of the Citizen Forces. </para><para>I sincerely hope the Government will never again take advantage of their arbitrary position to prevent Oppositionists exercising what, after all, is not only the privilege but the duty of closely criticising all Government measures. </para></speech>

                        <para>. - I have listened to the Acting Prime Minister introduce Bills in a way which has made me feel as volatile as a fairy ; but there are aspects of this Bill which depress me as much as a big meal of roast pork and plum pudding on a hot day. I fully expected the Opposition to take objection to many of what I consider the salient points of the Bill, but they have not done so, and I can only come to the conclusion that, had they dared, they would have gone as far as this Government has gone in extending the age of training. I should like to draw attention to the ill-effects this extension will have on the working section of the community, if great care is not exercised in the administration of the measure. The age fixed in the Act was one I entirely agreed with ; indeed, I might have consented to a slight extension. For instance, no one can take exception to the age fixed for the training of junior and senior cadets ; but the Government, in their wisdom, have extended the age in the case of the Citizen Forces to twenty-five years. This, I repeat, must, in my opinion, have ill-effects on mechanics, and, indeed, on all the wage-earners of the community. The Bill provides that the Citizen Forces shall give no less than eight days' training per annum in camp; but, as a matter of fact, if the Minister of the day thinks fit, he can make the training extend over sixteen days. I see that the engineers and artillery are really to be trained for seventeen days; and I ask what is likely to be the result on the wage-earning section? A contractor for a building has to employ carpenters, plumbers, plasterers, stonemasons, bricklayers, labourers, and men in various occupations ; and I venture to say that if he knows that a man has to be called out for training, that man will not be engaged. When a building contract is approaching completion the men are dispensed with by degrees. A workman towards the finish very often has an opportunity of getting work elsewhere which would last six or seven weeks, but he dare not leave his present employer, knowing that, if he does so, he will not be engaged by him again. Contractors, like other business men, are out for profit ; and the Government ought to see that regulations are made to meet such cases as I have indicated. This Bill will affect every trade followed in the community ; and care should be taken that men liable to be called out for training do not lose their means of livelihood. Employers, of course, will not openly decline to employ men so liable; but I know of cases, even under our present militia system, in which men have been " sacked, " because they insisted on attending the Easter camp. In every State, men in the Public Service have been refused leave to go rifle shooting or into camp, and even in the Defence Department of the Commonwealth itself employes have been refused leave for similar training. How can we expect private employers to stretch a point when we have such conduct on the part of the Government? Only about a fortnight ago a warder was discharged in Western Australia because he insisted on. going to camp ; and I am afraid that this Bill may have the effect of causing men to lose two months' work in the busiest portion of the year. Of course, if the Government, and those behind them, are prepared to take such consequences smilingly, I suppose I must do the same; but. I earnestly ask the Government to seriously consider this aspect of the case. If the age were extended to twenty-two or twenty-three the effects might not be so baneful ; but there are many men of twenty-five with family and other responsibilities. It is hard enough to make a living in the industrial world now without placing more obstacles in the way. I hope that the strictest regulations will be made, imposing a heavy penalty on employers who endeavour to interfere in any way with men who have to undergo this training. </para>

Another important consideration is that represented by the provision in clause  19 - </para>

                    <para class="block">In no army in- the world is the ranker prevented from getting a commission. He mav be looked down upon in the British Army, and by a large section of the so-called gentleman officers. I know he is nearly always ostracized, but even the Conservative British Government do not prevent him from getting a commission. In America and in Germany he is encouraged to rise from the ranks, and yet in Democratic Australia we are introducing a provision which prevents a man, after five years, ever being able to become* a commissioned officer from the rank and file. </para>

Last year the honorable member for Maranoa, who has had military experience in the British Army, secured the inclusion in the amending Defence Act of a provision allowing all grades of the rank and file of the military service to secure clerkships in all branches of the Defence Department, with the exception of the Central Administration. That provision - sub-section 3 of section 63 - is as follows : - </para>

                    <para class="block">This Bill proposes to alter that by omitting the words "central staff," and inserting the following words: - "Clerical staff of the Central Administration, Pay, and Ordnance Brandies." That will mean that no military man no matter how able, will be allowed to secure a position in those branches of the Defence Department. Some of the smartest military clerks have come from the ranks, and the British Army authorities encourage the system. Many men who enlist in the rank and file in Great Britain have had College or University educations, and are fitted to hold any of these positions. We can have the same thing in Australia, and yet, after giving the system a trial for less than twelve months, we propose to stipulate that these appointments can be obtained only by those in the Civil Service. Every position possible in the Defence Department should be held by men who are under a discipline Act. I would not care so much about the pay branch, although there are many positions even in that which military men are fit to hold ; but, in all the other branches, positions that ought to be held by military men are being handed over to men in the Civil Service. However, I suppose it is useless for me to suggest an amendment ; but the Minister ought seriously to consider the question. I have known gunners in the British Artillery who showed aptitude for office work to obtain the brevet rank of sergeant, and be placed in the office, where they did credit to themselves and to the army. We have able men who have been in the Military Force for ten, fifteen, or twenty years ; and yet they are to be utterly blocked from appointments in this direction. I trust that we shall get a thoroughly efficient rifle for arming our Defence Force. The weapon at present in use is obsolete and useless in comparison with the rifle used by continental nations. In answer to questions during the session, I have been told that the Defence Department are waiting for the British authorities to fix upon a good serviceable rifle, with automatic action. Our weapon is ineffective, because we cannot use as high explosive power in it as in the case of the continental rifle; and the trajectory is too high. I suppose the' matter is receiving consideration; but I hope the Department will not delay too long. Great Britain has never yet been prepared for a war. She has often blundered through to victory; but I do not think we ought to leave ourselves in that position ; and if the British authorities take too long to make up their minds in getting a perfect rifle, we ought not to be too proud to adopt one of the continental rifles on our own account. I lament the extension of the period for training to as high an age as twenty-five years; because it will have a baneful effect upon the wage-earning section of the community. </para>

                        <para>.- I have listened with a great deal of interest to the various speeches delivered by honorable members, but it strikes me as a tragic paradox that, whilst the nations of the world are desiring peace, we in sunny Australia should be practically following in the footsteps of those nations by building up a heavy military expenditure. The nations of Europe, in 1906, spent no less a sum than £266,202,845 on their armies and navies. They took men away from their work whose earnings, taking the weekly average at £1 per week, would have represented for the same year a sum of £232,829,800, giving a total of over £500,000,000 expended in preparations for war, or against aggression. It seems strange to me that, instead of endeavouring to follow the example of nations which ave trying to reduce their armaments, we should be practically forced to accept the inevitable and to prepare to defend our country. I do not support the principle of compulsory military training from choice. I have already done my share of compulsory training; and so it is not with any idea of escaping inconvenience that I express my great regret that I have to support the principle. We have, in Australia, a great country, with an area of 2,948,366 square miles. We have a coastline of 12,110 miles, and yet, in that enormous tract of country, we have a population of only 4,275,000 souls, of whom 1,295,000 are males of a fighting age. </para>

                            <para>- We believe in immigration of the right sort when we have looked, after our own people. I am not so much afraid of the white races, but I recognise that we have placed on our statute-book measures that must create in the minds of coloured races not many miles distant from Australia a feeling of bitter resentment. We have adopted the policy of a White Australia, and have prohibited the introduction of Asiatics. In olden days, when Great Britain was refused an opportunity to trade with any Asiatic country, it forced trade with it at the point of the bayonet, and there will come a time when these races, awakened as they undoubtedly will be to their potentialities, will do the same. Japan has already defeated one white race, and she is now in Manchuria, and also in China, awakening the Chinese. It was all very well for the Consul for China to say that the Chinese are a peace-loving people, and that they are simply going in for a policy of education ; but we have to remember that the Consul-General for Japan stated the other day that, whilst tens of thousands of our young men attended football matches, the people of his country were engaged in training. That was a very menacing statement, and it is for these reasons that I think that :the time has arrived when we should adopt :the system of compulsory military training: In war time, might is the only right that is recognised. Our volunteer system [has been in operation for a great number of years, and I have no hesitation in saying that it has absolutely failed. Recruiting in Great Britain has fallen away to such an extent that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hal'dane</inline> has been compelled to introduce his territorial system. In dealing with the question, Lord Roberts stated that, in order to be effective, training in the Territorial Army must, first «of all, be adequate ; secondly, that it must be compulsory for all able-bodied youths of military age; and, thirdly, that it must take place before, and not after, the outbreak of war. That is the position in Australia to-day. The training must be effective  and it cannot be effective under a -volunteer system ; secondly, it must be compulsory, as it will be under this Bill; arid, finally, it must take place before, and not after, the outbreak of war. Under our  existing system, we have a force of 25,000 ;men to protect this enormous continent ; and those men, in an emergency, would be  called upon, not only to man the forts of the six capitals, but to man any other fortified position, and also be prepared to repel an invasion. It would be absolutely impossible for such a small body  of men to carry out that task. Lord Kitchener, in dealing with this state of affairs, reported- </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">The conclusion I have come to is, shortly, - that the present forces are inadequate in numbers, training, organization, and munitions of war, to defend Australia from the dangers that are due to the present conditions that prevail in the country, as well as to its isolated position. </para>
                    <para class="block">Australia, in the past, has undoubtedly relied solely on the protection afforded by the British Navy, but we know that in time of war 75 per cent, of the British Fleet would be called upon to- defend the shores of the Mother Country, and I presume that the remaining 25 per cent, could not be spared to assist in our protection. It -is very interesting in this connexion to turn to countries where the compulsory system has been tried on a scale , such as that proposed to be adopted under this Bill "The countries to which I would refer are "Switzerland and Norway. .Switzerland at -the time of the French revolution was divided into a number of cantons. The French were not satisfied with the system of -government existing there ; and, as the people were not united, they created much havoc and devastation. After the revolution, the Swiss came to the common-sense  conclusion that for the better protection of their- country they should introduce the system of compulsory military training, and we to-night are asked to adopt the principle advocated by them. We do not believe in making any class distinction, and we therefore provide that every able-bodied man, whether he be the son of a king or the son of a cook, shall serve. The objection has been raised by the opponents of this Bill that we are introducing for the first time compulsory provisions ; but I find that section 59 of the Defence Act passed as far back as 1903, provides that - </para>
                    <para>All male inhabitants of Australia (excepting those who are exempt from service in the Defence Force) who have resided therein for six months and are British subjects and are between the ages of eighteen and sixty years shall, in time of ' war, be liable to serve in the Militia Forces. </para>
                    <para class="block">Under that provision, which has been in operation since 1903, every citizen of Australia in time of emergency would be called upon to serve, and I cannot see that any special disadvantage will be imposed on the citizens of Australia by the measure with which we are now dealing. "In Switzerland, where a large percentage of the population undergoes compulsory military training, one would naturally conclude that, having regard to the long periods of service for which provision is made, there would be no anxiety to make any further provision in this regard. We find, however, that in 1906 Switzerland had 3,732 rifle clubs, with a membership of 222,951. All these clubs are carried on under the volunteer system. In addition, there are what are known as miniature rifle clubs, with a membership of 6,795. Let us contrast the position of Switzerland and England. Switzerland, with a population of some 3,000,000, has 222,951 members of adult rifle clubs and 6,795 members of miniature rifle- clubs; whereas England, with her population of 42,000,000, has only 80,000 members of such clubs. The contrast is so striking that further comment is unnecessary. A Commission which travelled through Switzerland was particularly struck by the puny physique of the children and the fine physique of the men - a fact which goes to prove that the training which the citizens of that country receive- not only fits them to defend their country, but develops them both mentally and physically.

On the' other hand, Switzerland, with a population of only 3,000,000, has 281,000 men serving. Military training there does not start as early as it will in our case, but commences at the age of twenty years. The system consists of three divisions - the <inline font-style="italic">Auszug,</inline> consisting of men from twenty to thirty-two years of age ; the <inline font-style="italic">Landwehr,</inline> comprising men of from thirty-two to forty-four years of age, and the <inline font-style="italic">Landsturm,</inline> consisting of men from seventeen to fifty years of age. There the conditions of service in the militia are more severe than are the conditions which we intend to impose. The <inline font-style="italic">Auszug</inline> comprises 143,000 men ; the <inline font-style="italic">Landwehr,</inline> 93,000 : and the <inline font-style="italic">Landsturm,</inline> 45,000; or a total of 281,000. The <inline font-style="italic">Landsturm</inline> has not been thoroughly organized, and at the present time there are 260,000 men belonging to the unarmed section. Honorable members will gather from these figures that the vast proportion of the population of Switzerland is being trained to defend the country. One would naturally conclude that, such a vast section of the population being subjected to compulsory service, trade would be thoroughly disorganized ; but, according to <inline font-style="italic">A Territorial Army in Being,</inline> such is not the case.

The great bulk of the population of Norway consists of agriculturists. There is no nobility, and no capitalistic class there, but the great number of the people are freeholders.

In 1901 we were spending £834,000, or  4s.  4d. per head per annum on defence, and in 1903 the expenditure was reduced' to 3s. 7d. a head; but the Government proposals will increase the expenditure tr&gt; 8s. per head. Like the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, I have fault to find with the provisions relating to the Military College, though on somewhat different grounds. It is provided that no person who is not a graduate of the Military College shall become an officer of the Permanent Forces. Lord Kitchener suggested that the most eligible cadets recommended by commanding officers should be sent to the Military College, but I protest emphatically against the selection system. If we want the most brainy youths, we should submit all applicants for admission to the College to an examination. In the battery in which I served, a certain gunner on one- occasion desired to go up for examination, but the sergeant-major reported that he was unsuitable. The commanding officer, however, allowed him to go up, and, strange to say, when the results came out he was found to have beaten the best of the brigade, and to have established a record. Had the matter been left to the sergeant-major, that man would have had no chance to advance himself, and under the selection system recommended by Lord Kitchener,, men who, if they were allowed to go through the College, would make good1 officers, might be prevented from getting commissions. The College should be open to all. It should not be impossible even for a ranker to enter it, if he proves his ability. In the past the influence of class-  has been too marked. There are many other matters with which I should like to deal, but, as the Minister wishes to close the debate to-night, 1 shall confine my remarks to the question of pay. It is proposed to give infantrymen 4s. a day and keep, whereas the permanent men at present get only 2s. '6d. a day and their keep. In all trades and callings men in the Commonwealth receive on the average 83 per cent, more than men in Great Britain. The members of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers receive as a minimum 54s. a week, whereas in Great Britain they get only 23s. a week, which is 31s., or 135 per cent, less, while the maximum pay here is 90s. a week, and in Great Britain 41s., <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> difference of 49s., or 120 per cent.' Similar comparisons might be made in regard to municipal employes, the police, and others. The pay in the British Army is less than here, but there pensions are provided, computed on a twenty-one years' basis. Allowing for this, and for the difference in rate to which I have already alluded, our forces receive very little. Our warrant officers, non-commissioned officers, and men receive rates of pay which do not exceed the rates in force in the British Army by a percentage anything like so great as that by which rates of pay in civil trades and occupations here exceed the British rates. For instance, the pay of sergeant-major in the Engineers here is only 25 per cent, above that of men of the same rank in the British Army, while here a sergeant-major armament artificer enjoys an advantage of only 13 per cent., a master gunner of only 25 per cent., a staff sergeant-major of only 14 per cent., a regimental quartermaster-sergeant of 28 per cent., a regimental quartermaster-sergeant armament artificer of 9 per cent., a regimental quartermaster-sergeant armourer of 14 per cent., a company sergeant-major of 6 per cent., a sergeant of 14 per cent., a corporal of 14 per cent., a bombardier of 11 per cent., and a gunner of 37 per cent. It seems to me that men who devote their lives to the protection of the wealth of the country should be fairly paid. Artillerymen and engineers have a great deal to learn. I know that, as a matriculated man, I found, in connexion with various examinations, that there were a great many intricate and technical matters to understand and remember. It is, however, difficult to obtain recognition of this fact. Our Defence Forces receive from 46 to 77 per cent, less than the minimum -difference between the rates of pay in civil occupations here and in Great Britain. If our men here received 83 per cent, more than the men of the British Forces receive, their increased pay would be - Sergeant-major of Engineers, 6s. a day, or <inline font-style="italic">£109</inline> per annum; sergeant-major armament artificer, 8s. a day, or ^146 per annum; master-gunner, 6s. a day, or ^109 per annum; staff sergeant-major, 6s. a day, or ,£109 per annum ; regimental quartermaster-sergeant, 4s. 8d. a day, or <inline font-style="italic">£85</inline> 5s. per annum ; and so on down to gunner, 8d. per day, or <inline font-style="italic">£12</inline> 3s. 4d. per annum. Twelve men of the various ranks in the service would contribute ^1,030 13s. 8d. per annum towards a pension fund if the 83 per cent, increase in the pay of the British Army were conceded. I have also a table showing the comparative pay rates consolidated. </para>

                            <para>- I shall have an opportunity of dealing with the question on the Estimates. Lord Kitchener said that the new Defence Bill would give sufficient numbers to defend the country effectively if the force was sufficiently trained, organized, and equipped. I do not desire to set my lay opinion against that of such an authority; but, when Switzerland and Norway are mentioned, I can only point to the small area of those countries as compared to Australia, and express the opinion that 80,000 troops seem totally inadequate for our purpose. Further, it seems to me that the right kind of troops are not provided. In the South African War the Boers put up their effective defence, 'firstly, " because of their mobility, and secondly because of their deadly use of the rifle. There were only, I believe, some 85,000 Boers at the outside, while the British Forces numbered some 300,000 ; but, fortunately for the Boers, they were well trained in the saddle and still better trained in the use of the rifle. Taking that war as a lesson, I think we should go in more for mounted infantry, teaching our men how to ride and how to shoot from the saddle. I do not suggest a system of cavalry, because in the South African War, the cavalry with their lances and their swords by their side, and their guns strapped to the saddle, fell a very easy prey to the enemy ; but the Government should certainly take into consideration the  advisableness  of establishing strong mounted forces throughout the Commonwealth, when, I can  assure  them, we should have a much more effective defence than we shall have under this Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- I must express some regret that the Defence Bill carried in the last Parliament, and commented on most favorably by the British military authorities, has not been given a trial. That measure contained the principle of compulsory service up to the age of twenty years, but it was never put into practice; and now it is to be superseded by a Bill which extends the age to twenty-five years, with another year added in' which the members of the Forces shall be subject to report and one day's training. I am afraid that the result of the alteration will be that the scheme will break down of its own weight. By summarily bringing into effect a compulsory service measure of this kind, we shall so dislocate commercial and industrial arrangements that not only employes, but employers, will find their business and monetary interests seriously inconvenienced, and there will be a reaction instead of increased enthusiasm for1 military service. If I am any judge of human nature, that must be the result; and it certainly presents an "aspect of the question that ought to be considered. The feelings of the people generally will be to some extent outraged, and our prospects of effective defence will be diminished rather than increased. Then I hold that the very best defence Australia, can have is a largely increased population. We may enact what defence laws we like, but, unless we have sufficient numbers, we cannot hope to successfully resist the attacks of any large opposing force. One provision of the Bill is that all the male inhabitants of Australia, except those exempt, who have resided here for six months and are British subjects, shall be liable to service. I consider that a residence of six months is altogether, too short. We are making strenuous efforts, by providing land and so forth, to induce <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> emigrants to come to Australia as a source of wealth and strength, but I venture to say that our success in this direction is likely to be materially interfered with when it becomes known that no sooner will emigrants arrive here than they will be required to undergo compulsory military service. <inline font-style="italic">Bond fide</inline> emigrants in agricultural and other industries should be given at least three years' exemption in which ' to look around and thoroughly grasp the circumstances and situation of the country. The defence of hearth and home is one of the duties of citizenship ; but I venture to say that such conditions as this Bill imposes will tend to keep away the very people we desire to attract. What other comments I have to make I shall reserve for Committee. </para>

                        <para>.- A great number of people will, I think, experience considerable disappointment when the two Bills dealing with defence are passed by this House. We are entering on a new departure largely the result of newspaper agitation. Only a few years ago three of the principal daily papers of the Commonwealth were anxious to discover some political cry which would place the Labour party at a disadvantage. These newspapers had already said all they could against the platform of the party, and, being in want of an election cry, it occurred to them as a good idea to propose that Australia should present one or two <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts</inline> to the Old Country. It 3s a curious fact' that on the same day the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> and the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser,</inline> published leaders recommending such a presentation to Great Britain, in what was described as " her hour of peril." It was evidently thought that  the cry would catch on, and that the Labour party would oppose the idea, and, therefore, be defeated at the elections. We know, however, that the proposal did not meet with the approval of the public; and I remember that a subscription list opened at the Agricultural Show in Sydney, during which there were some  250,000  persons present, resulted in a collection of only  ,£5.  The proposed defence scheme appears to me to be beyond the strength of this small community - to be too large and expensive. I regard it as the outcome of panic originated by the opposing press in Australia, and in Great Britain by political parties for political purposes. Several causes led to the great defence scare in the Old Country. There were large numbers of unemployed ; the ship-building yards were idle and the ship-builders desired employment, while certain political parties desired to distract attention from local domestic troubles. It is an old practice of rulers to divert attention from internal agitation by declaring war against people outside. The scheme now before us is too large, and will, I believe, be modified before many years go by. * The sum of about  ^2,000,000  per annum which it is proposed that we shall spend on military and naval defence is too great for this working-class community, but the danger is that, having entered into the scheme, we may find ourselves obliged to continue it. We shall have a large number of officers, and undertake expenditure that will entail the employment of a consider-  able number of people, and when the time comes to retrench there will be the gravest disappointment and trouble. There will he a Black Wednesday or Thursday when the Commonwealth finds it necessary to dispense with a lot of its naval and military officers on account of the tremendous expenditure entailed on the community. I regret that it is proposed to put these measures through to-night. They are so important that they might well occupy the attention of the House for fully a week, but members are tired by the tremendously long session. I suppose that in no session of Parliament since the commencement of Federation has such a large number of important Acts been put through. I sincerely hope that we shall not have in our military and naval defence schemes anything in the nature of a military and naval caste, and that the Minister of Defence will put his foot down severely upon such incidents as occur in the Old Country. I remember a case of a hard-working Australian family whose son, being a bright young fellow and successful at his school, was assisted by them to go in for a military training. He was appointed a lieutenant in Australia, and obtained employment in the United Kingdom. There he found that his fellow-officers gave wine parties. He was in receipt of <inline font-style="italic">£200</inline><inline font-style="italic">or j£3°°</inline> a year» but that was not sufficient for him to keep up with his comrades, and his hard-working parents in Australia were foolish enough to supply him with <inline font-style="italic">£150</inline> to  ^200  a year in order that he might keep pace with them. They found, at last, that they could do it no longer, and they withdrew him. I hope we shall not have that kind of thing in Australia. The aims of the Labour army to which I belong have always been of a peaceful character, and I hope still are. All our ideas were against anything in the nature of a huge military and naval defence force. We believed in military and naval training, but merely for defence purposes ; and my fear of these proposals of ours is that our Forces might be used by the capitalists of the Old Country for the purpose of oppressing some subject nation in other parts of the world. We must remember that the capitalists in the Old Country have  ^2,800,000,000  invested abroad. Honorable members talk of the Empire and of the great British Navy protecting these shores. The British Navy is kept up, not to protect Australia or any  Other  part of the Empire, but to collect the interest on that vast sum of money invested abroad by the capitalists of Great Britain. If it were not for that unseen empire of capitalists, which has been recently so well described by a professor at the Leland Stanford University, we should not find so much money spent to-day in military and naval defence. , As Carlyle put it, what quarrel have the working men of Australia with the working men of Germany? What quarrel have the workers of England, Ireland, Scotland, or Wales with them ? The mechanics and labourers of the United Kingdom have no cause of quarrel against the workers of Germany. I am glad to hear from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hodge,</inline> who has lately come here from the House of Commons, that the visits of the British Labour party to Germany, and of Germans to the Old Country, are having the most splendid effects. British Labour members have addressed meetings in Germany, and told the people there that it is not the desire of the British people to go to war with them, and the best of feeling is growing up. We hear nothing of this interchange of visits from the capitalistic press of Australia. They suppress everything of that nature. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> publish everything that will create International friction and hatred, but anything that would bring about an <inline font-style="italic">entente cordiale</inline> is suppressed. I sincerely hope that Australia, while making every preparation to defend itself against aggression, will not lose sight of the question of International arbitration for the settlement of disputes. Honorable members appear to be afraid of some enemy that is likely to attack Australia. The more I read of what is going on in other parts of the world, the more satisfied I am that we have no attack to fear from India, China, or Japan; and surely we do not need to fear any of the European countries. There is a Socialistic party even in Japan, and there are Socialistic parties in Italy, France, Germany, and Spain. If ever the permanent peace of the world is brought about, it will come through the much-despised Socialistic and Labour parties. One clause to which particular exception has been taken, is that which provides that no person who is not a graduate of the Military College can become an officer in the Permanent Forces. That provision is, I think, a mistake. If it were ruled that no man could become a member of the Federal Parliament unless he had been through a college, where would the majority of us be? We should be outside. Most of the members of this Parliament have never been to a university, and have probably never even been to a grammar school ; but, like Darwin, have picked up the education that was most valuable to them after leaving school at fourteen. I understand, from the Minister, that no fees are to be charged at the College, but that students are even to receive a wage of 5s. a day, from which their keep is to be deducted. That is well, so far as it goes ; but the great objection is that no man can enter the College after reaching nineteen years of age. Many of the men who figured so prominently in the Boer War never saw a Military College. I am sure that is true of Generals Botha and De Wet, and others who proved themselves such clever and successful antagonists to the British Army. That provision in the Bill appears most likely to create the very military caste which has been spoken of. If no one can become an officer of the Permanent Forces unless his parents are able to afford him an education and facilities for entering the College before he is nineteen years of age, there will undoubtedly be a military caste created. Half the men in Australia do not know what occupation they would like to follow until they have reached the age of twenty-one. This clause ought, therefore, to be amended to provide that the Military College shall not be a close corporation. We provide, also&gt; that any one who can prove to the proper authorities that he has a conscientious objection to active service, shall be exempt. Any parents who have conscientious objections to their children being brought up to militarism ought also to be allowed to state them, and have their children exempt. Honorable members will say that that will break down the compulsory system; but I do not think it will. I do not think that the majority of people in the Commonwealth will be prepared to swear that they have conscientious objections to their children being brought up to the use of arms ; but I honestly believe that there are a considerable ' number of families who, from religious or other scruples, object to their children acquiring a warlike and aggressive spirit. It seems to .them that it is impossible to foretell what will be the result if we instil in the minds of our young people a feeling of militarism. Many parents have conscientious objections to such a training, arid their children should be exempt from it. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret that a measure such as this should be introduced at a period of the session when the influence of the Government, and, indeed, of members outside the Government, is likely to be exercised in the direction of curtailing debate, and of inducing the House with as little discussion as possible to vote either for or against it. Before the Bill is read a second time, however, I should like to refer to one or two1 features of a question which have more to do than has any other with the condition of Australia at the present time. The subject of defence is so interwoven with every other question which has been or is likely to be brought before the House for some considerable time, that it is almost impossible to touch upon any matter without impinging in some degree upon it. Nearly every Bill that has been dealt with during the present session has had some bearing, either direct or indirect, upon the question of defence, and in one or two cases the legislation submitted has been considered almost entirely 5 from the defence point of view. In its  early  history Australia relied entirely for its defence upon the Old Country. There was no attempt on the part of our pioneers, small in number and extremely scattered as they were, to take up the question of defence for themselves. They relied solely upon those small bands of trained men who were sent from the Old Country for the express purpose of defending the country. Ultimately the patriotic sentiment of the people became aroused, and the volunteer system was instituted with a limited number of permanent  men, mostly for the forts. That system obtained for a considerable period, but it was soon  recognised  that the work was falling into the hands of a comparatively small percentage of the population, and that it  was  not being carried out with anything like that effectiveness that was essential if anything like a good defence was to be made in time of emergency. In comparatively recent times the volunteer system was superseded by that of the militia. It is only since Federation that  the  militia system has been adopted all over Australia, and grave difficulties were encountered by Ministers who took up the question. The right honorable member for Swan was Minister of Defence when the militia system was universally adopted, and he found it extremely difficult to induce members of purely volunteer regiments to agree to what they considered a drastic change in their methods of administration. Some of them pushed their objections to such an extent that even to-day we have in the Commonwealth a number of volunteer regiments which refuse to accept from the State any pecuniary payment for the services rendered by them. All these systems were recognised by those who gave to them more than a cursory examination as being utterly and completely inadequate for our needs. We then had expressed in various parts of the Commonwealth a desire that  there  should be instituted some system of universal training whereby every able-bodied man would be made to recognise' his obligation to defend the country of which he was a citizen. It would be difficult to determine where the idea origi.nated, but one of the results of its origination was to cause quite a large number of patriotic Australians - members of the Australian Natives Association - to consider at their annual Conferences this question of universal training. The attitude adopted by that organization has had a great deal to do with the education of the people with regard to the obligation of the individual citizen to which I have just referred, and in bringing this question to its present stage. The Acting Prime Minister also took a leading part in that movement, and, as a member of the Australian Natives Association, I feel that we owe him a debt of gratitude, not only for the industry and the ability with which he advocated this system of military defence, but also for the still more potent fact that he was able to bring behind him a very large number of men who otherwise would have been the most out-and-out opponents of this system. There is no doubt that the Australian Labour party would have been the most virulent opponents of universal training but for the work done by the present Attorney-General. We have to realize the enormous area over which we shall have to operate should our integrity as a nation be ever threatened.  To refer to a familiar illustration, to which reference has been made more than once even during this debate, I would remind honorable members that the Imperial Government found it necessary to send over 250,000 men to South Africa, which in the matter of area and difficulties of transport cannot be compared with Australia. We have had under our old system some 25,000 men who may have been regarded as being more or less trained in the use. of arms. This country, with all its possibilities, and notwithstanding the eager eyes which are now, and have been for a considerable time, turned in our direction, has been relying for its defence almost entirely upon that small body of men. We knew perfectly well, however, that there was another barrier which an enemy would have to. overcome before those 25,000 men would be called upon to act. I refer to the Imperial Navy and the Imperial prestige; but I venture to say that any true Australian, when he gives the matter thought, must feel utterly ashamed of the little he has done to fit himself to carry out his national obligation in this respect. The modern tendency is for individuals to recognise this obligation, and to believe that the best way to secure peace is to be prepared for war. I know that that is an  old truism. It is challenged -to-day, but I venture to. say that it cannot be successfully challenged, and is not disputed, by those who have given any attention to the subject. Every one realizes that a man who has a strong house and is strong enough to keep it is in less danger of aggression than a man who has no means of protecting his house. The country possessed of the most up-to-date arms and a devoted and patriotic people trained in their use is less liable to be interfered with than is a- country which relies upon the sufferance of its neighbours, or- on the fact that it is too insignificant to be attacked. I venture to say that countries like Switzerland, which are frequently referred to as examples of this kind, are able to occupy their territory more because of the jealousy of the peoples surrounding them than because of any inherent power which they possess to defend themselves. We should realize that a country like ours is in grave danger from attack if we are unable adequately to defend it from within. I do not contend that by the adoption of universal training we shall warn off all possible invaders, but we shall find in it the foundation of an adequate system of defence. The honorable member for Capricornia gave us one of the most remarkable explanations of the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> agitation that I have yet heard. He said that it was designed and entered into by the leading newspapers of Australia in order to dish the Labour party. I venture to say that, great as the power of these leading newspapers undoubtedly is - and it is being added to every day by the publication of Labour journals - its influence has not yet been extended to Continental nations, and, at the time referred to, it was scarcely responsible for the feverish activity displayed in the German dockyards. I regret very much that in existing circumstances I cannot speak at length upon this question as I should like to do. I wish, however, to direct the attention of honorable members to paragraph 9 of the introductory remarks in that most admirable report which the late Government were fortunate, and, I think, far-seeing, enough to procure from Field-Marshal Lord Kitchener.

                            <para>- That is so. I have been made somewhat indignant  event  by statements I have heard made today, suggesting that because people wish to preserve their own integrity and defend their country, they must' be classed as military jingoes and under the influence of what is known., as "militarism." Militarism is a system, of government by the military, and I venture to say that .that is about the last thing: which the people of Australia would put up with.  We  have a Government of a sort to-day which is not satisfactory from the point of view of some of us, but I venture to say that we should infinitely prefer it to any system of military government which has operated in various parts of the world. I venture to say that such a system will never find in Australia the environment in which it could hope to exist. The conclusion to which Lord! Kitchener came is one which a number of us had come to previously, but which we had very great difficulty in. making the responsible authorities see as plainly as we saw it. ourselves. On- the subject of universal training and compulsory service, I am almost ashamed to again, direct attention to the very marked practical distinction between the two terms;.. The universal training which has been advocated by the Attorney-General, by the Australian Natives Association-, and by the three Federal Governments preceding the present Government, cannot by any stretch of the imagination be described as compulsory service. I would ask any honorable member who thinks that there is any element of compulsion in the universal trailing here proposed to contrast it with the systems of compulsory service in operation in other countries under- which,  men:  ara-  taken from their homes, their friends, their trades, and business for years in order that they may be trained to defend their country. </para>

                            <para>- I am astonished that the honorable member should persist in this misdescription of the system advocated by the present and previous Governments of the Commonwealth and the body to which I have referred. I wish to express my appreciation of the courage of the Minister of Defence in dealing with the Military College in the only way in which it could be effectively dealt with if it is to be a safe foundation for this system. The Minister's attitude will be the subject of misunderstanding and misrepresentation, but I venture to say that both he and the system will survive both, and we shall have established a Military College which, while it will avoid some of the features of West Point which may be regarded as objectionable, will prove a very worthy competitor as a means of military training with that, the most up-to-date Military College in the world to-day. During the two periods for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has been Minister .of Defence, I, in common with others who have been associated with the Forces, have been struck with his capacity and industry. </para>

                            <para>- And modesty. The Minister would be the last to make such a remark as that of the honorable member. I am only saying what I think is due to him. Although I may have my own idea as to how he gained it, I know that he has the confidence of every member of the permanent staff with whom he has come into contact, and the conclusions at which he has arrived respecting the establishment of the Military College are worthy of consideration, even by those who do not feel disposed to accept them. He proposes in order that men shall enter' the College under the least onerous conditions that can be imagined, to establish scholarships which will enable students to live at the College for five years, without -being dependent on their own resources or~~ any relative, as they will be taught, fed and! clothed, and given sufficient pay to keep them in pocket money. But I do not think that it would be wise to fill the College with students from each State in proportion to its population. That would be a mistake. To get the most effective Defence Force, we must get the best officers, and should throw open all positions to competitive examination. Furthermore, we do not desire to keep up the old provincial divisions. Australia should be treated as a whole. We should not perpetuate the State differences which have done so much harm in the past, and which Federation was intended to remedy. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports did the Minister and the Government injustice in what he said about the impossibility of rankers, getting promotion. Section n of the principal Act provides that in the first appointment of officers preference shall be given, where there is equality of qualification, to those who have served in the Defence Forces for three years without a commission, that is, to those who have served in the ranks. </para>

                            <para>- The present- Government propose that a senior cadet officer shall be eligible for the position of second lieutenant if he has served for three years in the Defence Forces. I am of opinion, from the" experience which I have had, that the finest officers have come from the- ranks. Colonel Price, when raising the Victorian Mounted Rifles, which became the model of similar regiments in other parts of Australia, and did  signal service in- , South Africa, stipulated that the. officers- should have served in the ranks, a stipulation which was eminently justified by results. The time spent at the Military College is to be deemed service in the ranks, and thus there is continuity between the system of the Deakin Government and that of the present Government, the principle of promotion from the ranks not being interfered with. Students entering the Military College will start at the foot of the ladder, and gradually qualify for a commission. </para>

                            <para>- Toy soldiers ! These men proved the most effective forces, I suppose, that went to South Africa. The honorable member, with his remarkable fondness for the permanent soldier, may tell us how far 4ie is prepared to go with regard to the establishment of a standing army in the Commonwealth. It does not lie in the mouth of any man here to decry the efforts that have been made so loyally and patriotically by a number of volunteers to fit themselves for the defence, of their country. I am sorry, indeed, .to find any member of a party which includes the Attorney-General decrying the efforts of those who have proved by their patriotism and self-sacrifice that they recognised their obligations long before the honorable member came on the scene. Something has been said about the liability of employers, and it is provided that those who interfere with men in their training shall be drastically dealt with. I hope to see the law put into operation -with the utmost rigour when a man proves himself so wanting in the sense of what is due to his country 'as to prevent his employes undergoing their training. </para>

                            <para>- In contradiction of what the honorable member for Melbourne Ports has said, I can point to quite a number of companies, trading and otherwise, as well as to private employers, who afford every facility for their men to train. I suppose no company is being more maligned at present in Victoria ' than the Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company ; and yet that company not only gives the time necessary for military training, but, if a man finds it necessary in pursuance of that object to absent himself for twelve months, or even three years, his position is kept for him. This company shows an example; and I can only hope that what the honorable member has said is not true, or, if true, that he will not rest until redress is made. </para>

                            <para>- I should have gone beyond the manager ; and, at any rate, I guarantee that there have been strikes on much less provocation. However, I have been drawn off the track by interjections; and I shall only say that I am afraid the honorable member is not doing himself or his cause any good by the statements he is making. I welcome the extension of the period of training, because one of my objections to the original Bill was the restriction in this respect. That restriction, however, was solely due to the party who now sit behind the Government. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member must agree that I have given a full meed of praise to the Attorney-General for his attitude in this respect. I do not include the Attorney-General, who courageously stood alone in his party at the beginning; and credit is due to him for the splendid fashion in which he has brought his party behind him on this question. I heartily indorse the proposal to extend the period of training, because, as I have already indicated, I do not believe that even the time provided is sufficient to make an efficient soldier. I am glad to see, further, that the officers are compelled to engage for twelve years. Some men who join the forces for the purposes of wearing a uniform, and having rank and title, " throw up " the service when something happens they do not like, and the force with which they are associated may possibly become disorganized. This, however, is no longer to be possible, for officers must serve the full period. The area system is an experiment, but I predict that it will prove highly successful. In this connexion we have an evidence of what I have already said in regard to the necessity of avoiding any State appointments. In one of the States, at any rate, there were not sufficient applicants, and men were appointed from the more populous States. From the calibre of the men, who are so much in earnest that they have taken up the work at a remuneration very much below the value of their services, we shall, I feel sure, secure one of the best means of placing the Defence Forces on a proper basis. The honorable member for Adelaide has said that these men will find difficulty in carrying on their own avocations, and I am of the same opinion ; but, from my knowledge of a large number, I feel sure that it is their avocations that will suffer, because their heart and soul is in military work, and they will do everything possible to make the system a success. It is to the patriotism of those Australian natives - to their capacity for organization and susceptibility to order and discipline - that we may look for the success of the service. The Minister has told us that we shall have to meet a probable cost of something like ^2,000,000 a year; but I feel that that amount is somewhat understated. When this machine gets into full operation the cost will be very much more, especially if the representations which have been made with respect to pay meet with the reception which some honorable members evidently hope. The present pay is more liberal than that proposed by a previous Labour Administration. With regard to altering the payments and grading them, I venture to say that that will be found impossible in practice. If the Government depart from the universal system of paying according to the work done, and paying according to the loss sustained by the men under training, they will find it impossible to properly arrange the pay-sheet. The amount paid would have to be an equivalent for what the men are losing in their various occupations ; and no Treasurer would view with equanimity any proposed pay-sheet of that character. If professional men were to have their pay calculated on the basis of their earnings in the same way as those engaged in trades and other occupations, we should have a class line set up within the Forces which would have a most detrimental effect upon them. </para>

                            <para>- If honorable members desire to pay the men for what they are losing, we shall have an enormous pay-sheet, and one which, in the case of some professional men, will run up to many pounds per day. It would not be fair to ask a man who was losing ^5 per day to accept 10s. per day, if we are going to pay that sum to a man who is actually losing 10s. a day. Members of Parliament, of course, are exempt ; but I do not know what we should have to pay to some of them if the rate were based upon their own valuation. The principle of this Bill recognises that the obligation of service is universal. The obligation being universal, we should put the men on exactly the same level with regard to the payment that they are to receive. The honorable member for Corio has mentioned the Mounted Infantry. I am gratified to know that the Government have given the assurance that the existing corps and organization are not to be interfered with at once. They are simply to be allowed to operate until the new conditions are brought into working order. In five or ten years' time, it will be found that the corps will be better able to adjust themselves to the altered conditions. The honorable member expressed the hope that the Mounted Infantry would be extended. I regret to say that one Minister of Defence did not appreciate the work done by the Mounted Infantry, and the possibility of their effectiveness in war time!  I take up an entirely different position. I agree with the honorable member for Corio that, requiring, as we do, that our enormous distances should be covered by a very mobile force, we cannot do better than extend the Mounted Infantry system which we have at present in operation, giving it greater effectiveness and enlarged opportunities for working in large bodies, .and acquiring by actual practice, those arts which are so necessary and so valuable in the maintenance of communication from point to point. I must apologize to the House for taking up more time than, perhaps,  1  should have done; but I desire to express again my regret that this most important of all questions should be brought up at the fag end of the session, when a number of honorable members who, like myself, feel that the subject should be most carefully and closely considered, are compelled to curtail their remarks and to deal with the matter in a more disconnected fashion than they would desire. </para>

                    <para class="block">Defence Bill in the last Parliament, and to which honorable members opposite were good enough to accord their entire support. The amendment which I then proposed was to this effect : Officers rising above the rank, of captain had to pass an examination showing that they had accustomed themselves to the use of arms other than the arms with which they were immediately concerned. In other words, they had to prove their knowledge of other arms of the service. Officers rising above the rank of major had to become, in very truth, field' officers, and to show themselves competent to command in the field a force of all' arms. I urged upon the House - and honorable members opposite supported me - that if the provisions of the Bill stood as: they were, and we were to impose these conditions on new officers, we should also endeavour to put our house in order in regard to existing officers, and require them, to prove their practical fitness for existing; commands.

                    <para class="block">Honorable members opposite were unanimous in supporting that proposal. It was,, however, held by the then House to be too sweeping ; and after some debate, in which every member of the Labour party who spoke warmly supported my amendment, we had a division, in which, every one of my honorable friends was ranged on my side. </para>
                    <para>My present proposal is not so sweeping as that was. I propose to follow the principle of the Act, as proposed to be amended by the present Government, making these stringent proposals as .regards efficiency apply to officers of the rank of major and upwards. The question of proof of fitness in regard to these officers is not one of theoretical examination, as* will, perhaps, be urged by those who, while pretending to favour the theory of this amendment, will say that it will operate unjustly against officers of old standing It may not be practicable for the Inspector-General to test the fitness of every officer in our forces, and consequently I have inserted a proviso which will enable him to appoint a  deputy  by whom the work will1 be performed. I do not think it is neces-sary for me to say anything more on this' question. My amendment is not nearly so sweeping as is the preceding clause. It merely asks that officers who in time of war will have, not only high responsibilities upon their shoulders, but the lives of those -who follow them in their hands, shall have attained a certain standard of efficiency. The Bill seeks to demand from future officers of the forces, which will be created some time after the passing of this Bill, a fair standard of military efficiency - a standard which will be decided, not merely by practical tests, but by theoretical examinations. My amendment does not -propose to expose existing officers, from the rank of major upwards, to the humiliation of having to subject themselves to theoretical examinations, but I do ask, in simple justice to their men and to the Commonwealth, that- officers enjoying field rank shall possess, at any rate, a rough-and-ready certificate of fitness, and that they shall not be asked to accept positions on active service which they are not fitted to occupy. I trust that the Attorney-General will accept the amendment. </para>

                            <para>- The Boers were fighting Britishers; and we have never taken these points in conducting a campaign. I cannot recollect any country which has waged war exactly as England did in South Africa. I am confident that, if any Power should invade Australia and find men without a uniform firing off rifles at them from behind trees, it would consider those men as murderers and not as soldiers. It is only fair that the Government should explain to the riflemen of Australia why, while pretending that they are members df the defence organization, they do not think that they are worth a uniform? </para>

                        <para>. - I am entirely in accord with the suggestion to clothe our riflemen with a uniform in order to fight the foe. I do not know what the fate of the <inline font-style="italic">franc-tireurs</inline> was ; but I am sure that it could not possibly have been worse than that which should overtake a man who would make a suggestion of this kind at this hour of the night. If the supply of a uniform to the honorable gentleman would make him see, as it were, the urgency of the point of withdrawing his- amendment and going home, I should be very glad to supply it at the cost of the Government. Beyond recognising the honorable gentleman as a sharpshooter, whose intention I admire, but whose erratic aim I deplore, I decline absolutely to commit the Government to clothe any riflemen. My instructions are not to do so ; and I am keeping strictly to them. The clause provides that uniforms shall be supplied free of charge to all ranks in the Citizen Forces. </para>

                        <para>.- If on no higher ground than in the interest of my honorable friend's family, I must ask him to stay here a little longer to consider this simple : act of justice to the riflemen of Australia. I should be the last man to keep him out of bed at any time. If I could only be satisfied that he would stay m bed,. I should have more confidence in the security of the country.. But, in this particular instance, it is necessary for him to stay out of bed a little longer, in order to consider whether or not he is doing the riflemen an injustice.  1  can remember him. going into my electorate and addressing a large meeting of riflemen when the previous Administration was in power. He was most effective, and promised everything under the sun.- I can assure my honorable friends opposite that this was the very least of the promises which he then made on behalf of a future Labour Administration. I am sure that I am justified, even at the risk of keeping him out of bed perhaps  a- little  longer  than  his. constitution warrants,  in  earnestly asking; him now to carry out this promise which he made to the riflemen at Randwick not long ago. This is not a matter' which should be treated with levity, but a serious matter for those concerned. Either the riflemen are worth a uniform, or they are not worth being called an integral portion of our Defence Force. It is not fair to ask them to go to the front in time of war, if their action will expose them to "be hanged! as murderers if caught. </para>

I ask him to vote for my amendment, and to clothe the  riflemen  with a Government uniform. I appeal to the honorable member for Parramatta who, no doubt, has a keen recollection of the very violent platform rhetoric of the Acting Prime Minister in favour of clothing the riflemen and doing everything which they wanted. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That is the proposal which the late Government tried to have inserted in the Bill of last year in the Senate, but it was defeated owing to the solid vote of the Opposition, reinforced by a couple of members from our own side. At first we did not propose to clothe the junior cadets. When the last Bill was under consideration varying estimates of the cost were furnished. Some officers stated that it would be £^50,000; others, .£75,000. I see that the estimate has gone up to £200,000 since the present Government took control, and in another year or two it probably will reach .£500, 000. We could very well give the junior cadets a simple uniform which would not cost much, as we propose to recognise them as part and .parcel of ' the Defence Force, and train them in miniature forms of soldiery. New Zealand clothes her junior cadets at a cost of about 10s. or 11s. per head, the uniform consisting of a simple tunic, belt, and a cap with a distinctive badge or band. Something of that sort could be adopted here. I do not propose to clothe the junior cadets in the present expensive way, which I understand runs to about 30s. per head, at any rate, in my own State. The senior cadets are  already <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be supplied with uniforms under the Bill, and an amendment on the lines I have indicated would not involve a very great cost. The advantage to the boys would be very great. I believe to-day they think a great deal more of ' their uniform than the adults do, and certainly more than boys of larger ages do. If we are to recognise them as part ana  parcel of the Defence Forces we shall do well to minister to the feeling of pride  that wells up in their young hearts. In any event, we should be putting ourselves in the good graces of their mothers if we ,gave them a simple uniform as prescribed. However, joking aside, it would not involve a large expenditure, and after the first outlay the annual cost, I suppose, would be only from £7,000 to £8,000. For all the good it would do in ministering to the military spirit of these youngsters, I think it would be desirable. I urge, therefore, that we should follow as far as possible the simple uniform that has "been adopted in New Zealand. There the cadets are all uniformed alike, and the system is in every way beneficial and advantageous. </para>

That provision includes, although we did not know it before, members of rifle clubs. I see no reason why we should grant uniforms to junior cadets. They are not soldiers, but school boys. The honorable member for Parramatta, who but a little time ago was a violent opponent of the system of compulsory service, and who, when I proposed "its introduction in 1903, said that it was absurd, has become such a devotee to the 1 -'business that he desires that little children of from twelve to fourteen shall be dressed in what he describes as uniforms. I submit that a child of from twelve to fourteen may derive the greatest possible benefit from physical training, and I do not think that there is one honorable member who, no matter what his opinions on militarism are, does not think that physical training will do children great good. But what real purpose is to be served by dressing our boys in uniforms ? They are not, and cannot be, soldiers. We have the authority of a soldier for the statement that it is not until a man. has passed through, his years of recruit drill that he is worthy to become a soldier. Why, then, call a boy of twelve or fourteen years of age a soldier &lt;or' dress him in uniform? There is no necessity for it. The drill which we are going to give children, will straighten them up, expand their lungs, and build them up physically. But uniforms are not essential to that work. We have already incurred certain .liabilities, and are daily incurring other liabilities of a truly portentous character. If we desire to find some* outlet for our money we can discover more legitimate ways in connexion with militarism and in making the fighting machine more effective than that proposed by the honorable member. Nothing that he could suggest in the way of improving the physical health of the children of this country would pass without attention and consideration from this Government ; but in putting a child in uniform we should only be trying to make him think that in some mysterious way he had become a soldier. One of the happiest proposals of my colleague the Minister of Defence is that the junior cadets shall be supplied with neither guns nor uniforms. I have no sympathy with militarism, and would not have a uniform if it were not absolutely essential that soldiers, whilst training, and particularly when on service, should wear some distinctive dress. I do not believe in building up the idea of militarism by clothing little children in uniforms, and I hope that the Committee will not agree to the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- We have it on record that the chief reason which the honorable member for Parramatta has in view in moving this amendment is that he may stand well in the good graces of the women folk of Australia and those who happen to have boys of from twelve to fourteen years of age. I presume that his desire at present to please the women folk is the outcome of some meetings that he has addressed during the evening, at which possibly it has been intimated to him how pleasing it would be to their mothers' hearts if their little darlings were clothed in uniforms, supplied with peaked caps, and given a bit of wood called a rifle. That may be an admirable idea from the point of view of the honorable member, who is at present utterly irresponsible, but I do not think that the Committee will accept the amendment, which would involve a very considerable expenditure. We have been given no idea of the cost of this proposal of the honorable member, which is designed to please, possibly, the little boys, and certainly would please the women folk. I should object strongly to putting boys into the half-and-half black-and-white uniform 'which the honorable member suggests. They are to have caps and tunics and a little belt. I presume that the belt would be used on them on certain occasions, but, so far as their pantaloons are concerned, they may wear, black, green, white, or. red ones. Whilst there might be some degree of uniformity so far as their top dress was concerned, the rest of their clothing would .be of variegated hue. I am unable to believe that the honorable member has seriously moved this amendment. He has no idea of the cost, but believes that a statement has been made that some such uniform, as he suggests, after attending a tea. meeting, would cost from 10s. to 11s. a head. How many of these children are we to clothe in uniform, - and on what authority is this estimate of cost arrived at ? By accepting the amendment, we may incur an expenditure of many scores of thousands of pounds.' It must not be forgotten that boys will be members of the junior cadet corps only whilst they are between the ages of twelve and fourteen years. Such a uniform as the honorable member suggests would not meet with their approval. They would not be proud of it. One boy might attend drill, in summer time, wearing a tunic and a white pair of pants, whilst another poor lad might appear with. a tunic and a black pair of pants with a grey patch on that part on which he sits. In such circumstances we can realize the disgust, not merely of the boys, but of the people who looked at them. The honorable member has not thought out his proposition with any degree of seriousness, and, in the circumstances, it ought not to have been made. In any case, I do not think we could justify the putting of a full uniform on schoolboys of between twelve and fourteen years of age. Let them go in for physical exercise to expand their chests and develop their bodies, and let them look to the period of senior cadetship for a uniform. I hope the amendment will not be accepted. </para>

                    <para>There is a serious purpose behind the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Parramatta. It marks a line of demarcation between his views and that of the present Minister of Defence as to the treatment of junior cadets. Rightly or wrongly, the present Minister believes that the junior cadets should not be regarded as a part of the Defence -Force. The honorable member for Parramatta takes another view, and believes that the junior cadets should be given some idea of discipline as well as of physical training, and some notion of what will be their duty to the country later on. He holds that the stage between twelve and fourteen years of age is the most receptive period of a boy's life, and that . if he is then induced to take a pride in some uniform he is likely to make a better soldier afterwards. A uniform is', symbolic of membership of a particular institution, and if a man is proud of an institution to which he belongs he will take a pride in the uniform which indicates that he is a member of it. The students of German universities wear uniforms which, in the opinion of many people, make them look like stuffed images, but they are proud of them for what they represent. If the Minister will not accept the amendment we need say no more. </para>
                    <para>I wish to point out that by mention of the fact in this clause that military uniforms for the Citizen Forces are to be provided free of charge, we limit the scope of expenditure in this way, and next year, if this measure passes, the Department will find that it is illegal to spend money for providing uniforms for members of rifle clubs. I understand now, in spite of the unanimous opposition of their supporters a few minutes ago, that it is the policy of the Government to supply uniforms to members of rifle clubs, but under this clause as it stands we limit expenditure upon uniforms to the Citizen Forces. Members of rifle clubs are not, as such, members of the Citizen Forces, and cannot, if this Bill is passed in its present form, be provided with uniforms. I think that provision should be altered if we are to do justice to the riflemen of Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- The amendment seems to me to be out of order. It certainly is in conflict with' another part - of the existing Act which, the honorable member does not propose to amend. But if the amendment be in order the honorable member for Parramatta will require to alter another part of the Bill. I point out that sub-section  3  pf section 12 of the Act which the honorable gentleman himself introduced and carried in this House last session forbids the wearing of uniforms by junior cadets. I suggest that in the circumstances the honorable gentleman should withdraw his amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - I was aware of the provision to which the honorable member for Coolgardie has drawn attention, and intended to deal with the matter in another, way. I have only a word to say in reply to the ridicule sought to be thrown upon the amendment by the honorable member for Adelaide. The honorable member has little to do when he attempts to throw ridicule upon a proposal of this kind. I always bow to his superior military knowledge, as he knows. An humble private like myself must always be ready to take orders from the General at Head-Quarters. It is a pity also that the honorable member could not abstain from gibing. What I may have opposed in. a former session has nothing to do with the question. To-night he treated me most discourteously. </para>
