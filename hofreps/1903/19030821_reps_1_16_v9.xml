                        <para>- I trust that honorable members will not be dismayed by the array of books piled up in front of me. They merely contain statutes to which I wish to refer, because I think that in dealing with matters like this it would be well if each one of us gave the chapter and verse of his authority. So far as my inquiries have gone, they do not lead me to hope for any success from the passing of legislation of the kind proposed. But in opposing a measure which embodies what is thought to be a popular idea, and which, according to the Attorney-General, marks a new phase in civilization, it behoves me to investigate the matter very thoroughly. So far from this marking a new phase of civilization, or being, as the right honorable member for South Australia has said, the beginning of an absolutely new line of policy, my researches show that nothing is older than legislation of this kind, and that nothing has been tried more frequently, or has failed more signally, than the methods which it seeks to re-introduce. </para>

                            <para>- No. They were tried, not under the conditions of a tremendous industrial ramification, such as exists today, but under conditions so much simpler that they might have been expected to succeed then if it is possible for them to succeed at all. To-day the complication of industrial relations makes success impossible, seeing that it could not be obtained under much less complicated social conditions. A matter of this kind, however, is not one upon which we should express . our opinions too positively. The House, I take it, is trying to arrive at what I may call a judicial sentence upon the question. It wants to pass legislation which will be in the interest, not of one section of the community alone, but of the whole people. It is on the ground that it will not benefit the whole people that I base my opposition against the Bill. When I heard the fine flowing sentences of the Attorney-General in regard to the beautiful prospects now opening out before us, I could not help thinking of the lines of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brunton</inline> Stephens - </para>

                            <para>- We are not now engaged on an inquiry into the origin of good and evil, or into the reason why they exist side by side, or why the Omnipotent appears unable to suppress the bad and uphold the good. We know only that good and evil do exist in the world together, and that the fight between them has been eternal. I do not intend, in my references to the past, to go too far back into history, lest it be said that we are losing ourselves in the misty realms of antiquity ; and my quotations will be chiefly from English sources. I intend to show what our ancestors did, and how they tried to meet the difficulties which confronted them. We must not think that the law of competition did not exist in their days, or that they adopted methods differing from those now proposed to try to evade it. They framed what are known as customary laws, and endeavoured to prevent competition altogether. That is the object of the Bill. This legislation, if it means anything, means practically the limitation of competition. I think all are agreed upon that. What happened in England? We find that at a very early period - certainly as early as the eighth century - what are known as guilds sprang into existence. They were in a sense the prototypes of the trades unions of to-day. I do not go so far as some, and say that they were absolutely of the type of present day unions, but making allowances for the differences between the two periods, especially in regard to means of communication and locomotion, a great similarity is seen to exist between them. Their object was to give effect to what is very largely the ruling idea in men's minds today - the desire to, as far as possible, settle things. In the endeavour to do .this they so regulated matters that the regulations became the customary laws to which I have referred, and these laws became so strong that for two or three centuries no legislation was passed to interfere with them. From about the eighth to the twelfth century there was scarcely any legislation in regard to the matters with which they dealt. It was thought impossible that any one could depart from the rules laid down for the regulation of labour and industry in the small towns where the tradesmen congregated together. When they did start to legislate, they nearly always inserted in their statutes a preamble expressing surprise that " divers wicked persons " had departed from the customary law, and they then proceeded to legislate against such departures. Nor can it be thought, when we hear men objecting to the introduction of labour-saving machinery, that this is a new thing, because as early as 1105 protests were made against the use of windmills, on the ground that the mills were doing, in the grinding of corn and the raising of water, what hitherto men had been employed to do. People in those times also thought that there should be laws regulating prices, and they enacted on what seemed to them incontestably good grounds that no one should undersell his neighbour. Goods had to be brought to particular market places for sale to prevent any departure from the customary law. Possibly one of the earliest English statutes on the subject shows how much regard was paid to these matters, and how much surprise was felt that any one should be able to depart from the customary law - from what I might call the common rale ; because that customary law was practically what is termed in this Bill the common rule. The statute 51, Henry III., passed in 1266, enacts that bread and ale shall be sold at the price of corn. It says - </para>

                    <para class="block">There was very little chance of escape from the definite statements of those days. Everything was made clear and simple enough, and one cannot help being struck with the idea that if some of our latter-day lawyers could possibly draw up the provisions of our Acts with the same clearness we should have no doubt as to the interpretation of our Acts of Parliament. In those days they were so anxious that the common rule should not be departed from that they contested every effort to introduce anything new. The honorable member for Newcastle may be interested to know that what we know as coal nowadays - then known as sea coal to distinguish it from charcoal - was the subject of a special ordinance. When the coal was first brought' in by ships they proceeded to legislate against it, and they were never at a loss for words to express their reason for taking action. As far back as 1306, we find an ordinance in these simple words - </para>

                            <para>- I am opposed to the regulation of wages and also to any attempt to regulate prices. They were very much interested in the price of ale in the old days, because it seems to have been one of the articles with regard to which they legislated most frequently. Some of the brewers evidently went beyond the mark, and they passed another Act regulating the price of ale, ac-' cording to the price of corn. They continued from time to time to pass certain ordinances, and one Act provided that " wine shall be sold at a reasonable price." Unfortunately, as they pointed out shortly afterwards, wicked people would not understand the meaning of "reasonable," but construed it as reasonable to gain something for themselves. During the plague that had taken place in London, such a large number of men had died that immediately afterwards the law of competition began to assert itself in spite of the law of custom, and we find an ordinance passed in 1349 reading as follows : - </para>

                    <para class="block">It was then stated that the fish must be sold by day, and in the presence of others. We are now trying to do much the same thing. Legislation failed in the old days, and it will fail now, or, if successful, it will stamp out all human progress. Our forefathers were so possessed with the idea that no one should go out of his trade that they made a special ordinance making provision to that effect. We find the first instance of a true measure of arbitration - apart from the assizes where the mayors met together and arranged matters- as far back as the year 1355, when by statute it was declared that there should be six mediators to decide all questions arising between buyers and sellers. We are proposing three mediators, and are to that extent departing from the old custom. These six mediator's met and absolutely decided all questions arising between buyers and sellers, and we propose practically that three mediators shall perform the same office. What failed then will fail now. So far from the steps which we are now being asked to take marking a new era,, they will simply result in the revival of an old custom. In the olden clays they carried their regulations into everything. They did not stop halfway. Merchants were not allowed to enhance the prices of merchandise, and lest one merchant should interfere with another it was decreed that they should use only one class of goods. In 1336, during the reign of Edward III., chapter 6, we find it declared, " The handicraftsman shall use but one mystery." Of course, " mystery " is an old English word which means a trade. But they added, " The women may work as they did." That is the first instance upon record in which the women were not interfered with by regulation. In the same year, they decided to regulate the diet and the apparel of servants. They declared what meals servants should eat during the day, when they should be fed, and how much they should consume. They forgot to exact that they should all have the same digestions. They regulated the apparel and handicraft of the yeomen and their wives and children. They then went on to declare what apparel a gentleman under the estate of knights should wear and what esquires possessed of 200 marks of land should wear, and also their wives and children. They also prescribed the apparel of merchants, citizens, burgesses, and handicraftsmen, together with that of knights who had lands within the yearly value of 200 marks, and of knights and ladies who had lands within the yearly value of 400 marks. Similarly they declared what- apparel should be vorn by the several sorts of clerks. I wish honorable members distinctly to understand that these were not in ' any sense of the word dead statutes. They prescribed the apparel which should be worn by the. various kinds of clerks, by ploughmen, and others of mean estate, and set out the forfeitures which were to be exacted for offences against the ordinance. They further declared - </para>

It will not surprise honorable members to hear that they were all so thunderstruck with this result that they made still further efforts to settle the whole matter by statute. Accordingly, in 1368 they again enacted that the Statute of Labourers should be executed. Thus it will be seen that they still doggedly pursued the same methods. Notwithstanding that they were repeatedly compelled to acknowledge that the statutes had not been observed they went on in the same simpler-fashion- -as if nothing had occurred - and with the same disregard of the inevitable result.

                    <para class="block">Apparently at this time they began to determine what things might be gilded with silver and gold and what might not. In 1414 a statute was enacted regulating the yearly wages of chaplains and parish priests. No doubt there was a customary wage for ' these people just as there was for everybody else, and persons who departed from it were regarded with very grave suspicion. I shall give the House various illustrations of the extent to which they carried out their system of regulating trade, and any one who has observed the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in New Zealand, as well as that in force in New South Wales, must realize that, when we come to regulate prices, we shall have to carry out this system to the same extent. They even passed a law declaring that patten-makers - that is the makers of clogs, such as are still used in the North of England - should not employ asp wood in their manufacture. That law was deemed to be 'necessary because there was not a very great supply of asp wood available, and the use of it by patten-makers caused the price to be raised against the shaft-makers. They declared also that no one should gild any sheaths or metals " but silver and the ornaments of Holy Church." In 1423 they declared that masons should not "confederate themselves in chapters and assemblies," and that justices of the peace should punish servants, masons, &amp;c., for taking unreasonable wages. They did not invariably set forth what the rates of wages should be, because they had to be determined according to the dearth or otherwise of victuals. If a man, charged with taking unreasonable wages, was able to show that the cost of living had increased, it was considered that there was some excuse for his action, and he was allowed to remain at liberty ; but if he could not do so he was committed "to the House of Correction. In 1433 they declared also what the wax chandlers should take " for their work of wax." Then we find that in 1436 they declared a restraint of unlawful orders made by masters of guilds, fraternities, and other companies. It appears that these people desired to depart from the customary law. and to keep the whole trade in their own hands. This was considered to to be improper, and an effort was made to pub a stop to it. In looking through these old laws one cannot fail to be struck by the enormous number of regulations that were made in relation to the woollen trade, which, of course, was then the greatest trade in England. The authorities appear to have been continually dealing wibh that industry. But I do not propose to do more than quote a few of the- rules made concerning it. We find that they declared again and again what the weavers and others were to bake. In 1442 four wardens of the worsted-weavers of Norwich were appointed yearly to inspect and regulate the worsted industry in that city, while two were appointed for Norfolk. Two years later it was declared that a servant in husbandry " purporting to depart from his master " must give him half a year's warning. This is a curious instance of how far old customs still regulate many of our actions, for this principle is still observed in relation to leases. If one engages a man by the year and dismisses him without giving him six months' notice he is liable, or if he allows him at the end of the twelve months' period to continue in his employ without terminating the agreement, the law presumes that the servant has been engaged for another year, and he can recover accordingly. There is a later practice under which the notice has been cut down to three months ; but this is, indeed, a curious illustration of the way in which the effects of some of these old laws are still felt by us. It may readily be imagined that when the desire to regulate everything was abroad, the authorities did not forget bo deal wibh the abborneysablaw. They did so in this way - </para>

I have already pointed out that the authorities dealt very thoroughly with the regulation of prices of apparel, and I desire to quote- from another quaint law, 22 Edward IV., 1482, in which it was declared that divers statutes and ordinances had been made touching the restraint of excessive apparel, and that by reason of the non due execution of the same the King's realm " was fallen into great misery and poverty."" Therefore it was provided that - </para>

                    <para class="block">Then we have a truly Kingstonian touch, if I may use that expression, in the words- " Penalty £20." In the same statute the price of clothes worn by labourers was also dealt with, the law determining whether a piece of cloth should be sold at so much per yard or at so much for the piece. The clothing worn by the various knights was likewise dealt with, and a regulation was framed concerning the length of the gowns to be worn by all persons " under the estate of a lord," in order that decency might be observed. The penalty for a contravention of this law was fixed at 20s., but I have not been able to discover why an exception was made in the case of a lord. While they were dealing wibh all these matters, they did not forget the extent to which archery was practised in those days, and they took care to regulate the price of bows. Ib was also declared that if a man made a bow of one class, he should make, say, fo.ur of another, the desire being apparently that labour should be distributed equally amongst those employed in working up the different classes of wood, or else that a better class of goods should be obtained. In 1485, the duties of shoemakers, tanners and curriers were Very clearly set forth in laws, and so much attention was paid <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> details that ib was declared that the makers of new shoes should not meddle with the menders of old ones. . As far back as 1385, there had been almost serious trouble between the shoemakers and the cobblers, and the authorities determined the allotment of their work. The King actually had bo enlist the services of the Lord Mayor of London to endeavour to settle the dispute which existed between these tradesmen. Some of the reasons given for the decisions are exceedingly amusing, but not one whit less entertaining than are those given by </para>

It was stated that the authorities did not want people to be deceived, and they went on to declare that if any one dealt with old shoes he should not meddle with new shoes.

The shoemakers declared, during the course of a fierce argument, that if a boot had to be half soled new leather might be used, but if the full length of the sole had to be replaced the work should go to the shoemaker and not to the cobbler.

A man was not allowed to permit these houses to fall into a state of decay, and the extent of land which should exist round each house was also declared. Thus the proposal in regard to " three acres and a cow " had its foundation in a very ancient law. At that time the people were so limited in number that they were all under control, and custom became so strong that the great bulk of the people adhered strictly to it. </para>

                            <para>- I am trying to point out that the legislation which we are being asked to pass must prove ineffective. The object aimed at cannot be achieved unless we give the Court power to make common rules settling the prices of commodities as well as the rates of wages ; and I am showing that in the past people were not afraid to push their expedients to what they conceived te be their logical conclusions. I hope, by showing that in spite of much more thorough attempts to regulate industry and trade at a time when industrial relations were much less complex than they are now, nothing but failure came from the legislation introduced, to prove that the legislation now proposed cannot hope to succeed, and will hinder rather than help people in the gaining of comfortable livelihoods. In 1514 laws were passed regulating the wages of several sorts of servants in husbandry, and of artificers and labourers ; specifying the hours at which they should begin and end their day's work ; and even the time they should have fur meals and for sleep, the curious exception being made in favour of London workmen that they might continue to ask the wages which they were receiving before the alteration of the law. During the reigns of Henry VIII. and Elizabeth the principle df competition exerted itself so strongly, and so little respect was paid to the customary laws, that the legislators tried very hard to bring people back to the old state of things. They were successful only, so far "as I can judge, in increasing the misery and poverty of the community. That, of course, was not their object, but no other result came from their attempt to over-ride economic laws. To show how far they proceeded in their attempts to regulate industry, I will read the opening words of a Statute passed to control the rope-making industry at the town of Burport - </para>

                            <para>- In those times men had to live in particular towns, and even in particular parts of a town, and the conditions of life were quite simple. If attempts to regulate industry failed then, they will fail still more signally now. Otherwise the lessons of history are of no use to us. For the information of those who are curious, I might add that, notwithstanding this legislation, the town utterly decayed. Acts were also passed to prevent butchers from tanning the hides of the animals they killed, any butcher keeping ' a tan house being liable to a forfeit of 6s.' 8d. per day. In 1531 it was also decreed that no brewer should be a cooper, and mend or make his own casks. To show how clearly we are retrograding from our position of to-day, I may mention that recently a member of the Coopers' Union waited upon a firm which employs a man to hammer tight the hoops on casks of tallow in their store, and informed them that an expert cooper should be employed to do the work. </para>

                            <para>- No ; though I cannot be held responsible for that I think, indeed, that I was to a great degree responsible for the alteration of the rules of the New South Wales Court regarding the admission of barristers. Prior to going to the Bar, I had lost everything I possessed, and had to go out surveying again. At the same time I was continuing my legal studies. The rules of the Court, however, then provided that no student should do anything towards the earning of a livelihood during the year preceding his admission. Honorable members can imagine what I felt about such a rule as that. My sense of the injustice of that rule has made me always inclined to fight strongly against similar restrictions. I think that no man should be allowed to hold himself out as being a member of a craft or profession unless he has' shown that he possesses the skill or knowledge required to enable him to undertake the work required from such' a person. I would, however, allow any man to plead the case of another in a Court if that other person was willing to allow him to do so. In 1532 the Act 24 Henry VIII. decreed that tanned leather should not be sold except in open fairs and markets after it had been searched and sealed, and ordinances were passed declaring how curriers should do their work, and what tools they should use.

It was recognised that butchers could not sell mutton at such prices as were fixed, unless they were able to buy their sheep at a fair rate.

                            <para>- Professor Thorold Rogers fixes the period at which the poor people of England were most favorably situated as between 1370 and 1400. He says that the improvement in their condition was due to the operation of the law of competition. He in effect says they had then managed to get beyond the law of custom, and it was not until the supply of labour became a little too great that the statutes were able to be used as instruments to grind down the people. He points out further that at that period wages did not depend altogether upon the prices of victuals, which were lower than for a century before. He also points out that the condition of the working classes was largely due to the fact that many of the workmen were able to obtain land, and that what was known as the stock-lease system of farming was attended with great advantage to the people.

They went so far as to state what kind of leather should be used by bookbinders. In 1533 an Act was passed dealing with the cloth-makers of Worcestershire, and this affords a singular instance of how far they attempted to carry their regulations. We are now proposing to make a common law applying to the whole State. But they found out in the sixteenth century that they could not do that, because it drove people from one place to another. The trade refused to be regulated, and we know that it is impossible for any trade to be regulated by men who have no interest in it, and no knowledge of it. This Act was passed in accordance with a petition from the people of the city of Worcester. It reads as follows : - </para>

As they saw that the migration of the people back from the country to the cities must not be interfered with, they further decreed that the rents of the houses in the towns should not be increased beyond the rates which had prevailed for the previous twenty years. This Act continued operative for twelve years. Then it was decreed that cloths, white and coloured, under certain sizes, were to be carried over the sea unbarbed and unshorn. The idea underlying that Act was to provide employment to shearmen. In 1535 they laid down the customs to be observed in the leather trade, and how it was to be conducted on the sea.

                    <para class="block">They declared that none of these things should be used, and that a man ought to be utterly damned if he employed them. In 1549 they decreed that cattle, butter, and cheese must be sold at the fairs and markets, and it was only three years later that they declared who should be allowed to buy and sell wool, " and at what times," and who should not do so. They also passed an Act limiting the persons " who shall weave or make broad woollen cloth," and an Act against regrators, forestallers, and ingrossers. In the same year they rehearsed their former statement about the stuffing of feather beds, bolsters, mattrasses, and cushions, and passed an Act to prevent the use of gigmills on the ground that their employment would be an injury to those engaged in the trade. In the f ollowing year another Act was passed for the " Assize of Fuel," and still another affecting the buying and currying of leather. In 1 554 an Act was passed restricting the carrying of corn, victuals, and wood over-sea - by reason whereof the said corn, victuals, and wood are grown unto a wonderful dearth, and extreme prices, to the great detriment of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para class="block">In Mary's time they declared who might carry on the trade of the making of " ruffles, sattens, satten reverses, and fustians," in Norwich. Four wardens were appointed, and were given full authority to deal with the trade, and no one was allowed to practice or occupy the trade unless he had been apprenticed for the full term of seven years. It had already provided that no butcher should be a tanner, and the several duties of tenners, curriers, and shoemakers were also set forth. In 1562 what was probably the greatest of these Acts was passed, for it brought together a greater number of the old laws than any other measure had done. Another provision was that oaks were to be felled "in barking time only." They endeavoured to deal practically with every subject in an Act commonly known as 5 Elizabeth, Chap. 4. I make no excuse for reading an extract from this law, because it is very much on the lines of the Bill before us, and the reasons given for the passage of the Act were very similar to those now advanced in support of this Bill. The Act set forth that- </para>

                    <para class="block">That is exactly what we are proposing to-day in this Bill. If there is one argument more than another which is continually being advanced in support of this measure, it is that we should give the labourer a convenient proportion of wages. The people of England tried to do so in these early days, and went further than . we have any idea of going. I must say also that they dealt with the question in a much more logical way than we are proposing to deal with it. They carried this system of regulation so far that any man who was under the age of thirty years, and had been trained in one art or trade, was required to retain that art or trade. It was declared that he should not depart from it. It was provided that a master should not be allowed to dismiss his servant except in certain circumstances, the Act declaring that certain penalties should be incurred by any master, mistress, or dame who, having retained a Servant - shall put away the same servant before the end of his term, unless it be for some reasonable and sufficient cause, to be allowed before two justices of the peace. Instead of requiring the parties to go before two justices of the peace, we declare that they shall go before a Justice of the High Court and two assessors. What is the difference ? I fail to see that there is any difference between the two positions. A man was not allowed to put away his servant without reasonable cause, and the servant was not allowed to depart from his master unless he also could show reasonable cause for so doing. He was bound to work for him, and to do his work - as one Act quaintly put it - " honestly and willingly." We provide in this Bill that assessors shall be called together to meet and discuss questions relating to wages. But in this old law it was provided that - </para>
                    <para>Forthe declaration and limitation and what wages servants, labourers, artificers, either by the year or day, or otherwise, shall have and receive, be it enacted by the authorit}' of this present Parliament that the justices of peace of every shire . . . and the sheriff of that county . . . and every mayor, bailiff or other head officer within any city or town corporate wherein is any justice of peace . . shall yearly at every general sessions first to be holden and kept after Easter, or at some time convenient within six weeks next following . . assemble themselves together ; and . . . calling unto them such discreet and grave persons of the said county . . . as they shall think meet, and conferring together respecting the plenty or scarcity of the time and other circumstances necessarily to be considered - " Other circumstances necessarily to be considered." That is' a very simple way of stating the position. I wish we would deal with it in the same fashion. The law continued - shall have authority by virtue thereof. . . to limit, rate, and appoint the wages. </para>
                    <para>This is the most comprehensive Act that has ever been passed in any country ; but it entirely failed to effect its object. Its object was to neutralise the operation of the law of competition, but it succeeded only in destroying competition, so far as the labourers were concerned, because, to a certain extent, they could not avoid it. It tended to keep them in poverty, and this law, in company with the Poor </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. I shall not. weary the House with quotations from many more of these statutes, but I shall now give what appears to me to be a complete admission by these old authorities of the failure of their legislation. It appears that a statute relating to the price of casks for ale and beer had been passed, but that the rate fixed was rather too low, and a. law was therefore passed declaring that whereas - such as do make the said vessels cannot make and sell any such barrels ... at the prices expressed . . . but to their great loss and. hindrance, whereby the mystery,, trade, and faculty of the said coopers is utterly overthrown, to the impoverishment and utter undoing of them, their wives, children, and families, as is most evident, the price of these vessels should be "rated anew, and forfeiture should take place if they were not sold at the rate fixed. When they discovered that this old law had tended to the impoverishment of the coopers, one would have thought that the utter futility of endeavouring to deal with these matters by legislative enactment, would have forced itself upon their minds. But nothing of the sort occurred. They seem to have ascribed a new power to Parliament, and to have said, "Let us make another start." In the Act in which this declaration was made, it was set forth that a new beginning would be made. That is a marvellous instance of the desire for unnecessary interference on the part of Parliaments - a desire on the part of men to interfere with matters which it is really impossible for Parliament to regulate. Passing over a number of these old Acts, I come now to one which I think indicates the difficulty that may arise in dealing with these questions. A famous dispute occurred in 1604 . between the plasterers and painters! The " villains of plasterers," according to the quaint language of the painters who were making a protest, had interfered with the painting trade, and we find that a law was accordingly passed setting forth that - </para>

Is there not at the present time a big dispute in West Sydney as to the work which relates to the shipwrights and the joiners employed in the ship-building trade ? I need scarcely refer to the still greater strikes on the Tyne in the years 1891-2-3. </para>

                            <para>- In 1632 a serious struggle took place between the carpenters and joiners, and an endeavour was made to determine the work relating to each trade. The disputants were very fortunate in that case, as they were able to hit upon a common ground. When they came to deal with the making of coffins they determined that it was work in which both carpenters and joiners might engage. Quite a number of Acts were passed in the reign of Charles II. to regulate the price of coal and the measures in which it should be sold, and a celebrated statute was enacted for the encouragement of the woollen manufacture, which provided that no person should be buried in linen, flax, or hemp. </para>

I pass by various Acts which were passed in the reign of George I. for the encouragement of the manufacture of woollens and silk, though I may mention in passing that they even framed enactments regulating the manufacture of bricks and tiles; and the size of the bricks used now in this country is laid down in some of those Acts. Not only were decrees passed in regard to the size and process of manufacture, but it was required that clay should be dug out of the pits only during one-half of the year, and the bricks burned only during the other half of the year.

In 1804 a very similar enactment was passed. I submit that I have now proved my case so far as it depends upon a statement of what has been done by Parliament in times gone by. I can understand legislation to compel men to resort to arbitration under pain of a penalty for not doing so, but the measure goes so much beyond that that I cannot support it, because I have shown that all attempts to compel the observance of awards have failed and must fail. It is somewhat singular that I have been able to find no statutes whose provisions are directed towards the improvement of the conditions of persons engaged in domestic and agricultural service, though I do not see how such an improvement could be effected by Act of Parliament. We often hear of men striking for higher wages, but what they should strike for, if it were possible to obtain it, is better employment. While I have confined my quotations to English. Acts of Parliament, I could also quote similar legislation from the statute-books of Germany, and France. The French laws, passed during a period of 1,000 years were found so oppressive that they were finally abolished by the people themselves. So much bitterness was felt at the limitation of trade which they created that many of the leaders of the corporations which the laws had been passed to protect were guillotined at the time of the Revolution, and the people re-affirmed, in the famous declaration of rights in 1 797, the words that Turgot, had used sixteen years before, the - inalienable right of every man to the possession of his own labour and industry ; his right to be able to sell and dispose of his labour as seemed to him best. </para>

                            <para>- There may be disputes between employers and employed, but there can, or rather should, never be a fight between capital and labour. They must always go hand-in-hand. It should be made perfectly plain that capital must be encouraged by every means in our power. It has been created by labour, and we should do all we can for its security. The mediaeval legislator tried to fix wages, and also to even fix the labourer to the station and place in which he was born. Even the consumer was not left to his own devices, but laws were made as to his food, his drink, and his garments. Custom and law bound industry with strong bonds, and progress has consisted in breaking them, and substituting for the commands of the State freedom of contract, and freedom of competition. Nor is most of the factory legislation in contravention of this, because, for the greater part, it assures the health and education of children, and by checking the licence of a few gives real freedom to thousands. </para>

                            <para>- No, it does not. I said " real freedom." I admit that it is very hard to define the strict boundary at which the State should cease to make laws. But so far as my knowledge and experience go - and I have not spoken, I hope, with positive assurance - I believe that we should at least try to break some fresh ground instead of going back to the musty fusty past, and adopting measures which have proved to be failures. Let us adopt only that which is soundest and best. I submit that we are not being asked to do that at present. The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life, and now the wealth of the nation is given to the workers more and more, and in better proportion to the value of their work, than in the past. Yet it was only within the last century that the law of competition came into full force. Before that custom ruled everything, and the labourer did not get so large a share of the results of his work as at present. To my mind industrial liberty means a maximum of individual freedom with a minimum of Government control, and is historically the outcome of centuries of striving against all kinds of rigid customs, caprices of arbitrary power, and governmental regulation of industry, which, for the most part, have been either useless or mischievous. The principle of competition applied to wages works towards the payment of equal wages for equal efficiency, and no scheme of socialism ever aimed at more perfect equality. With competition in full play the demand every day should absorb the whole available supply of labour. Sometimes the operation of this law is rude and imperfect, because of the want of proper organization on the part of labour. The very basis of perfect competition is perfect liberty, but there is a difficulty in practice, because labour in not properly organized. It appears to me that the remedy lies rather in teaching labour how to organize itself so that true collective bargaining can be brought into play. </para>

If the honorable member has any doubt of that he should read what Harriet Martineau has to say upon her times, or Kingsley, in his novel "Yeast." Presumably the minimum wage is to be higher than that which would be fixed as the natural result of competition. If not, where is the excuse for the proposed interference? It would be absurd to waste time and money in bringing into existence all the machinery now proposed, when the same result could be brought about at once by giving competition full play. If the minimum wage be raised above the competitive rate does not the honorable member for Melbourne Ports see that there must be a lessened demand for labour. </para>

                            <para>- Does not the honorable member see that there must be a smaller demand for labour, and that the works, which are barely paying at the lesser rate, must be closed up unless some cheaper method of production were employed, or prices were raised. Then again, if prices were raised the demand would be checked, and this in its turn Would lessen production. If the mere insistence upon . a certain rate could secure it, why should we fix the standard so low 1 Why should not we take the highest rate of wages paid in any trade, and fix that as the lowest rate ? If an industry were contracted, what would become of the standard wage ? Some might have it, but others would have no wage. If it were decreed that all should work in turn, the worker would be in no better condition, because, although the rate of wages would be good, the amount which he would receive would be small. If we want equality let it not be equality of want or of destitution. It has been well observed " that the State is the least of the powers which govern us, and that the enforcement of laws often proves much more difficult than their enactment." It has further been observed " that the end higher than all other ends is the formation of character." Are we not in effect trying to build up a nation by destroying by successive acts of interference, that spirit of responsibility and self-reliance of the people which alone makes a nation ? Shall we not bring about the system of caste, which in India has proved so fatal, and develop a degraded manhood, which will be unable to raise itself up, or to make any protest against what is going on? I ask whether from the point of view of the workmen it is desirable that the law should ever become so strong as to be able to regulate everything they do. I know that in the case of some men, including the right honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kingston,</inline> the desire to reduce things to order is so strong that they cannot resist the temptation to bring everything under control. This tendency, however, seems to me to be one of the greatest dangers which we have to fear. The fatal tendency of every such measure as that now before us is to become a precedent for still further encroachments upon individual action. It is not by the wax and parchment of the lawyers that the independence of men can be preserved. Those men flourish best who can think and act for themselves, and who are least regardful of such extraordinary laws as that now proposed. We are not only asked  to prevent the free use of liberty, but to rob men of all they have. The Government is to provide for everything, see everything, know everything, and the whole administration is to be carried on under the idea that no man knows his own interests and that no man can take care of himself. How can we decide for men whether wealth is to be produced by following certain occupations ? They cannot decide it for themselves without a trial. Let us for one moment consider the failures which take place every day. If we decree the amount of wages which a man shall pay, why should we not also decree the rate of profit which he is to receive and also show where it is to come from % How would the principles which it is now sought to apply operate in small towns? We should not lose ourselves in the larger mazes of the State, but should consider for a moment how the principles of this measure would apply to small communities of people as in municipalities. Every one must admit that they would prove a failure, and even though our horizon may be extended, the prospect of failure is neither removed nor lessened. I cannot do better than quote the remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Samuel</inline> Gompers, the president of the great American Labour Federation, who says that " strikes are ah expression of discontent in a highly-civilized country." In India there are none, in China there are none; but they have some things worse - a degraded, debased, and demoralized manhood. Labour insists on the right to go where it will, to stay where it will, or to change its employment. It is better for human progress and economic advantage to have awards violated than enforced. Let us put it to ourselves : Suppose an award were given by the Arbitration Court, calling upon an employer to pay a rate of wages in excess of those which he thought he would be able to give, could the Court compel him to keep- his works open? Certainly not. It is proposed that if he can show good cause he shall be allowed to close down his works'. On the other hand, if a workman refuses to work at the rate of wages decided upon, is he to be kept at his trade, is he to be driven to work by a policeman or by a squad of soldiers ? J Just think of what the position would be if we were a nation of sullen, resentful, unwilling workers. What would become of men who had so little love of freedom or liberty that they would not dare to throw down their tools and declare that they would not work ? The right to strike is one of the most sacred of the liberties of men. </para>

When the spirit which has caused us to fight dies out of our people we shall become as the Peruvians of olden days, or as the hordes of India, bound down by iron laws. Are we to do anything that would be calculated to bring about any such conditions here ? Is there no manhood in our people to assert itself? I venture to say that there is, and that it will be a fatal day when our people are willing to submit to the dictation of Government as to whether or when they shall work. If the day came when men, whether employers or employes, refused to accept such dictation, I should support them in taking up arms, if necessary, in order to assert their right to do their best according to the spirit which the Almighty has implanted in them.

It now turns out that there is no legislative solution at all, and that the true solution requires as its condition the removal of the mischievous meddling of the past. </para>

                    E. GROOM (Darling Downs).Whilst I am, to a certain extent, in favour of the principle for which the member for Kalgoorlie is contending, I would point out that in clause 70 of the Judiciary Bill provision is made that persons charged with indictable offences, and who are without adequate means, shall be defended by counsel, whose expenses shall be paid by the Commonwealth. In any proceedings before a court martial some such provision as the honorable member for Kalgoorlie desires to insert here is very necessary. In that case, a man might be far removed from any centre of population, his trial might be hurried, and he might be executed speedily without being afforded a fair opportunity to prepare his defence. But seeing that in the Judiciary Bill provision has been made for' his defence before the Civil Court if he is without means, I scarcely think the Commonwealth should be called upon to retain the services of counsel upon all occasions.

                    <para>- The Minister for Home Affairs, I presume, intends to limit the operation of this provision to time of peace. I would point out to him that it is very necessary to give the General Officer Commanding the forces power to impose the death penalty in time of war. If a soldier is entitled to be defended by counsel in time of war, it will be simply impossible to put any man to death. He may go to sleep at his post, even though the fate of his country depends upon his vigilance, or he may betray his country by giving away military secrets to an enemy. In my judgment it is absolutely necessary that the General Officer Commanding shall be vested with this power in time of war. </para>

                        <para>- No; he is the controlling force. I find that a procedure very similar to that which I propose is followed in Switzerland. The supreme control over the military there rests with the Federal Assembly and it appoints a Federal Council, the members of which have charge of the several departments dealing with these matters, This measure has been described as a Bill of regulations, and it seems to me that we have left a great many matters to be dealt with by regulations. They are so important a part of a measure of this character that we should have greater supervision over them. But many of a far-reaching character are framed by the officer commanding, and are passed by the Governor-General in Council, although this Parliament is ignorant of their effect. </para>

Each succeeding officer holds different views, and the whole service is revolutionized by the new authority. A Council of the kind I suggest should have power to frame regulations. The Minister smiles, but he knows that there is a very great reason for the adoption of this amendment. The service at present is altogether unsatisfactory. </para>

That is one strong reason why we should agree to this amendment. </para>

The question of expenditure is involved in this matter. It is notorious that an enormous sum of money has been wasted on the defence forces of Victoria, owing to the frequent changes made in their control. Previous State Commandants, such as Colonel Disney, Colonel Walker, and Colonel Brownrigg advocated a certain definite policy-- </para>

                        <para>- These changes of management lead to the adoption of different lines of expenditure. In company with the honorable member for Kooyong, I recently visited the forts at Port Phillip Heads, and I noticed that tens of thousands of pounds had been spent in building barracks. I found that barracks had been erected at Portsea at a cost of over £4,000, while the officers' quarters there involved an expenditure of about £2,000. Victoria has either footed the bill or is now paying interest in connexion with, this expenditure. The barracks, however, are empty. There is not a sufficient number of men at the Heads to constitute a relief party ; but a large number are acting as bandsmen, and in other capacities at head-quarters, thus helping to advance the pretensions of the staff. The whole policy has been changed. </para>

Honorable members from the other States should join with me in seeing that a system of management is set up which will prevent this wilful waste. I can assure honorable members that tens of thousands of pounds have been wasted on so-called defences simply because we have not had any definite line of management. </para>

                        <para>- Because great pressure has been brought to bear to prevent the adoption of that course. My right honorable friend knows full well that he had a great deal of trouble whilst administering the Department for Defence, and if rumour be correct he was glad to get out of it. He knows that the present management of the forces is by no means satisfactory, and that it cannot be satisfactory while the control rests with one man, do matter how worthy ari officer he may be. I know nothing about Major-General Hutton's qualifications, but I am aware that there is very general dissatisfaction throughout the forces, and therefore some change such as I have suggested should be made. I understand that the Minister is prepared to agree to the creation of a Board of Advice, but that Board would act only when the Minister submitted matters to it. </para>

The Imperial Parliament every year revises its legislation of this character. We do not do so. We transmit to other authorities the power to make regulations, and we lose all control over them. I wish to test the feeling of the Committee, and unless my right honorable friend will agree to the appointment of a Board of Appeal I shall divide the Committee. My desire is that the lowest roan in the ranks shall have some authority to which he can appeal. </para>

                        <para>- I am very sorry that I cannot accept the proposed new clause, because I recognise that the honorable member for Melbourne Ports desires to meet my wishes. We have, however, adopted a military system under which a General Officer Commanding has been appointed to control the whole of the Forces of Australia, subject to the direction of the Minister for Defence,, who is responsible to Parliament. Although considerable power" is given to that officer, I do not think that injustice is likely to be done, as all such acts as appointments and promotions, the re-organization of the Forces, the spending of money, and other important, features of administration can only be done - with the approval of the Minister. With regard to internal discipline and administration, and the moving of forces from one place to another, the General Officer Commanding must be given a pretty free hand, because it would not be advisable for the Minister to unduly interfere in such matters. What the honorable member proposes, however, would, if adopted, quite upset the existing system. Whilst I am aware that in England the Minister responsible for the control of the Navy is assisted in his administration by the advice of a Board of expert officers of great experience and knowledge, I think that he is virtually supreme. What the honorable member proposes, however, is to make the Minister only one of a number of persons who are to comprise a Council of Defence. He is to be associated with the General Officer Commanding, the Naval Commandant, the Senior District Commandant, the Senior Militia Officer, the Senior Volunteer Officer, two Members of Parliament, and the Secretary for Defence. </para>

My second objection is that the General Officer Commanding, who now takes his directions from the Minister, would, if he had an independent voice as a member of - the Council of Defence, be probably able to override the decisions of the Minister. In the same way, the Senior District Commandant, who is under the General Officer Commanding, would be able practically to flout his commands ; and so on, right down the list. I think the arrangement would be a mischievous one, and is absolutely unconstitutional, because it would abolish the parliamentary responsibility of the Minister. Then what is the Council to do?

                        <para>- It is not reasonable to expect that the Forces can be organized and consolidated without hurting the feelings of some persons. It would be impossible to take such a step in regard to any business having a number of branches without displeasing some one. It is easy to please people if one moves in the groove to which they are accustomed, but a reformer must propose changes, and invade the interests of others, to secure what, in his opinion, is best for the community at large. Thus, he becomes unpopular. But no one who is worth his salt can escape some unpopularity. The reorganization to which the honorable member refers has . interfered with some persons, and as a matter of course they cry out. To my mind, however - and I have been behind the scenes - the work has created surprisingly little dissatisfaction, and this is due to the efforts which have been made to consider, so far as possible, existing interests. I was told a short time ago that the Victorian Mounted Volunteer forces were very dissatisfied,, because they were to be enrolled as militia. But having taken the opinions of all their commissioned and noncommissioned officers, I find that 95 per cent, of them are quite satisfied with the new arrangement. </para>

                        <para>- The General Officer Commanding knows what is taking place all over Australia, and is therefore in a position to report to the Minister for the information of Parliament. But I do not see how the Council could get its information except through the General Officer Commanding, and I do not know of what use its report would be if it were based merely upon the report of that officer. What the honorable member proposes might be very well if we were dealing with a small area such as that comprised in this important State of Victoria, but it would not do for an immense area like that of the whole of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Their powers will be provided for under regulations. If, however, honorable members think it necessary, I am willing to insert in the Bill a substantive clause providing for the appointment of such a board to advise on all matters relating to 'the Defence Forces submitted to it by the Minister. The Minister could then summon the members of the Board even from the four corners of Australia whenever he required their advice in regard to any project of importance. I hope that the honorable member will accept such a provision, and nob press his amendment. What he proposes is really a change in our military system. I think it would be better, if we are to make such a change, to do away with the General Officer Commanding altogether, and appoint a board of experts such as they have in Switzerland, or such as the Admiralty Board in England. The military forces of England, however, are controlled, not by a Board, but by the Commander-in-Chief, who is subordinate to the Minister responsible to Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- There is no council which takes any part in the military administration and discipline in the same way as does the Admiralty Board in regard to the Navy. I can assure the honorable member that no such scheme as he indicates has yet been brought into force. The Bill has been framed upon the assumption that we shall have a General Officer Commanding and, therefore, a Council of Defence, with the - administrative powers suggested, would be altogether out of keeping witli the other provisions of the measure. I shall move the insertion of a new clause to take the place of that proposed by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. </para>

                        <para>- I have not seen the particulars as to the purposes for which the Council was created, but I read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brodrick's</inline> speech in the House of Commons, and I gathered that the Council was to have very large powers indeed. Here the difficulty seem to be that, although the Minister has control it is not- very often' exercised because of the fear that political influence may be too strongly exerted. In Victoria the Minister for Defence was frequently asked bo interfere, but, for the reason indicated, refused to do so. I should like to see a non-political board appointed, which would have control over even the General Officer Commanding. The Council of Defence in England must have very large powers, because its recommendation with regard to the number . of troops to be retained in South Africa was adopted in opposition to the military authorities, who considered that the number proposed was too large. I think that the proposal of the Minister may be accepted, in the hope that it will lead to the creation of a useful controlling body. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the honorable member for' Melbourne Ports will not. press his amendment. I think that I may fairly say that during the course of this debate I have hot displayed any great subservience to military authority or any great advocacy of the absolutism of that authority. I think a board such as the honorable member suggested would be entirely unworkable in view of the large area of the Commonwealth and its scattered population. There is no parallel between the Council of Defence in England and the Council which it is now proposed to constitute. The English Council is really a semi-political body, which is intended to harmonize the relations between the political and the military administrations upon all important matters of policy. One can understand the desirableness of such a board, in view of the conflict that has existed between the financial and the executive branches of the administration. The proposal of the honorable member is modelled upon the Council of Defence which existed in Victoria up to the time of the establishment of Federation, and the wording of the new clause, is practically the same as that of the section of the Victorian Act." The Victorian Council of Defence at times did very great service; but as a matter of fact every member of that Council for many years past was a resident of Melbourne, and it was very easy to call a meeting of that body. Very often valuable suggestions were offered by the junior members of the Board which proved of service to the administration, but during the term of one officer as Commandant, the Council of Defence simply served as a battle-field for the struggle which was waged between the Minister for Defence and the Commandant. Unfortunately the Council never possessed the power that it purported to exercise, because the Minister on the political, and the Commandant on the administrative side, exercised the real control. It must always be so, unless the command is put into commission as is the case with the Admiralty. I think that the Minister's proposal fairly meets the case. I think that from time to time it may be very desirable for the Minister to seek the advice of competent persons other than the Commandant, who, of course, will naturally be wedded to his own particular view. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member insinuates that the General Officer Commanding is a partisan. Reference has also been made to the Admiralty. We all know very well the history of the British Admiralty and the relationship which exists between it and the Ministry. In their well-known naval " text-book " <inline font-style="italic">Pinafore,</inline> Messrs. -Gilbert and Sullivan have characterized <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> H. Smith, who was a First Lord of the Admiralty, a very wealthy man, a successful bookseller, and a Minister of the Crown, in well-known lines which refer to him as an -administrator who never went to sea, -and who never used a great big D. I understand that the honorable member for Melbourne Ports desires to see the Minister occupying a seat upon a Council for Defence and associated with men who may be admirable judges of articles of commercial value, but who may be entirely destitute of military knowledge. Such a scheme could be satirised quite as much as was the English Admiralty control. Under the marvellous scheme which is suggested, the Council for Defence would be almost as large as a well-appointed regiment. When would this Board meet? It would meet every year at Cup time in Melbourne. I ask the honorable member for Melbourne Ports to accept the suggestion of the Minister for Defence. . </para>

                    <para>- After the observations of the honorable member for Dalley there is not much for me to add regarding this amendment. I am sure that its author could never have given his proposal serious thought. Does he desire to entirely dispense with Ministerial control ? Because that is apparently the object of his amendment. I say unhesitatingly that if his proposal were carried, the General Officer Commanding, if he had any respect for himself, would resign the next day. Honorable members are continually complaining of the expenditure upon the head-quarters staff, and yet the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, who is always preaching economy, desires to appoint another expensive board in connexion with defence matters. I agree with the honorable member for Dalley that this Board would probably meet in Melbourne once a year, which is generally the time fixed for the visit of the Squadron to this State. Further, the honorable member for Melbourne Ports proposes that the Minister for Defence shall be appointed to this Council. Does he desire that that officer shall have an equal voice with the Minister upon defence matters ? He also contemplates the appointment of two members of Parliament. What wisdom would they add to the deliberations of the Council f Talk about the Labour party ! Why this proposal is ten thousand times worse than any Labour caucus could ever be. It practically abolishes responsible government. I hold that the Minister is responsible to this House, and that the General Officer Commanding is responsible to the Minister. I trust that the Committee will not seriously entertain the amendment. The honorable member for Dalley referred to <inline font-style="italic">Pinafore,</inline> and it seems to me that the honorable member for Melbourne Ports must have 'obtained this inspiration from the book of that opera. No man' possessing a knowledge of military matters would submit such a proposition. </para>

                    <para>- I also join with other honorable members in urging the honorable member for Melbourne Ports to withdraw his amendment. Prompt action is necessary in times of emergency, and if these officers were scattered in various parts of the Commonwealth great expense and loss of time would be involved in bringing them together. When we had brought them together, what could we expect from subordinate officers ? Could we expect them to vote against the recommendation . of their own Commandant? The history of the Victorian Council of Defence gives only one case in which opposition was shown by a member of the Council to the views of his Commandant. Colonel Templeton on one occasion took this stand, and that is the only case on record. On many occasions the Victorian Minister for Defence acted independently of the Council, and succeeded in giving effect to his own views. If this proposal were adopted the same thing would probably occur again. I certainly think that such a body would be not only expensive but troublesome; that it would involve great delay in dealing with urgent matters, and that it would prove of very little service. I hope the amendment will be withdrawn. </para>

                    AUGER (Melbourne Ports).With the permission of the Committee, I beg to withdraw my amendment, but I intended to submit a proposal, to which the Minister for Defence has agreed, for the creation of a Board of Advice. That will be at least a step in the direction which I desire shall be taken in relation to the control oE our Forces. I am somewhat surprised at the argument used by the honorable member for Gippsland in regard to the question of expense, and the difficulty which would be experienced in bringing together the members of the Council. The question of cost is not considered in relation to the travelling expenses of the staff officers.

                    <para>- I hope that it will. In the case of the staff officers, the distance travelled by them in making inspections also counts for nothing. The honorable member for Gippsland will pardon me if I say that there is really nothing in his contention as to the delay that would be involved in bringing together the members of the Council, because the journey by rail between Sydney and Melbourne occupies only a few hours. A Council such as I propose could be called together at very short notice. </para>

                    <para>- Whilst many of us may approve of the object which the honorable member has in view, there are others who do not think that a clause of this description would accomplish that purpose. It might lead as it has done in other places, to sly drinking to an extent which could not be regulated. I shall vote, therefore, with the Government. Efforts in this direction have not been successful, so far as I am aware, in other countries, and I do not 'think they would be found of any service here. I have never held that moderate drinking isa vice. It is only unregulated drinking that may be described in that way, and anything of that kind is prevented, so far as our defences are concerned, by the laws relating to discipline. It would not become us to interfere with a great body of men and to declare what they shall eat and what they shall drink. </para>

Numerous reports confirm the views long held the this office that the old exchange contributed to sobriety, health, and contentment, of the men. The increase of desertions and trials for infraction of discipline is, by those best informed, attributed to the abolition of the former privileges of the exchange. </para>

The Minister has read a report by a United; States officer, and I should like, in contrast to it, to give my personal experience When I was with the troops in South Africa, awaiting the sending out of reinforcements from England after the reverses at Isandula and Rorke's Drift, we were kept seven months without grog, and during; that time net one, man was sent up forpunishraent. But when we got to Dundee, where a famous battle was fought during the recent war, the men were able to get liquor from the stores, and the first, night after our entrance into the town there were thirty-seven in the guardroom for drunkenness. Thenceforth, until we marched into Zululand again, there were several confinements each day from the same cause. I determined then that if I had the chance to put an end to the canteen system on active service I would do so-

I hold very strong views on-, the liquor question, so that I always feel compelled to, see- that I do not. allow my prejudices to rum away with my judgment., I was. die posed to- vote for the amendment until I had stopped to consider what it. means. If we- could provide for the total prohibition of liquor' to troops when, on duty unless prescribed by the doctors,. I should, vote for the- proposal. But that is-- not possible. What we have to consider in dealing: with the- amendment is whether; it is better for. the- men at the Queenscliff fort,, to use- a specific instance, to be- able to- obtain good, liquor in the.' canteen during certain' hours under- control, or to have- to- go to the hotels for it, and there consume drink of unascertained', quality at. all hours- without control.. I h&amp;ve been to&gt; a- good-, many eamps.of exercise;, und' although- I do not like to- see the canteens musk frequented-, I would, sooner see the- men-, iru the canteens, where there is always a sergeant on duty to turn out any one who: begins to, show signs of having drunk too- much, than see them go to- the hotels, where they can drink until they are drunk within the meaning, of. the licensing. Act, which my experience; of the- courts, tells me is a very advanced stage of intoxication. The amendment means simply transferring the consumption of liquor.- from. a place where there is control to, at- place where there is no control, and I think that that will only injure the. cause of tem&gt; perance..

                <para>Mr.McCAY. - I am, glad that the* law does not allow that to' be done. I appreciate the honorable member's position. He contends that the fewer the- places at which liquor may be- sold, the less the quantity that will be drunk. That principle, however, is not applicable to these special circumstances. In Victoria, every commanding officer is allowed, a regimental canteen. I have had one once since I have been a commanding officer; but I haive- not had any other - not because- my men were worse than- others, but because I. do not care- for the- system-. There were, however;, other canteen* to&gt; which- they could got The position before us is this : Are men who are not total abstainers to get their liquor at the canteens, where the supply is under proper control, or at the hotels, where there is practically no. control?' 1 do. not think that the amendment,, if! carried, would operate towards securing temperance. Therefore, I cannot support it. </para>

                    (Corib).- I feel pretty strongly upon this subject, because I have been in a canteen, while I do not think the honorable member for Melbourne Ports- ever has. I know -what I am talking about and of the dangers which his amendment would bring about. In my opinion his amendment either goes too far or does not go far enough. . If he proposed that no liquor at all should be allowed to the troops, I would be willing to support him. But what he proposes is that the selling of liquor at the regimental canteens, which are under strict control, is to be .stopped. That is quite ,a different thing. I know that, so far as Queenscliff is concerned, we could not do anything which would please the local publicans better than to close the regimental canteen.

                <para class="block">The beer supplied is 'sold .at a low rate, and the profits are spent on the library and the reading room, so that we have in the system an adoption of the best principles of the Gothenburg system. The honorable member for Corinella has said that he has had only one regimental canteen, but he knows that in most camps there are canteens to which all the men can go. Where there are no canteens, the men take liquor to their tents. The honorable member for Dalley must know that that often occurs in camps of instruction, ,and that, as a consequence, drunken men appear on parade. From the very first I have had no sympathy with this amendment. I drafted it at the request of the honorable member, substituting the word " Commonwealth" for the words "United States." But it is unfair that he should charge me with supporting it. I think that the experiment would be a disastrous one, and would lead to universal disorder and uncontrolled drunkenness. In my opinion, it is in the interests of the public houses, and not in the interests of temperance. If the canteens are closed, men will go to the public-houses, where the liquor will not be of as .good quality, and where there is no proper control. I shall vote against the amendment, because I believe in temperance principles. </para>

                    <para>- I am quite in. sympathy with the object of the amendment, but I. am inclined to think that the honorable member will defeat the object ;at which he is aiming. I would suggest something by way of a compromise. I presume that the honorable member desires to prevent drunkenness, and therefore, we might' provide that beers of light alcoholic strength and light wines only should be sold in the camps. It would be almost impossible for a man to get drunk on German lager bier, and the same thing would apply to the lighter classes of wines. It would be a hardship to deprive men of what they may regard as -a necessary beverage, and the proposal of the honorable member would only result in confusion. If we could keep the men away from drink altogether we might be able to arrive at the result which the honorable member desires, but the amendment would not carry him so far <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> a provision such as I suggest. </para>

                    (Dalley). - I trust that the (honorable member will press his amendment. The honorable member for Perth apparently does not object to intoxication in 41 modified form. He does not mind the men having a canteen, so long as the barometer of drunkenness does not go higher than 75 degrees. So long as the men get tipsy on dry wines or lager bier, he will be satisfied. The mere fact that German lager bier has been suggested should be sufficient to arouse the resentment of . the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, who is a strong protectionist. At present the men, who are in barracks, go out to little public- houses, and get as much as they can, and then come back to the canteen and drink a little drop more. If they are confined to barracks altogether they avail themselves of the canteens, and they may be in a state of semi-drunkenness half their time. By abolishing the canteen, we can at least insure that the men shall be sober in barracks, and I think that it would be to the interest not only of the men, but of the officers, if the amendment of the honorable member were agreed to. The officers of the perma- nent forces admit that they would prefer to be without the canteens. It is idle to speak of giving the men purer and better liquor than they can obtain in the public-houses, because the canteens are so worked as to produce as much profit as possible, in order to defray the cost of carrying them on and of providing means of recreation for the men.

                    <para>- It has been pointed out that there is no provision in this clause under which cadet officers may continue to hold office after they have attained the age of nineteen years. It is considered desirable that no age limit should be imposed in this connexion. I therefore move - </para>

                    <para>- In speaking the other day when the cadet provisions of this measure were under discussion, I unintentionally misled the Committee. I stated that I had been informed that the officers connected with the cadet corps would be quite satisfied if an age limit of nineteen years were prescribed. I have since been assured by my informant that I was mistaken. Personally, however, I am still of opinion that nineteen years is a proper age limit to fix. </para>
