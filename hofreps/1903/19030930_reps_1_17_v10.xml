                    <para>- I wish to inform the House that I have this day received the resignation by the Right Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir [Edmund</inline> Barton of his seat for the Electoral Division of Hunter. I find that (1) If a. writ were issued forthwith and- the shortest- reasonable period allowed between the issue of the writ and the nominations and between the nominations and the polling, it is almost certain that the session would have been concluded and the dissolution have become imminent before the new member could have been elected. (2) The franchise at such election would be quite unlike that under which the election following the dissolution would be held. (3) Considerable expense would be caused to the Commonwealth and trouble to the electors of the division, with no appreciable advantage to either. Therefore, I do not, as at present advised, propose to issue a writ under existing circumstances. </para>

My views on the subject are quite opposed to those of the majority of honorable members, and if an opportunity could be afforded I should like to discuss the question. I know nothing about the probability of an early dissolution, and I do not think any other honorable member does. </para>

Will he be good enough to say whether the Federal electoral rolls for Victoria have all been printed and distributed for exhibition as prescribed? Have the appointments of Divisional Officers and Registrars been made ? If not, when does the right honorable gentleman expect to make them ? Will he cause a set of rolls to be exhibited at each of the metropolitan railway stations in addition to the places prescribed <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> What will be the cost of a complete set of rolls for each division ? </para>

The rolls for the remaining seven divisions will be exhibited before the end of the week. The appointments about which the honorable member asks have not yet been made, but I hope to make them within a few days. With regard to the honorable member's suggestion that the rolls should be exhibited at the metropolitan railway stations; I should like to know whether he means the whole of the rolls for the State, or that at each station the roll for the division in which that station is situated shall be exhibited <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                        <para>- As the honorable and learned member is aware, there are about 600 clauses in the first departmental draft of the Navigation Bill. With the exception of those portions of the Bill which relate to coastal trade, and a few other matters to which my attention has been directed, I have not closely considered the measure, and am not able therefore to say specifically 'whether the Bill as drawn includes any provision of the character to which the honorable and learned member refers. But certainly the matter referred to is one which will require some consideration when the Bill is being revised. </para>

                        <para>I ask the Prime Minister whether his attention has been called to the fact that a large number of the members of the inter-State Bar have expressed a desire to be present at the swearing-in of the Judges of the High Court, and the holding of their first Court, and whether, in the circumstances, he can see his way to make the ceremony a public one, to take place on the Wednesday, instead of the Tuesday, so that a number of honorable members of this House who are interested may have an opportunity to be present <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                        <para>- The character of the judicial office is such that public display or ceremonial other than that of a professional character is generally considered foreign. An opportunity will be afforded, I have no doubt, to members of the Bar to exchange the usual courtesies with the Bench when its members first take their seats. </para>

                            <para>- The question is whether any business which may require to be transacted should be delayed for the purpose suggested ; but possibly a day or two would not matter. When the Judges of the High Court take their place upon the Bench, I hope and believe that the usual reciprocal exchange of courtesies will take place. But, beyond that, it seems to me scarcely a fitting thing in connexion with the judicial office to import any feature which might be considered to be in any way of a political, not to say party, character. . </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether I shall be in order in embracing this opportunity to refer to a matter concerning which I lately asked a question. I refer to the question which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have decided in proposing not to ask the electors of Hunter, who are now without a representative, to elect one until the Federal general elections, as to the date of which, at the present moment, we know nothing. I do not wish to contravene any parliamentary procedure ; but as this is a very important matter I think it should be ventilated to some extent. My difficulty is that you have made a declaration which involves the supposition that apparently you alone know that there is to be a general election for the House of Representatives at an early date. We know nothing of it officially, and I shall be surprised to learn that you know anything officially as to when this House will be dissolved, and. the general elections for the Federal Parliament will take place. It is because the action you propose to take may form a precedent that I direct special attention to the matter. I regret that such a precedent is being formed, no doubt with the very best intentions by yourself, and, if you have consulted others, with their advice. You, sir, are alone responsible, and I hold rightly or wrongly that you are here setting a precedent which may lead to mischief later on. It is for that reason I should like to know upon what ground, other than that of expense, the decision you have announced is based. I should be glad to secure the attention of honorable members in dealing with this matter. </para>

                        <para>- There are two difficulties in the way of the honorable member proceeding in this matter unless he can avoid them. In the first place, the honorable member will see that on the business-paper there is notice of an intention to move a certain resolution with reference to the time when the next general election shall take place. That notice being on the business-paper, and it being impossible to anticipate debate upon- any question so appearing, discussion upon the question the honorable member raises is precluded. On the other question we are now dealing with the second reading of the Appropriation Bill, and at this stage it is proper to discuss only matters which are included in the Bill. If the honorable member can connect his remarks with any vote appearing in the Appropriation Bill he will be in order ; but I must ask him to so connect his remarks if he can, and also to avoid anticipating any debate which may take place later on upon notice of motion No. 12. </para>

It is a most important point, and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have taken upon yourself a great power. I am not at all disputing the benefit which may be derived from, or the saving which may occur, as the result of your well-intentioned decision ; but I have the gravest doubts as to the constitutional soundness of that decision. One reason given for it is that of expense, and it is on that ground I raise the question. I believe that holding the high office which you, sir, adorn in this House, no question of expense should stand between you and the representation of- an important district of the Commonwealth. On that account I regret your decision, and whatever trouble and reasonable expense may be involved, it is our duty to see that every constituency in the Commonwealth has a representative in this House without one day's unnecessary delay. It is upon the grounds that I have stated that I regret the decision at which you have arrived. </para>

                            <para>- I am obliged to the honorable member for giving me an opportunity of pointing out that the expense was not the chief reason why I have not proceeded to issue a writ. I first pointed out in the statement I have read, that allowing the shortest possible practical interval between the issue of a writ and the nomination, and between the nomination and poll, it would require, I think, four weeks from to-day before any member could be returned to a writ issued to-day. If it were possible that the member so elected four weeks hence could take his seat, even for a day or two, and so represent his constituents, I should judge it unfitting on my part, or on the part of any one holding the office I have the honour to hold, that the consideration of expense should be taken as a sufficient reason for a course which would prevent a district being represented even for that brief period. Seeing that in the general opinion of those who know most of what is probable, four weeks hence will see this session closed, and that a dissolution will follow a few days later, it did appear to me that the expense and trouble to which the electors would be put would be absolutely result less and unprofitable. Then a further point to which I called attention in the memorandum I read is that in any case an election held now would have to be conducted under the New South Wales electoral law, under which women would not be able to vote, whilst if an election took place after the dissolution double the number of electors would be entitled to vote, as compared with those who could now exercise the franchise. Any election that might take place under a writ issued by me could afford no index of the will of the electors, or as to the probable result of the election which would take place a short time afterwards under the new roll. These were the reasons which influenced me in taking the action I did. I shall, however, hold myself free to issue a writ if, upon a closer view of the probabilities, or in view of the events which may transpire within the next few days, I consider that there would be any reasonable probability of the person who might be returned as the representative of the Hunter district being of any service to his constituents, who certainly have a right to be represented here, regardless of any expense that may be involved. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the honorable member for Wide Bay has taken the proper course concerning this very important matter. It is almost impossible nowadays, when public opinion is so keen concerning electoral matters, for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> to do anything he ought not to do. At the same time I venture to remark that unless you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> had some statement from the Government upon the' subject, it was not open for you to act as you have done in this particular case. Of course I do not expect you to say that anything has taken place between yourself and the Government, or that you have taken steps to ascertain the opinion of Ministers : but I have a shrewd suspicion that you have ascertained from the proper quarter what are the probabilities. If the Government chose they could put an end to the whole question in five minutes by making a statement, with some kind of certitude, as to the date upon which the elections will probably take place. Is there any special reason why this should remain a secret <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Is anything to be gained by withholding this information from Parliament ? It is usual towards the close of business in all Parliaments of the Empire to give the House some indication as to when it is likely to rise, and as to the business that is to be disposed of before the prorogation takes place. The Government have not so far informed honorable members upon these points, and the least we have a right to expect from the Prime Minister is some indication of the business which is to be proceeded with and completed before our labours are brought to an end. We&gt; should be informed as to the probable time of the prorogation and the date of the elections. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, except that under our system the Senate is entitled to have the Appropriation Bill presented to it earlier than is usual in the States Parliaments, in order to afford it an opportunity to criticise matters that do not come before it at other times. I might further reply to the question of the honorable member for Parramatta by stating that, of the business which is still on the paper, all that it is desired to dispose of is the Patents Bill and the determination of the site of the Federal capital. There are two other small measures of a purely machinery and departmental character, which it will be necessary to consider. Upon the notice-paper of the Senate appears the Defence Bill, upon which the final touches have to be placed. That is practically all that we propose to do this session, and I hope that this may be regarded as a sufficiently clear indication to honorable mem- . bers of the date of the prorogation. Of course, it is unconstitutional to refer here to that which is a subject for the exercise of the prerogative of His Excellency the Governor-General. The honorable member for Wide Bay directed attention to the step which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have seen fit to take, and he did so in a manner which was well within his rights. I have no doubt that the step which you took, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> involved much consideration on your part. It is clear, from such indications as I have mentioned, that this session is about to close, and it would surely be the cruellest of kindness to both the candidates and the electors concerned to ask them to take part in an election upon a roll which is about to be superseded, and which could afford but a very poor indication of the feeling of the constituency. </para>

                            <para>- I should agree with the honorable member if the consent of the constituents were required before a candidature could be entered upon. There is, however, no condition of that kind, and we know that very often persons are ready for the mere purpose of calling attention to themselves to rush in as candidates. Thus the Commonwealth might be put to the expense of a thousand pounds, and the constituents to the expense of conducting a contest which could be effective in no practical way, and would be repeated within two or three weeks. There is nothing to prevent <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> from issuing a writ at any moment if he comes to the conclusion that a representative could be here in time to take part in the work of Parliament. No doubt' he would issue a writ under such circumstances. But unless he is satisfied that the person elected would become a representative in reality, be able to take a seat in this House and speak for the electors, he is' surely acting in a most considerate manner, and in the public interest in saving the people of the district and the Commonwealth the expense which would be involved. I think that the course <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has taken is in the best interests of the public. Retaining, as he does, the power to change his course of action to-night or to-morrow morning, he can take the steps necessary to secure to the district its proper representation if our sittings should be prolonged sufficiently to enable its representative to take his seat. </para>

                        <para>- I quite appreciate the stand <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has taken with a view to save expense, but I am afraid that it may involve a slight "difficulty. When a vacancy occurs whilst Parliament is in session the proper person to issue the writ is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> Suppose, however, that Parliament really lasted until the 9th day of May next, and no writ were now issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I question very much whether the Governor-General could issue it. Some difficulty may arise from departing from the usual course. As a rule, when Parliament is near its close and is out of session the Ministry delay the issue of writs. But, in that case, there can be no question as to who shall issue the writs. Suppose, however, that the Speaker delayed the issue of the writ until the session closed. </para>

                    <para>- Had the honorable member put that question to me yesterday, when the Supplementary Estimates were under consideration, I could have supplied him with the details. At the present moment, however, I am not in the position to do so. I know that we have purchased a considerable quantity of machinery for printing purposes. When the Commonwealth was using the printing machinery of the Victorian Government, it was found that awkward delays frequently occurred. To obviate these, we secured some fast-running machines and machinery for binding purposes, and also a number of linotypes ; but it is impossible for me to quote the separate items which we purchased twelve months ago. I know, however, that they included some folding machines, and also a number of quick-running machines for other purposes. </para>

I trust that. some little time will elapse before the prorogation, and I desire the honorable and learned gentleman to consider whether an attempt should not be made, before the session closes, to pass the draft Standing Orders.

                    <para>- Before we proceed to consider the question of novelty, I wish to suggest that the examination provided for in this clause should be confined to the complete specification. I believe that the Victorian State Parliament, last year, passed an Act to adopt the English practice, which is confined to the examination of the complete specification. I understand that the practice of examining . the provisional specification was found rather inconvenient, and that it led to more expense and delay than was really justified by any safeguard which was thus secured. If a provisional specification is not followed by the complete specification nothing occurs in relation to the patent, although, of course, should a patent be ' applied for in respect of the same invention it might subsequently affect the question of novelty. If the complete specification in relation to the application is filed, all the examination that is necessary must be made. It must also affect the provisional specification, because in clause 36 it is provided that the examination of a complete specification must be for the purpose of finding out amongst other things whether the invention to which it refers is substantially the same as that described in the provisional specification. Thus the second examination which must take place under the Bill, as drafted, will also include an examination of the earlier specification. We have also to remember that if the earlier one is not in order, although it has not been examined, the patent itself will be liable to be challenged, or opposition may be offered to the granting of the patent on the ground that the provisional specification is not as prescribed by regulation. There is, therefore, no object to be gained by having two examinations. I do not think that even the drawings are filed in England until the complete specification has been lodged. There they regard the complete specification as the only one in relation to which much trouble need be taken. If there were a breach of the rules as regards the form or title in the provisional specification it might involve the patent itself. Several patent agents think that the examination should be confined to the complete specification, and in order to ventilate their views I gave notice of an amendment, which I do not now propose to move in the form circulated by me. I think that it would be well for the Prime Minister to consolidate clauses 35, 36, and 37. If the examination be confined to the complete specification they may well be converted into one clause. Then the various sub-clauses would follow in their order as part of clause 35, and the subsequent clauses could be amended accordingly for the purpose of reference. For example, if this were done the reference in clause 38 to clauses 35 and 36 would apply to the subclauses of clause 35. I trust that the Prime Minister will consider the matter, for I believe that several honorable members are disposed to support the suggestion which I make. </para>

                    <para>. - In the matter of drafting a good deal can be said for the last proposal made by the honorable and learned member. It would have been easy to include the whole of these three clauses in one, but the subdivision has been adopted, notwithstanding that it involves a little extra reference, for the purpose of clearly showing what is intended to be done at the different stages of the investigation. The honorable and learned member is also correct, so far as I follow him, in his references to the English practice ; but he requires to note that we have not adhered closely to the principle upon which' the English patent law is founded, and upon which the English administration is carried on. The amendment with which we shall deal presently introduces a proposal entirely novel to the British method of dealing with patents, and though I propose to move an amendment of that amendment, we shall still go considerably beyond what the British law contemplates. This appears to me to affect the question of the two specifications. If the honorable and learned member looks at the clause which we are now considering, he will see that the proposal relates to the provisional and complete specification, as the case may be. Any person who chooses to come forward with his complete specification will have to comply with clauses 35, 36, and 37. A provisional specification, on the other hand, will have to comply only with clause 35, and will not be affected by clauses 36 and 37. What are the requirements ? Occasionally even an agent makes a mistake in applying for a patent, although that is very rare ; but it constantly happens that persons who are extremely uninformed in the ordinary processes of patenting attempt to secure the protection of the law without the assistance of an agent, and that their applications are defective in purely formal matters. The proposed examination is intended, not for the advantage of the office, but for the assistance of the would-be patentee. </para>

                        <para>- Because the examiner is the officer who will have to deal with the application under the following clauses. The elementary requirements in respect of a provisional specification will be set out in the regulations, and under this clause it will be the duty of the examiner to point out to the applicant what those requirements are. It is comparatively common for a would-be patentee to misdescribe his invention, even in the matter of title, and applications are frequently defective in matters of form. The examination provided for is not an examination upon which any application is rejected. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; it was not in the Bill as originally drafted. Honorable members will see that when that paragraph has been omitted, all that the examiner will have to do is to see that applications for provisional patents are correct in matters of form. The examiner sees that the would-be patentee has complied with the regulations in that regard, and, if he has not, lends assistance to put matters right. No application will be rejected at this stage. The clause has been introduced solely to afford assistance to persons applying for provisional patents. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but in other States it is done either by the Commissioner or by one of his clerks. I think it would be better to so amend the clause as to leave it open to the Commissioner to refer applications either to the particular officers entitled examiners, or to clerks, or to do it himself. I do not object to the examination of applications, but the clause as it stands, if read in conjunction with other provisions of the Bill, provides that the work of examining shall be done only by certain officers. That, I think, is undesirable. </para>

                        <para>- That may not be an objectionable practice in a large office where there are plenty of examiners available, but it is not desirable that applicants should be kept waiting because a particular examiner is busy, when there are other officers who could run through their applications and see that they were formally correct. </para>

The Commissioner himself may perform the functions of an examiner, and if he should be <inline font-style="italic">too</inline> busy there is no reason why he should not refer a matter to one of those officers I think we should be disturbing the structure of the Bill if we omitted provision for the appointment of examiners.

                    <para>- I trust that the view expressed by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo will not find acceptance in the Committee. There have been two broad methods upon which patents procedure has operated in different parts of the world. Under one method there is something like an inquiry into novelty in connexion with an application, and in the other a patent is granted without any such inquiry. This latter procedure, in my opinion, strikes at the underlying principle upon which patents are granted. Patents were first of all granted in England on the ground that the inventions were 1 novel so far as England was concerned, and a monopoly with respect to a patent was granted in order to insure to the people the benefit of an invention previously unknown in the country. The essence of the whole matter was novelty. Yet the English procedure for some years has departed altogether from that leading principle, and in England at the present time patents are granted which, in a vast number of instances, are not worth the paper upon which they are written, as indicating that the patented article has the essential element of novelty. In the United States of America the procedure is upon exactly opposite lines. While there they make no attempt to guarantee the inviolability of a patent, or to say that it is absolutely novel, they still take all reasonable care to determine that it is novel. The old formula of " all care taken but no responsibility incurred " seems to be that upon which they act. They do take every care, and the experience of those associated with patent procedure as patent agents or- direct applicants is that they infinitely prefer a slight delay while inquiry is being made as to novelty, in order that they may be reasonably assured that their patent when granted does not infringe the rights of of any one else, and that it covers something novel in the way of a valuable improvement. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo has said that the experience of the Victorian Act has supplied him with one reason for opposing the provision. </para>

                        <para>- No, an attempt was made to repeal it, but the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood, who introduced the Bill for the purpose, became convinced before it had proceeded very far that it would be wrong to repeal the provision, and he dropped the measure and allowed the original procedure to stand. I may say that within a few days a petition against the repeal of the Victorian practice in this respect was signed by thousands of business men and inventors. In New South Wales we have adopted the laxer system, and I think it has been found to be a mistake. So far as I can learn, persons having business with the Patent Office, whether as patent agents or inventors, are not at all satisfied with the laxer procedure. I am not at this stage arguing as to the best place in which to insert this provision. The Prime Minister agrees that there does appear to be some reason why the element of novelty should be inquired into by the examiner, and whether the inquiry should take place in the preliminary stages of the application is a matter of detail. I trust that, in any case, the Committee will insist upon an inquiry into the element of novelty. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking with reference to information to be gained in schools and universities. I acquit the Prime Minister of any intention to reflect upon men who are not possessed of that information. There is learning of different kinds. One man may be learned in the law, and another learned in engine-driving. I do not for a moment suppose that the Prime Minister intended to convey any reflection upon such men as George Stephenson, Watt, and others. I have here a book, entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Law and Practice of New South Wales upon Letters Patent,</inline> by A. G. Taylor.

I am pleased to hear that the Prime Minister intends to retain the principle to which reference has been made. I should like to quote one short paragraph from a pamphlet published by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prank</inline> Gossler, a patents agent, who demonstrates the benefit of cheapness. He points out that it pays the nation to make its patent fees as low as possible, and to relieve patentees of expense as far as possible by employing officers to look after their interests. In the end, the general community benefits from every invention, and it should be prepared to pay for the advantages so conferred. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Gossler  says - </para>

                    <para>In the United States, in spite- or rather because - of the small fee charged for a patent, the inventors have with their fees full}' paid the cost of the magnificent patent office building in Washington, and maintained the enormous staff of officers employed therein. And yet there is a surplus of over ?125,000 in the Treasury to the credit of the patent office. The volume of work done in this office may be guessed when it is stated that 40,000 applications for patents are made yearly. In 1899 no fewer than 25,527 patents were granted. With all this work there is no bustle, no confusion ; everything goes like well regulated clockwork. </para>

The result of the American system has been to enormously increase the number of patents. In the United States there are twice as many patents applied for every year as in Great Britain. This has been due largely to the reduction of the fees. </para>

                <para class="block">This provision will bring us abreast of the latest British law upon the subject of patents. It will give us the benefit of the advance which has been made in the British law after the experience which they have gained of the unsatisfactory results of granting patents without previous searching of the records. The examiners will be persons of large experience and special training. It will be their duty to possess such a knowledge of the specifications as will enable them to detect in the records of the offices of the States similar patents already registered. Further, in the course of their inquiries they will become acquainted with unpatented machines which have been introduced into the States, and acquire a very large general knowledge as to inventions patented elsewhere, which, though not patented in Australia, ha.ve been published in Australia. As the fact of the publication or use in Australia of these machines would at any time thereafter be quite sufficient to upset the patent and destroy its value, we hereby provide that the knowledge obtained by the examiners, instead of being locked up in their breasts, should be communicated to the inventor if it is proposed to criticise the patent in that regard. Thus we are placing at the command of the inventor all the information which the examiner has. We do not propose to follow the American system, and erect the examiner into the position of a Judge who can make requisitions as he chooses, or issue or refuse patents. </para>

I presume that the honorable member has read <inline font-style="italic">Edmunds on Patents.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Edmunds</inline> is certainly one of the highest living authorities on patents. He is a master of the British system, but when he went to America he examined the United States system, which he had always admired and preferred to the British system. On examining it on the spot, he came to the conclusion that although it possessed great advantages it also had many drawbacks, which on the whole rendered it less desirable than the system adopted in Great Britain. We have followed the course adopted by the British Patent Office last year, and we are taking a still further stride in advance. We do not erect the examiner into the position of a Judge, but we propose to communicate to the inventor the knowledge obtained by the examiner. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the proposal of the Prime Minister constitutes a distinct improvement upon the present form of the clause, and it also removes the grounds of my previous objection to this provision. It does not set up the examiner as the judge of finality in this matter, nor does it obstruct the application for a patent, nor subject the applicant to a large expenditure, as has been the case in connexion with previous applications. It is a compromise which may fairly be accepted, because, as the Prime Minister declares, it give3 the applicant the advantage of the knowledge of the Patent Office by informing him whether there is any suspicion of a want of novelty in regard to his patent. Should such a suspicion be entertained, the Government officer practically says to him - " If you take out this patent you do so at your own risk, because it is liable to attack and is therefore valueless." I think that the amendment is the best possible solution of the difficulty. </para>

                    <para>- Concerning the remarks of the Prime Minister, I would point out that it is well known to patentees all over the world that patents issued by the British Government are absolutely valueless. The same remark applies to those issued by the Victorian Government. A British patent is worthless until it has emerged from the fire of actual litigation. Upon the other hand a patent which is issued by the American Government is so valuable that immediately the patentee gains possession of it he can raise money upon it. The reason for this difference is that the whole trend of the English Act is in favour of patent agents as against inventors. What we wish to do is to protect the inventor, and that should be our main consideration in this Bill. I am very glad that the provision relating to the novelty or otherwise of an invention is to be preserved in the measure. </para>

                        <para>- It ought to be so preserved, because it is the only vital principle in the Bill so far as the inventor is concerned. In England the practice is for the Government to accept money from the applicants for patents, notwithstanding which they have to run the risk of whether their inventions are novel or otherwise. Consequently, the patents issued in that country are absolutely worthless. In America, however, every application foi- a patent is most carefully examined, and such is the wonderful skill of the examiners that a statement appears in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail Year Book</inline> that there are not two per thousand of the applications for patents which cannot be finally reported upon regarding their novelty or otherwise. Our aim should be to protect the inventor, and we can never accomplish that unless we retain in the Bill a provision for inquiry as to novelty. That is really the vital principle in the measure. I speak from personal experience. I have had a great deal of experience with patents in connexion with inventors themselves. I know that every inventor feels that he is not sufficiently protected anywhere in the world, save America and Germany. The German patent law is very nearly as good as that which is operative in America. I hold patents in both those countries, and I have no hesitation in affirming that the difference between the value of an American or German patent and an English patent is really marvellous. That difference arises from the fact that the patent offices in America are managed by experts. So far from it being a disadvantage that the Commissioner, rather than a Judge of the Court, should pronounce as to the novelty or otherwise of a patent, I think there is no comparison in actual experience between the value of the two judgments. Nine out of ten inventors would infinitely prefer the decision of a patent expert to that' of a lawyer or Judge. </para>

                    <para>- I was somewhat doubtful about this provision, but I intend to support its inclusion in the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton mentioned in the course of his remarks that it did not afford very much protection in America, seeing that 72 per cent, of the patents issued there - notwithstanding the elaborate search which is instituted - are open to challenge upon" the ground that they are not novel. Personally, I do not think that his authority is altogether reliable. In the <inline font-style="italic">Law Quarterly Review</inline> for July last there is a very able article by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. White,</inline> who specially refers to these examinations for novelty, and would go to the length of the German and American practice by insisting upon a general examination in that respect. He points out that the. practice has been a very great success in America. Consequently I cannot regard the authority quoted by the Attorney-General as reliable. In America not only is there an examination as to whether previous specifications have been lodged in respect of the same invention, but a general search is made through the records and text-books. The digests of other countries are even ransacked with a view to ascertain whether any invention has been patented elsewhere. There, search is comparatively easy, because the index system in America has recently been brought up to date, and, in comparison with that of other countries, is perfection itself. But, according to an article which recently appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> the very opposite condition prevails in Australia. Consequently, until we bring our index system up to date there may be a difficulty, at any rate in regard to the economical working of this provision. I notice that in the report of the English Comptroller of Patents for 1902, it is stated that the Board of Trade Committee which inquired into this matter, and the question of compulsory licences under an Act which was passed in 1901, recommended as a compromise an amendment which applies only to an examination for previous specifications, and that a strong opinion was expressed concerning the need for the adoption of a general search, such as is proposed in this paragraph, in regard to the novelty of inventions. It points out what has already been referred to by the honorable member for Capricornia - namely, that the way in which patents are issued in that country constitutes a serious evil. I believe that in England, owing to the absence of an examination as to the novelty or otherwise of inventions, a search . disclosed that from 1870 downwards about 42 per cent, of the patents issued are open to challenge upon the ground of want of novelty. That condition scarcely fits in with the statement of the American authority quoted by the Prime Minister, who declares that 72 per cent, of the patents granted in America are open to attack. If in England, where there has been no examination as to novelty, 42 per cent, of the patents issued are open to challenge, how is it possible that in America, where a most rigorous examination is conducted, 72 per cent, of them can be open to attack <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The chances are that in America the provision is a complete success. Under the circumstances I shall support the amendment, although I cannot see that it makes the slightest difference to the clause in its original form, save in respect of the preliminary examination. </para>

                        <para>- That is not desirable. I do not say that the amendment I suggest is the best that could be made, but it is ridiculous that people should be able to patent an article with or without result. It may be said that a patent such as that to which I have referred would have no result. In that event the patent would be worthless, and, therefore, should not be issued. On the other hand, if people were threatened with heavy law costs if they made use of an article or process which had been patented in these circumstances, they would be deterred from using it, and the holder of the patent would secure an advantage to which he had no claim. An injury would thus be done to the public. Some provision such as I have proposed should be inserted. As I read the Bill - and the Prime Minister agrees with my reading - we might have the most ordinary processes, designs, or articles patented.

                    <para>- If an application for a patent is accepted, it is . published in due course, and any person who feels that his interests are in any respect challenged may enter opposition to the patent upon the ground of want of novelty, which, if proved, will be fatal to it. "When the officers of the Department think that a supposed invention is not novel, they inform the would-be patentee, but that is not fatal to his application. We propose to shut the door in an applicant's face only when the invention for which he seeks a patent has already been patented either in the State or in the Commonwealth. When it is objected to on the ground of want of novelty, the Department will give the applicant the advantage of its knowledge upon the subject, and leave it to him to say whether he will take the risk of proceeding further ; because the question of novelty touches upon problems of infinitesimal delicacy. In Germany, where there is in existence one of the most elaborate patent laws, the great Bessemer process, which brought an enormous fortune to its discoverer from the revenues obtained in England, could not be patented, on the ground that there was no novelty in any part of the invention, and that all that was new was the linking together of facts which were already known. The German Patent Office did not give the inventor the opportunity to take out a patent at his own risk. The practice adopted under the Bill is to give the applicant all the information in the possession of the office, and to warn him that the patent may be objected to on the ground of want of novelty. If he then chooses to take out a patent, he does so with his eyes open. "Under the English system, he would have his eyes shut. </para>

                        <para>- Under paragraphs e and <inline font-style="italic">f</inline> of clause 52. We have the choice of two disadvantages. We can either erect the examiner or commissioner into the position of a Judge, which is practically what they do in America, where in many cases there is no appeal from a decision, or, having given the applicant the information possessed by the Department, issue a patent to him with the warning that it may be opposed, and let him risk the opposition, and secure what gains he can, should he survive it. It seems to me that the second alternative is the lesser of the two evils. I have framed my amendment upon learning that, according to the advice of the experts consulted, it is, with our methods and our system,, safe to go as far as it provides but dangerous to go further. Although the amendment of the honorable member is in very general terms, and would nob impose anything like the obligation which is imposed in America or Germany, it still imposes the obligation to reject an application if it is thought that the invention is a matter of common knowledge or in common use. If we adopted the amendment, we should run the risk of having the examiners declare that because an invention was old in its form, but new in its 'application, it was not sufficiently novel to justify a patent, and thus the hopes of a man's lifetime might be destroyed. Is not that a greater evil than to run the risk of a patent being upset after warning has been given to the applicant of the possibility of opposition <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                    <para>- I feel compelled to support the amendment. It is the practice every day of patent scalpers to steal patents ; to take ideas from the American and English patent offices, and to work up a little syndicate to buy them. The moment the syndicate is established they apply for a patent in Sydney or in Melbourne. A case of the kind came under my observation three or four years ago, when a person to whom a patent had been offered asked me, while in Sydney, to inquire into it. I was a little suspicious of the patentee, but the drawings and the particulars of the patent appeared to be in order. A few days later, however, I found a drawing of the machinery in the <inline font-style="italic">Scientific American</inline> as an invention which had been patented in America. If "publication" in clause 52 were defined to mean, not the actual printing in the Commonwealth of a book or other document in which an invention has been described, but the selling of such a book or newspaper here, that difficulty would be got over. But I think it is also advisable, in the interests of true inventors, to adopt the amendment of the honorable member for North Sydney. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. THOMSON</inline>
                    (North Sydney).- The Bill is throughout framed on lines which I do not consider the best. I am entirely against the system of issuing a document which is supposed to confer a right or a privilege, but is absolutely useless for that purpose. When a decision as to its uselessness or otherwise is sought in a law court, it will very often happen that the party with the longest purse will succeed, because of the costliness of the processes through which he can take his opponent. There are such things as bluff patents, and they are not uncommon. They are patents taken out by wealthy parties with the object of frightening other persons from using an invention. Under the Bill a patent might be granted for an invention of the commonest knowledge, perhaps for an article in use in the Patent Office itself. The Department would say to the applicant - "This invention is not new, therefore you have no right to obtain a patent for it. Nevertheless we give you a patent." That is an objection able system. I would rather leave it to the Commissioner to decide whether a patent is novel, and give the right to appeal from his decision. When the Commissioner has decided that an invention is not novel, he should refuse to grant a patent for it, and should tell the applicant that if he objects to that decision he can go to court, and have the matter determined there. The applicant would then have to face, not a rich rival syndicate which was trying to crush him, but merely the Commissioner, who would have no private interests to serve. That is the position which I should like to see adopted. I recognise that the Bill has not been framed upon those lines, and that the acceptance of my amendment would necessitate the passing of other amendments which would, to some extent, disturb its framework. For that reason, and because it is difficult to get a sufficient number of honorable members to take enough interest in the question to vote on other than party lines, I shall not push it. But I protest against the system which has been adopted. I think that a better system, and one which would have been less dangerous both for the public and the honest inventor, could have been adopted.

                    (South Australia).The Bill is familiar to me, inasmuch as I had the honour of settling it after it had been prepared by the various patent offices. In regard to the conditions upon which patents may be granted, I was deeply impressed with the desirability of making letters patent something more than waste paper liable to be defeated by the showing at a subsequent date of 'a want of novelty, even though the patent had then passed into the possession of a
                    <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline>
                    purchaser for value. I should have liked to give them a document of the highest authority, such as a certificate of title under the Torrens Act. The ideal is to confer indefeasibility of title, to give by registration a guarantee of validity, backed up by something in the nature of an insurance fund. I thought at one time that perhaps we might proceed generally upon the broad fundamental lines of the Act to which I have referred, but on looking into the matter more closely, and after having the advantage of the advice of the authorities, and reading up what information was to be obtained on the matter, I came to the conclusion that, under the circumstances, we could not do what is most to be desired.

                    <para>- I should infinitely prefer to issue a certificate of the character I have indicated ; but the nature of the inquiries which would have to be made, and the vastness of the investigation involved, would make the operation so cumbrous and expensive that I am satisfied that we can do nothing at present. At the same time the idea is a very good one, and will require further consideration. I hope that ultimately something will be done in the direction indicated. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know as to that. We uaight lay it down that unless foreign patents are registered within Australia within a certain time they should be void so far as we are concerned. The question, however, is a very difficult one, and we are scarcely in a position at this late stage to introduce substantial amendments into the measure which has already been passed by another branch of the Legislature. At the same time I sympathize with the suggestion made. No doubt the Prime Minister has noted that, according to the memorandum prepared by the Board of Trade, by Imperial direction, for the use of the Colonial Conference, which sat in 1902, at page 99 it was stated - </para>

                        <para>- It is a pity that a number of absolutely worthless letters of registration should be granted, but we find ourselves between two difficulties. On the one hand, we could register everything, and that would involve the issue 'of a number of worthless certificates. On the other hand, there is the almost superhuman difficulty attaching to the investigation necessary before we should be justified in declaring the title of the patentee to be indefeasible. The officials of the Department gave a great deal of time to the consideration of this question, and I was very pleased with their work. I hope that the exception which has been taken to the measure will not prevent the Prime Minister from persevering with it, because I believe that there is a general desire on the part of honorable members to place a comprehensive Act upon the statute-book, and that it is generally recognised that the Bill now before us is an honest attempt to improve our legislation. </para>

                    (North Sydney).- With the consent of the Committee I shall withdraw my amendment. I have no desire that the Patent Office should guarantee the validity of a patent. But I wish it to abstain from issuing certificates which are known to be absolutely invalid and useless. If the authorities have reason to believe that a patent is absolutely worthless they should decline to register it, except, of course, under the direction of a Judge. I recognise the force of the statement of the right honorable and learned member for South Australia that it would be impossible to attempt to re frame this measure at this late period of the session. I desire, therefore, to withdraw my amendment.

I am closely in agreement with what he has stated, but looking to the task which will lie before the Patent Office during the next three or four years, in making good the defects in the records of the various States, and in initiating a new system, I am loth to put any fresh burdens on the Commissioner. When we are well established, and have taken the great step in advance for which this legislation provides - a far greater stride than has yet been taken by any large British community except Canada - I hope that we shall be able to march onward in the direction which the honorable member has indicated. </para>

The Crown Law officers, however, called my attention to the means of giving effect to it, and upon consideration I came to the conclusion that, <inline font-style="italic">prima Jacie,</inline> the only power which the Commonwealth possesses, is the power to issue Commonwealth patents - that is patents running throughout Australia. Having regard to the Constitution I do not see how it would be possible to issue a Commonwealth patent which did not run throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                    (South Australia).Of course clauses 42 and 43 are intended to be read together. It seems to me that, upon inquiry we may find that some person is entitled under a State Act to obtain a patent for a particular State, and that some one else may claim, as regards the rest of the Commonwealth, the issue of a patent under the Commonwealth law. Surely such a case may conceivably occur. I take it that what we wish to do is to continue existing conditions. We do not desire to interfere with the rights enjoyed by a man under a State patent either by diminishing or extending them. It seems to me, however, that if an individual has secured patent rights in regard to certain States it will be possible for another party to obtain a Commonwealth patent as regards the rest of. the Commonwealth.

                        <para>- This is not a question of what is desirable. If it were in our power to parcel out the Commonwealth, to deal with those States in which particular patents have been granted, and then to consider whether we should not issue a patent for the balance of the Commonwealth, it would be highly convenient and advantageous for us to adopt that course. But from my reading of the Constitution, I hesitate to believe that we possess any such power. The right honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> has been arguing the question of advantage, convenience, and propriety, and I agree with his arguments. Where I differ from him is that I doubt very much whether the Commonwealth has any power except to issue a Commonwealth patent. It appears to me that such a patent must be clear of all other patents of the same_ kind throughout the Commonwealth! </para>

                        <para>- Yes, unless the person who desires such an extension applies for it before the whole of this Act is brought into operation by proclamation. Up till that period it is open to any person to apply to any other State for a patent which has not been taken out there. But when by proclamation we extend this Act to the whole of the Commonwealth, we shall issue only one class of patents - namely, those which run throughout the Commonwealth. Clause 42 provides that in issuing a patent for the Commonwealth we shall take into consideration whether an invention is already patented in the Commonwealth or in any State. Where a patent has been granted in any one State the Commonwealth will be powerless to issue any other patent in respect of the same invention ; and it appears to me that in the remaining five States in . which no patent rights have been taken out the general public are open to make use of that invention. In giving the Commonwealth power to grant patents, the Constitution only conferred upon us the power to issue patent rights for the whole, of the Commonwealth, and not for parts of it. </para>

I have been considering that question since last night, and at a later stage I intend to submit a proposal which will guarantee all pending applications which are recorded before the Commonwealth finally takes over the administration of the Patents Department.

                    <para>- I desire to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister a concrete case having reference to this point which occurred only to-day. This morning the holder of a provisional patent called upon me. He said, " I know that a Patents Bill is now before the Commonwealth Parliament. I cannot afford to do more than obtain protection for my invention in Victoria, and consequently I am waiting till the Commonwealth Patents Bill becomes law. I shall then apply for patent rights throughout the Commonwealth." There are several other similar cases of which I have knowledge. Surely the Prime Minister will admit that in the 'case to which I have referred the man would suffer a very grave injustice. </para>

That proposal would enable him to at once provisionally register for the whole Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- I am particularly anxious that this Bill shall become law at the earliest possible date, and my frequent speeches are due not to any desire to delay its progress, but to my interest in it. There are men who may think it worth while to extend their patent rights beyond any particular State, but who for want of means are unable to do so. They have been able to raise the few pounds necessary to secure a patent in one particular State, but have been unable to bear the heavy cost of taking out a patent throughout Australia. I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether it would not be possible to convert a patent right held in any one State at the time of the passing of the Bill into a Commonwealth patent. Legal intricacies are not ' always clear to the lay mind, but it seems to me that a man who has taken out a patent, for example, in Queensland, at a cost of ?15 or ?18 - half as much again as we propose to charge for the issue of a Commonwealth patent - should be allowed to merge that patent into one extending over the whole Commonwealth on the passing of this Bill into law. The public would not suffer to any extent by the adoption of such a course. </para>

                    <para>- It appears to me that the position assumed by the Prime Minister is perfectly sound and constitutional. I do not agree with the suggestion that, even if we had power to grant a patent applicable only to a portion of the Commonwealth, a Federal patent should be a kind of fragmentary affair. Our Legislature has power to pass patent laws applicable not to any one section of the Commonwealth, but to the whole of it. The Prime Minister is quite right when he says that a patent granted by us, and made applicable to only a few of the States, would be null and void. At the same time, I agree with the contention that we ought to protect those who at present have, or at the passing of the Bill will have, patent rights in only one or two States, and I believe that provision has been made for such cases. By taking action the holder of a paten right in any of the States will be able to obtain a Commonwealth patent. His rights are protected by this Bill. An old State patent would, in these circumstances, merge into a Commonwealth patent. </para>

We should provide that on application being made by the holder of an existing patent, and certain preliminaries being carried out, the original right should merge into a Federal patent, and that the applicant should not be compelled to go to the whole expense and formality of making a fresh application. </para>

                    <para>- The point raised by the honorable member for Moreton is a very important one. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo objects to a patchwork system of patents ; but, if I read the Bill rightly, it will perpetuate the present patchwork system, inasmuch as it provides that a patent taken out in any State shall be recognised under the Commonwealth law only so far as that State is concerned. There is no provision that a State patent shall, on the passing of this Bill, merge into a Commonwealth patent. There is no provision that would allow the holder of a State patent to at once extend his right over the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Since the introduction of the Bill several persons have sought my advice in regard to this question. They were disposed to protect themselves by taking out a State patent, believing that on the passing of the Bill they would be able to convert it into a Commonwealth patent. I have had to tell, them that no such provision is made in the Bill, and that they would not be well advised in taking out a State patent to protect their rights pending the passing of this measure. The Prime Minister apparently considers that persons so situated have no rights - that if they have been unable to incur the very heavy charges involved under the existing law in taking out a patent for all Australia, they have no right now to demand that their State patent shall merge into a Commonwealth one on the passing of this Bill. I am not prepared to enter into a controversy with the honorable gentleman on the constitutional aspect of the question; but I disagree with the principle laid down by him. If the Constitution will permit of it I think that we should insert a provision in the Bill, enabling the holder of a State patent, in the absence of any valid objection, to convert it into a Commonwealth patent. </para>

                        <para>- That would be a valid objection to the granting of a Commonwealth patent. I should like to see some provision in the Bill to enable these persons to apply for the registration of their patent in respect of the Commonwealth. When the necessity arises the constitutional question can be fought out and settled by the proper tribunal. I hope that the Prime Minister will propose the insertion of a new clause enabling the holder of a patent in any State to obtain a Commonwealth patent, providing that the Commissioner considers that there is no reasonable objection to the granting of such an application. </para>

                    E. GROOM (Darling Downs).I recognise that the position would be complicated if an amendment were moved in relation to this matter, and that we should perhaps lose the present opportunity to pass the Bill into law. The Prime Minister, however, might give us his assurance that he will look into this question and see whether it is not possible to provide that, if a person has obtained a patent in any one State which is not being used in any of the other States, he ma)' convert it into a Commonwealth patent on making proper application. I feel that the position taken up by the honorable and learned gentleman is right in this respect : that if a patent has been granted, for example, in New South Wales. some one else should not be allowed to come in under the Commonwealth law and take out a patent in respect of the same article in all the other States of the Union. In that event, we might have two different proprietors of one patent granted in Australia.

                        <para>- In that case the patent should not be converted into a Commonwealth one. Such an objection should be a good reason for the refusal of the application. I recognise that this is a difficult matter, and cannot be settled on mere sentimental grounds. We have to bear in mind the strong constitutional point which has been put by the Prime Minister - that we have power to grant patents only in respect of the whole Commonwealth, and that in any grant of a patent we cannot except from its operation one particular part of the Commonwealth. The position put by the honorable member for Kooyong, however, is different. His supposition is that a patent taken out in any one State by a man who has not had the means to apply for it over all Australia should be converted into a Commonwealth patent. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. I think that that is a fair and reasonable request. If the Prime Minister gives the Committee his assurance that he will enable existing State patents, in the absence of any valid objection; to be converted into Commonwealth patents, and will also preserve the rights of present applicants for patents in any of the States, the concession will be a very great one. But there is force in his position that we cannot grant patents of limited application. The Prime Minister has promised what to a certain extent is a compromise upon the only lines which the Constitution will allow. What we all desire is to encourage inventors who have already been able to obtain a patent in one or more States. If their patent rights have not been lost by user, or in any other way, in the other States, let us give them an opportunity to convert their State patents into Commonwealth patents. The Prime Minister has given us a reasonable assurance, and I think it is advisable that we should try to pass the measure as speedily as possible. </para>

                    (South Australia). - I regret that I cannot follow the arguments put forward by some of the speakers in this connexion. The scheme of the Bill was that there should not be a duplication of State patents and- Commonwealth patents in the same area, but that at the same time we should recognise existing rights ; that we should recognise the rights of the owner of a State patent to have the continuance of that patent within the State. But it was not intended that a man who had chosen to patent an invention in one State, reserving 'the right to patent it in the rest of the Commonwealth when facilities for doing so were provided by a Commonwealth Act, should be in any way harassed or embarrassed. What is now proposed is that if an invention is patented in one State, there shall be no possibility of obtaining a patent for the remaining States. That was not intended, and it will cause great disappointment to many investors if the provision is carried into effect. The case to which the honorable member for Kooyong referred is but one of many. Inventors have, in many cases, been content to protect themselves in the State in which they are manufacturing, intending at some future time to take out a patent for the rest of the Commonwealth. Why should they not be allowed to do so
                    <inline font-style="italic">1</inline>
                    Why should men who have taken out patents in one State be in a worse position than men who have taken out no patents at all ? Or why should we deprive them of the existing right to take out patents in other States? The Prime Minister says that to give them that right will be unconstitutional. It has become the custom to say, when there is no other reason for objecting to a proposal, that it is unconstitutional, the word being used as a substitute for " that blessed word Mesopotamia." We have had too much of the cry. In my opinion what I suggest is not unconstitutional. We have the fullest power in this connexion. Under paragraph xviii. of section 51 of the Constitution power is given to legislate with reference to patents and designs, the provision not being accompanied by any restrictive words as to discrimination between the States. On what ground is it unconstitutional to provide what I wish to see provided ?

                        <para>-Yes. If the Prime Minister has his way, the possession of a State patent will be a disqualification for the granting of a Commonwealth patent. Under existing conditions, the holder of a State patent has the right to take out patents in other States where the invention is not in use, and we should not take away that right. If we do so, this' will be a disqualifying instead of an enabling Bill. </para>

                    (Moreton).- If the constitutional objection holds good, and it is impossible to grant a Commonwealth patent which will not apply to every State, I should like to know whether it will not be held that the existence of a patent in any State prevents the granting of a Commonwealth patent for the patented invention, on the ground that it is not a novelty within the Commonwealth

                    I think that, inasmuch as those who have taken out patent rights in the States have paid more than we are asking for a Commonwealth patent, their rights should be recognised, and we should not lose very much if we converted their State patents into Commonwealth patents.

The right | honorable member for South Australia is in i favour of allowing a person who has ob- tained a patent in, say, Victoria, but who at the time of the passing of this measure | has not applied for a patent in New South ! Wales, to ask for a Commonwealth patent which would apply to New South Wales, providing that there has not been user in that State. It is desirable to give patentees that right, if it is not unconstitutional to do so. The Constitution provides that duties of Customs shall be uniform, and that we shall pass laws of taxation without discriminating between the States or parts of the States ; but where is the provision that the patent laws shall be uniform <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> We might as well say that a post-office could not be built in one State because it was not built all over the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt. The Minister has in view the expediency of as soon as possible issuing patents for the whole of Australia, and we are all in agreement with him upon that point. But if at the time the Act came into operation a patentee had not yet applied for his patent in more than one State there is a general feeling that he ought to be allowed to apply for letters patent in any other State, and that in the absence of a prior user he should be allowed to qualify. It must be shown that at the time the Constitution came into force a patent had been issued in one of the States. Of course, after the Act came into force we could not allow a man to apply for an absolutely new patent for any one State. It is only in cases where a patent has already been issued in one or more States that a patent limited to other States could be applied for. I think that a good deal of the heat of this debate has arisen partly from the character of the right honorable and learned member for South Australia, who is strenuous at all times - in breaking a butterfly on the wheel, as in everything else - and to a misunderstanding. Perhaps it would be better for the Prime Minister to postpone the clause for the present, and to think over it. </para>

                <para class="block">South Australia. Last night I drew attention to the same point when I moved in the direction of conferring power on an applicant for a patent to ask that it shall be limited to a particular State. Several patent agents have drawn attention to this, question. I think we should strike out the clause, on -the understanding that clause 42 will be reconsidered. We ought te add the provision contained in paragraph 6 of the present clause to clause 42 ; otherwise I shall have to move the amendment of which I have given notice. The clause applies only to patents which were granted prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth. It is only where a patent has not been made applicable to the whole of the States prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth that a patent may be granted limited to the part not at present covered. </para>

                        <para>- I think the course indicated by the honorable and learned member for South Australia is the correct one. The clause is useless for the purposes for which it was originally intended, and the greater part of it has been incorporated in clause 42. I think, therefore, that it must go. If any provision of this kind be included, it should be separate and apart. It will require to be very care; fully drafted, and I shall be glad if the right honorable and learned member for South Australia, who has had so much to do with the drafting of this measure, will give the matter his attention and draft a clause which will embody his view. I think that he will meet with grave difficulties. When the Bill passed into my hands I found myself at an early stage face to face with the question whether it was intended to apply in the manner now desired - in what I call the partial manner. I at once entertained doubt as to our constitutional competency. Consequently, I adopted what I thought to be a safe attitude. A State patent was to remain a State patent, and, unless it were extended before the Commonwealth was established, it was not to be extended to the point of making it a Commonwealth patent. By section 51 of the Constitution this Parliament is entitled to make laws with respect to such matters as weights and measures, bills of exchange, bankruptcy and insolvency, and patents. It cannot be urged that we are entitled to legislate partially in any of those matters. </para>

                        <para>- This is something more than machinery. My honorable and learned friend was very ingenious in suggesting a way out of the difficulty. He says : Give a Commonwealth certificate in respect of a patent which has already been granted in one or more States. First of all make it a. Commonwealth patent, and then omit from the certificate Victoria, or New South Wales, or Queensland, if in those States patents shall already have been granted, and give to the patentee or his assigns a monopoly in the remainder of the States. That is a possible escape perhaps. </para>

                        <para>- Because the same kind of uniformity is not contemplated. This is expressly a matter of territorial legislation. The advantage to be derived from adopting the suggestion of the honorable and learned member is more superficially attractive than real. The cases in which valuable patents have been taken out in one State and not in others, must be very rare indeed. </para>

                        <para>- Even within my own limited experience I know of cases in which it would be extremely difficult to carry out the proposal of the honorable and learned member. I admit that a provision such as that suggested might prove very useful, but I deny that it is important. Take the case of the cyanide process, for instance. That has been patented in every State. A patent was granted in New South Wales, which has since been revoked, whilst in Victoria the rights of the patentees have been purchased by the State Government. How could we deal with that patent ? Could we grant a patent for New South Wales, where the patent has already been revoked <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> Then, again, to whom should the patent be granted - to the Government of Victoria, which have purchased it so far as it applies to that State, or to the original inventor or some of his assigns? Then, again, there would be different assigns for different patents which have been granted subject to special conditions. .This is particularly the case in Queensland. All these would have to be dealt with upon a territorial basis. If a patent had been granted in Victoria, and it were desired to extend it elsewhere, and it had been published and used in Queensland, but not in New South Wales, we should have to retain in a Commonwealth patent the boundary between New South Wales and Queensland, because no certificate could be granted for the latter State. Suppose it had been published in South Australia, and could not be registered there, but that it had not been published in Western Australia, and that a patent could be granted to the latter State, we should have to. grant a patent for odd States. The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has put the case of a patent which has been taken out for one State only. Take the converse case, in which a patent might have been obtained for five States and not for the remaining one. Does my honorable friend contend that we could grant a Commonwealth patent in order to cover only one State. I shall very carefully reconsider the whole question, which is surrounded with difficulty, and invite the able assistance of the right honorable and learned member for South Australia. I shall ask him to state his proposition. We are now dealing with a proposal to give those who have already obtained rights in some of the States an opportunity to obtain similar rights in other States bv means of a Commonwealth patent. </para>

Persons to whom State patents have been issued can at any time within the next two or three months make application on all the States to protect their rights. The right honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> desires to give State patentees an opportunity to secure a Commonwealth patent. Whether or not that can be done under our Constitution I shall advise the Committee at a later stage. Personally, I hope that it can be done. Consequently, I shall not object to the inclusion of this proposal, especially if it is made severable from the rest of the Bill.

                    (South Australia). - I think that the remarks of the Prime Minister are fair enough. At the same time, I cannot retire from the position I have taken up regarding the necessity of a provision of the character to which I refer. If the right honorable gentleman had not interfered with clause 42, he would not have experienced the slightest trouble in dealing with this matter. I understand that the policy of the Bill, as regards novelty, is chat if an invention has been previously patented a Commonwealth patent will not be issued. Clause 37 provides for that. An inquiry will be made as to whether it has previously been patented, and upon the report of the Commissioner the granting of the patent will depend. Should the report be favorable the patent will issue as a matter of course. According to clause 42, if the Commissioner is satisfied that no objection exists to the specification, on the ground that the invention is already patented either in the Commonwealth or in any State, he shall accept the specification. Clause 43 merely set out what was the position in case the Commissioner was not so satisfied - in the event of his discovering that a prior patent existed either in regard to the whole of the Commonwealth or to any State. It declares -

                <para>Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> deals with cases in which there is a difference between the patent which is proposed and any patent which is already in existence - cases which the Commissioner may well settle. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> was intended to apply to cases in which there was no doubt as to the identity of two patents - the State patent which was originally granted, and the Commonwealth patent which was proposed to be granted. In such instances it was intended to give the Commissioner power to except from the patent any State to which the objection applied. Where there was a. doubt as to whether two patents covered exactly the same ground, patent No. 2 was issued subject to patent No. 1. The third alternative is to refuse the application. I do not know how the matter could have been put plainer. What does the Attorney-General propose? Simply to jumble two clauses together, so as to give the power to specify patent No. 1 when there is a difference, also to give the Commissioner power to refuse the application, but to deny him the power to except from patent No. 2 the State to which the objection referred. It is not very much of a difference ; but I think it is infinitely better not to allow the patentee and the public to be worried by a comparison of the two patents. Where the Commissioner is satisfied that they are identical, it is well to permit him to except from patent No. 2 the whole State covered by patent No. 1, so that there may be no doubt in the minds of anyone concerned that the Commonwealth patent does not refer to a thing of that sort. I cannot put the position plainer, and I do not think it requires to be put plainer. It is an additional power which I venture to think will require to be exercised. I can assure the Prime Minister that there are many cases of the character referred to by the honorable member for Kooyong. Numbers of intending patentees are awaiting the facilities which this Bill offers for obtaining Commonwealth patents. I think that where persons have already secured a State patent they should be assisted in every possible way. Although some men's rights may not extend to the whole of the Commonwealth, but to five-sixths of it, I think they are entitled to equal consideration with those who enjoy the larger privilege. I hold that the adoption of terms such as those which were originally employed will tend towards simplicity, and I hope that further consideration on the part of the Prime Minister may lead to that end </para>

                    <para>- The right honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> desires to insert in the Bill a provision by which any person who is not the patentee of an invention in one State may apply for and obtain patent rights in respect of it in any other State or throughout the rest of the Commonwealth. The impression of the Prime Minister is that the Constitution will not permit of that being done. Should further investigation confirm his present impression, would it not be possible to give to the same patentee the right to obtain a patent which will cover the whole of the Commonwealth, including the State in which he has already secured protection? The reason why we cannot interfere with a patent which is already in existence is that by doing so we should be meddling with individual rights. But where the same individual is concerned we are not trenching upon any person's right. Should he wish to substitute for a State patent a Commonwealth patent which will extend to the State in which he has already obtained protection, it would be extremely hard if he could not do so. A man may recently have patented an invention in one State. It is impossible for him to determine what is the value of that patent until it has been tested. It may prove to be very valuable, and consequently he may desire to secure patent rights in the other States. In such circumstances it would be a great pity if this Bill prevented him from doing so. If we cannot go as far as the right honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> wishes - a proceeding which is most desirable if the Constitution permits of it - I trust that the Prime Minister will look into the matter with a view to ascertain whether it is not possible to grant Commonwealth patents to State patentees. </para>

                    (Northern Melbourne). _ I wish to call attention to this clause, which provides for advertising specifications after their acceptance. Of course the term "acceptance" means that any specification upon the face of it is a proper one, but it does not necessarily mean that a patent will be granted. The object of advertising is to enable people - rival inventors or others - to lodge objections, and to show cause why the patent should not be granted. Of course the report of the Examiner upon the novelty or otherwise of any invention will not be available to the public. But the advertisement is inserted with the object of directing attention to the proposed patent. I am assured that a practice is in vogue - much to the injury of honest inventors - under which, as soon as the specification relating to any invention is made public, patent agents send a copy of it to foreign countries, and take out patents there before the inventor here has had an opportunity to get his patent. The result is that the man in Australia whose brains are responsible for the invention loses the result of his work, and the thief abroad gets the benefit of it. It is this fact which induces me to oppose the idea of advertising specifications. The Bill, as introduced, provided for a thorough examination as to novelty.

                        <para>- Under the Bill as it stands an application for a patent will not be refused because of want of novelty. I am and always have been in favour of a thorough official examination as to novelty. I do not mean to say that such an examination would provide a guarantee as to the novelty of the article or process sought to be patented. That guarantee could not be given because the examination would take place before the rival inventors and those who desired to use the article had been heard. It would be impossible to say on the <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statement of an applicant and a search made by the official examiners that the article in question was novel, but in ninety cases out of one hundred the fact that a thorough examination for novelty has been made by an official examiner gives a practical guarantee of novelty. The result is that the inventor is placed in a better position in dealing with capitalists and the public generally than would otherwise be the case. If a patent is granted only after an examination for novelty has been made, its value is practically ten times greater than is that of a patent which has been granted without any such precaution. It is true that the examination does not assure the novelty of the patent, but there is such a strong probability that an article which has stood that testis novel, that capitalists are willing to help the inventor by taking a share in his invention. I am assuming at present that the Committee will abide by its decision that there shall be no examination for novelty. If no such examination is to take place there will be Still less reason for making a specification public. What is to be gained by adopting such a course ? The fact that a patent has been granted will in no way prove that it relates to an article which is novel, and, therefore, nothing is to be gained by advertising a specification. Rival inventors and the public generally are not bound to read it, and even if an advertisement is published, inviting objections to the application, it does not follow that outsiders will accept the invitation. There is no assurance of novelty in regard to a patent which has been granted after the publication of an advertisement of this kind. I at one time met a patentee in America who felt very aggrieved. He complained bitterly that under the American law a patent is granted to only the actual inventor, and that it is only given to him if the invention was not known at the time of his discovery, as distinguished from the time of its introduction into America. He said that there are English patent agents in Washington who are always on the look out for new patents, and that when they discover anything of the kind they at once send particulars to England and secure the patent rights there. Owing to the English law, which allows a patent to be granted to the man who first imports an invention into the country, and not solely to the actual discoverer, the pilferer is able to obtain a right and to rob the brains of the American inventor. When these facts were placed before me by this gentleman, I began to speak to him about the injustice of the United States copyright law, but he said - " A patent is far more valuable than anything relating to copyright, and in this regard you Britishers are the biggest robbers in creation." I feel that if in dealing with this Bill we find a provision which will assist pilfering of that kind, without giving any compensating benefit, we ought to strike it out. Having regard to the fact that there is no provision as to novelty in the Bill, what can be gained by requiring a specification to be advertised? It will be said, of course, that it is an evil to grant patents which are of no use, and which must mislead those who deal with the holders of them. That is quite true, and I admit that there ought to be an examination for novelty, but there is not-- </para>

                        <para>- I trust that the honorable member will succeed in his endeavour to provide for such an examination, and I promise to give hi in my support. As the Bill stands, however, nothing is to be gained by advertising specifications as is proposed. It will simply enable strangers to take advantage of an inventor's genius. It will delay applications, and at the same time it will insure no greater certainty as to the grant of the patent being of service. It is true that the advertising of a specification will enable opposition to be entered ; but even if objection were taken, no guarantee of novelty would be forthcoming. Very few people search for advertisements of this description. A few patent agents certainly do so, for they are always anxious to send details of inventions to other countries, in order to secure the patent rights there. The keenest look-out is invariably kept in America - I do not suppose that it is so strong in Australia - for any new and marketable invention ; and it seems to me that no compensating advantage is to be gained by the publication of advertisements of this kind. The proper course to pursue would be to allow a patent to issue after the applicant had satisfied the examiners and the Commissioner, and to give power to revoke a patent by machinery as simple as could be devised. If, in these circumstances, a man said - " I do not want to have this patent standing in my way, the patentee has no right to it" ; the answer would be - " The patent has been granted, but you are at liberty to take advantage of simple machinery for its revocation.' </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. But there is no provision in the Bill which will render opposition to an application of any -value. There is no guarantee that such opposition will be of any avail. What is to be gained by advertising for opposition unless, after it has been found that no opponents are forthcoming, the patentee is open to all the risk of action being taken against him in the law courts ? I do not know of any law under which men who work with their brains are more unjustly treated than they are under the patents laws. It is to the interest of patent agents to get their applications granted, in order that they may earn their commission. Having suceeded in doing so, they leave the poor inventors to the mercy of the men who will use their invention and say that it has been used before, with the result that the question of novelty has to be fought out in the law courts. If I had my way, I should provide a much simpler scheme than this. I should say, in the first instance, that we should have a thorough examination by official examiners to determine the question of novelty. Then we ought to give every opportunity to a man who thinks that a patent should not have been granted, to apply far its revocation ; but we should not allow him to see the specification before the grant has been made. In nine cases out of ten the examinees, if competent, may be trusted. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid that if we allow a specification to be made public before the application for the patent to which it relates has been granted, we shall enable men from abroad to send copies of it to other countries, and to obtain patents there before the inventor in Australia has secured a foothold here. I am assured by inventors that this practice is by no means uncommon. I would suggest that the clause be omitted. If this be done, consequential alterations will have to be made in other clauses, but I should not venture to interfere in that direction. I should leave that work to the Prime Minister. There is no harm in advertising the acceptances, though I do not think there is any advantage in doing so, because it is a mere preliminary stage. I hope the Committee will negative the clause. </para>

                    <para>- If the Committee strike out the clause they practically destroy the Bill. It has been drafted upon the latest English system, developed by an extension in the direction of novelty further than we originally proposed to go, whereas if this clause is negatived it will mean the substitution of the American system which has just been commended by the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. Under the American system the examiners are, not merely experts, but judges. They can require further information, and obtain it. They can insist upon alterations, and there is no appeal from their refusal to grant a patent. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, but what some honorable members desire is that want of novelty shall be a barrier. The Bill provides that the knowledge of the Patent Office in regard to novelty shall be placed at the disposal of the would-be patentee. He is to be given all the information possible as to the obstacles in his path, and, if he then chooses to accept a patent, he does so at his own risk. </para>

                        <para>- The public will not be injured because, when the acceptance of an application for a patent is notified, objection can be taken to it. Those who are interested in other inventions which they consider are affected will always be ready to challenge an application for a new patent. The challenge will afford an opportunity for the question of novelty to be settled. According to the original proposal, the question of novelty had to be determined as a condition of obtaining a patent. The Bill now provides that would be patentees shall have the benefit of all the knowledge in the possession of the Department, so that they can re-shape or alter their inventions in order to avoid opposition ; but the Department is not to refuse an application on the ground of want of novelty. If, knowing the risk, an inventor is ready to accept a patent, he is at liberty to do so. Instead of making novelty an essential element in the examination of an application, we make it a possible objection if opposition is raised. </para>

I He is prepared to allow the public officer to be both judge and jury, and to refuse to issue a patent until he is satisfied that there is novelty in the invention for which it is asked. The patentee, however, would still be liable to be brought before the Courts to test the alleged novelty. The honorable and learned member has stated that patents are very rarely challenged after there has been such an examination in regard to novelty as he asks for, but I find that during the years 1895, 1S96, and 1S97, the United States Courts declared seventy-six patents to be invalid, while for the last three years of which I have been able to obtain the figures the English Courts declared only twenty nine patents to be invalid. </para>

I do not press the argument too far, but the facts go to show that there is not the exemption from legal attacks under the American system which is generally supposed to. exist. It is well known that patent cases in the Courts of America occupy a very large body of legal practitioners, as well as a great many patent agents, and that the fights over patents are as keen, if not keener, in that country than anywhere else in the world. The examination into the element of novelty, exhaustive as it often is, does not prevent law suits, and I do not think any examination would do so. </para>

The question of novelty is always indeterminate, and with the multiplication and intricacy of inventions in all countries, even the most elaborate investigation cannot do more than approach the goal of satisfaction. </para>

                <para>As helping to show what small value ought really to be placed upon the preliminary examination system, it maybe interesting to mention that in Germany many patents granted after official examination have been declared void for want of novelty, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Edmunds,</inline> a barrister, who has devoted much attention to, and has written an exhaustive treatise upon, patent law, in the course of the discussion which followed the reading of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> Wise's presidential address at the Chartered Institute of Patent Agents, last November, said that he had recently had an opportune of personally inspecting the working of the examination as to novelty in the United States, and of talking to some of the examiners on the subject. He must confess that he went to the States rather enamoured of the American examination system, but he had returned quite the reverse. It appeared to him that the examination as to novelty was in a large number of cases highly vexatious and troublesome, that it led to an enormous amount of correspondence and worry and expense, and, further, that even when the patent was granted there was very little guarantee as to its validity. He had been told by these who were in a position to know, that something like 70 percent, of the total number of patents granted were, when litigated in the courts, declared void. What could be the value of an examination when that was the case ? Not 70 per cent, of the patents granted in this country, or anything like that number, were declared void. </para>

                <para class="block">I do not attach great importance to these statements, because they were made ten years ago, but they tend to show that novelty is a relative term. We cannot be entirely satisfied of the novelty of an invention. No man can possibly be aware of all that has transpired in every country, and the question arises as to the measure of the novelty to which we are prepared to certify. When the honorable member for North Sydney put before the Committee the reasonable proposal that where there was obviously no novelty in an invention, a patent should be refused, I asked him not to press it at present, because we have the enormous task before us of putting the whole of the State records in order. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt it will impose a considerable burden upon the office, but it will mark a great step in advance in the practice with regard to patents, because inventors require to be informed of the circumstances which lead to the conclusion that there is an absence of novelty in their inventions. It seems to me that that is about as far as we can go in regard to the examination as to novelty at present. When we have established the Patent Office, steps will be taken to extend these examinations as to novelty. If, however, we were to be plunged into the adoption of a system altogether new to Australia, and which, although it has been followed in America, has its defects, we should find great difficulty in taking up the work of administration which has been carried on in the States upon entirely different methods. We are now face to face with difficulties which must be multiplied immensely if we introduce an entirely new system. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see how we can modify it. The scheme of the Bill contemplates that any dispute with reference to a patent shall take place before it is granted. If there are no objectors, and the burden is to be thrown upon the examiners, and if, after the examiners have finished their work, the question is to be one entirely for the Courts, an entirely different; scheme will have to be adopted. I believe the thefts of patents to which the honorable and learned member has referred as having taken place in America and Great Britain have now practically been done away with, because I understand that, under the Treaty of Paris, a reciprocal arrangement has been entered into by which twelve months' protection is assured. The Bill has been drafted with the object of enabling the Commonwealth Patent Office to receive similar consideration under that Treaty. The evil referred to was a very grave one while it lasted, but now it seems to have been abolished. The honorable member's amendment, innocent as it may appear, would have the effect of substituting a system entirely different from that with which we are acquainted in Australia. It is true that under the Victorian and West Australian systems examinations as to novelty are provided for, but in neither case is so much responsibility thrown upon the examiners as is suggested by the honorable member. </para>

The information supplied to me led me to suppose that the protection was good for twelve months. The whole question now before us is whether we should alter the system proposed by the Bill and substitute that adopted in America, because that seems to be the natural corollary of the honorable member's proposal. If any such vital change were made it might be impossible to pass the Bill this session. </para>

There is no reason why an applicant should be called upon to fight in the dark, without any knowledge of the objections urged against his application. In the United States and Canada, if any difficulty arises the examiner reports fully to the applicant as to the grounds upon which he takes exception to the application. I am not prepared to propose an amendment, but I mention the matter to the Prime Minister, because I am quite sure that he wishes to protect applicants for patents. </para>

                    <para>- Practically, the invariable rule has been to treat the reports of the -examiners in the way proposed, and it is very often to the interests of the applicants themselves that this practice should be followed. It is of great advantage to the applicants to be informed of the purport of the reports against them. We have made provision to that effect in clause 41, and consequential amendments are to be made later on. The question as to how far these reports should be made public has been very carefully considered by the officials concerned, who have advised that this provision should be retained. We have made a considerable step in advance by inserting provisions which will place the patentees in possession of the most material part of the information at our disposal. </para>

                    (Northern Melbourne).Does the Prime Minister think that the provisions contained in this clause have been sufficiently worked out ? For instance, paragraph c declares that any person within two months from the advertising of the acceptance of a complete specification may give notice of opposition to the granting of any patent, on the ground that the invention to which it refers has been previously patented in the Commonwealth, or in a State. The fact that an invention has been patented in a State is to be regarded as an objection to the issue of a Commonwealth patent. Of course, that provision bears directly upon the question which has already been raised by several honorable members. But I would point out that if any alteration is to be effected in the policy of this measure, a similar alteration must be made here. Paragraph
                    <inline font-style="italic">e</inline>
                    sets forth as a possible ground for opposition to the issue of any patent, that the invention to which it refers is not novel. Paragraph
                    <inline font-style="italic">f</inline>
                    covers the same ground. Is that intended

                        <para>- I admitted last night that in portions of the Bill - and this is one of them - the drafting was not that which I should have adopted, nor do I think it is that which would have been followed by the right honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> had it not been pressed upon him by the Patent Officers. They declare that the public have come to place a specific meaning upon these terms, and that therefore they should be adhered to. At the same time I think that they might have been disposed of by a briefer and simpler statement. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to ask the Prime Minister if he thinks that two months is a sufficient time within which to allow of objections being taken to the granting of any patent ? Only this afternoon the case of the patenting of the cyanide process was mentioned. In that case the patentees really had no legal standing in Queensland until they secured an amendment of their patent. These matters are usually advertised in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> - a publication which the average person does not read. As a result the patentees of the cyanide process were allowed to amend their patent in such a way as to give them power, in the event of any other chemical being discovered for the extraction of gold - no matter how remote it might be from cyanide - to claim that it was covered by their patent rights. Consequently the mining industry in Queensland had to pay a royalty upon a large quantity of gold which was extracted by this process. Indeed the northern portion of that State alone must have contributed ?100,000 by way of royalty. I think that the period of two months prescribed in this clause should be extended to at least three months. </para>

                    <para>- I do not like this provision. More than two months might be occupied in reaching the centres of population, where the Patent Offices will be established, from the remote parts of the different States. The time limit imposed by the clause is altogether too brief. Paragraph sets forth, as a ground of objection, that the invention has been described in a book or other printed publication issued in the Commonwealth before the date of the application. The provision, it seems to me, will deprive a man, who has obtained a patent in any State, of his right to become a Commonwealth patentee. I wish to preserve to him that right, and I am not at all sure that we have done that, despite the assurances of the Prime Minister to the contrary. Let us suppose for example that a man obtained a patent in New South Wales in 1899, and that another individual, taking advantage of that invention, obtained a patent in respect of it in Victoria the following year, under this Bill who would have the priority of claim ? The original inventor would probably be the man who patented the invention first. But two conflicting claims would arise. </para>

                        <para>- I am inclined to think there is a great deal in the remarks of the honorable member for Kennedy. I find that the report which I have in my hand relating to the British patent system throughout the Empire does not refer to this point. Reference to the Victorian Act, however, shows that in connexion with the granting of patents in this State two months are allowed for lodging objections. If that period is not too long in the case of Victoria, it certainly does not err upon the side of liberality in the case of the Commonwealth. Of course it is very undesirable to keep an applicant whose patent has been accepted upon the tenter-hooks for a longer period than is necessary. Every extension of the time within which objections may be lodged constitutes an injury to him. We should, therefore, only allow such a period to elapse as will afford persons throughout the Commonwealth a fair opportunity to to lodge their objections. I feel some hesitancy in suggesting any further term, but I am prepared to extend it to three months. </para>

                    <para>- The undoubted difficulty is that the adoption of such a proposal would mean the introduction of still another tribunal. Although I am told that in Victoria comparatively few appeals have been made from the decisions of the Crown Law Officer, there is no doubt that the suggestion of the honorable and learned member, if carried into effect, would interpose another tribunal in cases in which contentious litigants were concerned. S? iar, I am without prejudice against the proposal, but I am assured by patent agents that they much prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court. </para>

                    (South Australia).- I do not know whether the Prime Minister is prepared to accept the amendment which I have circulated, but I have simply put it forward by way of suggestion. I have been consulted with regard to this question by several patent agents, who think that if the enlargement of the time of payment were extended to twelve months, and proportionate charges made for each additional month over the period at, present provided for in the Bill, considerable revenue would be obtained. It is purely a matter of conjecture.

                        <para>- This is a question relating to the' time of sealing. It has been pointed out that the term of sixteen months, although apparently universally agreed upon as fair, might in some very exceptional cases be insufficient. It is thought that the difficulty might be met by regulation, and that this brief and general manner of dealing with the matter will permit of greater elasticity in these exceptional circumstances. </para>

                    <para>- My attention has been drawn to this clause by representatives of the inventors, although I confess that I cannot see my way clear to move an amendment in the direction which they desire. They state that, occasionally, owing to opposition or other reasons, the sealing and issuing of a patent extends over a considerable period ; and that the grant itself dates back to the time of application, so that sometimes as much as a year in the duration of a patent, which may be for only seven years, is lost. I cannot say that it is altogether lost, because a man may use his provisional patent to some extent, although he is not fully protected by it. He has only a limited use of his patent, and cannot dispose of it. The inventors desire that the patent should date from the time of sealing and issuing. I know that objections can be urged against such an amendment, but the gentlemen to whom I have referred are very anxious that this proposal should be considered. </para>

                    E. GROOM (Darling Downs).The clause provides that in an action for infringement or in a proceeding for revocation the " Court or a Judge " may make certain orders. In other legislation, however, we have restricted the meaning of the word " Judge " to a Judge of a Supreme Court, and have used the word " Justice " when referring to Judges of the High Court. I think that the word " Justice " should be inserted after the word " Court."

                    (Northern Melbourne).It would be a great convenience to practitioners, and to the public, if a uniform system of reference to other Acts were used in the marginal notes. In Victorian Acts references are given to the exact year of the British Acts cited, so that we know exactly where to look for the original legislation. I suggest that the word " British " should be used in the marginal notes where the reference is to a British Act, just as the word " Canada " is used before the word " Act " in the reference in the marginal note to clause 15.

                    <para>- The Commonwealth cannot expect to derive a large revenue from patentees, and while I am glad that we have hitherto treated would-be patentees so liberally, it must be remembered that the officers of the Department will be put to as much trouble in dealing with an application for an additional patent in respect of an improvement as they were put to in dealing with the original patent, and therefore there seems to be no sufficient reason for charging a lower fee. If the same fee were charged, it might be an inducement to inventors to complete their inventions before applying for patents. </para>

                    <para>- I know that many inventors do not divulge the real secret of their inventions. They make public certain parts of the machinery, but omit what is really vital. That is frequently done by first-class inventors. In one case of which I became aware, a great deal of money was thrown away in Melbourne and in London upon a pirated invention, owing to the fact that the inventor had not disclosed the actual secret of his invention. I think, however, that we should encourage inventors to disclose as much as possible of their inventions, and therefore I approve of the proposal to charge only half-fees for additional patents in respect to improvements. </para>

                    (South Australia).- There is a provision in sub-clause 9 to the effect that where a patent has been- revoked on the ground of fraud, the Commissioner may grant the actual inventor a patent bearing the same date as the date of revocation of the patent revoked. It has been represented to me that some other date should be provided for. I have seen a statement of the President of the Chartered Institute of Patent Agents in Great Britain, who characterizes this clause, which is copied from the British Act, as the most absurd of enactments. Personally, I am not inclined to attach very much importance to the point, because I assume that it is covered by a later provision, but I was asked to direct attention to the matter.

                    <para>- Sub- clause 10 provides that an appeal shall lie from the decision of the Supreme Court to the High Court. "For my part, I should much prefer to see the power to revoke a patent given to the Commissioner. He grants the patents, and why should he not have the power to revoke them? Of course, it might suit the lawyers to have as many applications as possible made to the Court, but I think that applications for revocations could be effectively dealt with by the Commissioner at far less expense than by the Courts. </para>

                        <para>- Not always; because in some cases it is obvious that the patent should be revoked, and that no one could with any advantage proceed any further. I think it would be advisable to strike out paragraph 10, as it throws a doubt upon the question of the appeal to the High Court. We have already provided in the Judiciary Act for appeals in all such cases, and that should be sufficient. </para>

                    <para>- This clause is copied from the provision in the English Act of 1902 with regard- to the issue of compulsory licences. There are, however, some omissions which the Prime Minister might explain. The words of subclause 1 are taken from the English section, which contains these words in addition " or in the alternative for the revocation of the patent." I do not know why these words should have been struck out. Some of the patent agents think that they should be restored. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to specially direct the attention of honorable members to the provision contained in sub-clause 6. The powers given in the English Act, from which this clause is copied, are very extensive, and should prove very valuable. In the war upon which those great industrial corporations called trusts are at present entering against the unorganized industries of different peoples, this particular clause is likely to be of extreme service. In fact, apart from this claude, I do not know -what protection could be offered against such corporations as those which have bought up all the inventions connected with machinery used in some of the great manufacturing industries. These trusts will not sell the machines which have become essential to such industries, but only rent them at rates which practically pay for the cost of the machines. They levy further charges for their use, at the same time making it a condition that all other machinery of a similar class shall be purchased from them. As a result of this, manufacturers in other States are likely to be reduced to the position of hirers of the machines which have become essential to them. These operations have been very much commented upon in' Great Britain, and it was partly <inline font-style="italic">owing to</inline> the representations made regarding this development that the provision was introduced into the English law. I propose to amend the sub-clause so that it will read as follows : - </para>

                        <para>- Yes. But I am prepared to meet that objection by pointing out that the word " reasonable " allows such a large amount; of latitude that no Court would press unduly upon the proprietors of a machine. , In construing a point of this kind, the Courts would lean in every way towards protecting the interests of the seller, and they would only take action against him in the event of some abuse of his proprietorship. It might, perhaps, be objected that the phrase is not so strong as it ought to be. At all events it appears to me to take a step in a direction to which my attention has been pointedly called by the Melbourne Chamber of Manufactures. I have been shown conditions in leases to which manufacturers in this State are now obliged to conform which absolutely restrict their freedom of operations. This proposal inflicts no hardship upon the patentee. He is granted a monopoly, and so long as he either hires or sells at what the Court does not consider to be unreasonable prices no one can interfere with him. It is only when he seeks to obtain a trade monopoly that any Court would dream of interposing. In view of the gravity of the situation which is being created here, as well as in the' mother country, I move - </para>

                        (Northern Melbourne).I think that it is absolutely absurd to give any man a monopoly which not only enables him to make a considerable profit out of his invention, but prevents others from making use of it upon reasonable terms. Whilst we ought to offer every legitimate encouragement to inventors, some limit must be imposed. If this proposal be carried, is it the intention of the Prime Minister to propose that all inventions shall be worked within the Commonwealth

                    (South Australia).- This amendment seems to involve a much bigger issue than honorable members would imagine from the gentle manner in which the Prime Minister has moved it. The object of patenting an invention is to allow its author to obtain a special price for his article - a price which he otherwise could not secure. Surely then, it is the height of inconsistency to subsequently ask the Court to fix the price of it. We propose to extend to an inventor protection for fourteen years, and afterwards to allow the Court to cut down the price of his invention to what it regards as a reasonable sum. Probably that price will approximate to what competitors in other lines of business think it is worth.

                        <para>- And to stimulate inventive genius by affording inventors protection for a prolonged term. Under this proposal, an inventor may be harassed by a series of actions during the whole of that period. Applications may be made to the Court to vary the price of his patent from year to year. Thus, by the time his patent rights have expired, he may have lost the greater part of the benefit which he had anticipated receiving. Certainly, if he has to defend five or six actions in the Supreme Court during the fourteen years' currency of his patent, he will be involved in considerable expense. I trust that the Prime Minister will reconsider this matter. If we establish this precedent, it will develop in the same way that legislation has developed in New Zealand under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon's</inline> rule.

                    <para>- I thoroughly agree with the honorable and learned member for South Australia in regard to this proposal. I am anxious that the formation of trusts shall be prevented, but I think that honorable members should be allowed more than five or six minutes in which to&gt; to consider a matter of such grave importance. To my mind, the words in sub-clause 6, " to manufacture the patented article in the Commonwealth to an adequate extent," fully meet the position. Let me point to the inventor of the linotype as an example. I believe that the actual material and workmanship in that machine costs less than ?200, although the machine itself cannot be purchased under ?1,200. At the same time I am very doubtful whether any court would decide that 500 per cent, was a. proper profit for its inventor to make. If we start to consider such matters, we shall only get ourselves into the most awkward of dilemmas. If an inventor is not to enjoy the right to use his patent as he chooses for fourteen years, what is the use of ingenuity and ability? Moreover, under this proposal, an opportunity will be afforded to drag every patentee before the Court, and, as a result, endless litigation will arise. 'Every man who imagines that the price of a patented article is in excess of what it should be, will invoke the aid of the Court. I need scarcely remind honorable members that in the early days of his career, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edison</inline> himself was greatly harassed by rivals, who involved him in litigation. I support the position taken up by the honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn.</inline></para>

If we deprive inventors of their right to make all that they possibly can out of their inventions we shall rob them of their greatest incentive. I hold that the public are amply protected against an unreasonable charge being made for any patented article, by reason of the fact that an excessive price would result in its disuse. The proposal of the Prime Minister involves a very vital departure, and one which follows upon the lines of that policy which seeks to regulate the value of a man's work, his inventive genius, and his capacity by Act of Parliament. </para>

The value of any invention must be determined by a comparison between what the user was paying for his appliances prior to the invention being placed upon the market, and what he pays for the invention itself. If the appliances which he was previously using were superior, there will be no demand for the invention. If, on the other hand, the invention is superior, there will be a demand for it, and the price paid for it will be in proportion to its superiority. This is a limitation on the patentee. </para>

                        <para>- I am not sure, but I think that in that case the reduced price is due somewhat to the reduced cost of the production of the article. We have to recognise that if a man was prepared a few years ago to pay 15s. for the burner in question, it was because he obtained some advantage from its use. If, by its use, he could reduce the quantity of gas consumed on his premises, it was to his advantage to purchase the burner, and to allow the inventor the advantage of his patent rights for fourteen years, knowing that 'at the expiration of that period he would effect a still greater saving. Thus the public have been advantaged by that patent, although the patentee, in the first instance, may have received a very high price for his invention. It is very difficult to determine what is a fair price to allow for a patented article. We know that in many cases inventors have devoted the best part of their lives to the work of perfecting some improvement in a process or article of manufacture; and that in some cases they have lost thousands of pounds belonging to themselves or to other people in making that effort. When, after such an experience, an inventor at last achieves success, it is very difficult to say what he should receive in respect of his patent during the fourteen years over which it extends. The only true guide to the proper price to be fixed is the consideration of the question whether the public gains an advantage by purchasing the invention at the price demanded by the patentee. It would not suit a patentee to demand a price for his invention that would discourage its use. </para>

                        <para>- We should not leave it open to a patentee to be harassed merely because of some extraordinary circumstance which may have occurred in relation to a particular patent. Under this proposal a patent granted to a poor man will be practically worthless to him. He will be constantly harassed by men who desire to obtain possession of his patent, and who are better able to bear the cost of proceedings at law. A patent will be worth nothing to a man who has no means to defend actions brought against him under this provision. Will a rich monopoly suffer under it ? No. The man who will suffer will be the individual who cannot afford to go into court and contest the points of law which a provision such as this will enable people who want to secure his patent to raise. In these respects this is a very dangerous provision. I admit that in a few cases it may confer some advantage on the public, but it will be a serious danger to patentees, and more especially to patentees in poor circumstances. Ample provision is made for the Court to deal -with the difficulties which have been suggested. If in a case such as that to which the Prime Minister has referred, powerful foreign monopolists desired to retain the advantages of their invention for their own country they would probably secure patent rights for it abroad - in Australia, for example - and might charge a price for the article which would exclude its use or consumption here. But we have here a provision enabling the Court to grant a compulsory licence to others if it is shown that any existing industry, or the establishment of any new industry, is unfairly prejudiced by the action of the patentee. That is a fairly strong provision, and constitutes a great source of protection to the public. The Court . has also power to determine what shall be done if the demand for a patented article is not reasonably met. That touches the question of cost to which the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has referred. When the sale of a patented article is absolutely restricted, and people are unable to obtain possession of it because of the high price demanded by the patentee, the Court may be called upon to determine what shall be done in order to 'remedy that difficulty. But to say that in every case brought before it the Court shall decide what is a fair price to be charged for a patented article is a very serious matter. An invention may be hit upon by chance, while on the other hand, another patentee may have devoted many years of his life to the work of improving and perfecting an invention useful for the same purpose. In such a case the Court would have to say, " These patents, although distinct, are useful for the same purpose, and the public must take their choice. The price of this patent accidentally hit upon by this inventor, shall be so and so ; but as the other invention was devised after years had been spent in conducting experiments, and as the result of a considerable outlay the proper price to fix for it should be higher." Is that a fair way to make a comparison1? If these articles were designed for the same purpose and were practically equal, would they not be of equal value to the public ? This proposal will reduce the value of patents. It will operate to the disadvantage of the poor patentee, and will not accomplish more than would be accomplished by the other provisions designed to protect the public interest. </para>

                        <para>- Because the two questions are wholly different. If the honorable and learned member were a judge, how would he deal with the case which I have just mentioned? Surely he would have a right to take into consideration the plea made by an inventor that he had spent twenty or thirty years of his life in perfecting his invention, and to allow him to charge what he considered to be a fair price for it ? If another man came before him and produced an equally useful patent which he had perfected without the expenditure of much time or money upon it, what would he do ? Would he say - " These two articles, designed for the same purpose, although different in construction, should be sold at different prices," and thus practically deprive the man who had spent much time and money in perfecting his invention of a market for his patent ? The only way in which to decide these questions is by having regard to the principle which is really at the root of all patent laws. Let us assume, for example, that there is a certain process or article in use by the public, and that some one effects what he believes to be an improvement upon it. The public test it, and, finding that it is an improvement, they are willing to pay a certain price for it. </para>

                        <para>- Does not the honorable and learned member see that the clause already provides for the case of a man who declines to sell a patented article <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The public will only buy a patented article at a price which will enable them to obtain better results by using it than they could get by doing without it. I think that the Bill itself provides for cases in which the patentees will not sell. We are departing from the principles of patent law. Those principles are, first, that in order to encourage invention patentees should be given a monopoly for a certain period of the right to sell their inventions. But unless an invention is sold to the public at a price at which they can gain an advantage by using it, they will not buy it. </para>

                        <para>- The provisions of clause 88 have nothing to do with the question now under discussion. Although for a limited period patentees have a monopoly of the right to sell their inventions, at the end of that period the public have the full advantage of the inventions. There is no occasion for such an amendment as the Minister has moved, and I regard it as a dangerous one. It will be difficult to administer, and will play into the hands of those who wish to worry patentees, and especially poor patentees. Moreover, it will make patents of much less value than is the intention of most patent laws. </para>

                        <para>- They mutt use it, because the trust has bought up the latest patents. Proceedings of this kind were incredible to me until I was given proof of them, because I did not believe that it was possible for such a condition of dependence in business to be created in Australia. I find, however, that some of our manufacturers are absolutely at the mercy of a foreign trust which holds them in the hollow of its hand. My amendment is designed to provide a means to put an end 'to such a state of things. </para>

                        <para>- Sub-clause 6 has been borrowed from the English Act. What I aim at is the utter misuse of the monopoly created by patents. The profits of patents ought to be large, because it is necessary to offer great prizes in order to encourage inventors. But we should prevent wealthy combinations from obtaining control of whole trades by getting into their possession all the machinery which is necessary for carrying on those trades. Perhaps it would be better if I substituted for the amendment which I have already moved the words - </para>

                    (North Sydney).- Although the honorable member's alteration is an improvement upon his original amendment, I would point out that the words do not meet the case to which he referred, because the machinery of which he spoke is, he says, leased and not sold to the manufacturers. I think it would be better to say " or to provide or sell the patented article except upon unreasonable terms."

The honorable member for North Sydney has pointed OUt that inventors have often spent years in bringing bo fruition something upon which their brains have been working. For instance, the inventor of the Wolseley shearing machine worked at it for, I am afraid bo say, how many years. </para>

                        <para>- Surely when an inventor has perfected his invention and obtained a patent for it, he should be able to obtain a large reward. Some inventors are lucky, and are able to perfect their ideas in a few hours or days, but very often an inventor has spent years in perfecting his invention. It is proposed to leave in the hands of the Government the decision as to the reward which shall be given bo a man for many years of labour. Ib would be just as fair to cut down the fees of a barrister after he had proved himself especially competent and skilful. I know that there is such a thing as a taxing master attached bo the Courts bub some barristers are allowed much higher fees than are others. We might by imposing a condition of the kind now proposed, prevent some big combination from doing harm, bub ab the same time we should work infinite mischief bo a large number of poor inventors </para>

The manufacturers of the Wagner and the Mann railway cars were ruined by the Pullman Car Manufacturing Company, which captured every important invention used in car building. The other works were crushed out, and a gigantic monopoly was reared upon their crumbling remains. Then, again, the whole world is to-day paying tribute to one man in Pennsylvania for the use of the Westinghouse brake. </para>

                        <para>- On the contrary it will enable every man to place his invention upon the market. It is only fair that the Courts should decide what is reasonable or unreasonable. It has been pointed out that one man may work for thirty years upon an invention, whilst another may hit upon an important discovery by a flash of thought, as did Holliday of San Francisco, the inventor of the cable tramway system. All these diverging circumstances in connexion with inventions cannot, however, be sufficiently provided for. We must recognise the doctrine of the survival of the fittest. I am glad that the Prime Minister has endeavoured to embody in this Bill the principle that the people shall rule. If a man does not wish to sell his patent we should compel him to make it available to the public at a reasonable price. We know that inventors require the fullest encouragement : but, at the same time, we should protect the public against monopolies. Inventions of the utmost value and importance in mining operations have been purchased by two or three big monopolists, who have crushed out all smaller competitors. We must look after the " little fellows," because the time has come when no individuals in the community should be allowed to profit by the misfortunes or follies of their fellows. </para>

                    <para>- I think we may regard this proposal as a crowning' piece of cheek on the part of protectionists. It is characteristic of the whole movement. First of all the boot manufacturers aimed at securing a monopoly of the trade in the Commonwealth by means of the high protective duties imposed by the Tariff. Then they claimed that all their machinery and tools of trade should be admitted free of duty, and now, forsooth, they ask that they should be granted the benefit of other men's brains. They want to compel inventors to sell the product of their brain work for years at any price that may be fixed upon by those who require to use the inventions. This Bill will prove to be so much waste paper if this provision is retained in it, and I shall fight it by every means in my power. </para>

The conditions of the boot trade were mentioned only by way of illustration, and boot manufacturers are not more interested in this matter than are others. In these matters we must go back to first principles. Patents are monopolies, and some people think that no patents should be granted. The State having adopted the view that inventors must be encouraged to a limited extent, we must not allow patents to be so used as to prevent inventions from being employed to proper advantage. In some cases, manufacturers who have large plants purchase the patent rights of new inventions which would have the effect of displacing their antiquated appliances, with the object of preventing the new machines from being adopted. </para>

                        <para>- This provision is intended to improve the position of the poor inventor, who is only too glad to sell his invention if he can obtain a reasonable price. Under the British law the Crown can compel a patentee to make his invention available to them for nothing. If the Crown is to be allowed to use inventions without compensation, and we are to give to the patentees advantages which are not conferred upon them by the existing law, surely we are entitled to compel patentees to give to the public the benefit of their inventions at a reasonable price <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> May I also point out that we are really haggling over a matter which the clause already concedes in other directions. It provides that, in case of default on the part of the patentee to work his patent or to manufacture it within the Commonwealth to an adequate extent, or to grant licences upon reasonable terms, the Commissioner shall have power to grant a compulsory licence or to revoke the patent. Surely we ought to be as hard upon the vendor of patented articles as we are upon their inventors. A great deal has been said in reference to the liability of the poor patentee to be attacked upon all sides. But I would point out that he cannot be attacked unless with the consent of the Commissioner. Under sub-clause 2, no person can attack a patentee for not fulfilling the reasonable requirements of the public, unless he first obtains the leave of the Commissioner. </para>

                        <para>- No. The applicant must satisfy the Commissioner in the first instance, and if he cannot do so that officer will dismiss the application. There is no power of appeal from the Commissioner's discretion. That fact alone affords adequate protection to the patentee. I feel that honorable members who have opposed this proposal have done so chiefly because it constitutes a new departure. But, after all, it will inflict no hardship upon the patentee, and, therefore, I sincerely hope that honorable members may see their way to allow the clause, in its modified form, to be carried. </para>

It seems to me that mere neglect on the part of the patentee to work his patent should not subject him to any oppressive treatment. In its modified form, however, the clause is not open to the same objection which I previously urged against it.

                    (North Sydney).- The Prime Minister has been able to give only one illustration of the necessity for such a provision as he proposes. The case which he cited had reference to certain machines, which are used in an industry to which consideration has been given by the State, in order that a demand may be created for the article which they produce. But I would point out to him that that case is already met by sub-clause 6, which declares -

                <para class="block">The one claim which could be urged in the case instanced by the Prime Minister was that the industry employing these machines was unfairly prejudiced. That case, therefore, is fully provided for by the provision in question. The only instance which was mentioned by the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne was one in which the patentee or his assignee refused to sell a patented article. Such a case, I contend, is fully met by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of the same sub-clause. But the Prime Minister desires to go further arid to introduce the question of price. Such a proposal must tend to the injury of the poorer inventor. The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne declares that the Commissioner must first decide that a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case has been established. That is just one of the means which will be adopted for harassing the poor patentee. A complaint can be made to the Commissioner that the price demanded for any article is , excessive. If the patentee is possessed of means, of course he will fight the matter, but the poor patentee will be compelled to prove to the Commissioner that the price demanded by him is not excessive. If persons wish to reduce the value of his patent, they will merely require to appeal to the Commissioner. If they make certain statements in order to support their complaint that the price charged for any article is unduly high, he will be compelled to bring rebutting evidence. This may involve him in a considerable outlay. The Prime Minister has expressed his admiration for the English Act. . Then why does he not follow the language which is employed in it?

I have shown that the Bill provides for the cases mentioned by the Prime Minister and by the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. We shall incur great risks, and we do not know where the consequences may end. We shall also place the poor inventor at a greater disadvantage than before. Questions affecting his patent will be constantly raised under this provision by those who wish to depreciate his invention, in order to obtain possession of it at a lower price than he is entitled to receive. The Prime Minister admits that the gain will be slight. I do not think that any advantage will be derived from this proposal, and I contend that we should not incur these additional risks. We should accept the provision as it stands, for the best guide to the price of an article is its value to the public. </para>

At the time we purchased that board, the Western Electric Company had patent rights for New South Wales. A switchboard sold by the Ericson Company was regarded by our experts as much superior, and the price of it was about ?4,000 less than was asked for the board we purchased. </para>

As a matter of fact, we did purchase some jacks, which were considered to be of a much superior character, from an agent in Victoria, but the agent for the Western Electric Company in New South Wales took the company from whom we purchased them to Court, and the Equity Judge gave us a good drubbing - rightly so, I believe. I did not think we had any right to do as we did, and I was not aware of it until it was done. Ought there not to be some provision by which the Government can make arrangements to take an improvement upon terms which would be financially fair to existing patentees <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

In Sydney we are using inferior appliances in the Telephone Department because of the existence of the patent rights to which I have referred. In a matter of this kind it is only a question of payment between the Government and the patentee. If a Government took care that a patentee lost nothing, it should be at liberty to use any other invention. </para>

                    E. GROOM (Darling Downs).There is one aspect of the question raised by the honorable member for Wide Bay to which I would direct the attention of the Prime Minister. It might happen that in one of the States a patented process for some mining operation was being sold at an extortionate price, and the Parliament of that State might desire to acquire the patent rights in order to enable the public to make use of the invention more cheaply. Under the Bill as it stands, however, the patentee could not be compelled to sell his patent to a State. A State could not compel him to sell what he has acquired under a Jaw of the Commonwealth. I understand that the honorable member desires that power shall be given to the Governments of the States to acquire patent rights for use by the public on the same terms as those upon which they can be acquired for use in the Public Service.

                    (Wide Bay). - I am glad that the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs has thrown more light upon my suggestion. Those who have any knowledge of Australia must know that there are in existence patents which it would-be advisable for either a State or the Commonwealth to purchase right out for the benefit of the public. Such a step would also be beneficial to the patentees, because they would at once receive the profit of their inventions. I should like to see it specifically provided in the Bill that a patentee may go to a State Government and say, " I am willing to accept a certain sum for the patent rights I hold within this State."

                    <para>- There are persons other than solicitors, or those who are at present practising as patent agents, who might be equally entitled to become registered as patent attorneys. For instance, when the Commonwealth Patent Office is brought into existence the whole of those officers now employed in the States offices may not be absorbed into the Commonwealth service. Some of these might be specially qualified to act as patent attorneys, and I do not see any reason why they should be required to pass an examination, and to pay a fee of ?5 whilst others, perhaps less competent, are admitted without complying with any such conditions. I suggest that, in addition to those who pass the prescribed examination, the Commissioner should register any person who supplies proofs of competency in accordance with the regulations. Many persons now engaged in Patent Offices would be able to comply with all reasonable requirements without being subjected to an examination, and persons who have been engaged in the patents business in other parts of the world might also be able to give satisfactory evidence of their qualification for the position. I hope that the Minister will consider the matter. </para>

The patent agents suggest that the practice under the South Australian Act, the Victorian Act, the Canadian Act, and the United States revised rules of 1 899 and other patent laws, should be adopted. </para>

                        <para>. - I was so closely engaged to-day - first with the Cabinet, and then with "the Patents Bill- that I have not had time to deal with the papers of my Department for the last two days. I take it that the intimation has arrived from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Woodford,</inline> who is the British Resident in the Solomon Islands. If I find any information in the papers I shall inform the honorable member <inline font-style="italic">for</inline> Wide Bay to-morrow. I shall ask the Attorney-General to convey to the Chief J Justice the intimation that inter-State members of the legal profession wish to do the Bench honour, and I have no doubt that an arrangement for the sitting of the Court will be made to meet their convenience, The presentation of the evidence taken on Capital sites was delayed by the discovery at the last moment that three sheets were missing. The missing sheets have been -obtained from Sydney, and I believe that the report will be circulated early tomorrow. When the House meets to-morrow I shall probably have a statement to make', and perhaps a proposition to submit in (reference to the Federal Capital. </para>
