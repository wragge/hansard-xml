                    <para>-My object in moving the adjournment of the debate last, night was . to give honorable members an opportunity for the free and intelligent discussion of the distribution of the Queensland Federal divisions proposed by the Commissioner recently appointed by the Government for that purpose. I felt that proper consideration and attention could not be given to this important matter if we proceeded with it at the late hour' at which we concluded the sitting. It will be admitted: that the representatives of Queensland should know . pretty well, whether the distribution proposed by the Commissioner is. or is not acceptable to the electors of the' State. I abstained from speaking upon the proposed New South Wales division because I felt that I did not possess the information necessary to qualify me to give an. expression of opinion on the subject, and I did the same in regard to the proposed distributions of South Australia and Victoria.. But, in regard to the matter now before theHouee, we, who represent Queensland, are in a very different position. I had the-' pleasure of spending last week in Brisbane. It was an opportune time to be there, in that it enabled me to meet a larger number of people than I should have met on any other occasion. The annual show was being held, and consequently there were in the city many theusands of people from tho country districts. I mixed freely with them, and took the opportunity to ascertain their feelings in regard to the Commissioner's proposals. I can honestly say that in no instance was any objection to them expressed. Not a solitary elector made the slightest objection to the divisions proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall.</inline> But one morning last week I was very much surprised to read in the Brisbane newspapers that the Minister for Customs intended to move resolutions dis- . approving of the schemes of distribution for the States of Victoria, Kew South Wales, and Queensland. The Queensland - Commissioner himself found that there were few objections to his scheme. He says iti his report that - </para>

                <para>The objections came from the districts of Herbert and Kennedy, the other seven Queensland constituencies offered no word of protest. One of the objections came from the honorable member for Herbert, and the other was from the Cairns Political and Progress Association. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, McDowall</inline> goes on to say that - </para>

                <para class="block">Seeing that there were, so few objections from the electors of Queensland, I do not see why this House should take it upon itself to reject the scheme prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall.</inline> I believe that the Ministry in appointing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall</inline> and the other Commissioners felt the utmost confidence in them. The general public had the same confidence, and were prepared to abide by whatever scheme was proposed by them. What can be the reasons for the determination of the Ministry not to accept the schemes, I am unable to say. But I fancy that there must be other reasons than the drought. A large number of people have come to the conclusion that there must be other reasons. Is it possible that the Minister had a feeling that the divisions prepared for Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland might have such an effect that at the next election some members' of the Government would, be. left out in the cold? </para>

                        <para>- There are members of the Government who represent Kew South Wales and Victoria. Is -it possible that the Minister imagined that the scheme prepared for New South Wales was such that even he might be left out in the cold, and that some members who usually support the Government might find it difficult to obtain seats in the House? The country never expected that the' divisions would be so arranged as to make it easier for members of the present Parliament to obtain re-election. ' The electorates were supposed to be divided in the best interests of the Commonwealth. Speaking for myself, the electorate of Oxley, as now proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall,</inline> is somewhat against my interests. A very large slice of the present Oxley divisions has been taken away from my electorate, and something like 2,000 electors have been given over to my honorable friend, the member for Moreton. I think I am justified in saying that at the last election those electors voted strongly in my favour, and possibly they would do the same again if they had the opportunity. Bat they have been taken away from me, and' have been given to my honorable friend, who, I hope, will receive their support. </para>

                        <para>- I hope I am wrong. I have no desire to do an injustice to any member of this House. I would not willingly do an injustice to any one. But I would remind the honorable gentleman that some time ago, when the honorable member for Gippsland urged that Parliament should make the divisions, the Minister urged that that course would show partiality. The same Minister has now been guilty of greater - partiality than any Minister in Australia has ever been. Although I do not claim that the divisions are in any way perfect, I still maintain that we ought to accept them, and to carry out . the next election on the basis of the new scheme, and not according to the old one. </para>

                        <para>- In Queensland there was a howl of dissent at the time the first division was announced, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall</inline> was sensible enough to discover that he had made a mistake, and to take the first opportunity to rectify it. I do not claim that the distribution is anything like perfect, but at the same time we ought to adopt it for the purposes of the next election. The honorable member for Gippsland, for whom I have the highest respect, suggested that Parliament should make the distributions, but the Minister strongly opposed that idea because he thought that it would expose us to a charge of partiality. </para>

                        <para>- I take it that he would naturally appoint all the Commissioners, and that he would select independent men, persons having nothing to do with politics, and expect them to do justice to the electors, and to leave out of consideration any individual representative. I was surprised to hear that it was proposed to reject the recommendations of the Commissioners. I do not say that it was owing to my absence that the Ministry got themselves into trouble, but, at any rate, they have involved themselves in difficulties, and placed the House in a most humiliating position. Reliable, honorable, and independent men were appointed to perform certain duties, and now that they have brought forward their reports, their efforts should not be utterly ignored. Why does not the Minister allow the Commissioners an opportunity to revise their work ? They carried out the instructions which were given to them. They paid regard to community or diversity of interest, means of communication, physical features, and the existing boundaries of the divisions. Can any honorable member say that the Commissioner for Queensland did not pay due attention to those matters ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that that is an altogether correct statement. I do not claim that the distribution now before us is perfect, but I think it should be adopted as the basis of the next elections, and that when the people who have been driven from the country districts by the drought have gone back, in some twelve or eighteen months' time, a further distribution should be made. When the suspension of the fodder duties was under consideration, no such anxiety was displayed for the welfare of the country people, and I cannot understand why the . Government should now show such concern on their behalf. </para>

                        <para>- My electorate isa very compact one and wonderfully rich, and it requires more looking after than the immense territory represented by the honorable member. The only fault I have to find with the distribution proposed is that Queensland is not divided into ten electorates instead of nine. If the population in that State was counted according to the method that has been adopted in Victoria, Queensland would be entitled to an additional member ; but I understand that this is not the proper time at which to discuss that question. I intend to oppose the motion, and I hope that other representatives of Queensland will do the same, because I believe that the electors of that State are looking forward to being able to exercise the franchise under the proposed distribution at the next election. </para>

                    <para>- I had hoped that the motion proposed by the Minister would be earned on the voices, because it seems to me that the action of the Commissioner for Queensland is practically indefensible. The honorable member for North Sydney referred last night to the fact that no objections had been raised ; but every one who has had anything to do with politics knows very well that in matters of this kind the electors are particularly apathetic Under the conditions of the Electoral Act, copies of the Commissioner's recommendation had to be exhibited for thirty days, and certain forms had to be complied with, and very few men indeed, beyond those intimately concerned, are willing to take any trouble in these matters. It is difficult even to induce men to go to the poll and record their votes, and it is a wonder that any action whatever was taken.' Only two objections were lodged - one from myself, and one from a Cairns political organization. I should like to point out to those honorable members who are exclaiming against the existing divisions, as compared with those proposed by the Commissioner, that, out of 22.2,100 electors, only 5,026 are really interested in the proposed change. The honorable member for Oxley told us .that when he was last in Brisbane he met a number of people from the country. It is the residents in the' country districts who are most interested. in this proposal, and I feel sure 'that they will not object to our adhering to the old divisions for the present. The electors of Maranoa and Kennedy are particularly well represented at present, seeing that they are accorded more than the full value of their votes. Some complaint might be made by the electors in the district represented by the honorable member for Oxley, and in the Brisbane electorate represented, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macdonald-paterson.</inline> The latter district has 3,443 electors in excess of the quota, whereas in Oxley there are only 1,583 in excess. Of the whole of the electorates there are only three which do not come either within the maximum or the minimum. The electors in the Moreton division come within the maximum, and there are only three electorates which would be really affected by our adhering to the present divisions instead of adopting those proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall.</inline> Those which would not be affected are Wide Bay, Herbert, Capricornia, Moreton, Darling Downs, and Kennedy. In the Maranoa district the number of voters is below the minimum but the electors there have no reason to complain, because their votes possess their full value. It is. significant that when the later divisions proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall</inline> were advertised, most of the northern public journals were in favour of them. It is true they declared that the divisions might have been improved upon ; but no very serious complaints were urged, and it was thought that under thecircumstances' they might well be accepted. For instance, a leading newspaper in the- electorate of Capricornia was in favour of them, and so also were several journals in my own electorate. The great outcry which is alleged to have been made was confined to a few , persons who were particularly interested in the matter, and who desired the electorates to be so arranged that they could "dish" the Labour party. That was their expressed desire. But the most significant feature of the whole proceedings was the change ,of front made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall. His</inline> original map was certainly an improvement upon the present one, although the divisions then prepared could not be highly commended. I am convinced that they- would not have been  indorsed by the House, because he- did not attach sufficient weight to considerations of accessibility and community of interest. Forty-eight hours after that map was published <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall,</inline> for some reason or other, saw fit to withdraw it, and to issue an entirely different map. I desire to know what were the reasons underlying his action. Possibly the Minister' can inform us. </para>

J believe that he has the information which will confirm what I say. If that be so, I ask him to lay it upon the table of the House. If my information is accurate, every honorable member ought to vote in favour of the rejection of the Commissioner's recommendations, if only to evidence their disapprobation of the action of certain State Ministers. </para>

                    <para>- It is a power of rejection which we should' exercise. Regarding the proposed new electorates in Queensland, I do not think it can be said that the Ministry desire their rejection upon any personal grounds whatever. To my mind there is ample justification for rejecting the whole of the electoral divisions proposed in that State, because they do not constitute the best scheme that has been submitted to the people. If we take into consideration the conditions laid down in the Act in reference to community or diversity. of interest, means of communication, geographical position, and existing boundaries, I hold that the second scheme proposed by the Commissioner is not the best one possible. I have in my hand the first map of the new Federal electorates which were proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McDowall.</inline> That map was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline><inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> upon the 11th of June last. If honorable members will look at it they will at once realize the tremendous changes that have been effected in it, especially in the electorates of Kennedy, Herbert, Maranoa, Capricornia, and Darling Downs. The boundaries recommended in the electorates of Brisbane, Oxley, and Moreton are practically unaltered. The remaining districts, however, have been completely changed for some reason or other which is not patent upon the face of this report. With a view to ascertain what had brought about this change, I consulted the files of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Courier.</inline> From' these I gather that the original scheme recommended by the Commissioner was published in that newspaper upon the 11th of June of the present year. The whole of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> McDowall's report was printed, and that officer declared that his desire was to place the scheme before the public at the earliest possible moment. Upon the very next morning however, and before the scheme could possibly have reached the electorates of Kennedy, Maranoa, and Darling Downs, a paragraph was published in the journal to which I have referred stating that there was sharp criticism in political circles of the scheme proposed, and the paragraph continued - </para>

                    <para>The directions plainly given by the Federal Electoral Act and the electoral divisions, clearly marked out by the State Government, have been, alike repudiated, with the result of creating dissatisfaction everywhere outside of the SouthEastern electorates. It is therefore gratifying to learn that the Commissioner has stayed his. hand, and that there is apparently some prospect of amended boundaries being devised before the electoral maps are exhibited in the various, divisions as required b}7 law. </para>

                        <para>- The <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> simply recorded the historical sequence of events. It is well able to take care of itself. It has a right to fight as it thinks fit, and I am not making any suggestions in regard, to it. But when we come as n judicial body to consider this matter, and to determine whether we should or should not accept this distribution, I contend that we should have the various stages of each event placed in their order before us, so that we may justly appreciate the significance of the work which we are called upon, to perform. The <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> plainly shows that the first agitation in Queensland with respect to the divisions; was based, not on the contention that the spirit of the Act hod been violated, but on the ground of political considerations. I contend that that fact is clearly and manifestly proved, and that it was never contemplated that we should pay any regard to the question of political considerations when dealing with this matter. The Minister for Trade and Customs was right when he said that so far as the Queensland distribution was concerned, a great variation in the population of the scattered districts had been occasioned by the existence of the drought. I shall give some official figures in respect to this matter which should prove of interest to honorable members. They were published in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier on</inline> the 24th of June, after the revised distribution had appeared, and the police returns had been received. The honorable member for Maranoa will bear me out in saying that the drought started in Queensland about the year 1896, and continued with increasing intensity until recently. It is well known that, after it had been in existence for several years, great fluctuations took place in the population of the State. </para>

                        <para>- That statement is borne out by the official figures. I shall not deal with the changes of population from the inception of the drought, but will take the census returns for 1901, and ask the House to compare them with the police collections. Let us take, for example, the figures relating to the electorate of Capricornia. According to the census returns of 1901, the adult population entitled to be on the rolls for the electorate of Capricornia, as defined in the last report made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall,</inline> was 26,209, while the police collections in December last showed a decrease of 4,681. I am not dealing with the time when the population existed largely in the western parts of Queensland, but' I am taking the figures for the place in respect of which I can obtain reliable statistics. The police collections in December showed ' that the adult population of the electorate was 21,528, or a decrease of 4,681 electors. In the Herbert electorate there was a total decrease of 2,193; in the electorate of Kennedy a decrease of 914; in the electorate of Maranoa a decrease of 2,179 ; and in the electorate of Wide Bay a decrease of 1,932. 8 t </para>

The first proposition which I lay down is, that so far as we can prove by reference to the <inline font-style="italic">Courier,</inline> the first agitation in Queensland was on political grounds and it was not raised by the people particularly interested in the electorates in regard to which complaints were made. The electoral boundaries, as now fixed, are not the best that we can obtain. I think I may be permitted to deal first with the way in which my own electorate has been divided. As a matter of fact, the present division of Darling Downs has been practically mutilated. I shall refer honorable members to the Commissioner's own report in respect of this electorate. On 18th June, when he was defending his position, he said, in the course of an interview with the <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> reporter, that - </para>

                    <para>This excision of Dalby and Carnarvon from Darling Downs was very distasteful to me, and I endeavoured to avoid it ; and it was only to avoid a worse combination that I was compelled to adopt it. I know that the fruit-growers of Stanthorpe, the tobacco-growers of Texas, and the farmers of Inglewood and Goondiwindi, not to mention the Dalby people, will feel themselves badly mated with the immense bat sparsely populated grazing country extending to the South Australian border, but with a margin of only one-fifth allowable, some of the more populous districts nearer the coast had to assist in bringing up the numbers to the minimum permissible under the Act. </para>

                <para class="block">But because representation is given, as it believes, to the opponents of a certain political party, it is quite prepared to support the mutilation. The honorable member for Oxley has stated that he has heard no complaint as to the way in which the divisions have been laid out. I am afraid that he has heard only the felicitations of those who admire his representation of certain interests, or the expression of views in regard to the demarcation of his own electorate ; I doubt if he came into contact with representative men from the other electorates, and got their opinions upon the position. </para>

                <para class="block">If honorable members read the newspapers published in that part of Queensland, they will see that much dissatisfaction has been expressed with the Commissioner's distribution. The <inline font-style="italic">Border Post,</inline> published at Stanthorpe, protests strongly against the position of that district in the proposed scheme,, while the Dalby <inline font-style="italic">Leader,</inline> a newspaper published at the other end of the electorate, takes a similar position, pointing out that Dalby is really a part of Darling Downs, and should not be placed in another electorate. Similar dissatisfaction has been expressed in other divisions. If honorable members turn to the Commissioner's report, they will see that very strong objections were raised by the people of Herbert to his proposals, and strong objections have been urged against them by newspapers circulating in other parts of the State. I believe that the first scheme proposed was, except for a flaw in. regard to the demarcation of the Capricornia division, and which I think might have been altered to meet the requirements of the Electoral Act, the best that could have been put forward, and if submitted to Parliament would have been adopted. I regret the agitation which has been started, not for the good of Queensland, to obtain the due representation of its various interests, but purely for political purposes.

                <para>I say that that provision is imperative. If honorable members look at section 21, they will see that the word " may " is used in regard to the issue of a proclamation by the Governor-General when both Houses of Parliament have passed a resolution approving of any proposed distribution. It cannot be argued that any option is given in regard to the issue of that proclamation. Similarly the word "may" must be regarded as imperative in section 22. Therefore, if either House rejects a proposed distribution, the Minister must send it back to the Commissioner with instructions to him to propose a fresh distribution. It may be said that it is now too late to do that. If so, the Minister is to blame, and our only alternative is to accept the distribution proposed. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but I disapprove of the introduction of a Bill to vary the terms of an Act which contemplates the securing of uniformity in regard to Federal elections. Unless a Bill is introduced to apply to all the States, and the distribution of South Australia is repudiated, the essential principle of Federal legislation, which is the securing of uniformity, will be violated. Although it is not prescribed by the express words of the Constitution that there shall be uniformity in regard to legislation on any of the matters set out in section 51 of that Act, it is evident that the object of all Federal legislation should be to promote uniformity : but if the Government pass such a Bill as is spoken of there will not be uniformity, unless the South Australian division is repudiated, and that is not contemplated. </para>

                        <para>- No; because they will not nil be divided under the same .Act. They will be divided under two Acts, the 8 t 2 provisions of which will not be the same. Anything we do in this matter should be done by one Act. We should not have two Acts, one of which provides for a method of distribution inconsistent with that provided for by the other. For instance, while section 16 of the Electoral Act provides that in the making of any distribution regard shall be had to community or diversity of interest, means of communication, physical features, and existing boundaries, it is not certain that due consideration was given to those matters in. the original division of the States by the States Parliaments. Nor is it certain that the States Acts contain the provision that the number of electors in any division shall not exceed or be below the quota by a difference of more than one-fifth. The provisions in the Electoral Act in regard to that and other matters are imperative, and they should apply to the distribution of all the States. If we provide for the distribution of South Australia and Western Australia by one Act, and that of Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria by another, in which the States divisions are re-adopted, we shall violate the essential principle of federation, because we shall allow the existence of different conditions in the various States. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to discuss the details of the distributions, because they have already been fully dealt with. All the Commissioners were bound by the terms of the Electoral Act, and I do not think that the provisions of that measure have been violated by any of them. If we allow the State electorates to stand, in a great many instances we should violate the principle of division prescribed, the ground of electoral uniformity. </para>

Consequently, we shall have two principles of division, one under the Commonwealth Electoral Act and one under States Acts, and these diverse principles will be repugnant to the spirit of Federal legislation. This consideration will compel me to vote against the proposal of. the Government. </para>

                    <para>- I recognise that the details of the matter under debate should be undertaken by the representatives of Queensland. But it does seem to me that in a general way there is nothing before us, either on the surface of the Commissioner's report or in the representations of the Minister, or, allowing for everything that has been said by one or two of the Queensland members, to justify the absolute dismissal of the procedure prescribed for the protection of the Queensland people. Only two notices of objection to the proposed divisions were received by the Commissioner, and those have been dealt with by him. I should like to know how we could possibly expect any kind of unanimity of feeling with regard to the distribution of electorates in a State like Queensland. We have there a handful of members representing an area in which it must be almost impossible to comply with the conditions set forth in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. </para>

                        <para>- My point is that the division, has been carefully done, presumably after much consideration ; but Queensland is a State which has such an enormous territory that it would be impossible'to please everybody, and impossible to comply with the ordinary conditions laid down in the Electoral Act. Therefore, if we postpone the distribution until after the next election there is no reason to believe - as far as any evidence before us goes - that we shall obtain a better result than is before us today. In view of all the circumstances, in view of the speeches made by some of the representatives of Queensland, in the face of the evidence itself, and of the absolutely meagre information which we have obtained from the Government, we must attribute the tactics adopted in this case to the same motives as induced the tactics which prevailed in dealing with New South Wales. We must assume that for certain political reasons, more with a view of safeguarding themselves in their opinion at the next general election than from any other consideration, the Government have sacrificed the whole of the principles of the Electoral Act of the Commonwealth. We must assume that they have done this in order to suit their own purposes. </para>

                    <para>- I have been particularly interested in the proposals for the distribution of seats for the Federal Parliament, because in the State from which I have come we have had for many years a very bitter experience- in that connexion with regard to the State Parliament. In Western Australia the distribution of seats was so disproportionate that for years and years it was a source of continual agitation. Therefore the people of Western Australia are particularly well educated on the question. They know how the principles of representative government may be defeated by a method of distribution. In that State we had as many as a dozen electorates at one time, each one of which returned a member to the State Parliament, whilst the sum total of the electors in those constituencies was not so great as the number in one other district. For instance, we had a district which had forty-six electors on the roll, but which returned a member to Parliament ; and there was another district with close upon 6,000 electors which also returned only one member. </para>

                        <para>- I can see a great deal of difficulty about reconciling that system of representation with any. democratic ideas. I am much surprised that any honorable member holding democratic opinions should seem to favor such a state of things. I must assume that the honorable member for Maranoa is not in earnest in his interjection, because I am perfectly sure that he favors the principle of equal electorates, and recognises as fully as I do that that principle is the only one by means of which we can secure a fair representation of the people. For the reason I have given, I. am particularly interested in the system of distribution. Whilst the proposal of the Government is not in the matter of discrepancies so bad as the system which existed for so long in Western Australia - and which to a certain extent still exists there - nevertheless the discrepancies which may be found in these proposals are very great indeed. They are so great that I am surprised that so many honorable members holding liberal views should support them. </para>

He asserted that the Premier and the Minister of Railways in Queensland interfered with the Commissioner in the distribution of electorates for the State. According to what the honorable member said, a distribution had .been arranged by the Commissioner, and the scheme had been published in the press of Brisbane, but subsequent to its publication the Commissioner, owing to the representations of the gentlemen mentioned, was induced to entirely alter the boundaries. Of course, as a private individual, the Premier of Queensland, just like any other individual, was entitled to make objections. </para>

                        <para>- The Premier was entitled to make an objection subsequent to the' official announcement as any private individual, might do. But the- method he adopted was reprehensible in the. extreme. If the statement of the honorable member for Herbert be correct - and I presume he would not have made it unless he had very good authority for it - it is not to the credit of the Premier and the Minister of Railways of that' State. Nor is it creditable to the Commissioner that he allowed himself to be influenced by any such representations. But the way in which we ought to -view the proposals of the Government is as follows : - We have now before us, irrespective of the representations which may have been brought to bear upon the Commissioner, the old scheme which was made three years ago under a different franchise, and when the conditions were altogether different from what they are mow, and the new scheme arranged by the Commissioner appointed for the purpose. I gather from the report that there are great discrepancies in the numbers of electors in the present divisions. In the Brisbane -electorate there are 33,057 electors, and in the district of Oxley 31,197. On the other hand, the district of Kennedy has 18,897 electors, and Maranoa only 16,484. It will therefore be seen that there are in Brisbane twice as many electors as in Maranoa. Under these circumstances, I fail to see how any honorable members holding liberal views can do other than approve of the distribution proposed by the Commissioner in preference to that made three years ago. </para>

                    <para>- I noted with interest what was said by the Minister in introducing this resolution. He put it that the very sudden alteration of the divisions first proposed to the distribution now before us was of an extraordinary character. The matter has been gone into more closely to-day, and some honorable members have stated that the Premier of Queensland and the Minister of Railways interviewed the Commissioner and brought pressure to bear which occasioned the change. We ought to know exactly what are the facts in this connexion. My own notion is that no one has a right to privately interview the Commissioner on the subject. He is in the position of a judge, and in order that he shall not make any mistake for want of information, there is a procedure prescribed by which he may be enlightened. The Act provides that - </para>

                <para class="block">That is a safe and proper mode of procedure, and no private " ear- wigging" of. the Commissioner, and no private proceedings which cannot be examined afterwards, should be permitted. If anything has to be represented to the Commissioner, it should be put in writing, so that in the ordinary course it might be regularly 'placed before the House. ' I strongly object to anything in the shape of swaying a judge - and the Commissioner is in the position of a judge - who holds, to some extent, the future political existence of honorable members in his hands. The mode in which information can be brought under his notice is prescribed in the Act, and nothing else should be permitted. If there has been any attempt of the character referred to by a member of this Parliament, or of any other Parliament, the fact ought to be known, and I ask the Minister straight, in the interests of right, whether he knows of anything which warrants the suggestion that there has been any conduct of the kind attributed to the gentlemen named </para>

                        <para>- A positive statement has been made by some honorable members, and all I am asking is that we may have the benefit of any facts with which the Minister is acquainted, so that we may judge what foundation there is for the statement. I would go further and say that it seems to me that the sooner we have the Bill before us the better. I take it that it will be brought down in such a shape that we shall be able to do what we consider right and just under the circumstances. We shall not have to choose simply between adhering to the old electoral divisions and adopting the reports of the Commissioners, but shall be able to do justice as best we may. In view of the debates which have taken place, the Commissioners whose reports have been set aside , should have an opportunity of replying to the criticisms to which the reports have been subjected. We considered that they were trustworthy officers, and the presumption is in their favour. I am sure that we do not want to legislate in this matter except on the best and most correct lines, and those who are responsible for the proposals which have been rejected might at least be called upon for a further report, so that when we have the Bill before us, we may have the advantage" of their statements, and know what to do under the circumstances.

It is not a. question so much of what we should reject as of what we should provide for, and it should not be put to the House as a matter of adhering to the old state of affairs, which has been in existence for the last three years, as an alternative, to approving of the recommendations of the Commissioners. W e should have an opportunity of doing what we conceive to be best. It would be a mistake to ask us to decide between the distribution now proposed as distinguished from the old divisions when we have the distribution first proposed by the Commissioner.

                <para class="block">Then, why limit our discussion to the acceptance of the distribution last proposed?" Our proper course is to do all that we can to effect the best division possible. According to the Minister's own declaration, the best division is not chat which was' made three years ago. That it should be the best was inherently improbable. Let us pass, then, from the consideration of the question of its rejection. It is far more important for us to provide for that which we ought to accept. Let the Bill be introduced which will enable us to do what we ought, and that at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                <para>Mr. TUDOR. - At any rate, we have evidence that within forty-eight hours of issuing <inline font-style="italic">his</inline> original map the Commissioner withdrew it, and substituted a fresh map which defined entirely different boundaries. What right had he to do so? Personally, I should not care about trusting the Premier of Victoria and the ex-Minister for Railways to draw up an electoral map which would be acceptable to labour representatives. I do not know that the Queensland labour members would receive any more justice from the Premier of that State and the Minister for Railways than would labour candidates here it the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent.</inline> Seeing that the map originally submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall</inline> has been withdrawn, I maintain that some reasons should be assigned for his action. He should certainly be called upon to explain why he altered the electoral boundaries which he first recommended. I voted against the Government upon the motions submitted in reference to the New South Wales and Victorian divisions, and should do so again under similar circumstances. At the same time, I cannot support the scheme recommended by the Queensland Commissioner, in view of the fact that, within forty-eight hours after the publication of his original proposals, he withdrew them and substituted others, without assigning any reason for so doing. </para>

What we did, after providing that the States should be divided into electoral divisions, was to say that we would not immediately proceed to determine those divisions, but that we would, through the Ministry, appoint an officer to do intermediate investigating, collating, and mechanical work. In performing the duties vested in them by Parliament, the Electoral Commissioners were asked to take into consideration certain conditions, and their discretion was limited in certain ways. When their work was completed, the Ministry were bound to submit it to Parliament, and when Parliament resumed consideration of the matter, it must be called upon to say " yes " or " no " upon a distinct motion as to whether or not the divisions proposed shall become law. </para>

That the Minister, forsooth, must say that he does not agree with the proposed electorates, pigeon-hole them, and not bring them before Parliament at all. That is not the meaning of the Act. Its meaning is that the Minister should appoint his Commissioner, who is to be a public servant of the Commonwealth, and should receive from that officer for the information of Parliament the distribution recommended. It was the Minister's bounden duty to submit the Commissioner's report to Parliament, in order that the two Houses might judge of the desirableness or otherwise of adopting the proposed divisions. Not only has the Minister done nothing wrong, but he could not have swerved one iota from the course which he has pursued. Had he acted otherwise he would have been guilty of a gross breach of duty. In my judgment it was obligatory upon him to bring this motion before the House. Of course, he is at liberty to exercise his discretion as to the form of the motion. He must determine in his own mind whether it shall be a motion to approve or disapprove of the proposed divisions, but it is entirely within the power of the House to agree or disagree with him.

                        <para>- Certainly: When we are speaking of the Governor we do . not usually use the word " shall," but when we are referring to a Minister we are not so particular. From section. 13 onwards there are a series of provisions which deal with matters from the appointment of a Commissioner down to the submission of his report and map to Parliament. When the Commissioner has completed all his. work what is to happen? Sections 21 and 22 do not say that " when " both Houses of Parliament have passed a resolution the distribution shall come into force ; but that " if " both Houses of Parliament pass a resolution the distribution shall become operative. The matter is, therefore, perfectly conditional. The language is most emphatic. This distribution by the Commissioner is to have no force or validity unless the contingency mentioned in this Act occurs. " If " Parliament shall pass a; resolution approving of them - and only in that event - the divisions shall become law. There is sometimes great virtue in an " if," and the words of these two sections are very significant. It seems to me that sufficient attention has not been given by honorable members to the words of the sections as they stand. The first and, as it seems to me, the only thing which the Minister can do in this case is to move that the House disapprove or approve of these divisions. Upon what basis are we to approve or disapprove of them ? I must say that I am altogether opposed to investing the Commissioner with any sacrosanct character. He is not the person who is immediately concerned in this matter. The real object of our solicitude must be the people of Australia, and, in my opinion, this House would have been absolutely wrong if it had passed an Act to the effect suggested by the arguments of some of my honorable friends. What would have been the position if this House had joined with the other branch of the Legislature in saying, " We do not know who the Commissioner may be ; we do not know what his. tendencies may be ; but we will put it absolutely in the power of the Minister of the day to appoint any person he chooses, and whatever the Commissioner does shall be beyond appeal. However fallible he may be " - and even the best and youngest of us are fallible - " whatever mistakes he may make, whatever erroneous information may reach him, his determination shall be final and beyond appeal." For whose benefit would such a course have been taken ? I think we must not consider the Commissioner so much as the whole of the people of Australia. It is for, the purpose of preserving our duty to the people of Australia that we have reserved to ourselves the power to approve or disapprove of any distribution. In disapproving of a scheme, Parliament is not to be put in the " tight corner," if I may use a colloquial expression, of being bound to give particular reasons, based on evidence that would be necessary to convict, a man of fraud, for its action. I utterly repudiate such a suggestion. We have to form our opinion honestly and as best we can upon such evidence as we can obtain (mentally and morally, and to say whether, in our opinion, this distribution ought to be approved of or not. I am unable to understand the argument that although we cannot search the mind of the Commissioner we are to swallow everything he does unless we can bring evidence that would be sufficient to convict him in a court of justice of doing something morally or monstrously wrong. I cannot think that that is our duty. We have not to look to political considerations. We must not regard our own interests. We must not regard the interests of any policy, fiscal or otherwise. But it does seem to me that if, 11 DOn material such as the Minister brings before us, or that we may gather from our - fellow members we arrive at the conclusion that the distribution would be wrong, it is our bounden duty, irrespective of any feeling in regard to the Commissioner, and, while thinking that he has honestly endeavoured to do his duty, to say that we disapprove of it and that it shall not be law. </para>

                    <para>- May I suggest that the honorable and learned member for Indi has been chasing a shadow? No one has ever set up 'the contention that we must perforce accept the dictum of the Commissioner. No one has put forward an absurd proposition of that kind ; nor has </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Any one said that we should surrender ourselves politically body and soul into the hands of the Commissioner. All that is contended is that it is wise and prudent for the House to accept the verdict of the Commissioner, unless it can show good reasons for the adoption of an opposite course. That is the only suggestion that has been indicated throughout the debate, and it is the position which the right honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> sets up. He says that we are bound under the Electoral Act to do certain things, and that, in his opinion, it would be better for honorable members to keep away from the Commissioner.  He never suggested, as the honorable and learned member appears to think he did, that it would be improper or illegal for any honorable member to go near the Commissioner.  His  sole argument was that in his opinion it would be better for us ' to keep away from the officer, and that is our contention. While the honorable and learned member for Indi has been chasing these legal subtleties, he has not given a single reason why we should vote against the determination of the Commissioner for Queensland ; nor have I heard any given during the whole debate, save one, which reflects most seriously upon the integrity and ability of that officer. The honorable member for Herbert charged the Commissioner with having been manipulated by certain people in Queensland, and the Minister for Trade and Customs, in substantiating that statement  in an interjection, said that it would have been better if certain persons had kept away from him. That is the way in which  the Minister  puts the position, clearly leaving it to be inferred that the Commissioner has been led by  the interference  of Queensland Ministers to do something which  he otherwise would not have done  That is practically an allegation of a corrupt action on the part of the Commissioner. It is a serious statement to make, - especially when we remember that the man against whom it is levelled is not here to reply for himself. Surely the least that we can do is to probe these allegations to the bottom and to see whether there is a substantial basis for them. We owe it to the Commissioner to clear the suspicion sought to be woven about him in this Chamber. We obtain the services of a State officer to do this work, and then we turn round and accuse him of having been corruptly manipulated by the Ministry he has served in the State. If the Minister for Trade and Customs knew that the Commissioner had been improperly influenced by Queensland Ministers it was his bounden duty not to submit this scheme to the House. On making the discovery, he should have instantly discharged him and appointed another man in his place. It is an insult to the House to bring down for our consideration a report which the Minister suggests has been obtained by unfair means. The Minister should have sent this officer about his business the moment he discovered that any improper influence had been brought to bear upon him. </para>

                        <para>- In reply to a statement made by the honorable member for Herbert, the Minister said that it would have been better if certain persons had kept away from him. The honorable member for Herbert goes further, and asserts that the Commissioner was influenced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Philp</inline> and other members of the Queensland Ministry, with the result that the proposed divisions were suddenly altered. That is a very serious statement to make, and the Minister is under an obligation from every point of honour, and every consideration of fair play, either to clear this officer's character, or to justify all that has been said about him. Until that is done the House should be prepared to accept the Commissioner's report. All that honorable members who have made a charge against that officer have done to support it is to mention the coincidence that the Premier and the Commissioner of Railways in Queensland went to see him, and that within forty-eight hours afterwards he altered his proposed distribution. Such a statement is not sufficient to destroy a man's character, and would not be accepted as proof in any court of law. If substantial grounds can be given for the accusation which has been made against the Commissioner, every honorable member will vote against the acceptance of his proposals j but do not let us cloud with suspicion the reputation of a man who is not here to defend himself. The Minister should, in fairness, either see that the statements made against the Commissioner are substantiated, or disprove them. What reason has the honorable gentleman advanced for the rejection of the proposed distribution <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The only reason advanced is that it was altered within forty-eight hours. </para>

                        <para>- No reasons were given last night. The honorable member for Herbert has expressed surprise that the motion has not been agreed to without debate. Have we come to this, that when we have appointed Commissioners to do certain work, and their proposals have been formally submitted to us, we are ready to veto them without consideration <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> We have certainly the right to do so. Parliament is supreme, as the honorable and learned member for Indi is always telling us. But did we intend to play a farce when we passed the Act <inline font-style="italic">'I</inline> Did we think that Parliament would be asked to disapprove of proposed distributions without being given the slightest reason for doingso <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I think that the intention of honorable members in passing the Act was to provide for a new distribution in each State prior to the holding of the next Federal elections. Now that these distributions have been made, however, we are asked to disapprove of them, and the only reason alleged by the honorable and learned member for Indi for taking such action is that we have power to do so. I was surprised at such a statement. Of course we have the power, but what .we have to consider is the wisdom of such a course. There have been strange proceedings while these motions have been under consideration. Members have voted in a certain way one day and have voted in an opposite way next day, without giving any reason for the change. Honorable members voted for the proposed South Australian distribution, in regard to which the provisions of the Electoral Act were rigidly adhered to. </para>

                        <para>- I do so only incidentally, to show how the treatment accorded to the proposals of the Commissioner for South Australia differed from that which has been given to the proposals of the Commissioners for other States. I ask the reason for that change. Surely if there is any State in which consideration should be given to the country divisions, it is the sparsely-populated State of South Australia. In that State, however, the provisions of the Act have been rigidly adhered to. The electorate of Flinders, for the representation of which I understand the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> .will be a candidate next year, is larger than the State of New South Wales. But, notwithstanding its large area, the Commissioner has given it as many as if not more electors than he has given to some of the Adelaide constituencies. Yet honorable members approved of that distribution. What reason had they for adopting it, and objecting to the proposed distributions of the States of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, where the population is closer, and the difficulty of travelling less <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Certain principles are laid down in the Constitution and in the Electoral Act, but while honorable members were ready to apply them to the conditions of the sparsely populated State of South Australia, they were not ready to apply them to the populous and compact State of Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- I have finished what I intended to say on that head ; but I think I was entitled to refer to the contrast. If certain principles should be applied to South Australia they should also be applied to Queensland. I hope that honorable members will seriously consider the matter before they vote for the rejection of the Commissioner's recommendation, since in doing so they will be departing strangely from the principles laid down in -connexion with the South Australian distribution. </para>

                    <para>- I have not hitherto taken any part in the discussions upon the proposed distributions of the States of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, because I thought it better to leave them to the representatives of those States. We have now, however, a new position before us. Serious charges have been made against the Queensland Commissioner and certain influential persons in that State. No honorable member has a right to make such charges unless he is prepared to prove them, and I think that we should adjourn the discussion on this motion until the charges made have either been proved or disproved. I therefore ask the Minister to consent to an adjournment until the Commissioner has had an opportunity to answer the allegations which have been brought against him. It would be scandalous if, before the Commissioner has had an- opportunity to answer the charge, we passed the motion and rejected the proposed distribution, chiefly on the ground that there has been some hanky-panky work in connexion with it. Surely honorable members will not practically brand the Commissioner as dishonest until he has had an opportunity to explain his position '? If the statements made by some of the Queensland representatives are true, and the Commissioner has been so weak as to yield to the temptation alleged, the House will be unanimous in rejecting his distribution. But we should not deal with it merely on hearsay evidence, and thus injure an officer's reputation without giving him an opportunity to clear himself. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned member's speech was a fine piece of special pleading, and he took a severely technical view of the whole position. Our indictment of the Government is that they are departing from the spirit of the Electoral Act. They may be saved upon the' letter of some miserable clause ; but if they are to be saved in that way, let us exactly understand the position. So far as the spirit of the electoral law is concerned, everyone must admit that the idea running right through the Act is that we must leave the work of distributing the electoral areas to impartial Commissioners, with no political ideas to sway them one way or- the other. I admit that Parliament has the reserve power to accept or reject the recommendations of the Commissioners, and I have never contended that we should give up our final right in that respect. But before the work of a Commissioner is rejected, it should be shown that upon high public grounds it is bad, and has been done in such a way as to imperil the principle laid down in the Act. Not one word has been uttered by the Minister in that direction, . </para>

                        <para>-The Minister has said a good deal by way of interjection. - He has practically indorsed the remarks of the honorable member for Herbert, who appealed to him to substantiate them. If the imputation cast upon the Commissioner by the honorable member for Herbert is unfair, the Minister should be the first to stand up and defend him. We shall have arrived at a pretty state of affairs when public officers cannot rely upon their Ministers to defend them. If the Minister sits quietly by and. allows this imputation to be made against an officer whom he. has appointed, does he not realize that he will become a party to the imputation? The honour of his officers ought to be as dear to him as the life of the Government itself. A serious charge is; levelled against a high public official by an honorable member, who appeals to the Minister to support him, and yet the Minister remains silent. </para>

                            has already ruled that I cannot refer to what was said during the previous debate, and, therefore, I shall not refer to what was stated yesterday. We are confronted with the report of the Commissioner for Queensland, who has acted according to law. He had instructions from the Minister to divide the State into electorates on the basis of proportional representation. He tells us that he has established a quota and divided the State on the basis of that quota, that he has used the margin allowed, and that he has exhibited his maps in accordance with law ; and, finally, he has submitted his report. Now we are called upon to say whether we approve or disapprove of the divisions made by him. It has not been suggested that the distribution has not been made upon the principle of proportional representation.

                        <para>- The honorable and learned member showed that there had been departures to some extent from these principles ; but it must be recognised that the boundaries of existing electorates cannot be preserved if effect is to be given to the principle of proportional representation. All that is required is that the Commissioner should give due consideration to the matters I have mentioned so far as may be consistent with securing proportional representation. He can only depart from the quota by one-fifth over or under. He cannot preserve existing boundaries absolutely. There must be a variation of boundaries from time to time if the population basis as laid down by the Act is to be adhered to. In Queensland there are at present the same anomalies as to population that have been pointed out in New South Wales and Victoria. If the existing boundaries are preserved, the electorate of Brisbane will have 33,000 voters, which honorable members will notice is nearly 50 per cent. in advance of the quota., whereas the electorate of Maranoa would have only 16,000 electors. Is it fair that . because a man lives in Brisbane he shall vote only as' one of 33,000, whilst an elector in Maranoa is permitted to vote as one of 16,000. In the proposed division of Maranoa there are 26,607 electors. The number within the present boundaries of that electorate is 16,4S4, whereas in the division of Brisbane under the existing boundaries there are 33,057 voters. This brings us back to the old trouble which was brought forward so prominently in the case of the other States, namely, that an elector in the country possessed twice the voting power of an elector in the metropolitan district. Is that a state of things which was contemplated by the Electoral Act? Does it fit in with the principle of proportional representation which is embodied in the Constitution? </para>

                        <para>- I shall not ask the honorable and learned member, because he would probably evade giving a direct answer by means of some technicality. No doubt he would point out that honorable members are labouring under a misconception as to the strict legal meaning of the provisions of the Electoral Act. The fact, however, is patent that in the district of Brisbane 33,000 electors are required to return a representative to this House, whilst in the district of Maranoa only 16,484 are necessary. Had the boot been upon the other foot, doubtless we should have seen the burly representative of Maranoa storming, upon the floor of this House upon the violation of the rights of his constituents. </para>

                        <para>- Bat under Federation we were to inhale a " rarer " atmosphere. Certainly, I was under the impression that any attempt to " fix up " electorates would be regarded by this Parliament with contempt and scorn. But, after what was done in the case of the New South Wales electorates last night, I shall not be astonished at anything which this Chamber may do. When a grave injustice can be perpetrated upon the electors of any one State I have very little hope. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know. A principle is laid down in the Electoral Act for the guidance of the Commissioner, and that principle, should be respected by Parliament. Last night I admitted that Parliament is omnipotent in these matters. It has a reserve power which enables it to set aside the Commissioner's report. It has power to be unjust if it chooses. It has the power to pass laws which press unduly on different sections of the people. But are we, the members of the first Commonwealth Parliament, prepared to justify before the people of Australia unequal divisions, such as those which will be established if we reject the Commissioner's report ? </para>

We have no desire to alter the existing boundaries merely for the purpose of creating chaos. Our desire is that those boundaries shall be altered, only when the adoption of that course is necessary to give effect to the main principle of the Act, which is proportional representation. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw that expression, and say that when we come to deal, with the matter purely as one of principle, the House recognises that the principle of proportional representation lies at the foundation of our electoral law. But when we deal with this question complicated by existing boundaries and by the interest which each honorable member has in preserving those boundaries, at once there is a combination to prevent any alteration whatever being effected. That is simply the attitude taken up by honorable members who are in opposition to the Commissioner's scheme. They do not at present desire any disturbance of the existing electoral boundaries, but when the elections are over, they will return to their former loyalty to the principle of one man one vote, and one vote one value. At present we are merely beating the air. At the same time, I suppose a certain amount of satisfaction is to be derived from protesting against what we consider to be unjust. I ask the Minister to consider the reasonable request preferred by the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton.</inline> It has been said that improper influence was brought to bear upon the Queensland Commissioner in the preparation of the map which he submitted. </para>

                        <para>- It has been stated that the Commissioner decided upon a plan of distribution which was published in the press and immediately withdrawn. If that plan were based upon the principle of proportional representation, and if it were more in harmony with the opinions of this House and therefore more likely to meet with acceptance at the hands of honorable members, surely it might be brought forward. The Commissioner might very easily substitute his original proposals for his later ones. </para>

If the officer is acquainted with the objections which have been urged in Parliament against his scheme, and has formulated another plan of distribution, based upon the principle of proportional representation - a plan which he knows will be more likely to meet with the support of honorable members - could he not submit it to the Minister ? </para>

                        <para>- I have a right to speak upon the basis of the report. It is admitted that these active political organizations exist in Queensland, that the plan of distribution was exhibited for thirty days, and that not one of them lodged an objection against it in the form prescribed by law. I am entitled, therefore, to argue that they entertained no objection to it. That is a perfectly fair inference to draw from the facts. If that be so, why should the House discard the Commissioner's recommendations ? It is true that the honorable member for Herbert lodged an objection, and that the Commissioner dealt with it. He could not have adopted the alternative proposal submitted by the honorable member for Herbert without going beyond the minimum allowed by law. The Commissioner could not oblige the honorable member, and at the same time observe the law. In the letter addressed by him to the honorable member for Herbert, he clearly pointed out that it was impossible for him to accede to his request without bringing himself into conflict with the law. The only objections submitted to the scheme have been answered by the Commissioner, and yet </para>

                <para>Mr.F. E. McLEAN.- I think not. I see nothing in the report in reference to that matter ; but there is abundant opportunity to prove whether or not any improper influence has been brought to bear upon the Commissioner. If it could be shown that improper pressure was brought to bear upon him with a view to obtain an alteration of the original distribution, that would be sufficient cause for a searching investigation into this matter. </para>

If there is one atom of truth in the statements which have been made against this officer, and which have almost been approved by the Minister, it is certainly right that, pending a searching investigation, we should stay our hand. The Minister has not positively admitted that there is any truth in the charges, but he has practically allowed that there must be some ground for them. In these circumstances, surely the Commissioner should have a right to disprove allegations which, in themselves, are sufficient to damn any man in the public service of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know, but I am endeavouring to get at the root of the matter. I presume that honorable members representing Queensland constituencies in this House recommended his appointment, but some of them are now not only dissatisfied with his work, but are attributing to him a very serious offence. They assert that he was led by the influence brought to bear upon him by members of the State Parliament, including the Premier, to alter his original scheme of distribution. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister was a party to the appointment, and he should give <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall</inline> an opportunity to prove or disprove this charge. I do not profess to be sufficiently familiar with the geographical features of Queensland and its population statistics to enable me to form a judgment as to whether this distribution is right or wrong ; but I support the request made by the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton.</inline> A man charged with the gravest crime in the calendar is by British law not considered guilty until he has been proved so. Surely an officer appointed by the Cabinet at the instance of Parliament, and on the recommendation of members either of this House or of the State Parliament of Queensland, to perform certain responsible duties, should be given an opportunity to answer charges brought against him before we, by agreeing to the motion, practically affirm our belief in the truth of them ? I do not think any representative of Queensland will deny the fairness of the request for an adjournment. I have no desire to delay the consideration of this question, but I hope that in justice to the Commissioner some honorable member will move the adjournment of the debate. </para>

If we could amend it, and in such a way that finally both Blouses could come to an agreement, there might be some reason for doing so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston.</inline> - Surely we can object to the report ? </para>

                        We cannot either accept it or reject it. It would destroy the whole system of the Commissioners if we could amend a portion of the report. We must deal with it as a whole. The whole principle of the Bill, so far as this part of it is concerned, is that the Commissioners have the responsibility of making the distribution. If the Houses approve of the distribution it becomes effective ; but if the Houses do not approve of it - the}7 have only power to approve or disapprove - it must go back to the Commissioners for amendment.

I say that it does not.. When the House disapproves of a proposed distribution, it is- the clear duty of the Government to send it back to the Commissioner for a fresh report. That must be done under the Act. If, when the Bill, was before the Senate, the question had been raised, the members of that body would no doubt have made it clear that the matter was not to be left to the sweet will of the Minister. The Act does not allow us to amend a Commissioner's report. </para>

The members of this Parliament were returned to support the principle of one man one vote, one vote one value, and I therefore did not expect to see them take action which will have the effect of disfranchising hundreds of thousands of voters.

If I thought it could be proved that the Commissioner was guilty, I, like the honorable and learned member, would not support his recommendation. I cannot always compliment- the Government upon the appointments they make, but I believe that in regard to the Commissioners they have endeavored to select the ' most competent men. I know the Commissioner for New South Wales to be an honorable, straightforward, and able man. I do not know anything about the Queensland Commissioner, but, judging from his report, he has shown great industry in the discharge of his duties, and has furnished valuable information. Still, I should feel inclined to reject his distribution if I felt that there was the slightest ground for the charge made against him. Honorable members do not like charges of corruption to be made against them, and they should be careful before allowing similar accusations to lie against high public officials. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister does not hesitate to go that length when it suits his purpose, but he has entirely failed to give any reasonable reply to the questions submitted to him upon this occasion. With regard to the electoral divisions of Queensland, I find that in three of the existing electorates there are 56,000 electors, whereas in three other electorates there are 89,000 electors,, or a difference of 33,000. That surely presents a very serious state of affairs, and one which cannot be approved of by those who advocate one vote one value. </para>

                        <para>- I am endeavouring to show that the Constitution embodies the principle of one vote one value, and that the Government are now seeking to rob the electors of their right. The principle is fully applied in the case of the elections for the Senate, and it is within our power under the Constitution to extend it to the exercise of the franchise in connexion with the elections for this House. It might be urged against us by honorable members in another Chamber that the principle of one vote one value had not been applied in our case. </para>

                    <para>- It is not necessary to malign the character of the Queensland Electoral Commissioner to justify the proposal of the Minister for Trade and Customs. As I intimated just now, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall</inline> in his first scheme - which, by the way, was published iri the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Courier,.</inline> long before it was available to honorable members - declared that, in dealing with the peculiar circumstances of Queensland, he was circumscribed in his action by the margin which this Parliament had allowed in the Electoral Act. He alleges that if he had been permitted a margin of one-fourth instead of one-fifth, he would have been able to effect a much better division. Thus the officer whom the honorable member for Macquarie is so anxious to defend,. desired to do the very thing against which he argued. Moreover, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall</inline> is an ex-Surveyor-General of Queensland, who knows what he is talking about. He was particularly desirous of giving a larger measure of representation to the country districts than to the metropolitan divisions. Such a proposal is entirely' in opposition to the whole trend of the discussion upon this motion. Concerning the arguments which have been used in support of the principle of one vote one value, I merely desire to say that they are very good in their way. But with the exception of the right honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> not a single honorable member has contended that the principle . should be adhered to under all . conceivable circumstances. We have provided in our Electoral Act that it may be departed from to the extent of 40 per cent. I believe in that principle as much as does any one, although it is not incorporated in the platform of the Queensland Labour party. I admit that it is a good principle, but a*; the same time, we ought not to take extreme views upon this matter. There is one aspect of the question as regards Queensland which should be carefully kept in view. It is very evident that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall</inline> possesses a mind which is so evenly adjusted that it is susceptible to representations by any party. That is patent from the fact that in his first report he set out in the most precise way the reasons which influenced him in arriving at the divisions which he recommended. In his second report, however, he controverts some of the arguments which he had previously used. Therefore, I hold that it is not necessary to prove that undue influence was brought to bear in order to warrant us in rejecting his recommendations. There is still another aspect of this matter, which I think should be put by a Queensland representative ; and, perhaps, I can put it with more grace, because the district of Wide Bay, which I represent, would not be affected under either of the schemes recommended by the Commissioner. </para>

                        <para>- The electorate of Wide Bay would not be disturbed under either of the divisions recommended, so that I cannot be accused of having any personal interest in this matter. It is only fair, however, that I should state- in the plainest possible terms that Queensland stands alone in one particular respect. The. State Government there have avowedly set themselves the task of defeating the Labour party at the next Federal elections. Immediately the first divisions recommended by the Commissioner were published in the Queensland press, the State Premier, according to a wire which was despatched here, denounced them, and declared that he was preparing a map of his own, which would set out a better distribution. I do not deny his right to do anything that he has power to do. Knowing him and his political associates, I am convinced that they will not fight shy of us for want of weapons with which to achieve their purpose. Whilst I am dealing with this phase of the question, it might be as well if I quoted some evidence which ' comes from Western Australia. One of the representatives of Queensland in the Senate also holds a seat in the Legislative Council of that State at the present time. I refer to Senator Ferguson, who, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Perth Morning Herald</inline> of the 11th August, was interviewed in Fremantle when on his way to London. The paper in question states - </para>

                    <para>Among the passengers for London in the- R.M.S. <inline font-style="italic">Orontes,</inline> who passed through Fremantle yesterday, was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferguson,</inline> of Queensland, who was accompanied by his wife and family. Owing to it being his intention to make a protracted stay in Britain, he will not stand for reelection to the Senate. In ' conversation with a <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> reporter on board the steamer he stated that he considered that the death knell of the- labour régime had been sounded in Queensland, and that the people were heartily tired of labour representation. At the next Federal election there would be a clear-cut issue between the Queensland Government and the Labour party in regard to the Senate seats, and he did not think'that one labour man would be returned. Each party would have three nominees, and the members of each were pledged to support the chosen candidates. He thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> Glassey, undoubtedly the greatest democrat in the State, would not be reelected, as he had not been chosen by either party, and if either supported him it would be endangering the position of its direct nominees. The Government and their supporters were raising £.10,000 to fight the socialistic or Labour party, and at the time of his departure they had already collected £4,000. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member ought to be careful in putting such questions to me. I was not referring to any pressure being brought to bear on the Commissioner. I said at the outset of my speech that that question did not arise. I shall not discuss the question of whether or not undue influence has been brought to bear on . the Commissioner, and I should be very sorry to hear that it had. I venture to say that every Commissioner is more or less influenced, and I differ from the right honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> who appears to think that we are not competent to deal with the ' redistribution of seats. In my opinion, we are quite competent to do so, and any body of members constituting this House that was incapable of dealing with them would be unfit to represent the people. The final deci sion in the matter of the distribution should rest with the House, and I regret that we have not the power to revise these schemes. The suggestion has been made that the original distribution made by the Commissioner should be adopted. But, unfortunately, it is not before us, and I understand that it would be impossible to have it brought before the House. </para>

                        <para>- The electorate of Maranoa is almost as large as the State of New South Wales, and yet we have honorable members complaining of the anomaly of a proposal that 1 7,000 electors residing in that vast constituency should have as much voting power as is exercised by perhaps nearly twice the number living in another part of the State. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall</inline> would have preferred to have that large margin to work upon when dealing with such a division. It would have enabled him to arrive at a decision more in accordance with the Act under which he was working. But he had to keep within the powers granted to him, and he experienced the greatest difficulty in doing what he considered would be just. The papers relating to the first distribution should have been made the property of the Commonwealth. If that had. been done honorable members would have had an opportunity to inspect them. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall</inline> did not absolutely complete his original scheme ; but he published it broadcast. </para>

I enter my serious protest against the adoption of such a course. The Minister had certain information in his office, but honorable members had to wait until the Brisbane newspapers arrived in Melbourne some days later before they could obtain the details of the scheme. That is riot a desirable situation for honorable members to occupy in relation to an important question like this. </para>

                        <para>- All the parties did their best according to their lights, but that fact did not relieve us from the embarrassing difficulties which arose. The publication of the scheme in the Brisbane press prior to any information being obtainable in relation to it in Melbourne gave the State Government a lead of three days over honorable members of this House. The State Government always appear to have an advantage over us. I was a member of the State Parliament in which the electoral divisions upon which we were elected to this House were first discussed and carried. The State-Government came down with a proposal that one division - the electorate of Maranoa - should comprise a little over 5,000 voters, as against 15,000 voters in the electorate of Wide Bay. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. I have always held that Parliament is the body to arrive at a proper distribution, and that view is. supported by the action of the State Parliament on the occasion to which I refer. Notwithstanding that the Government had. a large majority, the views put forward in opposition to their proposal appealed with such force to Ministerial supporters, that the divisions were varied, and were made more or less reasonable before being passed into law. </para>

                        <para>- The good sense of the House allowed it to make a reasonable distribution. In view of this fact I regret that in this matter we have not the power of revision as well as of rejection. I do not think it wise or necessary for an honorable member to make sweeping assertions; or to lose his temper in dealing with this question. So far as the general principle is concerned I certainly favour one vote one value, but having regard to the special circumstances, I am in entire agreement with the proposition submitted by the Minister for Trade and Customs. It is, undoubtedly, a fact that the population of the remote districts of Queensland has been more or less reduced by reason of. the drought. As one of the newspapers published in this city remarks to-day, nature has struck them heavily, and why should Parliament also strike them. A large population has moved from the country citywards. What better proof could we have of that than the fact that the old division of Brisbane North, which, formerly had a fewer number of voters than had the electorate of Wide Bay, has to-day ii number enormously in excess of the voters to be found in it? The people, especially the wives of settlers - and good settlers too - have undoubtedly migrated to Brisbane. When the police collections were made, the state of affairs was not in anything like a normal condition. Much as I like the principle of one vote one value, I have a still greater regard for the proposition that we should endeavour to induce the people to settle in the back portions of Australia, and particularly in the State' of Queensland. There has been far too much centralization, and any little encouragement of a political character towards the settlement of the land shall not be wanting so far as I am concerned, even if it violates the great principle of one . vote one value. There must of course be some limit, but had this House fixed the margin at 50 instead of 40 per cent., that would cover the whole difference between the distribution made by the Commissioner and the old divisions. I regret that so much time has been occupied in dealing with the question, and that so much acrimony has been imported into the debate ; but I believe that some good result will follow from the discussion, and that, in any event, we shall all admit the good faith of those who take a certain course of action in regard to the matter. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member for Wide Bay is to be congratulated upon the calm judicial way in which he has dealt with this question. But some of the reasons advanced by him in support of the rejection of this scheme do not appeal to my mind, and I shall endeavour to refute them. The honorable member asserts that the electorate of Maranoa is practically equal in size to the State of New South Wales, and is therefore entitled to special consideration. If the enormous area of some of the Queensland electorates is to be considered, why did the honorable member fail to. have regard to the extent, of some of the divisions of South Australia when the distribution of that State was before us ? The South Australian electorate of Grey, for example, covers an area larger than Queensland itself. If it is right that special consideration should be given to people living in such extensive divisions, why did not the honorable member for Wide Bay, together with the supporters of the Government, fight for tha interests of that electorate? We have had several propositions put before us. The scheme of distribution for South Australia has been accepted, but we have rejected the Victorian and New South Wales distributions, and it appears that a similar course is to be followed in regard to Queensland. Each. Commissioner, as his report has come before us, has been spoken of as the most able man who could be obtained for the work. Honorable members have praised the Queensland Commissioner, who was the Surveyor-General of the State, as they have praised the other Commissioners ; but in every case, with the exception of South Australia, they have disapproved of the proposed distribution. It is a remarkable thing that it was possible to observe the principle of one vote one value in South Australia with almost mathematical precision, but that it is impossible to do so in the other States. In dealing with the New South Wales and Victorian distributions we have had what I may call . the " drought " argument and the " gum-tree " argument advanced in support of the proposals of the Government, and now we have the worst argument of all, the " got-at " argument ; honorable members imputing wrong-doing to the Queensland Commissioner in order to lead the House to disapprove of his proposed distribution. </para>

                        <para>- That objection, and the objection of the honorable member for Herbert are the only two which appear in the report. My political views, so far as they can be defined, are distinctly radical. I do not lend myself to any party in matters of this kind, and if the statement that the Government of Queensland interfered with the Commissioner in order to "down" the Labour party there appeared to me true, I would vote for the disapproval of the proposed distribution. But I want proof of its truth. Before we reject the proposal of the Queensland Commissioner, we should receive further information on the subject.

Unfortunately the House has hitherto, except in the case of South Australia, refused to recognise that principle. I am fighting this battle to-night, as I did last night, and last week, not on political grounds, but on the grounds of principle. In my opinion, honorable members are concerned not about the disturbance of boundaries but about the disturbance of representatives. It is of no use to disguise the fact. Ministers and members are fighting for their personal interests, and are neglecting the interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I am not doing so ; I am merely giving my opinions. If the principles I have named can be applied in South Australia, why cannot they be applied in the other States. All that the Minister has done in regard' to the proposed Queensland distribution is to throw the Commissioner's report on the table and move that it be disapproved of. He gave &gt;no reason why the House should take that action. To-day, however, the honorable member for Herbert has brought forward the " got at" argument, and he has been supported by the honorable member for Wide Bay, and others. We are now focussing the attention of Australia upon a struggle between Parliament and the people. The people are not interested in maintaining the existing boundaries of divisions. Bather than have a repetition of what has occurred during the past few days, I should like to see the people Vote in each State as one electorate in the choosing of representatives for this Chamber as well as for the Senate. If each State voted as one electorate, the votes of country electors would not count for more than the votes of city electors, and we should have a full recognition of the principle of one man one vote and one vote one value.' I think that the people - -when they understand the wrangling which has taken place here and the flimsy arguments which have been' adduced in support of the disapproval of distributions - will say that they would rather not have the States divided than have the question treated as it has been treated. At the present time we find that the city of Melbourne is being robbed of two representatives. </para>

                        <para>- Then, by all means let us have fresh distributions, but do not let us fall back on the old divisions. The difference between some of the present Queensland divisions is too great. Maranoa, for instance, contains 17,000 electors, while there are 30,000 in other electorates. It cannot be argued that there are particular interests in Maranoa, or Kennedy, or Capricornia which require particular representation in this Parliament. The matters with which we can deal under the Constitution are matters in which the people of Brisbane, and of the other cities of the Commonwealth, are as much concerned as are the people residing in the country constituencies. If the administration of the Lands or the Mines or other similar Departments had been referred to the Commonwealth, the position would be different. We are concerned with the people, not as electors in New South Wales or Queensland, or of any other State, but as electors of the Commonwealth. Whether a man be a fisherman on the Gulf of Carpentaria, a- goldminer at Kalgoorlie, or an iron worker in my constituency, he is entitled to fully exercise the rights conferred upon him by the Constitution, and I hope that we shall apply the principle of one vote one value to the fullest possible extent. The honorable member for Wide Bay has urged that the margin allowed for the Commissioner was not sufficient to enable him to make a just distribution. When the Electoral Bill was under discussion it was proposed by the leader" of the party to which the honorable member belongs to reduce the margin to one-eighth, and I cannot understand why the honorable member should now clamour for an extension to one-fourth. The object of allowing the margin was to enable the Commissioner to overcome certain difficulties with regard to the boundaries, and to deal in a practical rather than in a strictly scientific manner with the division of the State. The Commissioner for South Australia dealt satisfactorily with the distribution of that State, which is even more sparsely populated than Queensland, and I cannot understand why a margin of one-fifth should not have proved sufficient to enable satisfactory results to be achieved in Queensland. The Minister has been asked, to inform the House as to the basis of the charge made against the Commissioner. If he had reason, before the report was laid upon the table of this House, to believe that the Commissioner had acted improperly, he should not have presented his recommendation. A Bill will have to be brought in to give effect to the resolutions of the House with regard to the electoral divisions, and it will then be possible to adopt the original recommendations of the Commissioner in regard to Queensland instead of retaining . the present unsatisfactory divisions. The honorable member for Wide Bay said that it was right that it should be left to Parliament to deal with the distribution of the electorates, but I do not agree with him, because Commissioners, free from political influence, would not be likely to make such grave mistakes as would honorable members actuated by regard for their own interests. The Commissioners were chosen because they were practical and independent <inline font-style="italic">men,</inline> and their reports should not be set aside without the strongest reason. If it can be shown that the Commissioner* for Queensland has made a mistake his report should be referred back to him for reconsideration. </para>

                        <para>- I can quite con- . ceive that an officer intrusted with that work might make several divisions before arriving at one which was satisfactory to himself. Of course, if the Commissioner submitted a plan of distribution to some person other than the Minister, it is for the latter to say whether such action was in the interests of the community. At the same time it is incumbent upon any honorable member making such a covert charge against an officer to put it forward in the most definite and set terms possible so that the accused may be afforded an opportunity of replying. I have no sympathy with an officer who would go behind the back of his Minister and perform work to the satisfaction of State officials rather than of the Minister who engaged him on behalf of this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall</inline> says- </para>

                <para class="block">Settlement in Queensland is similar to that which has taken place in the other States, so that while it is impossible for the Commissioner to divide that State into electorates to the satisfaction of the representatives concerned, it is possible for him to cut it up to the- satisfaction of Parliament. I trust that when the good of the country is at stake we shall rise superior to personal interests. From the Commissioner's report, I conclude that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall</inline> has discharged his duty faithfully, and to my mind it is incumbent upon the Minister to advance reasons why the scheme recommended by him should not be accepted. It is not right upon a mere <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statement to conclude that undue influence has been brought to bear upon the Commissioner in the performance of his duty. Before arriving at such an opinion, the Minister should be satisfied from undeniable evidence that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall</inline> has been unfaithful to his trust. Should he be so satisfied, it seems to me that a very serious situation would arise, inasmuch as possibly the officer in question would have to be retired from his position. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I assume that a good division has been effected - certainly it constitutes a decided improvement upon the present division. Under the electoral boundaries, as they now exist, there are 33,057 electors in the district of Brisbane, and only 16,484 in that of Maranoa. In the southern part of that State, therefore, an elector has more than twice the voting power of an elector in Brisbane. Surely no one can seriously urge that such a distribution is just, seeing that under our own electoral law we prescribe a margin of only 5,000 above or 5,000 below the quota. I understand that the Minister intends to introduce a Bill for the purpose of legalizing the action which he has taken. That, however, will scarcely condone the offence which he wishes us to commit upon the eve of a general election, by effecting, in the interests of the sitting members, an alteration in the provisions of an Act which was deliberately ' passed when the representatives in this House desired to be faithful to their trust. It is a most improper course to pursue. I trust that the House will reject the proposal of the Minister and adhere to the scheme which has been recommended by the Commissioner. In one portion of his report, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall</inline> states that he received, some commendation from the Chief Electoral Officer for his preparation of that document, and for the promptness' with which it was forwarded to head-quarters. Under these circumstances, I trust that the Minister will adopt the course of returning these divisions to the Commissioner for revision, with instructions to prepare a fresh distribution for submission to Parliament in time to be of use in the impending general elections. </para>

                    <para>. - In the first place, I have been 'attacked by . some honorable members upon the ground that in submitting this resolution the course which I adopted was one which I ought not to have pursued. It has been urged that, instead of putting forward this proposal, J should have dealt with the matter by a Bill. It seems to me that the Act is very definite in regard to this point when it declares in section 22 that, after the maps and the reports have been submitted to the House - </para>

                <para>If either House of Parliament passes a resolution disapproving of any proposed distribution, or negatives a motion for the approval of any proposed distribution, the Minister may direct the Commissioner to propose a fresh distribution of the State into .divisions. </para>
                <para class="block">Section 21 also deals with the course which is to be followed if both Houses of Parliament pass a resolution approving of any proposed distribution. When the Government felt that these distributions were not in the best interests of the electors of town and country alike, it would have been cowardly for them to submit a motion for their approval with- the knowledge that it would probably be defeated. Honorable members will readily concede that a Minister adopts a much more manly attitude when, instead of resorting to a subterfuge, he submits a motion in accordance with the law, and takes a course which he and his colleagues believe to be a proper one. I have come into the open, and I have clearly stated my opinion in regard to this matter. </para>

                        <para>- I know that the honorable member's opinion would be different if he could only express it free from party bias. I contend that the course taken by us must commend itself to every disinterested and non-party man in the community. What object had we in view in submitting to the House the principle of one man one vote - a principle which was supported mainly by honorable members on the Government side <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The curse of plural voting had been felt in New South Wales, and probably in all the other States, and it was our desire that it should be abolished so far as the Commonwealth was concerned. Up to the present time we have had no definition of the principle of one man one vote, and one vote one value. That is something new. The cry has been rehearsed in the Opposition room, and it has been brought down for the purposes of theatrical display on the floor of this House. The chief object which we had in view in giving legislative effect to the principle of one man one vote was the destruction of plural voting, and that desire has been carried out as the result of the action of honorable members sitting on this side of the House rather than because of anything done by honorable members of the Opposition. In dealing with this matter, the first consideration is not whether the Commissioner has done anything wrong. The primary question is whether or not the distribution is a good one. </para>

                        <para>- It has been very strongly demonstrated. If the honorable member and others on that side of the House were allowed to have their way they would not permit the electors residing in the country districts, and who represent the great producing interests of the Commonwealth, to have a voice in the government of the country. Two honorable members have gone so far as to say, "Let us have no divisions. Let us poll the State as one electorate." What would follow the adoption of such a proposal ? Tt would mean that the large centres of population would absolutely control by ticket the whole of the members to be returned, and the producing interests of the country districts would thus be absolutely swamped. What is our aim in dividing a State into electorates? Is it not one of the objects sought to be achieved that the numerically weak,, but great producing, parts ' of, the country, shall have some voice in government? I am pleased that one or two honorable members of the Opposition have to-night let out the secret that they desire the State to be polled as one electorate, so that the cities will be able to control the country. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to import Tariff considerations into this discussion, but I may, perhaps, be permitted to say that I am in favour of anything which will help the producing interests of this community. I am strongly opposed to anything which would destroy our producing interests and, at the same time, injure the consumer. The so-called "destruction " to which the honorable mem- . ber refers is doing a great deal of good to Sydney, as well as to other parts of the Commonwealth. The suggestion has been made by one honorable member that in the Bill which will probably be submitted in connexion with this matter it would be wise to provide for <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> new arrangement of the boundaries. Any honorable member who has had as much experience as I have had during my period of public service, will know that it would be very difficult to attempt to alter certain boundaries without varying the whole of them. Indeed, I think that it would be scarcely possible to carry out such a proposal. I contend - and my view is indorsed not only by the Commissioner for 'Queensland, but by the Commissioner for New South Wales - that, if a margin of one-fourth instead of one-fifth had been allowed, it would have enabled the Commissioners to deal with the abnormal conditions which have prevailed in the country during the last two or three years. In the Bill, as introduced, I provided for a margin of one-fourth, and I said at the time that I had not made that provision without well weighing the condition of things which prevailed in Australia. I. felt that it was the lowest margin that, would meet the extreme circumstances in which the Commonwealth was placed by reason of the drought. </para>

                        <para>- The House decided against, me, and I had to accept its decision. The Act as it stands is. therefore the work of the Parliament. I also proposed that we should have three Commissioners instead of one for each State, and I hold that if these two proposals had been carried into law no trouble would have arisen. The House decided, however, that there should be only one Commissioner for each State, and I had to do the best that I could in the circumstances. The Act is not as perfect as I should wish it to be, nor as perfect as I believe it would have been if it had been carried into law as introduced by me. I do not think it is wise to refer the distribution of a State to one Commissioner. In my opinion the House should not delegate its powers to any one individual, and I feel satisfied that if my proposition had been adopted there would have been no occasion for the course which we now feel compelled to take. The honorable member for Parramatta has referred to the position of South Australia. I would point out, however, that. South Australia was not divided into electorates for the first Federal elections, and that it lends itself to subdivision on an equality of quota to a greater extent, perhaps, than does any other State. There is a vast area stretching away from the north of Adelaide, and there is the Northern Territory itself with only a fringe of population, but with that exception - and even those conditions present no serious difficulties - the State peculiarly lends itself to the purposes of an equal distribution. In . Tasmania as well as in South Australia, the distribution of population is small, but is more even than is that to be found in any of the other States. On the other hand we have in Victoria and New South Wales two great cities, representing half the population of each State, while the capital of Queensland has also drawn a great population from the centre of that State. Perhaps I am wrong in saying that it has attracted the people from the central districts, for the population has to a certain extent been driven to it by the exigencies of the State. Not only the women . and children, but the owners of property in the drought-stricken districts, as well as the labouring population, have been driven into more favoured localities. We hear a great deal about the unemployed in large centres of population. We hear of them here to a certain extent, and to a very considerable extent in New South Wales. What is the main reason for the existence of these large bodies of unemployed <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It is that ordinary sources of employment in many of the country districts have failed, and that men have been driven to the large centres of population. That is one of the great evils which have followed from the extreme drought from which we have suffered. The drought in New South Wales did not extend over a period of one or two years, but a period of five or six years. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. But it is only within the last two years that its effects have been felt in their most acute form in those two States. Honorable members opposite blame the Department for Home Affairs for failing to rush this thing and that thing through, and for neglecting to have everything up to time. But in the establishment of that new and great Department, and the creation of a highly important branch of it, greater activity has been shown and more punctuality has been observed than might reasonably have been expected. The officer who has been so much maligned and so maliciously attacked by certain honorable members of the Opposition deserves thanks and praise rather than abuse for his work. If it were necessary to refer these distributions back to the Commissioners, and if I had before me data that would satisfy me that it would be anything but a farce to adopt that course, I should be prepared to return them for reconsideration. I repeat the assertion that there would be ample time to return the distributions to the Commissioners, and as long as I could see that I should be able to submit the schemes in time to permit them to be returned and adopted before the next elections, I felt satisfied that I was properly discharging the duty intrusted to me. There has been no failure in any degree in dealing with this most exceptional matter. An attack has been made upon the Queensland Commissioner. I dislike very -much to have to make reference to matters of this kind at any time ; but I regret to say on this occasion that I have in my possession two documents which are of a most serious character. </para>

I refused to accept a verbal statement, and said that unless it was made in writing, and supported, I would take no notice of it. The names of two or three persons who could substantiate it were given. I sent to Brisbane to ascertain if they would substantiate it, and I have here a letter, signed by them, which practically substantiates it, though they decline to make any further statement unless called upon for an official report. Upon receiving that letter, I instructed my secretary to call upon them for an official report. That has been done. The report has not been received yet, but I was told an hour or two ago that a telegram had come saying that it is on its way.

I venture to hope that the charges and statements which have been made, and the baiting which has taken place in connexion with the matter, will now absolutely cease. If I had had the Commissioner's reply, I would have laid these documents upon the table, but I do not think that it is fair to make them public until he has had an opportunity to give his side of the question, and make his defence, if he has a defence to put forward. The charges are serious. </para>

                        <para>- The question for the House to consider is not whether the Commissioner has or has not done anything improper, or placed himself in an improper position, but whether the proposed distribution is a fair one. The reference which I made to this delicate question in introducing the motion was that I had received a scheme of distribution from the Commissioner for Queensland, and that when I was on the point of taking action upon it, I received by telegram a second ' distribution, which to me contained a surprising alteration. The first distribution was one which I believed would not have been objected to by any member of the House or by the electors. I did not know then what I know now. The occurrence, however, placed an obligation upon me to make an inquiry as to the cause of the sudden change. I have, in consequence of what has been stated here, been drawn into saying more than I desired to say. </para>

                        <para>- t shall be very glad to lay the papers upon the table when the Commissioner has made his reply. I wish now to say a word or two in reply to the statements of the honorable member for Oxley. I was very much hurt at the attack which he made upon me personally. I took his remarks as a reflection upon my personal character. There are some honorable members of whose statements I do not take much notice, because they repeat their accusations so often that they probably believe them to be true, although they are absolutely untrue. But when the honorable member for Oxley accuses me of having: been influenced by an unworthy motive in connexion with this matter, and of being guilty of greater partiality than any other honorable member, I hurl back the charge. </para>

                        <para>- Because I thought it was not a good one. If there was no- other reason, I have during the last few minutes given a very good reason, and it will be still further investigated before I have done with the matter. I did not expect to have personal accusations brought against me in connexion with this matter. Personally, it does not concern me one iota how the State of Queensland is divided. Probably the distribution proposed by the Commissioner would be as good for the Government as the present divisions. I was, however, intrusted with the administration of the Act, so that I might see that things were fairly and reasonably managed. That is what I have done. If the honorable member for Oxley harbors the suspicion that I have been influenced by ulterior motives in connexion with any of the three distributions of which I have asked the House to disapprove, he harbors a thought which is unworthy of him. I would not entertain such a suspicion in regard to him, and I feel that he has no right, whatever malign statements he may have- heard from honorable members opposite, to entertain such a suspicion in regard to me. </para>

                        <para>- I took the honorable member's words down. He said that I was acting from some unworthy motive. If that is not a personal attack, I do not know what is. I am no more capable of doing anything of the kind that he suggests than he is. My political character has been more tried than his has. Of course, if he says that he did not intend to make a personal attack upon me, I accept his explanation. But it seems to me that no other interpretion could be placed upon the words which he used. I am sorry that I have had to deal with these matters. I do not think that there is any further statement I need make with regard to the motion. To my mind, it is as clear as possible that the proposed distribution is not a good one, nor the best that could be made, and no harm will be done if we revert to the old divisions and allow the electors to vote at the coming elections in the divisions which were laid out by the State Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- What I said was that it would be more in the interest of the people to allow them to vote for the members of the House of Representative with the States as single electorates, than to continue a system under which, as it would appear from this debate, politicians are plotting out the electorates to suit themselves. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the Committee will not agree to the amendment. It may be remembered that when the Bill was introduced it was proposed to give to the High Court, in addition to the powers conferred by section 75 of the Constitution, all the optional powers mentioned in section 76, viz., to confer upon the High Court original jurisdiction upon matters arising under the Constitution, or involving its- interpretation, or arising under any laws made by the. Parliament, and upon matters of Admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction, or relating <inline font-style="italic">to&gt;</inline> the same subject matter claimed under the laws of the different States. Strong objection was taken to converting what was regarded in the beginning as an appellate tribunal into one with vast original jurisdiction, which would overlap the jurisdiction of the States Courts, and involve the&gt; creation of a large Judiciary and corresponding expense. This clause was considered before the number of Judges was fixed, because it was fully understood that if the original jurisdiction were cut down a comparatively small Judiciary would suffice. <inline font-style="italic">The</inline> Government evidently felt the force of that reasoning, because, at the suggestion of the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, one of the branches of original jurisdiction proposed to be conferred, namely, that relating to Admiralty and maritime matters, was immediately struck out. The proposal to confer original jurisdiction in the other matters mentioned was strongly opposed, and after a debate extending over two days the Attorney-General recognised that the Committee was strongly against him, and gave way, at the same time expressing the hope that perhaps the Committee might, at a later stage, see its way to concede a small measure of original jurisdiction.. That was done. Although clause 31 was, in the first instance, practically struck out, a slight concession was afterwards made to the Attorney-General by conferring upon the Court original jurisdiction in all matters involving any question as to the limits <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> of the constitutional powers of the States, and those of any State or States, or of any two or more States. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment is much wider than the provision for which it is proposed to substitute it. If the amendment is agreed to, the two paragraphs will disappear, because they will be included in the more general wording adopted. I- ask honorable members not to go back upon the emphatic direction given by the Committee to the Government, that there should be no enlargement of the original jurisdiction of the High Court beyond the two matters provided for in clause 31 as it left this Chamber. The Prime Minister indicated, when the clause was being recommitted, that perhaps the Government might seek in another place to enlarge the jurisdiction. Objection was at once taken to any action on the part of the Government to upset the emphatic decision of the Committee. But still that course was eventually adopted. If honorable members will refer to the debates they will find that the Vice-President of the Executive Council moved the amendment, which was accepted without any discussion by honorable members in another place, who do not appear to have been very attentive to what was going on. I think that honorable members will agree that practically the whole of the original jurisdiction that could be conferred upon the High Court would be embraced in the words which it is proposed to insert. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt up to the present the majority of the cases which have come before the courts have turned upon the construction of particular Acts of Parliament ; but at the same time I contend that if there were no provision other than that which it is now proposed to insert, regarding the original jurisdiction of the High Court, it would be sufficient to cover the cases which have been heard up to the present. Section 76, sub-section 2, of the Constitution refers to matters arising under any laws made by the Parliament, and that provision appears to me to have been inserted for greater caution rather than as being necessary, because matters arising under Acts of Parliament come within the comprehension of the words of sub-section 1, which deals with matters arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation. </para>

                        <para>- As the Constitution is worded I know that a distinction is drawn between the two classes of cases, but honorable members know that where doubt exists as to the exact connotation of words, or the express meaning of terms, an additional provision is often inserted to make everything secure. I regard sub-section 2 in that light, and as not being necessary to bring matters arising under the laws passed by Parliament within the jurisdiction conferred upon the High Court. Supposing, however, that I am wrong with regard to that, we are still being, asked to revise our well-considered judgment upon the mere initiative of the representative of the Government in the other Chamber ; and I object to that. There is no necessity to confer original jurisdiction in cases such as have been referred to. Supposing that the words, "arising under this Constitution, or involving its interpretation," are so limited as to apply only to the Constitution as an Act, the cases mentioned ought not to be decided in the first instance by the Federal Judges. They are matters of such great importance that, in regard to them, the Federal jurisdiction ought to be appellate only. The judgments given in cases involving the interpretation of the Constitution which come before a single Judge - that is, as a Court of first instance - are certain to be followed by appeals, because the magnitude of the issues involved will be too great for the decision of a single Justice to be regarded as conclusive. </para>

                        <para>- In section 75 of the Constitution we have made provision for conferring upon this tribunal greater powers of original jurisdiction when the increase of our population warrants us in adopting that course. Surely there is no necessity for the High Court to overlap the States Courts by conferring all this original jurisdiction upon it. Honorable members in another place desire us to partially cancel a well-considered decision. There is absolutely no necessity under the Constitution to confer - upon the High Court original jurisdiction in these matters. If that jurisdiction is withheld the Court will give judgment only in its appellate jurisdiction. As a matter of expediency and convenience this jurisdiction ought not to be immediately vested in the High Court. Should it be subsequently required, it is an easy matter to amend an Act of Parliament. I ask the Committee not to reverse our previous decision. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that the jurisdiction which the other Chamber proposes to confer upon the High Court is quite as full as that which the Attorney-General originally desired to vest in it. At the same time nobody can quite see the end of this provision. We all know that the natural tendency of Judges is to arrogate to themselves as much power as possible. I desire to prevent the clause from being drawn in such an elastic way. In the form in which it left this Chamber, its. meaning was perfectly clear, and no reason has been assigned, why a departure should be made from the decision of the Committee. Upon looking up <inline font-style="italic">Mansard</inline> I find that the debate upon this question extended over two days, and that the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, advanced strong reasons against any alteration of the character proposed by the other Chamber. It is true that he spoke upon the clause in the form in which it was then submitted, but he dealt specifically with the same objections that were advanced by the honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn.</inline> After a long discussion, the Committee unanimously determined to limit the jurisdiction. As the High Court Bench will consist of only three Justices I would point out that if a case involving the original jurisdiction of the Court is heard by one Justice and an appeal be made from his judgment, the other two Justices must constitute the Court of Appeal. Such a state of affairs would soon be urged as a reason for the appointment of an additional Justice. I did not object very strongly to the appointment of five Justices, but seeing that the Committee have determined that the High Court Bench shall .consist of only three, I protest against the creation of difficulties which must necessitate the appointment of a fourth. In my opinion the Committee will act wisely if it adheres to its original decision. If we confer this original jurisdiction upon the High Court its effect will be to deprive some of the Supreme Courts of the States of the jurisdiction which we have already extended to them under this measure. I learn by reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that no debate took place upon this proposal in the Senate, but that it was inserted merely because it was suggested by the Minister who is in charge of the Bill in this House. </para>

                    <para>. - As allusion has been made to the debate which occurred in another place, I may be permitted to say that notice of this amendment, which was inserted at the instance of my honorable and learned colleague, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, had been given by more than one member of the Senate. My colleague simply moved it in order to avoid delay. The question of jurisdiction had been discussed at some length upon the second reading of the Bill, and the Senate was so unanimous in desiring to enlarge the original jurisdiction of the Court that the difficulty which my colleague experienced was not in making amendments in the Bill, but in inducing the Senate to make as few as possible. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and others held that this amendment represented so small an extension of the constitutional powers conferred upon the Court that they doubted whether it was worth while making the addition. Nevertheless, they all approved of it as an addition, and the bulk of them were prepared to go further. </para>

                        <para>- This amendment does not involve an extension of the exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court. It merely lessens the exclusive jurisdiction which the States. Courts would possess in these matters. The margin between the form in which the clause is now submitted, and that in which this Committee agreed to it, is relatively small, and represents only a difference in optional jurisdiction. Thus the parties who prefer to' go to the States Courts will still have those tribunals open to them, whilst those who prefer the High Court will be able to come before it. I think that the honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> will find that the distinction between the area which this clause covers and that which is covered by sub-section 2 of section 76 of the Constitution is much more definitely drawn than he apprehends. Under no circumstances could it be held that the second sub-section is included in the first. In Quick and Garran's work, <inline font-style="italic">The Annotated Constitution of the Commonwealth,</inline> page 790, a quotation is made from Storey's Commentary, in which Storey points out that - </para>

                        <para>- They are analogous in this respect, that with us a distinction is drawn in our Constitution between matters arising under the laws made by this Parliament and matters arising under the Constitution. In the absence of that specific provision a similar distinction has been made in the United States in the clearest possible manner. If that distinction were made in the United States, in the absence of express enactments to that effect, how much more clearly will it be drawn when it is set out upon the face of our Constitution! Under the circumstances, honorable members will see that this is merely an optional jurisdiction. It is <inline font-style="italic">only</inline> opening a door through which no one will enter except those who desire to do so. </para>

                        <para>- We took away all power of removal as of right, and strictly safeguarded the power of removal left. Under that provision the Court may, for special cause shown, order a removal. If there be any classes of cases to which the Federal Court ought not to have a closed but an open door, it is surely those arising under the Federal Constitution, and involving its interpretation. No attempt has been made to give it exclusive power to deal with . them. It is sought only to enable the Court to deal with what, perhaps, is the most distinctively Federal class of cases which could be conceived. This is a plea for the open door rather than the closed door, the door having already been partially opened by the liberalty of this House. Surely the views so strongly expressed by the Senate are entitled to consideration. The concession is so small that I feel satisfied that the Committee will not be hard-hearted enough to refuse to grant to this Court merely the first of the four measures of optional jurisdiction which the Constitution allows to be conferred upon it. </para>

                        <para>- We omitted the four paragraphs after a discussion extending over three or four days, and the Attorney General was so convinced that the feeling of the Committee was against him that he did not divide it. The chief factor which induced the Committee to arrive at this decision was that the Supreme Courts vested with Federal jurisdiction were competent to deal with all matters likely to arise under these particular paragraphs as well as any other case that might occur. It was considered that by restricting the jurisdiction of the High Court, the necessity for an increased number of Judges would be obviated. Have we since obtained any additional evidence to show that there is an actual necessity for the extension of the original jurisdiction of the Court in this way ? </para>

                        <para>- I do, and I am going to state it. The effect of this amendment will be that a litigant in Queensland, for example, who has the choice according to the time of the sitting of the Court and so forth, will take the advice of his legal adviser, and adopt that course which it will be more convenient and more economical for him to follow. If his case involves a number of findings of fact as well as questions of law, counsel will probably say, "Let us go to the State Court and get the law and the facts decided. We can then go to the High Court." If the facts are not in dispute and the parties can agree to state a case they will at once say, "Why should we not go to the highest tribunal instead of taking all these intermediate steps which must involve us in expense ? Why should we not have the case decided at once?" Merchants would gladly embrace such an opportunity. They would say, " Why should we go to the State Court and incur cost when we should have to go after all to the High Court?" </para>

                        <para>- I am referring to the advantage which will follow to the community from this proposal. Most of us have had some experience in advising members of the mercantile community, and we know that their desire is to secure a speedy settlement of disputes. They desire that their cases should be settled as speedily and as cheaply as possible. A litigant may choose his Court according to the nature of his case. If he resides in Queensland and the case is likely to be one involving a long investigation of facts and requiring the examination of a number of witnesses, he will go to the State Court. After the matter has been thrashed out he will go to the High Court if the decision of the lower Court is unsatisfactory to him. But if the parties Agree to a case being stated and say " We do not wish to incur costs in respect of witnesses; we are prepared to submit the case straightway to the High Court," why should they not be able to adopt that course ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that a High Court consisting of three Judges could deal with all cases. It is not proposed to invest the Court with original jurisdiction in relation to all cases arising under the laws made by the Parliament. If that were the case the objection would be a solid one. But where this proposal is limited to questions relating to the Constitution no such objection can be taken. I cannot say exactly how many cases have occurred in Australia : but doubtless a large number have arisen in some shape or form. I should imagine that of that number not more than three have involved the interpretation of the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly ; when the parties could agree upon the facts, would it not be a very proper thing to allow the case to go straight to the High Court ? When the matter was before us in the first instance, <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> had still to go to the Senate, I could well understand the anxiety of honorable members not to increase the original jurisdiction of the Court, lest the Senate might be tempted to increase the number of Judges proposed to be appointed. But there is now no risk in that direction. Therefore, it seems to me that all that we have to look at is the benefit to be given to the community. I can see, for instance, that if the Arbitration Bill be passed, as I hope it will, a question might easily arise which should not be dragged before <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> State Court and then to the High Court. Why should not the parties, if they want to know if a matter is or is not within the Constitution, have a right to go direct to the High Court without any extra expense ? </para>

                    (Werriwa). - I hope that the Attorney-General will give the Committee a better reason for agreeing to the amendment than the statement that it would be an act of friendliness to the Senate to do so. There is no escape from the position that if we agree to the amendment we give the High Court original jurisdiction in regard to all matters arising under the Constitution. A certain original jurisdiction is given to the Court by the Constitution, though for my part I think it is a pity that any such jurisdiction was given to it. The Attorney-General, when the measure was last before us, urged that this original jurisdiction should be extended, but the feeling of the Committee was so decidedly against him that he would not even call for a division in support of his proposal. Now, however, we are asked to go back upon our opinions, and to do what we have already decided not to do. Does not the honorable and learned member for Indi admit that the amendment will enlarge the powers of the Court beyond what was originally intended? We originally provided that the Court should be, as far as we were able to make it so, merely an Appellate Court. But if we agree to the amendment, we shall open its doors so wide that we. shall require to appoint to the Federal Bench not three Judges, but half-a-dozen. I challenged the honorable and learned member to place on record his legal opinion upon the point, so that it might afterwards be quoted against him, but he would not venture to do so. Did not that show that he was speaking with a reservation, and that the powers conferred upon the Court by the amendment are much wider than any layman would imagine ? I trust that all those who are in favour of making the High Court as much as possible merely an Appellate Court will vote against the amendment. We are being asked to insert in the Bill, though in another form, a provision which we have already rejected, and I ask the assistance of lay members of the Committee in opposing it.

                    (Werriwa).- In the last five minutes we have, by amendments so specious that only lawyers could have drawn them up, completely altered the character of the Bill. The way in which they have been got through is a fraud upon the Committee.

                        <para>- Both the honorable and learned Attorney -General and the honorable and learned member for Indi know that it is so. I asked the honorable and learned member for Indi to give a legal opinion on the point, so that if he were ever appointed to the Federal Bench I could quote it against him afterwards ; but he refused to do so. Although the lay members of the Committee may not understand them, the simple amendments that have been made have quite altered the character of the Bill. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo, and the honorable member for Gippsland, did all they could to reduce the expenses connected with the High Court, but the Government are now seeking, through these amendment-!, to increase the expenditure to an extent undreamt of by us. We should enter a strong protest against the gross extravagance to which it is proposed to commit us. </para>

The Committee is being asked to absolutely stultify itself because the whole foundation of the Court is being changed by the amendments. I decline, as a lawyer, to allow the imputation to be cast upon the members of my profession that we are always in favour of enlarging the Courts. The amendments that are being made will probably lead to an increase in the number of Judges, and I am determined that nothing shall be done in that direction without a strong protest from me. </para>

                        <para>- I must say that the only extravagance in this connexion is to be found in the language employed by the honorable and learned member. I have twice explained at some length the meaning of the amendment, and am sure that no other honorable and learned member will be found to indorse the assertion that the honorable and learned member for Werriwa has made. I pointed out that in the Bill as it was sent to the Senate power was given to the High Court to issue a writ of mandamus against all persons holding office under the Commonwealth. I explained, further, that under the new paragraph now proposed the Court would have conferred upon it the remainder of the ordinary jurisdiction of Courts in regard to the issue of writs of mandamus, and am sure that no member of the profession on either side of the Chamber who heard my explanation would find any such divergence between it and the facts as the honorable and learned member for Werriwa has sought to establish. I do not dispute the right of the honorable and learned member to express his opinion, or to believe that he is right, but I claim to be perfectly entitled to declare that his view is utterly wrong. </para>

                    <para>- Perhaps the honorable and learned member for Werriwa was under some slight misapprehension as to the effect of the amendment, and therefore the heat which he has displayed may be to that extent pardonable. Personally, I think that the amendment is necessary. It will not extend the jurisdiction of the Court, but will confer upon it that ancillary power which it ought to have. Under the clause as it stood, the Court would have power to issue a mandamus against an officer of the Commonwealth but not against an ordinary citizen. </para>

                    <para>- The amendment appears to me to involve a very grave change, and to carry out a design - I do not say a nefarious design - to compel Supreme Courts to " knuckle under " to any <inline font-style="italic">fiat</inline> of the High Court. The idea in the first instance was that the Supreme Courts should judge as to their duty, and the High Court as to its duty, but now the proposal is to permit all kinds of writs - by way of mandamus or otherwise - to be issued to force the Supreme Courts to adopt the view of the High Court, even before they have given their decisions. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but there might be a difference between the Federal Court and the Supreme Courts as to the meaning of an Act or of the Constitution, and before the Supreme Court had fulfilled its functions the High Court might issue a mandamus directing it to do this or that. I do not think tha,t that is desirable, even though the power relates to the Supreme Courts in their Federal jurisdiction only. It might lead to great expense, because the High Court would be able to issue writs of <inline font-style="italic">certiorari</inline> and writs of mandamus to compel a Supreme Court, before it had performed its functions, to carry out the view of the High Court. Grave differences may arise as to the constitutionalty of this particular Bill - as to the validity of Clause 40, which forces all appeals to the High Court and voids appeals to the Privy Council. Suppose that a Supreme Court assumes that such a provision is invalid, and that it is arranging for an appeal to be carried on as of right, to the Privy Council. If the Supreme Court show an inclination to allow the appeal to go, the High Court might, under the provision now proposed, interpose with a mandamus to compel the Supreme Court to take a certain course, or might, by other means, cause the removal of the suit from the Supreme Court, and thus prevent it from giving a decision. I shall vote against the amendment, and I think that the proposed new sub-clause should ako be rejected. We should allow the Supreme Courts to take the view that an appeal lies to the Privy Council, notwithstanding the fact that the Bill provides that it shall not so lie. Under the amendment proposed, if the Supreme Court of a State had not actually decided a case, the High Court could intervene with a direction. Of course, I urge these views very respectfully ; but if the amendment be pressed to a division, as I hope it will be, I shall vote against it. I was net listening at the time the last amendment was being put from the Chair, otherwise I should have objected to it. </para>

                    <para>- Prom the very introduction of this Bill I have consistently endeavoured to restrict the original jurisdiction of the High Court, and my last vote was cast in the same direction. At the same time I cannot see that the proposed amendment tends to enlarge the original jurisdiction. It simply regulates the mode in which the jurisdiction shall be exercised. It is practically a pare of the appellate jurisdiction, and merely indicates the way in which the power of revision shall be exercised. Inasmuch as the amendment does not enlarge the powers of original jurisdiction, I shall support it. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, the honorable and learned member will agree with me that no Court ever says to another tribunal, " Before you enter upon the decision of a certain case, we will tell you how you must decide it." The only occasions upon which the High Court would issue a mandamus, would be when the lower Court, by reason of some mistaken view of the law, failed in its Federal jurisdiction to hear and determine cases. For example, let us suppose that the Supreme Court of a State declares that it has not the power to hear and determine a particular case throughout. A litigant may hold that the Court possesses the necessary power, and may apply to the High Court for the issue of a mandamus. If the High Court considers that the State Supreme Court is endowed with the necessary jurisdiction, it will issue a mandamus compelling that tribunal to hear and determine the case. The procedure followed is exactly the same as that which is adopted by the States Supreme Courts when inferior tribunals mistake their powers. It is only when the lower Court, in its mistaken view of the law, declares that it has not jurisdiction that the higher tribunal will step in and issue a mandamus, which, after all, is a mere matter of machinery. </para>

                    the Bill in its original form, however, were not so limited. The mistake which has been made is in supposing that the power to issue a mandamus is confined to matters of Federal jurisdiction. It is not. It is absolute, and it is all the more expressive because in the preceding provision? the power is confined to Federal jurisdiction. Further, can we confer power to issue a mandamus in cases where the matter involved is not one of Federal jurisdiction ? Suppose, for example, that a Court is called upon to deal with one point in perhaps twenty, which involves a question of Federal law, The other nineteen points may relate to. matters of ordinary law. What I mean is that the Court may issue a mandamus upon ordinary matters of law. I have said that it was unfortunate that issue should have been joined on this particular writ of mandamus. The very first amendment which was carried in the interpretation clause clearly indicated what was the intention of the Senate. Right throughout these amendments the intention evidently is to allow the High Court to interfere before a decision has been given by the Supreme Court of a State, and to direct that Court as to its business and as to how it is to perform it. I, therefore, move -

I objected to this clause when it was previously under discussion, because the Privy Council does not issue writs of mandamus to Courts of inferior jurisdiction. As the Privy Council does not compel by mandamus the discharge of a duty, similarly we ought not to vest that power in the High Court.

                    QUICK (Bendigo).- I hope that the Attorney-General will consider the suggestion, and either recommit the amendments or add the provision in some other form, because, as it stands, the words

                    are left, without any connexion with the remainder of the clause. In the American Federal Acts all cases relating to
                    <inline font-style="italic">habeas corpus</inline>
                    are distinctly provided for in order to show that the matter is within Federal jurisdiction.

I am not responsible for the origin of this amendment, but, so far as I understand the position, it was proposed because it was considered that other remedies might be required which were not within the terms of any one df these specifications. Consequently, this provision was inserted, not to enlarge the powers of the High Court, but to prevent any contention that the recapitulation in the preceding part of the clause was exhaustive, excluding everything not specifically included in it. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. It was argued that many cases could be conceived in which none of the particular writs here authorized could suffice ; although they were and ought to be within the power of the High Court in its Federal jurisdiction. In order that the Court should be able to give effect to its will, it was felt that it required power to issue writs. This provision was inserted so that, without giving a new endowment to the Court, the recapitulation to which I have referred might not be considered exhaustive and exclusive. - </para>

                    (Indi).- I think that the Attorney-General has put the position very well, and I should like the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne to recognise the reason for using the last few words in the amendment. They are necessary. Section 34 commences with these words -

As I understand the position it is this : A superior court is invested at common law with power to see that the inferior courts have not transgressed their jurisdiction. </para>

The Supreme Court of a State is no more under the heel of the High Court than are the County Courts Under the heel of the Supreme Courts. We are giving certain powers to the High Court, and this amendment is designed to show that we are not taking away the means necessary to enable it to carry out its undoubted jurisdiction. It is to prevent any argument as to the power of the High Court being foreshortened. </para>

                <para class="block">I explained this matter on Friday last when introducing the amendments to the Committee. These words were formerly in the Bill, but the honorable and learned member for Bendigo had a doubt as to whether they were within the constitutional power of this Parliament, and they were accordingly omitted. Upon consideration, it appears to me that they are within the power of this Parliament, and I think it very desirable to reintroduce them. In this State it was thought necessary to pass a special Act to limit appeals upon interlocutory matters - a power which was becoming extremely burdensome in the hands of litigious people. ' This is a safeguard which has been adopted in other States. </para>

                    (Northern Melbourne).Might I suggest that we should follow the practice which exists under the Judicature Act in England as well as in Victoria, so that the Supreme Court itself might give leave to appeal? In the English Act, which we have copied in Victoria, there is no appeal from an interlocutory order in Chambers unless either the Judge who has made the order or the Full Court gives leave. We go only to the Full Court, as it were, to obtain leave to appeal, and that involves the expense o'f an application. There is a good deal of trouble saved if the Judge who makes the order is able to say in answer to a request for leave to appeal - " You can appeal if you choose to do so," when he believes there is sufficient doubt about the matter to warrant the adoption of that course. In order to allow that to be done, the only alteration necessary would be to say that -

                    <para>- I think that the suggestion is a good one, but I have a slight doubt as to whether we can make this limitation. In a recent divorce case an interlocutory order was made by the Supreme Court of a State, and an appeal was allowed to the Privy Council. If such a matter is appealable to the Privy Council, it must be appealable to the High Court, and this limitation cannot cut down the right. The suggestion made by the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne would get over the difficulty. </para>

                        <para>. - It is proposed to proceed with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and I hope the debate upon the second reading will be pursued without further interruption to its conclusion. If on any evening there should be any difficulty in continuing the debate to a sufficiently late hour, the Minister for Home Affairs will ask the House to agree to two or three new clauses which it is proposed to add to the Defence Bill. </para>
