            <para>- I desire to ask the Prime Minister if he has seen the reports published from time to time as to the ghastly butcheries perpetrated in the Balkans. If so, will he consider the advisability of cabling to the Imperial authorities a protest, on behalf of Australia, against their continuance and urging those authorities to strain every nerve, conjointly with the other European powers, to speedily bring them to an end ? </para>

            <para>- Every reader of the daily press must have noticed the reports received referring to what I think the honorable member has properly termed the ghastly tragedies in the south-east of Europe. There exists in that corner of the Continent a condition of affairs which one would rather expect to find in the centre of darkest Africa, or in some other hopelessly uncivilized country. I am perfectly sure that the unanimous sympathy of Australia is with the honorable member in his desire that these tragedies should speedily be brought to a conclusion. </para>

              <para>- Probably there are. I never knew a case to which that remark would not apply in some degree. It is, however, obvious that the main burden of the blame for the atrocities which have been committed rests upon those who are not of the same blood and faith as the people of the rest of Europe. I am sure that the feeling of Australia is unanimous in this matter, but hesitate to telegraph an expression of sympathylest our action might be considered due to a suspicion on our part that the Governments of Great Britain and of the other nations of Europe are not just as alive as we are to the deplorable conditions which obtain and to the necessity for altering them. I trust that the present unsatisfactory state of affairs will speedily be brought to a close. </para>

          <para>The rifle clubs in Western Australia have not hitherto been enrolled under any regulations, and therefore have no official standing. Steps are now being taken to gazette these clubs under the Commonwealth Rifle Club Regulations. An arrangement was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, prior to these regulations coming into force, by which these rifle clubs in Western Australia, voluntarily formed, but which are affiliated with the National Rifle Association, were able to acquire certain issue of ammunition ; and in order to avoid discouragement, pending the gazetting of these clubs under the new regulations, and therefore bringing them into line with all other rifle clubs in the Commonwealth, the Commandant of Western Australia has been authorized to continue the issue of ammunition within reasonable limits to those clubs which have applied in the regular manner to come under the new regulations. </para>

But I am quite sure that a great strain has been put upon both the male and the female employes, and I believe that in some instances the health of the female typists has broken down.

            <para>. - The request which the right honorable member makes is, that under the circumstances the vote on the Bill relating to the selection of the Federal Capital Site shall not be taken before Wednesday next. I do not think there need be the least difficulty about that under-  taking. But I wish the House to be prepared to commence the discussion on Tuesday; it will certainly be Wednesday  before we  can come to a decision. To prevent any loss of time it will be necessary to commence dealing with the&#39; question on Tuesday, though there is no prospect, I am afraid, of concluding the debate on that day. </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister is now asking us to pass the third reading of the Appropriation Bill. I think that before we do so we should have an assurance from him that the Capital site matter will be carried to a definiteconclusion before Parliament rises. What I  mean by a definite conclusion is that either the site shall be selected, or that the mattershall reach the deadlock stage, at which it will be absolutely impossible to select a sitethis session. I gather that it is the honorable and learned gentleman&#39;s intention to try to attain a definite conclusion, but I wish to hear a statement made by him before the Appropriation Bill receives our assent. </para>

              <para>- Yes, because while thisHouse is dealing with the question of the Capital site we wish to give the Senate an opportunity to deal with the Estimates which are embodied in this Bill. It mustbe remembered that from the point of view of the Senate the discussion on this Bill is equivalent to our discussion on the Estimates. The Appropriation Bill is the only measure that gives the Senate an opportunity to consider the Estimates for theyear. </para>

              <para>- This is the one measure which we ought not to surrender too hurriedly to the Senate. We ought not to give them the Appropriation Bill whenever they think fit. There are obvious reasons why an Appropriation Bill is held back in all Parliaments. How do we know what is going to result in connexion with the selection of the Capital sites? No one can see the end of that troublesome business, and none of us knows precisely what is going to eventuate between the two Houses. </para>

              <para>- We have been promised that we should see the end of this business ever since we commenced to consider it. But we seem to be progressing backwards. I believe that on the first consideration in the Senate there was only a difference of one vote between the two parties. But we have progressed so much in regard to the solution of this difficult matter that, last night, there was a difference of seven votes on a division. That does not augur a speedy and definite settlement of this matter. I wish that I could be as optimistic in regardto its discision as some honorable members appear to be.I do not think that this Bill ought to pass its third reading until the Capital site has been selected, or at any rate until some promise of finality has been reached.Under the circumstances I would ask the Ministry to defer the third reading of the measure for at least a week. Certainly it ought not to be sanctioned until the important business which is before the two branches of the Legislature is in a fair way of being determined. That is one of the fundamental principles of parliamentary government. I would urge upon the Ministry to agree to the course which I have suggested, and to postpone the third reading of the Bill for aweek. </para>

            <para>- I do not blame the Government for attempting to get this measure passed as early as possible. To get the Appropriation Bill out of the way is a wise proceeding on the part of any Ministry, because it places them in the position of being able to settle with Parliament whenever they may think fit. Of course there is something to be said in favour of the early passage of the measure through this House, because of the position of the Senate under the Constitution. The other Chamber naturally desires time to consider it. Nevertheless, as was stated by the late Prime Minister, the determination of the Capital site is one of the most important questions with which this Parliament has been called upon to deal. It is quite unusual for a subject of such magnitude to be decided after Supply has been granted to the Government for the full period of the year. At the same time if the Opposition do not think it worth while to enter a protest against the adoption of the course which is proposed, no charge of haste can be laid against the door of the Government. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline>B.EDWARDS (South Sydney).I quite indorse the remarks of the honorable member for Parramatta and the honorable member for Wide Bay. According to my parliamentary experience, the Appropriation Bill is the very last measure which should be passed by Parliament. Seeing that the selection of the Capital site constitutes the most important business with which we have had to deal during the present session, that question ought certainly to be decided before this Bill is disposed of. Generally speaking, the Appropriation Bill is finally dealt with only a few hours before the prorogation of Parliament. I admit that our Constitution is somewhat different from the Constitution of the States, and that some deference must be paid to that difference. That fact in itself, however, is not sufficient to justify the passage of an Appropriation Bill at the present juncture. Throughout the session I have constantly blamed the Ministry for neglect in failing to submit for our early consideration the question of the selection of the Capital site. But despite the gravity of the present position I think that the reputation of the Prime Minister is such that the House will be prepared to accept his assurance that the list of eligible sites will be reduced to two, and, if possible, to one, before the session closes. It is only upon that under standing that I am prepared to allow the third reading of this measure to pass. </para>

            <para>- It was only to be expected that the Government would endeavour to push this very important measure to its final conclusion as soon as possible. To my mind, however, there is no immediate hurry to pass its third reading. Several other measures are awaiting our attention. Despite the fact that the question of the selection of the Federal Capital site has been given considerable prominence from the very inception of this Parliament, its consideration has been deferred till the closing days of the present session, and very little time is now available in which to deal with that matter. Moreover, present appearances point to the probability of future complications with the other Chamber which must inevitably result in further delay. I repeat that there are other important measures which have still to engage our attention - notably the Patents Bill and the Defence Bill. If we agree to the passing of this measure, it means that we shall lose control over the Government. The latter will then be able to close the session at any time they choose without consulting the House. But so long as the Appropriation Bill is held in abeyance, honorable members are in a position to exercise a controlling influence upon our procedure. I do not think that it is unreasonable to ask that the third reading of this Bill should be deferred a little longer. The adoption of such a course will not inflict any hardship upon the public servants, and, therefore, there is no need whatever to unduly hurry the passing of the measure, unless the Government desire to bring the session to a close at an earlier stage than Parliament would be disposed to approve of in view of the incomplete state of the business upon hand. I would strongly urge the Ministry to consider the request which has been preferred by some members of the Opposition. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member for Wide Bay has certainly given the members of the Opposition a very timely reminder of their duty. He has declared that, whilst it is to the interests of the Government to secure the early passage of this Bill, if members of the Opposition are alive to their responsibility they will insist on its further consideration being deferred. I thoroughly agree with his remarks. In view of the fact that the Federal Capital site has not yet been selected, I hold that it would be unwise to sanction the third reading of this measure. As has already been pointed out, several important measures have yet to be passed. How would honorable members feel to-morrow morning if, when they arrived at the House, they found the parliamentary shutters up <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Immediately the Appropriation Bill is passed, the Government will be in a position to flout the will of Parliament, and to close its doors. I feel strongly tempted to submit an amendment which will have the effect of compelling the Treasurer to furnish us with some information in regard to this matter. If the Treasurer now replies the debate will be closed. </para>

              <para>- That being the case, it is unnecessary for me, at this stage, to move an amendment in order that honorable members may have full opportunity to discuss this question. I trust that the Treasurer will make a statement to the House, as requested by the honorable member for Parramatta. At a most critical stage in her history, New South Wales to-day finds herself without her full measure of representation in either House, and if the leader of the Opposition were present I should hope to hear him strongly oppose the third reading of this Bill, pending the settlement of the Capital site question. We have received an assurance from the Prime Minister that the matter will be dealt with, but we know that the Victorian press arid various public meetings held in this State have bitterly opposed the selection of a site, and therefore there is a danger of the question being shelved for this session. B3&#39; preventing the third reading.of this Bill today we shall be able to avert the anticipated danger, and it is my duty to join with other honorable members in exercising that power. I ask the Treasurer to say that he will not press the passing of this Bill through its remaining stages before New South Wales has secured her full measure of representation in the Federal Parliament. </para>

            <para>- If the House agrees to the third reading of the Bill it will create a very dangerous precedent. It is the duty of every honorable member to protest against the adoption of such a course. The moment we agree to the third reading of the Bill our power over the Ministry will disappear. We know that important legislation materially affecting all the States still remains to be dealt with by us, and if we allowed this Bill to pass we should have no means to combat an attempt made by the Government on some flimsy pretext to shelve that legislation. I think that every honorable member should protest against the granting of such a power to the Ministry. I have never heard of the adoption of this practice in the House of Commons, or in any Legislature in Australia. Of course, if the House is foolish enough to acquiesce in the Government proposal, the Treasurer cannot be blamed for making it. If it is necessary that another place should have ample time to deal with the Estimates, an arrangement should have been made to enable it to consider them as soon as they left this Chamber, the Appropriation Bill meanwhile being kept back until the last moment. In that way we should have been able to overcome the difficulty suggested by the Treasurer. This is a very serious matter, and if a division is called for I shall certainly vote against the motion. I feel inclined to move that the debate be adjourned until next week : but in any event I think that the Government should give us some assurance that they will not seek to pass the Bill through its remaining stages for at least another week. </para>

            <para>- I quite admit that the practice usually followed in the States Parliaments is to keep back the Appropriation Bill until all other measures have been dealt with. We must not forget, however, that we are working under a new Constitution, and that the position of the Senate is altogether different from that of the Legislative Councils of the States. The Senate has a right to request the reduction of any item in the Appropriation Bill, and it is therefore only fair that it should have a reasonable time to consider the Estimates, and to obtain the fullest explanation in regard to them. In these circumstances we cannot adopt the practice of the States Governments, and hold back this Bill until the last moment. That practice works very well in the States Legislatures, because the Legislative Councils of the States can simply reject or accept an Appropriation Bill, and, as a rule, they agree to such measures as a matter of course. This House, if it doubted the promise given by the Prime Minister, would be justified in refusing to pass the Bill at this stage. The only object which honorable members could have in view in adopting that course would be to retain control over the Government. But, as my honorable and learned leader has given a definite and distinct pledge to the House that the Federal Capital question will be advanced this session as nearly as possible to finality, even if it is impossible to finally settle it, I fail to see why any opposition should be shown to the Bill being read a third time to-day. An Appropriation Bill is held back, as a rule, simply to enable the House to have a check upon the Government, The honorable member for Dalley is afraid that if this Bill be passed to-day he may find to-morrow that Parliament has been prorogued, and that the question of the Federal Capital has been shelved. I am astonished that he should make such a suggestion. </para>

He said he was afraid that if we passed this Bill to-day he would find to-morrow that the doors of Parliament had been closed, and that the Government had failed to invite the House to proceed with the consideration of the Capital site. If we held back this Bill until both Houses had dealt with that question, we should have to send it to another place at a time when it would be impossible for honorable senators to give it proper consideration. In view of the pledge given by the Prime Minister - which I am certain is accepted by the majority of honorable members- I see no reason why we should not now agree to the Bill being read a third time, and thus give another place a fair opportunity to discuss it. </para>

Doubtless if they considered their purpose would be served by again taking up that attitude they would not hesitate to do so.

If we allow this Bill to pass we shall part with our control over the Government.

            <para>-I desire to emphasize, if it be necessary, the remarks of the last  speaker  and of other honorable members as to the need for an adjournment of the debate. As has been well pointed out, no control can be exercised by the Government over the members of another place, nor indeed can they exercise an effective control over the members of this House after the Appropriation Bill has been passed. Whilst I have every confidence in the honesty of the Government, their intentions are one thing, and the intentions and acts of their supporters here and of the members of another House are quite another thing. The representatives of theStateof New South Wales in this House are entirely at the mercy of honorable gentlemen who, not to put too fine a point upon it, are not exactly eager for the selection of the Federal Capital. They would not bother very much if it were not selected this session, could view with equanimity the possibility of its not being selected during the first session of next Parliament, and doubtless would sleep well if they knew that it would never be selected at all. Therefore, as the Government cannot effectively control the members of this House, and have no control whatever over members of another place, I think that they should agree to the suggested adjournment of the debate, at any rate until an opportunity has been given to this House to decide the Capital question. I do not think that we are asking too much in making that request. The Government cannot state definitely that they will not prorogue until the matter has been dealt with, because they have no means of carrying that promise into effect. </para>

Their suggestion amounts to this : That we should not send the Appropriation Bill to the Senate until the members of that body have concurred with us in the selection of a site for the Federal capital. </para>

              <para>- Parliament will have no control over the Government after the Appropriation Bill has become law. With regard to the suggestion of the honorable member that we should keep back the Appropriation Bill, and endeavour to make some arrangement which will enable the members of the Senate to discuss the Estimates of Expenditure in some other form, I think that this House has given away already too much of its control of the purse. I shall never be a party to increasing the powers of the Senate in connexion with financial matters. The members of the Senate are entitled under the Constitution to consider the items in the Estimates as they cannot be considered by the Legislative Council of a State, and to enable them to exercise that power they must obtain the Appropriation Bill before the last moment of the session. </para>

              <para>- I fail to see that I am. Honorable members who urge the keeping &#34;back of the Appropriation Bill are labouring under a delusion. We must rely upon the good faith of the Government so far as our relations with the Senate are concerned. The position of the Appropriation Bill will not have any effect in bringing the Senate into line -with the House of Representatives upon the Capital site question. Besides, we cannot keep back the Appropriation Bill indefinitely. Therefore there is no force in the veiled threat that would be made by taking the course of action suggested. I do not wish to leave the House to the uncontrolled mercies of any Ministry, but we must either accept or decline the assurance of the Prime Minister. If we accept his assurance it will not matter to us where the Appropriation Bill is, and so far as the Senate is concerned, it does not matter where it is, because we cannot in the least degree control the actions of the members of that body. </para>

              <para>- I listened very carefully to the remarks &#39;of honorable members, and I did not hear any suggestion of the kind. If it had been made it would have at once struck my notice as a most startling proposition. What I understand is that the retention of the Appropriation Bill undoubtedly affords the House the most powerful means of exercising control over the Government. Of course, we can go on as long as we like passing Supply Bills in order that the affairs of the State may be carried on from month to month, but once we pass an Appropriation Bill which provides for the expenditure for the remainder of the financial year, we lose our constitutional power so  farasit  relates to the control of the finances and of the Government. I think that that is a proposition of the most elementary character, and I do not see how it is possible to put the matter of retaining the Appropriation Bill other than as bearing upon the control which this House exercises over the Government. With regard to the action which should be taken by us, I think that we ought to settle the question of the Capital site as soon as we possibly can. I venture to say that honorable members are sick of it, that Australia is sick of it, and that the most mischievous consequences would ensue if we had to go to the elections before finally settling the matter. I hope that in the early stages of the next Parliament two matters will be removed from our consideration - two matters which have troubled us too long. I hope that the fiscal issue will be settled once and for all - or, at any rate, for a considerable period - upon the basis of the continuance of the Tariff now in operation, and also that the Capital site question will be disposed of. </para>

              <para>- I hope not. Honorable members need not lay that flattering unction to their souls. I do not think that the fiscal peace which honorable members desire to see maintained will be disturbed bv the consideration of the question of preferential trade. We can easily give effect to that principle without reopening the whole fiscal controversy. I am indeed sanguine that when we meet next year both these questions will be out of the way. I would beg of the Government to spare no pains whatever to get the Capital site question settled this session. </para>

              <para>- Then the sooner they get it the better. Let the Government keep their noses to it. Judging from the Prime Minister&#39;s statements, I think that he is fully seized with the importance of removing from the constant notice of the Parliament and the people this question, which ought to be settled and which has all too long remained unsettled. I hope, therefore, that he will do all that is necessary to insure that both Houses shall express their choice ; that he will persevere, and not be induced by any desire to get into the haven of recess to spare any pains. As I believe that the Government will do all they can - Appropriation Bill or no Appropriation Bill - and that they will carry out what is the undoubted wish of this House, I am prepared to assist them in doing what they propose. </para>

            <para>- With reference to what has been said on the Capital site question, I desire to point out that no one on this side of the House questions the sincerity of the Government. We do, however, doubt their ability, with the Appropriation Bill out. of the way, to carry the determination of the Capital site to a conclusion. We have known Governments to make promises before. I need scarcely remind honorable members of the statement recently made by a right honorable gentleman no longer a member of this House, in perfect good faith, concerning a matter of vital importance, and of the fact that within one short month a course exactly opposite to that indicated by him was taken. That statement was made in the same good faith as the statement of the Prime Minister in reference to the Capital site. No one doubts his sincerity, or that it is his intention to carry his promise into effect. In politics, however, no one knows what a day or an hour may bring forth, and there is nothing like being ready for emergencies. Therefore I urge that the consideration of the Capital question should be postponed for a week, or until we can see how matters are likely to shape themselves between the two Houses. All the talk about the Senate having no work to do next week is quite beside the question. The Senate has had many holidays extending over a week during the present session. They had one recently because there was nothing for them todo, and therefore there is nothing novel in the other Chamber being able to go away for a week. In view of the fact that this is the most vitally important matter which we have been called upon to consider this session, I would urge the Government even now to leave the consideration of this Bill over in order that we may see what kaleidoscopic changes may take place. We cast no reflection upon the Government or the Prime Minister, but we say that, as has happened before, political eventualities may cause the Prime Minister to take action contrary to the solemn promise which he has just made to the House. We have had recent experience that this is possible in politics, even assuming good faith, and all the like. We have seen that these political turnovers can take place, and what has happened will probably occur again. I therefore ask the Government to allow this Bill to stand over for a week at least. </para>

I wish to point out that one reason why the Bill should not now be disposed of is that we have been promised certain additional information bearing upon the Capital sites, and that, in accordance with that promise, we have to-day received documents containing a report of the evidence. But we were also informed that we should be supplied with the minutes of the proceedings of the Commission. </para>

              <para>- I wish to urge the postponement of this Bill, for the reason that, so far, honorable members have not been supplied with full information bearing upon the Capital Sites inquiry. A postponement would enable us to get that information, and we should be in a better position to deal with the sites. I hope the Government will see their way not to take from the House the power which we possess, as they will do by putting through this measure. There is no immediate hurry for it. I trust that they will accede to the wish of the Opposition in allowing it to stand over for at least a few days, so that we may be better able to see our way with respect to other matters which the Government have asked the House to consider. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. THOMSON</inline>(North Sydney).Whilst 1 quite recognise all that has been said in connexion with the desirability, under ordinary circumstances, of not giving the Government the Appropriation Bill until the principal business of Parliament has been transacted, I also recognise the claim that the Senate should be allowed time for the consideration of the Bill, which covers the Estimates for the entire year. While I think that the  Government could, allowing for all that, have left over this Bill for another week, I also recognise that we can hardly go to the extent of resisting the.proposals of the Government so far as not to assent to the third reading of the measure until the Capital site and all the other business of Parliament has been absolutely cleared up. Since we have to agree to send the Bill to the Senate before other business is concluded, I felt that the best thing we can do is to obtain from the Prime Minister an absolute promise as to the carrying out of the principal item of business that  remains  to be transacted before Parliament is prorogued. There has been some doubt as to what the Prime Minister actually promised. To me his promise was not capable of doubt, and I will now state what I understood it to be. I understood the Prime Minister to promise that before Parliament is prorogued there shall be, if possible, a selection by the two Chambers of one site ; or, if that is not possible, that there shall be a selection of one site by each Chamber. Those words are plain enough, and are easily understood. </para>

              <para>- The promise of the Prime Minister is an absolute one, and is a stronger hold upon the Government than retaining the Appropriation Bill. I, for one, am prepared to accept the Prime Minister&#39;s absolute promise, because I think we can get nothing stronger by taking any other course that we have the power to adopt. It is our power that we must consider as well as our desire. I have confidence that the Prime Minister will see that his promise is fulfilled, not only to the letter, but in the spirit. </para>

            <para>. - I hesitate to address myself again to this question, but if I did not, a misconception might possibly be allowed to take root. No promise has been made by me with regard to this matter that did not express the intention adopted long ago as part of the policy of the Government. I intended from the first to take a course which would settle this vexed question ; and cordially re-echo and agree with the remarks of my right honorable friend the member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> that the whole Continent, as well as the State of NewSouth Wales, desires to see it settled once and for all. As far as lies in our power, what we proposed to do originally, and what we still propose to do, is to commence next week in this House, and endeavour, if possible, before its end, to get a conclusion arrived at by honorable members in regard to the selection of the site. If we are fortunate enough to succeed in that, the proposal of this House would then be put before the other Chamber the week after. The Senate will have the whole of next week to dispose of the various Appropriation Bills before them - the principal Appropriation Bill, that relating to works and buildings, and the two minor Bills relating to arrears. Those measures will occupy the time of the Senate during next week. If this House is fortunate enough to make its selection of the site - as I hope will be the case ; if necessary sitting late and long for that purpose - then, in the week following, the members of another place will have an opportunity of agreeing or of disagreeing with us ; whilst we on our part shall take up the Defence Bill, and the minor measures that are still before Parliament. That business will occupy us while the Senate is considering the question of the site. If the Senate agrees with what we have done, practically the work of the session is over, and we shall depart. If the Senate does not agree - though I cordially hope they will - we shall take steps to endeavour to arrive at some harmonious agreement. Nothing will be lacking on the part of the Ministry to arrive at such a conclusion. It is possible, of course, that the Senate may refuse to come to any decision. It is also possible that this House may do the same ; although I think, from my knowledge of the feeling of honorable members on both sides, and of public sentiment in the country, neither House will receive any encouragement to prolong the indefinite and unsatisfactory state in which this matter stands. The Government desire to get the question settled and out of the way as speedily as possible. It has been part of their policy from the first to remove this vexed question from the arena of politics, and I hope that the policy we shall submit to the country will not be interfered with by the intrusion of any other issue. </para>

Hitherto a number of bogus patents have been issued, and held <inline font-style="italic">in ierrorem</inline> over people who have been using inventions which they did not know were patented. I have adopted the provision in vogue in America, with one variation, which was in the nature of a suggestion that I saw in the <inline font-style="italic">Law Quarterly Review</inline> of July last.

        <para class="block">If honorable members turn to clause 12 they will see that we have omitted paragraph (e), which gave the Commissioner the right to delegate any of his powers to a Deputy Commissioner. It seemed to be too important a power to include with the Commissioner&#39;s authority to summon witnesses and receive evidence, and accordingly it has been placed in this special clause. We have particularized it so that in delegating any authority the Commissioner will indicate the particular matters, or class of matters, or the particular part of the Commonwealth to which his delegation is to extend. The power is the same as that originally provided in clause 12, save that the Commissioner is now given an opportunity to adjust it to the necessities of each case. It might otherwise have been assumed that &#34; delegation of powers&#34; meant a delegation of all powers over all the Commonwealth. This delegation probably will be chiefly used, in the first instance at all events, in the appointment of a Deputy Commissioner in each State, who, until the whole system becomes completely unified, will be able to act in such matters as the Commissioner thinks fit to intrust to him. </para>

        <para class="block">The object of my amendment is to facilitate the transfer of patent rights. At present the cost of transfer is, in some cases, far greater than the cost of taking out the patent itself. In very many instances holders of patents who may happen to be impecunious are utterly prohibited from transferring a right which may be of some value, although not valuable enough to justify the large expenditure at times involved in preparing the various deeds necessary to enable a transfer to be made. I wrote to the late Minister for Trade and Customs some time ago, suggesting that when he was drafting this Bill he should embody in it some such simple reform as this. The right honorable member apparently did not think it worth while to adopt my suggestion, but I would remind the Committee that the reform, if it is a reform, is one which we have carried out in relation to transfers involving very much larger suras than are usually associated with the transfer of a patent. It has been introduced into our land laws by what is known as the Torrens transfer system. One can transfer property of very great value at a cost of about ten shillings, exclusive of the tax. Life assurance policies may also be transferred by indorsement, while one scrip, perhaps of the value of &#163;100,000, may be transferred by a duly witnessed indorsement. It seems to me that we might well adopt this very simple expedient in order to facilitate the transfer of patents. It would be a very great concession to poor holders of patents, who have already received much consideration at the hands of the Committee. </para>

            <para>- I am not a lawyer, but I think that the patentee in such a case would require to have a deed drawn up setting forth the interests of the several parties. But if a man were the original patentee, and still held the patent right, he would beable under this amendment to transfer it at a cost of 5s. or 10s. I was obliged on one occasion to take over some patents in New South Wales, and in one case the transfer cost me over &#163;20. I had to go to the Patent Office - just as one was called upon to visit the Titles Office in connexion with the transfer of land under the old system - with a bundle of documents tracing the holders of the patent from first to last, and showing the various releases and liens upon it. We should have a system under which patents would be retained in the office of the Registrar, and a certificate issued setting forth that &#34; A.B.&#34; is the holder of letters patent, giving him the privilege of a certain invention. Under that system, if &#34;A.B.&#34; wished to dispose of his rights, he would simply have to write on the back of the certificate a statement of transfer to &#34;C.D.,&#34; who would have the transfer registered for a small fee, and thus complete the transaction. At present transfers have to pass through the hands of lawyers, who are called upon to display much ability in tracing the various holders of the patent rights, and in drawing up long deeds of recital. The adoption of my proposal will confer a great boon upon a very large number of holders of patents, who are unable at present to do anything with them because of the cost of the transfer. </para>

        <para class="block">What  is desired is that when a monopoly is granted in the Commonwealth the patentee, or some person authorized by him, shall, if required, commence and continuously carry on the construction or manufacture of the patented article within Australia. The enormous development of chemical manufactories in Germany, now one of the most prosperous elements of the trade of that country, is largely due to the restrictive provisions of the German patent law. Formerly Great Britain controlled many of the most valuable and profitable chemical manufactories, but when the patentees found that they were under no restriction to manufacture in that country, while they were required to manufacture in Germany, they were induced to remove their operations to the latter country, to which they have proved one of the most prolific sources of wealth. Another illustration of the same result is the manufacture of linotypes, the patent rights in which, owing te the provisions in the German law, were purchased for about &#163;150,000 in that country as compared with something like &#163;800,000 paid for the patent rights in the United Kingdom, and possibly some of its dependencies, and it is understood that the development of linotype manufactories in that country is largely due to the provisions of its patent law. The principle underlying the clause is so important that, in order to insure its acceptance, I have introduced conditions which will make it operative only in cases in which it is evidently not injurious to the legitimate interests of the patentee. For instance, the patented article must be reasonably capable of being commercially constructed or manufactured, or the invention patented reasonably capable of being commercially worked within the Commonwealth. The condition as to the working of a patent within the Commonwealth need not be complied with if the consumption of the patented article within Australia would be too small, or if some necessary element would be so expensive that its manufacture here would be an injury to the patentee, and involve an increase in the price of the article. </para>

            <para>- I do not think it desirable to narrow the provision in that way. It might be possible to establish a new  industry  upon conditions favourable to the patentee, and it would be unwise to impose any restriction such as the honorable and learned member suggests. There is no desire, under this power, to extract anything more then can reasonably be claimed. Surely when a person is being granted a monopoly, it is reasonable for us to say - &#34;Take your monopoly and enjoy it, but if you can manufacture your patent with commercial success within the Commonwealth you will be called upon, in return for the monopoly you enjoy, to supply the requirements of the community by manufacturing here.&#34; That seems to be only reasonable, and the conditions under which it is proposed to make the demand of the patentee, appear to remove the chief objections which apparently led honorable members in another place to strike out the clause. These amendments I propose will require to be embodied twice within the clause and also in the patent itself . With safeguards which I have indicated to honorable members, I believe that the provision will afford a means of legitimately increasing the productions of the Commonwealth, that it will result in advantage to our industries and to our people, and, at the same time, inflict no undue hardship upon the patentees. </para>

            <para>- Clause 83, as amended last night, provides that the Court shall decide whether the price at which a patent is sold is a reasonable one. If it is found that it is sold at an oppressive or unreasonable price, after two years from the &#39;time of issuing the patent, a compulsory licence may be granted so that any person in the Commonwealth may manufacture it. The Court also has power to absolutely revoke the patent. Notwithstanding that drastic alteration which goes far beyond the English law, the Prime Minister now asks us to agree to a provision which is not to be found in any Patent Acts except those of Canada and Germany. I am informed that the provision in the Canadian Act has proved a dead letter. A similar provision was embodied in some of the South Australian Patent Acts, but proved inoperative. It was recognised that if it were enforced, it could only lead to an increase in the price of the patented article. For instance, honorable members must realize that it would not pay the Singer Manufacturing Company to manufacture their sewing machines within the Commonwealth. The same remark would apply to the manufacture of linotypes. It is only by centralizing their work that these great manufacturing firms can turn out an article at a small cost. The Singer Manufacturing Company have been able to establish a successful branch in only one place, namely, Scotland. There is no necessity for this provision, which amounts to protection and nothing else. It is not required to tone down the effects of the monopoly granted by a patent, but is an attempt to enforce the local manufacture of articles in respect of which we have granted patent rights. Although no working conditions are imposed upon patentees in the United States, the greater part of the time of the SupremeCourt is taken up in dealing with actions relating to patents. There is no doubt that during the last twenty or thirty years an enormous number of patent actions have been dealt with in America. Nearly the whole of the jurisdiction of some of the district Courts is monopolised by patent actions, and similar results would be brought about here. Among other questions which the Courts would be called upon to determine here would be the question, for instance, whether a patent machine could be manufactured at a fair price, and such questions must lead to endless litigation. The patentees would be subjected to continual harassment, and I hope that honorable members will not consent to pass such an anomalous and drastic provision. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. THOMSON</inline>(North Sydney).- I should have thought that every possible security - more than was desirable - had been afforded by the amendments which were accepted last night. Under the provisions referred to by the honorable and learned member for South Australia, if a foreign patentee did not consider it desirable to manufacture in the Commonwealth, it would be competent for any one whothought he could successfully manufacture the article to apply for a compulsory&#34; licence to enable him to do so. Now we are asked to insert another provision which would have this effect. . If it did not pay any one in the Commonwealth to apply for a compulsory licence, and it did not pay the patentee himself to manufacture within the Commonwealth, the patent might be revoked. That would mean that any person manufacturing in a place where there was no patent law, such as Holland, could gain the advantage of the patent in our market, in spite of the money spent by the patentee in registering the patent within the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- That does not affect my argument. We know that many patents do not assume any great value until after the patentee has spent many years in creating demand, and that frequently it is only during the lastyear or so of the period for which the patent is issued that the patentee receives any return for his ingenuity and enterprise. In other words, the patentee has. to work his patent into repute. It is now proposed that if at the end of that period the patentee has achieved success and worked up a demand for his article in the Commonwealth, the patent shall be subject to revocation. A patent may be revoked before the patentee has been able to secure sufficient outlet to permit of his establishing works within the Commonwealth. I donot think that is a fair provision. Moreover, it is to be left to the Court to decide whether a patent can be commercially and profitably manufactured within the Commonwealth. That is a very delicate question to be decided by any court. </para>

        <para class="block">The patent may be essential to the carrying on of certain industries, and if the cost of manufacture is increased through the requirement that it shall be made within the Commonwealth serious injury may be inflicted. The decision of the Court may have the effect of impeding the progress of industry. If a patent were not manufactured in Australia, more than sufficient security would be given to the public, because any person could obtain the right to manufacture under a compulsory licence. I object to the provision in the first place, because there is no necessity for it; secondly, because the High Court would be called upon to settle very delicate and difficult questions; and thirdly, because it would operate, not only unjustly towards the patentees, but injuriously to the best interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>- I thoroughly sympathize with the views expressed by the honorable member for North Sydney. There are many classes of patented plant and machinery which must be obtained from abroad. For instance, the plant used in meat works is in nearly all cases imported from America. Most of the machinery has been patented in America, and is also protected by patent rights throughout Australia. The Americansare very sharp business people, and if they found it to their advantage to make this machinery in the Commonwealth they would do so apart from any legislation. If we enacted that all patented machinery should be made within the Commonwealth, we should practically prohibit the introduction of much valuable plant, and thus make a very grave mistake. If an attempt were made to manufacture within the Commonwealth all the machinery we required, the cost would be very largely increased, and I do not see that any good object would be served by passing the clause. </para>

            <para>- I cannot quite follow the modifications, because they do not appear in print. It would be difficult for me to conceive of any modifications that would remove the objections which I have to the clause. It seems to me that any such provision would result in increasing the cost of patented machinery, and that the effects would be the reverse of beneficial to our industries. In a great many instances patentees have been unable to get their patented articles manufactured within the Commonwealth except at a much greater expense. As has been already pointed out, the community is largely protected by the clauses to which the Committee agreed at a previous sitting. I therefore hope that the proposal of the Prime Minister will be rejected. </para>

          <para>That the House at its rising adjourn until Tuesday next, upon the understanding that on that day honorable members will come prepared to debate at once and finally the question of the proposed seat of government of the Commonwealth. Of course it will be impossible to take a vote upon the matter on Tuesday evening, but I trust there will be no delay upon any grounds whatever in arriving at a decision. I hope that the two questions - the method to be adopted in selecting the site, and the relative merits of the different sites - will be dealt with at once. </para>

            <para>- It may be necessary to adopt that coarse later, but it will not be necessary to do so upon the first night. If, in the meantime, honorable members will be good enough to address themselves to the information which is contained in the report which was circulated to-day they will be in a position to recommend to the House the sites which they feel they ought to recommend. When we commence to vote upon the sites, I hope it will be agreed that there shall be no more debate. </para>

              <para>- I am perfectly prepared to accept that responsibility, but do not think it would be a proper course to adopt in this case. No question of Ministerial prestige, influence, or any personal consideration whatever, should be involved in the determination of this question. I trust that honorable members will mark the order of their preference for the different sites, viewing the matter from an Australian stand-point. When we have decided the method of selection to be adopted, I trust that an exhaustive discussion will then take place upon the respective merits of the different sites, and that we shall then proceed to vote, vote, vote, until we have reached finality. If we mingle the two questions - that is to say, take a vote on one site and then have a discussion upon the merits of other sites, take another vote and have a further discussion - we shall never reach finality. But if honorable members will be content to at once debate the merits of the sites finally - and I trust that we shall have attentive Houses throughout -when the discussion is finished we ought to be in a position to vote and to continue voting until we get an absolute majority in favour of one site. </para>

I have had nothing to say so far in relation to this matter, but as one of the members of the Conference of Premiers at which it was agreed to insert the provision in the Constitution relating to the site of the capital, I feel that it is especially my duty to see that nothing is done to baulk the intention of the people as pronounced by their vote on the Constitution Bill. We have to think not only of New South Wales, but of Victoria, to both of whom we are pledged, and to both of whom, I hope, we shall show that we have the fullest intention to keep the bond. </para>

              <para>- Although there is nothing in the Constitution to show that we are pledged to Victoria, we. are indirectly pledged to her in so far as we have agreed that the capital site shall be not less than 100 miles from Sydney. I understand that that was a concession made to a feeling on the part of Victoria. </para>

            <para>- If there is one question more than another which ought to be considered when we are determining the site of the Federal Capital, it is the question of cost. But, so far as I have been able to discover, the papers which have been circulated give no estimate of what will be the cost of the Capital. I understand that the late Prime Minister, in reply to a deputation representing the Shire Councils of Victoria which recently waited upon him, stated that the cost would not exceed &#163;500,000; but in the course of the discussion of this question which took place on a motion submitted to the House some days ago, it was said that it would be &#163;10,000,000. That estimate was generally accepted. I should like the Treasurer to give us an estimate of what the cost is likely to be before we are asked to decide this question. It would be very unfair to call upon honorable members to make a selection in the absence of information as to whether the cost will be &#163;500,000, &#163;10,000,000, or more. The question of cost will certainly affect my vote. If the cost is to amount to &#163;10,000,000,I do not think that we should at present select a site, and that is the position which many honorable members may take up. I would ask the Prime Minister to say whether it is not possible to put before the House a definite statement as to the expenditure to be incurred, and how the necessary funds are to be raised. It will be difficult for us to determine the site of the Capital next week, unless we know how the necessary funds are to be raised. I do not think that we could now provide &#163;10,000,000 for such a work, and I trust that before a selection is made the Treasurer will furnish us with an. estimate of the cost. Unless he does so we shall be very much in the dark in deciding this question. </para>

            <para>. - The only bearing which the question of expense at this stage can have upon the proposals to be submitted to the House next week is in so far as it relates to the consideration whether the Federal buildings would cost more at one site than at another. Some people speak anxiously of the cost of the Federal Capital ; but that depends upon what it will comprise. It may consist merely of two simple Chambers in which Parliament will meet, with the necessary Government offices, and, somewhere near at hand, accommodation for. honorable members. Those buildings may be constructed of any material. They may be of the utmost simplicity, or they may be designed to last for any time. The question of what shall be spent upon the capital will rest entirely with the people of Australia and their representatives. The representatives of the people will spend as little or as much as the people please to authorize ; but no one can now offer a precise opinion that would be worthy of a moment&#39;s consideration as to the actual cost of the capital until we have determined its size, its area, the nature of its buildings, the date at which we shall go there, the water supply, temporary or permanent, to he obtained, and the communication, if any, to be established. Each of these items requires to be considered before we come to any estimate of cost. </para>

We have information bearing upon that point as well as general information as to the cost of providing a water supply. The site, however, will be selected without reference to the kind of Federal city which is to be erected upon it. The question whether it shall be of the bark -hut order of architecture, or consist of marble halls, will rest with the people. The only matter to be determined next week is where the Federal city - whatever it is, and whenever it is to be occupied - shall be. </para>

              <para>- These are at present all secondary considerations. Once we have determined where the capital shall be, we shall have to consider its area and the land to be taken over, the date of occupation, the question of water supply, the means of communication, and a variety of other issues. But we must first fix the site of the capital. The question to be determined next week is where the capital shall be. Once we have dealt with that matter we shall be on the high road to a full and free discussion upon the other issues. </para>

              <para>- It can have only an indirect bearing on the general question of the site. We surely cannot commence to debate the question whether we shall take over 1 00 or 1,000 square miles before we decide where the capital shall be? Having determined that question with some regard to all these other matters, but without attempting to finally dispose of them, we shall have to consider what we are to spend upon the capital, and when and how we shall expend it. </para>

          <para>Mr.DEAKIN.- That is possible, although very improbable. The honorable member for Canobolas inquired for certain information as to the minutes of the meetings of the Commission of Experts, and, in accordance with the promise of the late Prime Minister, I shall have them laid on the table of the House when they are procured. </para>
