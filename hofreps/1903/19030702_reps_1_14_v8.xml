                        <para>- I find that there is a great discrepancy between the new Federal rolls for Western Australia and the State rolls which were compiled on 31st December last. The complaints made by representatives of other States are as to the difference between the census figures and the number of electors on the Federal rolls ; but in this case the discrepancy is between the State rolls recently compiled and the Federal rolls. In the electorate of South Perth, a district in which names of electors can easily be collected, there are 1,937 less electors upon the Federal rolls than upon the State rolls. I desire to ask the Minister for Home Affairs if he has any information on the subject. </para>

                        <para>- I have not received the information to which the honorable member refers, and I shall not be able to check the differences between the newly- compiled Federal rolls and the State rolls collected in December last, until I have the full details. I can, however, inform the honorable member that the Federal rolls are complete, and show a total of 116,000 electors. Yesterday a telegram was sent to the Electoral Commissioner, giving him the quota, and instructing him to proceed at once with the division of the State into electorates. </para>

                    <para>- Order ! In view of the confusion that sometimes exists in the House, I really must direct the attention of honorable members to the fact that interjections across the chamber, and conversations having no reference to the subject upon which an honorable member is addressing the Chair, are distinctly disorderly, and that I shall have to take notice of them unless they are discontinued. </para>

                    <para>- I think that honorable members should have an opportunity of considering the speech of the Prime Minister upon the second reading. I would remind him that he asked honorable members to suspend their judgment with regard to some aspects of the matter until they had heard his statement. I am suspending my judgment accordingly, and I hope that we shall be allowed a few days, indeed, I should say a week, in which to consider the Prime Minister's speech ; because we really have not time during sitting days to read ahead of the work under consideration. The days upon which Parliament does not sit, when, according to some authorities, honorable members are supposed to be idle, are fully occupied in preparing for the legislative work which will engage their attention at a later stage. </para>

                        <para>- In answer to what has been said, I desire to point out that the papers relating to this matter were circulated not later than the 23rd June - some nine days ago. Of course, cases will always arise in which honorable members do not receive their papers, and I know that it is the habit of many of us to occasionally forget some documents which may have been circulated amongst the great bulk of parliamentary papers. But the papers relating to the proposed naval agreement were circulated in the ordinary way. I would further point out that the proposed agreement has already been the subject of very full discussion out of doors. Not only have many honorable members participated in that discussion, but I myself have done my best to give detailed explanations of its provisions in public. Moreover, on the address in. reply, some honorable members debated the question in a cursory way, whilst others dealt with it much more fully. The matter, therefore, has been the subject of very thorough discussion. Indeed, if I may trespass on the recollection of honorable members, it has been debated quite as much as has any ordinary measure which has come before this Parliament. The second reading debate upon the Bill is not likely to be concluded in one night, and therefore those who wish to speak upon it after Tuesday will have ample opportunity of so doing. Seeing that the papers were laid upon the table on the 26th or the 27th May, and were circulated nine days ago - the Printing Committee having exercised its undoubted powers to order the printing of documents in their regular order - my view is that we ought to proceed to debate the Bill, after I have moved its second reading upon Tuesday next. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly I did, but in doing so I was asking for the ordinary privilege which any Minister in charge of a Bill is entitled to claim. My statement clearly did not imply that delay would take place after the second reading of the measure had been moved. I merely asked honorable members not to commit themselves to a particular course of action until they had heard some argument upon the subject. Seeing that the papers have been laid on the table and printed, and that the contents of the agreement have been thoroughly discussed, all I can do is to adduce arguments in addition to those which I have already put forward. This resolution is simply the ordinary procedure which must be adopted in the case of a Bill involving expenditure. Such measures must be preceded by a resolution in Committee. When we emerge from Committee I propose to introduce the Bill, have it read a first time, and fix the second reading for Tuesday next. I am quite sure that there will be some honorable members who will be ready to continue the discussion on that day, so that no time will be lost, whilst others who wish to speak upon a later date will be able to do so. Inasmuch as the motion relating to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill cannot be taken until Tuesday, and as that day can be occupied in debating this Bill, it is only fair that it should be so occupied, without prejudice to the rights of speech of any honorable member who may wish to address the House at a later stage. </para>

                    <para>- I cannot agree with the principles laid down by my right honorable friend, who is so sound a constitutionalist. Indeed, I am surprised at his attitude. This matter is not constitutionally before the House until the responsible Minister has made his statement in regard to it. No matter what discussion has taken place in. the country - a discussion which occurred before many honorable members had the official documents in their hands - this House has an undoubted right, upon every important measure which is submitted to it by a responsible Minister, to have a full and comprehensive statement of its principles and its contents put before it. I do not think that any honorable member should be forced to deliver himself upon this important subject on the night of the Prime Minister's statement. </para>

                        <para>- I asked my right honorable friend a very simple question. I asked whether, in view of the fact that he did not intend to make his statement at this stage of the proceedings, he would give honorable members an interval for consideration after he had moved the second reading of the Bill ? In view of the immense importance of this subject, which is an Imperial one, and upon which our attitude will be watched at the other end of the world, I think that the proper course to adopt would be for the Prime Minister, when moving the second reading of the Bill, to make as ample and complete a statement as possible, and then postpone its further consideration until another day. </para>

                    <para>- I confess that at first I was inclined to agree with the view entertained by the honorable member for Wentworth, but I understand from the Prime Minister that the Bill merely validates the agreement which has already been circulated amongst honorable members. Although I admit that it is usual upon an important measure to interpose an interval during which honorable members may consider the second-reading speech of the Minister, I would point out that we have all the necessary materials before us if the Bill merely proposes to validate the naval agreement. In view of the Prime Minister's assurance, I do not think it is unreasonable for him to ask that the debate shall proceed upon Tuesday next. A further delay would be likely to inconvenience the Ministry. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the Prime Minister has given the very best reason why the debate upon the Bill which is the subject of this resolution should not be proceeded with on Tuesday after the right honorable gentleman has moved its second reading. He has just stated that the discussion of a matter of such importance cannot be finished in a single day. Therefore, honorable members should be allowed an interval in which to consider his speech. I would press upon him the importance of granting an adjournment of the debate for at least twenty-four or forty-eight hours. We cannot anticipate his remarks upon this subject. If he could make a statement now, and foreshadow the substance of his speech upon Tuesday next, we should be in a slightly different position, &gt; and might perhaps be disposed to assist him in endeavouring to continue the discussion of the Bill upon that day. But, whilst Parliament is sitting, it is impossible to consider prospective legislation. Under this Bill we shall be, asked to vote a subsidy of £200,000 for naval defence. I need scarcely point out that that sum may prove altogether inadequate for the purpose if a tariff war is to be entered upon by Great Britain at the behest of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> and his party. If a fiscal fight is undertaken, it may lead to an industrial struggle which will involve the Empire in war. Therefore, it might be that honorable members would be prepared to vote for the expenditure of £2,000,000, or, perhaps, £8,000,000 or £10,000,000, to prepare us for the consequences that may result from a tariff war. I will continue my remarks when the standing order which provides that not more than one speaker shall simultaneously address the Chamber is observed. </para>

I was pointing out that we might have to consider whether we would not be justified in voting a very much larger sum than is contemplated if an industrial struggle is to be entered upon, and that the serious consequences that might result from the war, which will inevitably follow that struggle, ought to be taken into consideration by us. When honorable members reflect upon those consequences they will see that we have every right to ask the Prime Minister to grant us a sufficient interval in which to carefully consider his speech. I support the request of the honorable member for Wentworth, and if it is not to be complied with, I hold that the Prime Minister should make his statement now. </para>

                    <para>- I thoroughly understand that the proper time for honorable members to object to the discussion upon the Naval Agreement Bill being proceeded with is when the second reading motion is submitted. But I would point out that it might then be too late to adopt that attitude. If the Government insist upon proceeding with the second reading debate of the Bill after the Prime Minister has delivered his speech, we cannot press the matter to a division, because, by so doing, we should be attempting to take the control of the business out of the hands of the Government. I strongly urge that, inasmuch as it is desirable to get on with the business as quickly as possible, we might have the discussion on the second reading of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill after the speech of the Prime Minister on Tuesday. </para>

                        <para>- I take it that with the permission of the House the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill could be introduced to-day if necessary, and advanced another stage on Tuesday. There are many ways which could be adopted, if it is desired to get over the difficulty. It may be that the Government are not prepared to proceed with the Bill, but it is a measure of great importance, on which there will, doubtless, be much discussion, and taking into consideration the fact that the Prime Minister has already dealt with the matter to some extent, it would be unfair to ask honorable members to continue the discussion immediately he has concluded his statement. Honorable members may be prepared with ordinary second-reading speeches, but not with replies to the particular remarks which the Prime Minister may make ; the discussion ought to be adjourned for a day or two in order that the Bill may be given the fullest possible consideration. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps I may make myself a little clearer by adding a few words. It has been suggested in so many words that the Government wish to force honorable members into discussing the Bill. Nothing is further from the desire of the Government. But it is not right to lay down the principle that because the subject matter of a Bill is of importance, there should in all cases be an adjournment of the discussion. An adjournment depends very much on the stage to which the discussion of the principle involved in any particular measure has been advanced. If discussion has reached an advanced stage - that is to say, if it has been general and public to a large extent - there is not the same reason for asking for an adjournment that there otherwise might be. Of course the Government cannot listen to any proposal to take the conduct of business out of their hands, but I suggest that, without any forcing at all, those who are ready to continue the second reading debate on Tuesday may be permitted to make their speeches. If nobody is ready to go on, nobody will be forced to do so, and there will be an adjournment of the debate ; but if anybody is ready, why should there be any organized attempt - though I do not think there is any such attempt - to prevent an honorable member from delivering his speech if he desires to do so? That is the perfect understanding so far as I am concerned, and it does not alter one jot anything I had already said. I shall move the second reading, and those honorable members who are ready and willing to proceed with the debate may then make their speeches. When we come to a stage at which no honorable member is ready to continue the debate, and a desire is shown for more time for consideration, then an adjournment may be granted. To ask any honorable member to speak unprepared is far from my thoughts, and I do not intend to take any such course. The Bill consists simply of the. short title, a ratification of the agreement in so many words, and a clause appropriating the necessary money, the rest being the schedule containing the agreement. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think there is any such reference in the White Book. As I have previously informed the honorable and learned member, I have already tried to obtain leave to publish the White Book, but I am met with what I think must be conceded to be the reasonable objection that where a discussion has taken place on the condition that it is not a public discussion, there must be the consent of all concerned to make the report public. I am very willing to have every bit of the White Book published, but I cannot have it published in defiance of the objection which has been already acceded to by the President of the Conference, the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Let me repeat that there will be no attempt to force honorable members to continue the discussion on Tuesday. Those who are ready and willing may speak, but when it is found that no one is ready to continue the discussion, unless he is reluctantly driven to do so, without preparation, I must give in to an objection raised on that score, and consent to an adjournment. I hope that on that understanding the Bill may be considered on Tuesday. </para>

                <para class="block">It is a remarkable thing that because a man happens to be a member of the military or naval forces of the Commonwealth, he cannot successfully prosecute in the law courts a claim against the Department in which he serves. Only three weeks ago in Sydney the leader of the Opposition, when appearing for a defendant, found that his client could not maintain his rights upon a contract admitted by the Crown, because he was a soldier, and the contract had arisen in connexion with his position as a soldier. Last night in speaking upon this matter, I referred from memory to the case of <inline font-style="italic">Gillespie</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Queen,</inline> which was decided in the Supreme Court of Victoria in December, 1896. Ever since that time, I have been trying to obtain justice for the petitioner and a number of others interested with him, but without avail. I hope, however, that this Commonwealth Parliament, " broad based upon the people's will," will see that justice is not denied to men in a particular service upon purely technical grounds. I brought the matter forward when the Claims Against the Commonwealth Bill was under consideration, and the Attorney-General then asked me to give him, in writing, a statement of the case I did so, and received, of course, a courteous acknowledgment of my letter, but nothing more. If the honorable and learned gentlemen, however, will not accept my amendment, I must ask the Committee to pass it in spite of him. I am unable to give the details of the recent Sydney case, but it is practically on all-fours with the Victorian case. The heading of the case in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus LawReports,</inline> . vol. 2, contains the following : - </para>
                <para>The petitioner, a soldier in the Victorian Military Forces, accepted an offer, under a General Order, to resign on receipt of six months' "salary." <inline font-style="italic">Held</inline> that upon the wording of the offer, "salary" included the 3s. 3d. per diem " pay" to which the soldier was entitled under the regulations of 22nd June, 1891, and also the 9d. per diem to which ho was, under such regulations, entitled "in lieu of rations." </para>
                <para>But <inline font-style="italic">Held</inline> that agreements between Her Majesty and Her Military Forces in Victoria are not enforceable against Her Majesty, and that the petitioner was consequently not entitled to succeed in proceedings to recover the 9d. per diem in lieu of rations, which had been excluded in the computation of the six months' "salary." </para>
                <para class="block">The Chief Justice, after hearing the evidence which was taken during the trial, which lasted a couple of days, said that no doubt the bargain was made that the men concerned should receive 4s. per diem, and not 3s. 3d. He proceeded, however, to quote the rule in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Mitchell</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Queen,</inline> which, he said, laid it down in language as general as could be that - </para>

Anything that Her Majesty appears to promise to a soldier is merely a matter of her bounty to give or withhold as she thinks fit. Her Majesty being naturally disposed to do what is right, and to refrain scrupulously from doing what is wrong, the anticipation is that Her Majesty will keep her word, out she cannot be compelled to do so. </para>

State is a party, the rights of parties shall' as nearly as possible be the same ; but that confers no new rights. The honorable member has shown by his arguments that he is proposing to confer a new right. It was owing to the force of the arguments, addressed to the Committee with reference to Part V. of the Bill by the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and the honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> that some doubt was. raised as to whether one or two of the clauses came within the scope of the measure, and partly for that reason, and partly because they can be more conveniently associated with provisions of the Judiciary Bill, they have been embodied in that measure, which confers powers. A provision such as that, proposed by the honorable and learned member for Corio might be inserted in the Defence Bill or perhaps in the Judiciary Bill, but it could not well be included within a Bill dealing solely with the machinery of the High Court. I therefore suggest to my honorable and learned friend that however great the merits of his proposal may be, and however marked the grievance which he seeks to redress, he must necessarily postpone his proposal. </para>

                    <para>- So far as I have been able to make up my mind, I feel very strongly disposed to agree with the honorable and learned member for Corio on the merits of the case he has submitted. I do not see any reason why a soldier should not have his rights conserved in the same way as other people, but I do not think that we can deal with the subject in this Bill. The rights of soldiers should be properly denned in the Defence Bill, and the honorable and learned member will have an opportunity of" making his proposal when that measure comes under consideration. He would not carry the matter any further if he succeeded on this occasion. To enact that the fact of a man being a soldier shall not take away from him any rights will not- confer any new rights upon him. At present a soldier has no rights of contract with the King. It has been decided in Victoria that a soldier is bound to serve for the time for which he Ls engaged, but that he can be discharged whenever the Crown thinks fit, and that any regulations made as to his rate of pay do not amount to a contract that he shall receive that rate. The amendment proposed by the honorable and learned member would really be an anomaly in a Bill relating to the procedure to be followed in the Federal High Court in respect to rights which exist independently. </para>

There is an important distinction between the Commonwealth and the Executive in regard to the military.
