                    <para>- I desire to say in connexion with this clause that I trust that it will be one of the most actively administered in the whole measure. As I said last session, in the debate upon the second reading of the Defence Bill then introduced, it seems to me that in a properly organized system of cadet corps we have the solution of the difficulty which confronts those administering the Department of Defence, because such a system will provide for the proper preliminary discipline and training of Our youths, so that when they join the defence forces of the Commonwealth, the limited time at their disposal for military exercises may be devoted to thoroughly practical field work and instruction. Of course, to make our cadet system effective, the Commonwealth authorities will require the hearty cooperation of the authorities of the States. In addition to the advantages which may be secured in the way I have stated, there are the moral and physical benefits which will accrue to the rising generation. I believe that the Minister is in sympathy with the idea, and I look forward with great hope to the advantages which will be derived from its execution. </para>

                    E. GROOM (Darling Downs).I echo the remarks of the honorable and learned member for Corinella, but I desire also to suggest to the Minister an extension of the cadet system. Honorable members will notice that Part V. deals only with military cadets, and I wish to so amend this clause that it shall provide that the Governor-General may establish and maintain naval as well as military cadet corps. There are in existence in Queensland at the present time several naval cadet corps, and the Naval Commandant, Captain Creswell, has very highly commended their work. In a recent report he states that he was originally opposed to the idea that naval cadet corps had any value, but that, after having seen their work, and having taken them to sea. in one of the gunboats, he has come to entertain a very high opinion of their possibilities. In Brisbane and various coastal towns in Queensland - and I suppose it is the same in all the coastal towns of the Commonwealth - boys at even an earlier age than twelve years go in greatly &#39;for boating, which is one of their most popular pastimes. An inherent love for the sea exists in them, and it has been found that when they are organized into cadet corps they soon attain a high standard of efficiency. We recently passed a Bill the object of which is to encourage our people to take an interest in naval matters, and, that being so, we cannot commence too early to instil into the minds of the boys of the Commonwealth a liking for the work of naval defence. I do not wish to refer at length to the value of military and naval training for our young people, because the facts are sufficiently patent to all. To secure the object which I have in view, I intend to move the insertion, after the word &#34; maintain,&#34; line 2, of the words &#34; military and naval.&#34;

                        <para>- I quite understand that to make the system effective he must obtain from Parliament a much larger vote for the purpose than he has received up to the present time. In the Estimates now before us the quite inadequate sum of &#163;5,220 is set down for the cadet corps of the various States, and I therefore intend to ask, when the proper opportunity occurs, that the amount be increased. The honorable and learned member for Corinella has indicated the advantages which are to be derived from giving as much encouragement as possible to the cadet system. On Wednesday evening the honorable and learned member for West Sydney very strongly urged that every citizen should be compulsorily instructed for a term of years in the art of warfare. I must confess that I had a great deal of sympathy with his proposition, because I believe that the imprimatur of citizenship should be a man&#39;s ability to use his rifle in defence of his country when necessary. But the scheme proposed by my honorable and learned friend was, in my opinion, unnecessarily expensive and impractical. It is, however, possible to give practical effect to his views by the military instruction of the boys in our various State schools. I hold that not only will the giving of such instruction prove of great advantage to the Commonwealth, but that it will have a good effect upon the moral and physical condition of the boys themselves which will be of advantage to them all through their future lives. The Minister, of course, must have the co-operation of the States authorities, and&#39; so far as Victoria at least is concerned, where the cadet movement was originated by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood, he will have the heartiest cooperation. </para>

                        <para>- I know that they do not now get the necessary encouragement, but I hold &#34;that every boy who is physically capable should be required to attend military drill, and to learn how to handle a rifle. Of course, the younger boys cannot carry heavy rifles, but light and useful weapons could be placed in their&#39; hands. I feel the more that is done in this direction the more effect will be given to the underlying principle of the Bill, which is dependence for defence upon our citizen soldiery. Honorable members must be so well aware of the advantages of the cadet system as to make it quite unnecessary for me to labour the matter by quoting facts and figures. I will, however, point out that the General Officer Commanding has a very high opinion of the value of the cadet system for the future recruiting of our defence forces. Referring to the good effects of military discipline and training upon the rising generation, he recommends that the system which has proved so valuable in Victoria should be extended throughout the Commonwealth. I hope that the Minister will regard the amendment with favour. </para>

                    COOK (Parramatta).I agree very much with what has been said by the honorable member, but I do not see that the amendment would carry us much further. I do not think that any good purpose would be served by the substitution of the word &#34; shall &#34; for &#34;may,&#34; because the Minister would not be compelled to do anything more than is being at present done. In all the States of the Commonwealth there are thousands of cadets, and in New South Wales we have a large number who are receiving excellent instruction. At the same time, I think that very much .more encouragement should be given to the system. If the honorable member formulates a definite scheme for the improvement of the present system, which can be carried out at reasonable cost, I shall give him my support. The proposed mandate would be complied with if one corps of cadets were maintained in each of the States, instead of the large number of corps we have at present.

                    <para>- I hope we shall not drift into a general discussion as to whether the adoption of the cadet system has been justified, or whether it shall be further extended. We are all agreed that experience has shown that there is no- better method of laying the foundation of an effective defence force than the training of school boys to the use of arms, and I think that if sub-clause (3) were made mandatory it would have more effect than the amendment proposed. The cadet system has flourished in spite of discouragement. It owes its success largely to the enthusiasm of the lads father than to any special assistance received . from the authorities. </para>

                <para class="block">InVictoria the cadets were first placed under the Education Department, and they were then fairly well looked after. But when they were subjected to direct military control they were not supplied with the arms and ammunition necessary for their proper training. In addition to that, they have been to a large extent discouraged by the refusal of the Defence Department, under the present Minister, to supply them with railway passes to enable them to travel from one district to another to take part in rifle competitions. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of the practice which obtained. One of the most efficient cadet corps in Victoria belonged to the Echuca district, and the boys travelled to various parts of Victoria and carried off the chief prizes offered for efficiency in rifle shooting. All such lads should be encouraged, because the experience gained in travelling about cultivates the quality of self-reliance, and fits them to take responsible positions in after life. Above all, they should be supplied with arms and ammunition. The parents already supply the uniforms, and it is of no use to ask them to provide rifles and ammunition also, because in many cases they are unable to afford it. Moreover, it is the duty of the State to give the lads an opportunity to obtain that instruction which will decrease the ultimate cost of military training. The very best men who were sent from Victoria to South Africa were those who had passed through the cadet corps. I hope that the Minister will be more sympathetic with the cadet corps, and that he will see that they are supplied with proper arms and a full supply of ammunition. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the idea of the honorable member for Kooyong has been rather misunderstood by the honorable member for Parramatta, and that it has not been generally grasped by the Committee. The amendment would not achieve the object which - the honorable member, has in view. It is intended to test the feeling of the Committee upon the question whether it should be made compulsory for all boys between the ages of twelve and eighteen to become members of cadet corps. I do not approve of that proposal for several reasons. In the first place, the Committee has already decided that compulsion should not be applied to youths between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one, and I fail to see why we should approve of it in relation to younger boys. Another objection to the proposal seems to me to be fatal. If we apply compulsion to these youths we shall have to provide them with arms and uniforms. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Kooyong stated that his object was to invite a general discussion on the question, and I understand that the purport of his proposal is as I have described. Whilst&#39; thoroughly sympathizing with the idea of extending the usefulness of cadet corps, I think that we should go too far if we compelled all boys to join them. </para>

                    <para>- A large number of parents strongly object to many of the features of the present system. It would be far preferable if the boys were under the supervision of the Education Department, and direct association with military administration were avoided. There are many objections urged against permitting cadets to go into general military camps. The moral tone of the community was seriously lowered by the low &#34;jingo&#34; songs which were prevalent when the war spirit was rampant some little time ago. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It may be very amusing to honorable members to hear my complaint, but I seriously contend that such songs do not exercise an elevating influence upon our Australian youth. I know of a large number of lads who would have liked to join the cadet corps, but their parents were not in a position to buy uniforms for them. Does the honorable member for Kooyong propose that the whole of the boys should be supplied with uniforms, or that some should appear in uniforms and others in ordinary dress ; or does he propose to abolish uniforms altogether <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I hope that this matter will not be rushed, and that the Minister will not be led to incur a large expenditure in carrying out what is at best a doubtful experiment. </para>

                    WILLIS (Robertson).The honorable member for Laanecoorie has delivered a most interesting speech with reference to what has been accomplished by the cadet system in the past. I see an objection to the substitution of the word proposed by .the honorable member for Kooyong, even if it has not the effect which was pointed out by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie. The clause in its present form merely means that boys may continue in cadet corps after they have quitted school and until they are competent to join the higher branches of the military forces. Of course they will be equipped, but, until we vote a sufficient sum of money to provide for a huge force, there is no danger whatever of the scheme involving too large an expenditure. In Melbourne, during the Ducal visit, a magnificent display was made by the cadets, although the annual expenditure upon them by this State represents only about &#163;1,300. Similarly in Sydney the members of that force make a formidable muster. I think that the idea embodied in the clause is an excellent one. I trust that the honorable member for Kooyong will not press his amendment. If he does so, I shall be obliged to vote for the clause in its present form.

                    <para>- I think that the Minister would expedite the course of business if at this stage he made a statement as to the Government policy in regard to this matter. It seems to me that the end which the honorable member for Kooyong has in view is a considerable extension of the cadet system, which is a very laudable object. But I would point out to him that one of the most effective ways of accomplishing his purpose would be to move, when the Estimates are under consideration, that 10 per cent, of the total expenditure upon military defence in time of peace shall be allocated to fostering that force. We should then be in a position to insure the proper training and equipment of its members. Hitherto, most of the cadet corps have been trained in the State-schools of the Commonwealth, and the teachers have acted as their instructors. </para>

If one or more of the States chose to say to the Minister - &#34; None of our teachers shall be allowed to train the cadets in military drill,&#34; what would be his position ? That is why I am exceedingly anxious that the right honorable gentleman should make a statement of Ministerial policy upon the matter. </para>

                    <para>- I am glad that this discussion has taken place, because it confirms the opinion which I have always held that one of the best things we can do for the youth of this country, is to drill them, so as to make them familiar wit military evolutions and the use of the rifle. Such a course of training also materially improves a- boy&#39;s physique. It teaches him to walk erect, as if he was not ashamed to look his fellows in the face. I think that the cadet movement is capable of conferring an immense amount of good upon the youth of this country. The reason why the Government have done nothing in the direction of encouraging that movement is that we have lacked a uniform statute which would be applicable to the whole of Australia. I ha.ve, however, made some representations to the State authorities upon the matter, and have found them very willing indeed to assist us. If we can arrange for the State school teachers to become drill instructors to the cadets, the scheme will work very smoothly. I do not think that it will cost very much. It has not done so in Victoria. Last year the expenditure upon the cadet force in this State was only &#163;1,300. I think that the drilling of the boys should be under the control of the Military Department, but there is no reason why the State school teachers should not receive an honorarium for performing the duties of drill instructors. </para>

                        <para>- That is what I should like to do, but in some schools the teachers might not be competent to undertake the work. I do not think that any one desires to see a compulsory cadet system introduced. I believe that nine- tenths of the boys will be only too glad to avail themselves of any opportunities for being drilled that may be presented to them. I repeat that in the past our chief difficulty has been the absence of a uniform statute throughout Australia. When that obstacle is overcome we shall be in a position to submit some scheme to every Education Department in the Commonwealth. Thus, we hope to bring about uniformity in the training of the cadets. Personally, I have always favoured the drilling of our youth. By undertaking the task we shall confer a great benefit upon the lads themselves, besides doing something of national advantage in the time of emergency. I shall be very glad to accede to the request of the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs to make this part of the Bill applicable to naval as well as military cadets. I am also prepared to agree with the suggestion of the honorable and learned member for Corinella to increase the age limit from eighteen to nineteen years. I am informed that in Victoria there are 4 19 senior cadets, and 3,950 junior cadets. The senior cadets have 450 Martini- Enfield rifles, and the juniors 376 Martini-Enfield, and 4,270 Francotte rifles. </para>

                    <para>- I intend to support the clause. At Cobar, in, my electorate, there is a public officer who is enthusiastic in his desire to instruct the youth of the country in the rudiments of military drill. In that town quite a number of lads, after they had left school, desired to continue under his tuition, but we could get absolutely no help from the Department. We applied for assistance, but were referred by the Military Department to the Education Department. I attempted to obtain a supply of dummy rifles to enable the youths to be drilled in the use of arms. In this effort, however, I was unsuccessful, although the whole enterprise was to be carried out by means of local funds, and without any cost to the State. </para>

                <para class="block">I am not making any complaint, because I am willing to recognise existing conditions, and the explanation which the Minister has just given to the Committee was furnished to me a day or two ago. These youths, who will now come under sub-clause (2), afford abundant material for strengthening the military forces of the future, and if, instead of adopting a policy of red tape, the Department gives them some freedom, the system will be of great benefit. The headmaster of a State school is not always ready to continue to drill boys after they have left school, but if he is a military man he has the work at heart, and is always prepared to do so. Therefore, I think that the Minister should provide some allowance for such men. There are other cases in which ladies have charge of country schools. They are excellent teachers, but, while some of them can drill their pupils, we could not expect them to take up this work. It often happens, however, that there are private citizens ready, from a pure love of the movement, to drill boys after they have left school, and I believe that this system can be materially extended. Every advantage is enjoyed by the boys in the large cities, but scarcely a.ny consideration is given either by the Education Department or the Defence Department to boys living in country towns. This kind of work is a source of pleasure in country districts, and I think that we ought to do something to extend the movement. When visiting Cobar recently with other honorable members, we were met at the station by these boys. They were headed by a band, and constituted practically a guard of honour. As a matter of fact, these corps receive no encouragement whatever from the Department. The supply of rifles is hot only very important, but involves considerable expenditure. We must remember that the boys who will come under sub-clause (2) are rapidly approaching manhood, and that many of them will subsequently join our rifle clubs. I therefore suggest that, instead of arming them with the ordinary small cadet rifles, we should supply them with the weapons which they will use when they become members of those clubs. They are quite old enough to take care of them. If we adopted this practice, we should obtain efficiency at a minimum of cost. We should also have an increased supply of arms, and a large body of trained riflemen available if Russia or some other power invaded our shores. In New South Wales the cadets start with the use of dummies, and as they grow older are supplied with rifles. </para>

                        <para>- They are well provided for. We should give the elder boys rifles which they would be able to use when they entered the rifle clubs, from which we shall hereafter draw much of our fighting strength. As an insurance against invasion, I think that this is a direction in which we might well spend some money. I feel inclined to agree to a vote for these two branches, because I think they offer all the advantages to which reference has been made. I trust that full attention will be given to the country districts, for the cities can well take care of themselves. </para>

                    <para>- I have known this question to be raised again and again during the consideration of the Defence Estimates in the New South Wales Legislature, and, although the Ministry have been entirely in sympathy with the proposal, the Estimates have been passed, without any understanding being arrived at, and nothing more has been done. Unless we obtain some more tangible result when the Defence Estimates are before us, we shall probably find ourselves next year in the position that we are in to-day. I know that the Minister for Defence is in sympathy with the cadet movement, and has every desire to fall in with the wishes which honorable members have expressed this morning. I find, however, that the sum set apart on the Estimates for cadets is only &#163;4,743. That does not represent one per cent, of the proposed expenditure upon the military forces, and I contend that it is wholly, insufficient. If we are going to train our youths, and if, as the Minister says, they will learn as cadets the value of obedience and discipline, surely we should be prepared to do something more for this movement. If, in this way, we are to secure a reserve force which will be available in the hour of &#39; need, should we not consent to a further expenditure? Unless we propose to throw on the parents themselves the expense of training the cadets, it is absurd for us to expect to obtain efficiency as the result of such an insignificant outlay. We are familiar with the history of the cadet movement in New South Wales. The honorable member for Darling has already told the Committee of the progress which it has made in the country districts. At Milton, in my own constituency, a cadet corps has been formed, and everything connected with its establishment and maintenance has been provided by the parents of the boys. A few days ago, however, when a request was made for the supply of ammunition for the use of the corps, the reply was received that the General did hot consider that the time was ripe for granting such an application. </para>

                        <para>- If Major-General Hutton is in sympathy with the movement, instead of giving expression to the opinion I have mentioned, he should have said that provision would be made for the supply of ammunition as soon as the money was available. It seems to me that there is an inclination on the part of those in authority to endeavour in every way to &#39; scotch &#39;: the citizen soldier movement. The first step towards the creation of a citizen soldiery is the training of our boys, and then our young men, in military tactics. Whilst I would go so far as to&#62; make the system compulsory, I do not think it is necessary to do so. If some consideration is given to the existing cadet corps, and to proposals to establish new ones, we shall find all the boys ready and willing to join in the movement. But some provision must be made for the supply of rifles, uniform, and ammunition to them, and in my opinion the sum - proposed to be set apart for this purpose on the Estimates for the current year is wholly inadequate. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the question. No difficulty will be experienced in carrying out this scheme. Honorable members know that numerous applications for the establishment of cadet corps are before the Department, and although the military instinct is not unduly evident in my own constituency applications from all parts of it have been sent in. This is a very important question from the military stand-point, and it is for the Minister, who is in sympathy with the proposal, to inform us how we can best emphasize our opinion that the provision proposed to be made is wholly insufficient. </para>

                        <para>- Having regard to the staff expenses and the amount proposed to be set apart for this purpose, he does not appear to be. Recently the General Officer Commanding visited Bathurst in order to review some troops. The whole ceremony was not likely to occupy more than twenty minutes, but he found it necessary to have half-a-dozen staff officers in attendance, and to incur expense in other ways. Nevertheless we are told that that system cannot be cut down. Side by side with the large expenditure on the staff we find a proposal to expend &#163;4,743 on the cadet corps of Australia. The whole thing is absurd, and I intend to deal trenchantly with the question when the Estimates are before us. I give the General notice in advance, so that he may be prepared, through the Minister, to answer our complaints. There is too much glory and glitter about these men, and the sooner we clip the wings of those who think that the military system is to be run by a highly-paid staff, and that nothing whatever is to be done for the cadet and other forces in country districts, the better it will be. I am for a citizen soldiery, but we are not acting in a way that will encourage the movement. The honorable member for Port Melbourne may laugh, but in New South Wales this is regarded as a serious matter. Those at the head of defence matters seem to think that they can ride rough-shod over the people, but we will show them that they cannot. </para>

                    <para>- While I am unable to emulate the honorable member for Melbourne Ports in the giving of information to the Committee as to the lyrical tastes of the rising generation, I desire to point out that, in my opinion, it would be better if the junior members of our cadet forces were kept apart from the present military organization. There is in Great Britain a cadet system which I think we might advantageously follow in that respect. There they have what are called boys&#39; brigades, and the testimony is general that the operation of the system has been very beneficial, as regards both the physical and moral effect of the discipline to which the children are subjected. </para>

                        <para>- The system originated largely under the wing of certain churches, but it has since been considerably extended. We can hardly over-estimate the value to boys, and even to girls, of a thoroughly effective system of discipline and physical instruction, and the work of giving such instruction is such as ought to be taken in hand by the Defence Department, even if the children are not directly members of our defence forces. I have been very pleased to see the way in which the cadet system has developed in Victoria, though it has certain defects which militate against its complete adoption. There is, for instance, the cost of the uniforms, which is a very serious thing to the parents of the poorer children. What I suggest is the adoption of a simple uniform, consisting, perhaps, of an easy fitting tunic, which could be drawn over the ordinary clothes, and secured at the waist by a belt, together with a cap. The present uniform tends to make the boys ridiculous. I have walked behind some of these small military men, equipped in absurd imitation of adult soldiers, and they have appeared to me almost grotesque. </para>

My suggestion is the adoption of a cheap and distinctive uniform for the whole Commonwealth, which could be procured at the minimum of cost, and would give the children, when at drill, that appearance which is so desirable.

                    <para>- I think that sufficient indication has been given to the Minister by the various speakers who have preceded me of the desire of the Committee that the cadet system shall be encouraged. The policy of the Government, as it was briefly and tersely put by the Prime Minister in his Maitland manifesto, is defence by means of a citizen soldiery : and no better or more substantial foundation for the organization of such a defence force can be found than in the encouragement and fostering of military knowledge and skill amongst our juveniles. Boys at school are at an impressionable age and full of enthusiasm, and are therefore likely to remember as long as they live the instruction which is given to them in military matters. That being so, we should strenuously insist- upon encouragement being given to the cadet system, and not allow the Government to be led away, as I sometimes think they are, by the advice of their administrative officers. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro has pointed out that money is expended unnecessarily upon the head-quarters staff, and that, no doubt, is the case. It has been told me by men on whom I thoroughly rely, as persons who know what they speak about, that there is too much expenditure upon mere frill. Take, for instance, the case mentioned by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro. In that instance the General Officer Commanding travelled from Melbourne to Bathurst to make an inspection of a few mounted men, which occupied perhaps half-an-hour, and he took his whole staff with him. We do not want to see our money expended in that way for show purposes. I think that the Minister should lay down a policy for his Department, and insist upon it being administered by the General Officer Commanding. I should like also to emphasize what has been said by the honorable member for Darling Downs as to the desirability of encouraging naval, as well as military, cadet corps. We have splendid advantages in Australia for the training of naval cadets, but - and I speak under correction - I believe that there are no -naval cadets in New South Wales, notwithstanding the abundance of material there. On the northern rivers we have what ure called water brigades - organizations whose object is to save life and property in time of flood. They are purely voluntary, and consist of young men and boys who act under the supervision and tuition of men of more experience. If the members of those bodies were given some naval training, and a periodical trip to sea on a man-of-war, they would be very useful in time of need for our naval defence. I hope that the Minister will give effect to the suggestion of the honorable and learned member for Darling- Downs, and that the various expressions of opinion from the members of the Committee will cause the right honorable gentleman to initiate and actively prosecute a policy which will build up a truly citizen soldiery. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to support the proposal of the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs. In my opinion, there is too great a tendency on the part of our military authorities to spend money unnecessarily upon our land forces to the neglect of our naval defence, though most honorable members will admit that the latter is our first arm of defence. . There is no time when persons are more susceptible to training, and more benefited by athletic exercises and discipline, than when they are children ; and military instruction could be given to our school children, not only more effectively, but at a less cost, than later in their lives, and with no sacrifice of time on their part. At the same time, I would not make military training compulsory even for our boys. Our difficulty will be to supply sufficient arms and drill instructors for. those who will be anxious to join the cadet corps. In my opinion, the country is indebted to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood for the work he did in initiating the cadet movement in Victoria, and great benefits have already accrued from it. For a long time our cadets were armed with dummy rifles, which were well enough for drill purposes, but, of course, gave no opportunities to the children to learn to shoot. The Government of which I was the head therefore placed the sura of &#163;3,000 upon the Estimates for the purchase of effective rifles. It is not necessary that expensive and modern rifles should be given to the cadets, because children can learn to shoot straight with almost any kind of rifle. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but if they learn to shoot with one kind of rifle they will very soon be able to shoot effectively with any other kind. When I was a boy I learned to shoot with a muzzle-loading gun, but the first time that I used a Martini-Henri rifle I tied with the highest scorer in a match. I quite agree with the honorable member for Perth that it is absurd to waste any considerable amount upon clothing or trappings. We do not want to spend money on frippery, frill, and feathers. The cheapest possible uniform, or even a badge, would be quite sufficient to distinguish cadets from other boys. Whatever money is available should be devoted to drilling the boys, improving their marksmanship, and imparting instruction that would be useful in after life. I am very glad that the Minister is in sympathy with the cadet movement, and that he recognises the desirability of arranging with the States Governments to forward it in the schools, because there is no doubt that the schoolmasters are the best persons to have charge of the youngsters. They are more anxious with regard to their moral and social advancement, and take a keener interest in their welfare than do other instructors. I do not regard the amendment of the honorable member for Kooyong as necessary. We do not make it imperative upon the Government to have a Defence Force, and it is not desirable that we should use the word &#34; shall &#34; in this connexion when we do not employ it in regard to the Defence Forces generally. It has already been stated that the military authorities are not displaying towards the cadet movement that sympathy which it deserves. Some years ago I conducted an inquiry in Victoria with a view to effecting retrenchment, and I took evidence from all the military authorities, who, without exception, advised that the amount which we were spending upon the cadets and upon&#39; other branches of our citizen soldiery should be cut down, and that the votes for the maintenance of the permanent forces, and the headquarters staff should remain untouched. There is no doubt that money devoted to the training of cadets and other branches of our citizen forces will produce much better results in proportion to the amount expended than will that applied to the maintenance of permanent forces and a. large central staff. </para>

                    <para>- I regard this as one of the most important clauses in the Bill. The children whom we train in the schools must, in after years, form the foundation of our Defence Forces, and we should, from the commencement, instil into them the necessity of acquainting themselves with the use of arms. I think that more opportunities should be afforded to the cadets for rifle practice, and that the Government should not hesitate to devote small sums to the purchase of prizes which would encourage the youngsters to become efficient marksmen. I do not know if there is any system by which youths of the age of sixteen or seventeen, who have passed through the cadet forces, can be encouraged to take part in rifle shooting competitions, but I suggest that the Minister should do everything he can to encourage such practice. I fully share the views expressed by the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs with regard to the maintenance of naval cadets, and I shall have much pleasure in supporting any proposal that he may make in that direction. I hope that the Minister will recognise that the vote placed upon the* Estimates for expenditure upon the cadets i&#187; altogether inadequate, and that it will be largely increased. If the amount were doubled it would not be too much. </para>

                    <para>- I think that even as matters stand the cadet corps, constitute the tap-root of our defence system, and that we should secure much better results if we proceeded in the direction indicated by the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs. We may legislate ever so well, and all our efforts may be rendered abortive, if the administration continues to be as unsympathetic as it has proved during the last eighteen months towards the cadets and other branches of our citizen forces. I do not know the extent to which the cadet system has been developed in other States, but in Queensland we had a very well organized and disciplined, although numerically small, corps,, which, under the administration of the Defence Department since it was transferred to the Commonwealth, has been practically wiped out. The intention of Parliament as evidenced last session was mot that we should maintain a highly-paid standing army, but that we should have a well-equipped and well-disciplined citizen force, upon which we could rely at all times. It is well known that if children are drilled <inline font-style="italic">At</inline> school they are much more apt pupils in after life when they are called upon to undergo military instruction. We have made the mistake in the past in connexion with our defence system of allowing boys to drop out after reaching the age of fourteen. I am glad to notice that it is provided in the Bill that boys may remain members of the cadet corps until they are of an age which will enable them to become members of rifle clubs. This would be a great improvement if we could feel sure that the administration would be sympathetic. I desire to read an extract from the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Observer,</inline> which seems to me to describe the position of Queensland to a nicety with regard to rifle clubs and cadets.

                        <para>- I am reading the comments of the <inline font-style="italic">Observer</inline> upon it. The article continues - but he trusts that before long a movement so valuable to the future of the Australian nation may be seriously taken in hand. To our mind, no scheme which does not encourage the youth to interest himself practically in military tactics can claim to have much to commend it. If there is money to train men, there should not be much difficulty in providing enough to allow the rising generation to prepare to take the places of men when they become too old to bear arms, or for other reasons can no longer take an active part in military affairs. Is it not generally admitted that the best soldier is he who has been caught young, and has been subjected to a course of discipline, which makes him not only a better fighter but a better man ? It seems a lopsided system which will take the full-grown man and attempt to mould him, and refuse the youth whose very years and whose school life make him particularly susceptible to all the influences which are brought to bear upon any scheme of training. School discipline is a valuable aid to that of militarism. But once let a boy leave school and enter the work-a-any world, and he leaves his discipline on the shelf with his school books. The thing which has long been lamented in connexion with the old system has been the hiatus in a boy&#39;s life which separated his State school cadet term from that in which he might join the Defence Force made it exceedingly difficult to recruit him ; and without, even the cadet system - poor as it is - we can see not only an almost impossible task before those who would make Australia self-defensive, but also the possibility of an alarming increase in the number of larrikins and thriftless boys. As General Hutton remarks, the inculcation among the members of the rising generation of the great principles of patriotism, self - sacrifice, and self - discipline is necessary as forming the basis of a national military training, and if these principles are not to be instilled until the youth of the country has reached man&#39;s estate, it is leaving it too late to do much practical good. The idea of leaving the cadet system to the various States is so much nonsense. Either we are to have a national system of defence, or we are not. If we have, it is one that must be controlled by the Commonwealth. Indeed, one of the great arguments urged in favour of federation was that it would unify the continent for defensive purposes; and for the Commonwealth to say it cannot provide money to continue what is the very foundation of the principles of defence is to admit its inability to provide for the country&#39;s protection. Not only should the cadet system be maintained, but it should be augmented, and in conjunction with it should be the equipment of training ships. Australia at least owes this to her 3&#39;outh. </para>

                        <para>- He is endeavouring to form cavalry instead of mounted rifle corps. We do not require to be taught that the first essential in connexion with our defences is to instruct our men how to shoot. That is far more important than mounting the men on horseback, because the average Australian is a good horseman. He may not be able to perform the military manoeuvres which are executed by a cavalry regiment with the same brilliancy, but he can do practically all that is required of him in the field. Therefore I hold that the same necessity does not exist for training men to ride as for training them to become expert marksmen. The use of the rifle should be taught in the State schools throughout the Commonwealth. Some of our cadets are al read}&#39; armed with a very effective and useful weapon by means of which they can be taught to shoot quite as well as if they were armed with the most approved .and modern rifle. By training the boys in our public schools to handle a rifle they will be stimulated upon leaving those institutions to become members of rifle clubs. These men will give their service to the State, not for the sake of any monetary gain, because I bold that far more is spent by the members, of rifle clubs themselves than is contributed by the Government in the slight encouragement that is offered to them. Very frequently the professional soldier follows that avocation for the sake of earning a livelihood. But the citizen soldier gives of his time and his substance to the country. I am very sorry indeed that in the regulations which have been issued there appears to be a tendency to restrict in every possible way the privileges which have hitherto been enjoyed by the citizen portion of our defence forces. I do not think that our citizen soldiers are being treated at all generously, and I believe that the Minister should have a little more to say in the administration of his Department, instead of leaving so much to professional soldiers. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. Youths over eighteen years of age are required for the purpose of stiffening a corps, and unless we have some youths over that age it is impossible to keep the noncommissioned officers in them. I understand that the Minister contends that we should not increase the maximum age to 21 because it is open for a youth of eighteen to&#187; join the volunteer or militia forces. In my opinion, he would make a great mistake if he departed from the recognised practice. </para>

The honorable member for Perth is not aware of the fact that under the regulations no one who is under 5ft. 6in. in height can join the militia. A youth who could not comply with that regulation might still desire&#39; to retain; some connexion with the military forces, and&#39; if my suggestion were adopted he would bes able to remain in the cadet corps until he was 21 years of age. </para>

I know that there are some senior cadets who object to be paid for rendering a public service, and they will not join the militia, although they are content to remain in the cadet corps, if a youth of eighteen desires to remain in a cadet corps for another two years, and thus help to strengthen its backbone, I fail to see why he should not be allowed to do so.

                    (Corinella). - I should like the Minister to agree to the age being raised to nineteen. I understand that the system of military cadets desired to be established is designed to give our youths the necessary training in what I might call barrack-square work as well as some elementary practice in rifle shooting.

                        <para>- I know as much about the senior cadets as does the honorable and learned member, and I am able to state that the senior cadet authorities in Melbourne will be quite satisfied if the age be raised from eighteen to nineteen. I have an assurance to that effect from those immediately concerned with senior cadets whom I have consulted. They .would prefer the limit to be raised to twenty years, so that they might retain the services of the young men for a little while longer. But they agree that if we raise the age to nineteen we shall give them a margin that will enable them to carry on in a satisfactory way. If all youths had to leave the cadet corps on reaching the age of eighteen years it would be necessary if they were not to be lost to the military service for a militia officer to be ready to snap them up on the day that they went &#39; out of the corps. On the other hand, if we allow one year&#39;s margin the officers will have a chance of securing these youths for the militia. I know from experience that the reason why the cadets, as a whole, have not served to feed the volunteer and militia forces is because there is a gap between the time at which they leave the junior cadet corps and the age at which they are available for service in the other military forces. They leave school when &#39; they are fourteen or fifteen years of age, and save when they are members of senior cadet corps, two or three years elapse before they are eligible for -service in the military forces. During this interim they lose their , affection for military work. I therefore think that it is necessary to allow a small margin, which would enable some of the older boys to act as noncommissioned officers in the cadet corps. In that way they would obtain most valuable training, which would be of great service to them when they joined the military forces. If we raised the maximum age to 21 years they would finish their military career when they left the senior cadet corps, and would join no other force. We have to be careful not to raise the limit to too great an extent, just as we must see that we do not make it too low. </para>

                    <para>- I regret that the Minister for Defence has agreed to accept this amendment. My experience is that the average boy, on leaving school, is apprenticed to a trade in which he associates with adults, and that it is against human nature to expect him on reaching the age of eighteen or nineteen years to join a cadet corps in which boys are serving. I am speaking from experience, because I know that in New South Wales thousands of young mechanics who are associated with men in their daily avocations, are willing to join naval brigades and militia and volunteer corps ; bub while they work beside men all the&#39; week they are not prepared to join cadet corps if it means association with boys. </para>

                    <para>- I have listened with pleasure to the remarks made by the honorable and learned member for Corinella and others with regard to our cadet corps, and I consider that as we believe the training of our youths in these corps will be of great advantage to the community, and will fit them later on for service in time of war, some little consideration should be shown to them. In clause 11 provision is made for preference to be given, in the first appointment of officers, to persons who have served in the ranks. I fail to see why some preference should not also be given to the senior cadets who have served for several years, and who would probably be equally eligible for appointment as commissioned officers. They would be required to pass the prescribed examination just as any other member of the military forces will be called upon to do, and I fail to understand why they should not have the same consideration extended to them. Many lads are trained during their school days - often at some little expense to their parents - and I think it would be regrettable if we created a gap between the cadet corps and the militia which could not be bridged. The country lads have no opportunity of joining . the senior cadet corps after they have left school, and the only way to make provision for them is to give them a reasonable opportunity to put in an application for a commission in the militia within a reasonable time after they leave school. When Major-General Tulloch was in command of the Victorian Defence Forces, he arranged for examinations to be held by the Imperial officers in some of the larger public schools. I cannot say whether the system extended to the State schools, but the boys in the other establishments were notified that they might present themselves for examination, and that those who passed, no matter what their position might be in the school corps, would be able subsequently to enter the Defence Forces as officers on probation, without being required to serve as privates in the ranks. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Holled-Smith took charge of the defence forces of Victoria, he refused to recognise that practice, and it was abolished. The honorable and learned member for Corinella, without pledging himself to support it, has kindly drafted an amendment for me, which, I think, might be added as a new sub-clause. The new sub-clause I should like to add is this : - </para>

As I have already mentioned, Major-General Tulloch when in command in Victoria had the boys in the Public school cadets examined by Imperial officers.

                        <para>- I cannot promise to re-commit the clause, but I would point out to the honorable and learned member for Corio that all that the amendment does is to add to the definition of Defence Force in clause 11. If it is agreed to, preference must be given in the first appointment of officers, in the case of equality of qualifications, to persons who have served in the Defence Force for three years without a commission, including persons who have served in a cadet corps. I do not see why a young man of nineteen, if he can pass the necessary examination, should not have an opportunity to obtain a commission. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me that the amendment will open the door for favoritism. We have already had many instances in which young men who have had influence behind them have been promoted over the heads of men of . much longer service. I agree with the honorable and learned member for Corio, that the proposal of the honorable member should be postponed. </para>

                    (Corinella). - I think that, the amendment might very well be accepted. As the Minister has pointed out, all it means is that in the first appointment of officers preference shall be given, in the case of equality of qualifications, to persons who have served for three years without a. commission in the Defence Force, including the senior cadets. It provides a connecting, link between the senior cadets and the citizen defence force which should be very serviceable.

                        <para>- If so, paragraph (e) also confers the power to acquire, construct, and maintain ships, and the other powers which are specified in the foregoing paragraphs. I think that as those powers are specified, we should also specify the power to establish and control a small arms and ammunition factory. The time may arise when it will be essential to have such a factory. We are so far removed from other countries from which supplies may be obtained, that it will be necessary for us in time of war to depend upon ourselves. </para>

                    <para>- I have been requested by the honorable member for New England to call the attention of the Committee to the first paragraph in the clause. He thinks that it is too much to give the Governor-General power to acquire, arm, and maintain ships, vessels, and boats. Of course, there would have to be an appropriation of money for the purpose, and the necessity for having to get that money voted by Parliament would be a substantial check upon the Ministry; but the honorable member thinks that the power should be limited in some way. I would also draw attention to the provisions of paragraph (e), which, in my opinion, is unnecessarily wide. The words of the paragraph place a tremendous power in the hands of the Ministry. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so, though this is not the place for a legal argument on the subject. The Governor-General is empowered to acquire or build, and arm and maintain ships, vessels, and boats, construct and maintain forts and defence works, lay down mines, acquire, construct, and maintain artillery and rifle ranges, and, beyond and above all this, he is to be authorized to do all matters and things deemed by him to be necessary. That seems to me to give too wide a power. In this case, the &#34;Governor-General&#34; means the &#34;Minister,&#34; and he has full power to do everything that he may deem to be necessary without any reference to Parliament. If a Minister is worth anything at all, and a great emergency arises, he will act without the law, and afterwards look to Parliament for an indemnity. At the same time, there is a great check upon the whims of Ministers when they know that they have to apply to Parliament to sanction their acts. </para>

                    <para>- If the honorable and learned member will look at the Acts of other countries he will find that this provision is contained in nearly every one of them. The powers taken in the clause are intended only to authorize the Government to do whatever may be necessary for the purposes of defence when Parliament has voted the necessary money. Ships could not be acquired or built, armed, and maintained, nor could forts be constructed or mines laid down, unless money were available for the purpose. Paragraph (e) refers to all matters and things connected with the efficient defence and protection of the Commonwealth, and could not relate to any other matters. The power proposed to be taken is necessary, and could be exercised only subject to the approval of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I do not deny that statement. At all events there is no marginal note referring honorable members to the statutes from which these drastic provisions have been taken. I quite admit that huge powers are given to the Governor-General for specific purposes. But in the present instance we are dealing with our defences, and are expressly providing what may and may not be done. This clause declares that the Governor-General may &#34;do all matters and things deemed by him to be necessary &#34; for the purposes of defence. What is the use of the Committee enacting certain provisions if such a plenary power, is to be given to the Governor-General? Of course the answer to my question is that the Governor - General would have to obtain from Parliament the necessary money with which to do anything, and that fact would restrain his hand. </para>

                    E. GROOM (Darling Downs).This clause controls only State railways. I desire to point out to the Minister that there are some private railways in the Commonwealth, and that the construction of others is contemplated. Does the Minister propose to subject both private and State-owned railways to the provisions of this Act? We have private railways in Queensland, authorized and under construction, and some of them are over 100 miles in length.

                        <para>- I have been in communication with the Defence Department, and it seems to me that they treat the public in a rather high-handed way in regard to this matter. This remark applies especially to subordinate officers. In one part of Queensland, to my own knowledge, the officers are continually endangering the lives of the public, by allowing their men to fire across roadways. Notwithstanding the remonstrances of those who use those thoroughfares, no action has been taken by the Department to prevent the practice, and if this clause is passed, they will have . a still greater opportunity to infringe the rights of the public. In any event, notice should be given in the newspapers as to the time at which firing operations are to take place, and provision might be made for that by regulation. I shall vote against the clause. </para>

                    (Corinella).- The honorable and learned member for Corio has just drawn my attention to a matter which I think requires the consideration of the Committee. I wish to point out that in Victoria, at all events, there is a very valuable practice under which men belonging to a corps, for example, in Melbourne, who go, say, to Bendigo for a few months in the pursuance of their ordinary civil avocations, are allowed to be attached to a corps in that city. After the expiration of a few months, perhaps these men return to their own homes and rejoin their corps. The officer commanding the corps to which&#39; they have been attached then certifies to the officer commanding the corps to which they belong that they have attended certain drills, and that officer may then claim for the men the pay due to them in respect of those particular parades. This practice enables a man to attend to his duties as a soldier during his temporary absence from home, and it is a perfectly safe one. As the clause stands it would be stopped, and I therefore move -

                        <para>- I should like to see the amendment included in the list of indictable offences, and for that reason I consider it should be part of this clause. I have no desire to labour the matter, because I believe that although the proposal is an innovation so far as a measure of this kind is concerned, it is one which will be recognised as being highly necessary. Whenever there is a war, or an alarm of war, we invariably meet with instances of a grossly scandalous kind in which the community is defrauded in respect of the value given in goods or equipment supplied to the Defence Forces, and by which the efficiency of those forces is very seriously interfered with. </para>

                <para class="block">During the war in South Africa numerous cases of that kind occurred, and, in some instances, within the Commonwealth. We have heard a great deal of the paper helmets that were supplied to our troops, and which melted away under the first shower of rain to which they were exposed. We have also heard of the case in which soldiers were supplied with tins of jam that were considerably underweight. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. There was likewise a gross scandal in connexion with the horsing of many of the mounted detachments. During the Spanish-American war similar scandals occurred; and, in fact, there has been no war in modern times which has not very pointedly illustrated the necessity for such a provision as this. It may be said that the penalties proposed in my amendment are too stringent; but in matters of this kind I think the maximum penalty should be a heavy one. There have been instances of scandals perpetrated by contractors with the connivance of officers that deserved severer punishment than I propose under this clause. </para>

                        <para>- A contractor in time of peace might supply munitions of war, equipment, or material, which were of such an inferior nature that they would seriously interfere with the efficiency of our troops ; but their defectiveness might not be discovered until the time of war actually occurred. If we limited the provision as suggested the contractor who provided such faulty equipment, and the officer who connived at its supply would thus escape punishment. Therefore, this provision is equally necessary in time of war and time of peace. </para>

                        <para>- With all respect to the honorable and learned member, I hold that we should also make negligence punishable. Many men would otherwise escape punishment because they would plead that the supply of inferior provisions or equipment was simply an act of negligence. It is always said that such cases are due to an oversight, but it is strange that these acts of negligence invariably favour the individual interested. </para>

                        <para>- We cannot afford to be indulgent in matters connected with the defence of the country. We know that scandalous things are constantly being perpetrated, and, as the forces are so liable to be imposed upon - although&#39; it is necessary that their equipment should be of the best quality - we must do everything to safeguard them from imposition. I think that officers who, through negligence, allow inferior food or material to be supplied should be punished. </para>

                        <para>- Insignificant departures from a contract would not be punished, because, even in civil contracts, a certain degree of latitude is allowed; but, if the supervision is to be effective, officers, as well as contractors, must be punishable. I acknowledge the assistance of the Attorney-General in the drafting of the provision, but I am quite open to accept suggestions for its improvement. I do not suppose that the officer who allowed light-weight tins of jam to be supplied to the troops in South Africa committed a criminal act, but he was guilty of a serious dereliction of duty in not ascertaining that the proper quantity was being supplied, and such breaches of duty should be punishable just as positive offences are punishable. </para>

Under the honorable member&#39;s amendment an officer who negligently received inferior bread would be liable to imprisonment for three years, and would be guilty of an indictable offence, which, of course, could not be summarily punished. </para>

                    <para>- I think that there is justification for the imposition of an exceptionally heavy penalty when offences of the kind to&#39; which the honorable member has referred are committed. In my opinion, imprisonment for three years is an exceedingly mild punishment for such offences. I am not a believer in capital punishment, but I would point out that, although under the laws of the States, murder - and in some cases other crimes - is punishable with death, fraudulent army contractors are often virtually guilty of the murder of many thousands, and escape punishment altogether. That has been the experience of Great Britain, and of every other country, including even America during the civil war. Napoleon is credited with the remark that army contractors and their ilk are the lepers of a nation. In his day it was notorious that many men made fortunes, and were able to live in fine homes, because of the profits they made in supplying inferior material and food to the troops. We know, too, how great the suffering of English troops has been because of the bad food and inferior clothing and equipment with which they have at times been supplied - suffering and sickness which have not been exceeded by that caused by wounds and injuries received on the field of battle. But it is not only the health of our soldiers that we have to consider ; we must remember that the very fate of a country often depends upon the equipment of her forces, and the supply of proper food to her men. As has often been pointed out of late, the most important Department of an army is that which has to do with supplies for the stomach - the Commissariat Department. In fighting, as in other work, men do best on good food, and it is necessary, also, that they should have good clothing and efficient weapons. It is notorious, however, that the commercial men and others who contract foi&#39; the supply of food and materials in war time often hold the loosest ethical principles. They seem to think that they must seize the occasion to grab all the money that they can. During the civil war in America, notwithstanding the worthy cause at stake, many men were content to -make money by purveying cheap supplies to the army.- The Minister for Defence asks why army contractors should be treated differently .from other contractors. One reason is that frauds perpetrated by other contractors can more easily be found out ; but the censorship in connexion with the operations of an army in the field prevents the complaints of the men from being heard, and unless they come to the ears of an officer like Lord Roberts, there is very little chance of things being remedied. Men who are fighting in South Africa have to take what is ready for them on the spot ; they cannot wait until better jam is sent to them from England or Australia. I strongly advocate a system under which the Government would manufacture its own requirements. Great Britain does a great deal in that way, although she is not looked upon as a particularly democratic country. Not only should contractors be prevented from making profits dishonestly, but they should also be punished for the suffering which&#39; they inflict upon the soldiers, and the risk of loss to which they submit the country. Men cannot fight properly if they ure robbed of their proper food, and swindled in the matter of clothing &#39;and equipment. The experience of hundreds of .years has not produced a method for preventing the fraud of contractors, and, therefore, I think that the Government should supply its soldiers with clothing, equipment, and weapons of its own manufacture. The amendment is, however, an attempt to improve existing conditions, and I cordially support it. </para>

I hope that the Minister will accept the new sub-clause. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCAY</inline>
                    (Corinella). - I do not think any of us will be inclined to quarrel with the principle of the proposed sub-clause. It is necessary to be specially rigid with regard to both contractors and those who are responsible for the receipt of supplies for the troops in times of peace as well as in times of war, because a great portion of the materiel required in times of war is received in times of peace. We need not probe very deeply into the history of Great Britain in order to find instances in which weapons and ammunition of inferior quality have been supplied, and have cost the lives of men who were worth many hundreds of times the value of the goods. The same thing is liable to occur here. Human nature is the same all the world over, and contractors do not perhaps always realize what their miserable extra profit may cost in human life. Whether they do so or not, however, we should endeavour to put a stop to any further abuses. What I object to in the amendment is that it would make an act of negligence of the most trivial character, on the part of an officer, a criminal offence punishable only by indictment, which involves a preliminary trial before justices, and a committal for trial before a jury, and the branding of a man for life as a criminal. The honorable member had in his mind only the most serious cases, but the sub-clause in its verbiage covers trifling cases as well. It is of no use to say that a man might be imprisoned for only a short time, because the man who is committed for trial and is afterwards found guilty by a jury is industrially and socially damned as effectively by one day&#39;s imprisonment as by three years&#39; imprisonment. I have always objected to our criminal laws being so framed as to put it within the power or caprice of any particular set of Crown officials to bring a man before the Courts upon a criminal charge. I suggest that the first part of the sub-clause should be amended to read -
                </para>
                <para>Any contractor, purveyor, or other person, and any employe of any such contractor or other persons who fraudulently and knowingly supplies. </para>
                <para class="block">That makes the new sub-clause agree with the other provisions in clause 69. It is also proposed that if any officer fraudulently, knowingly, or negligently or contrary to his duty, receives goods, he should be liable to imprisonment. Those words &#34;negligently or contrary to his duty &#34; are not required. It would be contrary to the duty of an officer at all times to receive any article not absolutely up to requirements. It is the duty of the commanding officer of a corps who himself cannot personally, receive all his stores, but who does so through his subordinate officers, to see that all stores are according to sample, and if a single jacket which had a button sewn upon it not quite so strongly as the contract required were received, he would, under the terms of the proposed new sub-clause, be liable to three years&#39; imprisonment. </para>

                        <para>- No ; he could not. Of course, the prosecution could not see into a man&#39;s mind in order to ascertain whether he did certain things knowingly or otherwise, but the Judge and jury before whom he was tried would draw their own inferences from his conduct. For instance, if a quantity of light weight jam were sent in, the jury would conclude that the intention of the contractor was fraudulent, and that he acted knowingly, in order to secure more profit than he was entitled to. Instead of dealing with acts of negligence in this clause I should prefer to frame a new clause, and provide for a pecuniary penalty.

With the consent of the Committee I propose to insert the word &#34; and &#34; between the words &#34;fraudulently&#34; and &#34;knowingly,&#34; and to omit the words &#34; or negligently,&#34; line 4 ; also to insert the word &#34;and&#34; between the words &#34;fraudulently&#34; and &#34; knowingly,&#34; line 13; and omit the words &#34;or negligently, or contrary to his duty.&#34; I also wish to alter the word &#34;section,&#34; line 18, to &#34;sub-section,&#34; and to omit &#39;all the subsequent words, because they are already contained in the clause as it stands.

                    <para>- It goes without saying that I should be in favour of requiring contractors to supply goods according to the terms of their contracts, but it seems to me that the proposed subclause,even in its altered form, goes further than is necessary. Honorable members will recollect that when I was speaking as to the necessity of making provision in the Bill for the future, I was told that it was necessary only to apply it to our present conditions. At present we have only&#39; 1,300 permanent men, and we hold military encampments in the different States once a year. The supplies for our permanent forces and for the men in the encampments are all that we require from contractors, and it seems to be unnecessary to apply the stringent conditions proposed to such circumstances. Why should the contractors for our limited requirements be subject to a law different from that which applies to those who contract for the supply of goods to other Government or public institutions. The ordinary law is good enough to apply to our contractors in times of peace. If the provisions of the sub-clause were restricted in its operation to times of war I should not object, because the supply of goods to troops on active service is one over which we cannot exercise too close a supervision. Because a contractor unknowingly supplies meat of an inferior quality to the troops at Queenscliff, is he to be dragged before the court and charged with an indictable offence1? Under such circumstances I should refuse to become a contractor. If the amendment were adopted, it would be incumbent upon the person accused to prove that the inferior goods were supplied by him unwittingly. In other words, it would make a man a criminal first, and afterwards impose upon him the onus of proving his innocence. </para>

                        <para>- I am as anxious to see right done as is any one. But why should some respectable butcher who, perhaps, supplies inferior meat to the troops at Queenscliff, which is so ably represented by the honorable and learned member for Corio, be charged with having wilfully supplied it? Why should he be compelled to prove that he did not knowingly supply such meat <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                        <para>- At any rate there would be a long paragraph in the newspapers which would probably ruin his business, even though he afterwards proved himself to be perfectly innocent. I hold that we should treat every one alike. Why should we have one law relating to contracts for the supply of food to the military, and another relating to contracts for food supplied to the hospitals ? I would further point out that all the food supplied to the military is subjected to official scrutiny. </para>

                        <para>- An officer has to inspect the food each day. Why, then, should we make the provision proposed? In my opinion it is unnecessary. I should be very severe upon persons who supplied inferior goods to the military authorities in time of war, but even in connexion with the scandals which occurred in the recent South African campaign, I hold that those who inspected those goods were almost equally to blame.

                    <para>- I am very glad to hear from the Minister that I so ably represent the &#34; respectable &#34; butcher. But I do not think that the respectable butcher should be allowed, even if he desired, to supply inferior meat even in time of peace. The fact that we cannot legislate in reference to the food supplied by contractors to hospitals, is no argument why we should not legislate in regard to the food supplied to the military. If we had the power to deal with hospital contracts, I should urge the adoption of a similar provision. I would, further, point out that the proposed amendment will apply to camps of instruction. Because I go down to a camp at Sunbury for a few days, why should I be compelled to eat meat that is infected with fluke or tuberculosis ? </para>

                        <para>- Then I shall support him. The honorable and learned member for Corio has indicated what might happen at one of the instructional camps. At such camps it is no uncommon thing for officers to inspect the food submitted. It would, however, be rather extraordinary if the orderly officer who had received food of an inferior quality were made guilty of a criminal offence. Under the amendment as amended, however, that will be impossible. In my opinion it is advisable that regular army contractors should be made to feel that we are doing all in our power to avoid a repetition of the disgraceful occurrences which were recently witnessed in South Africa. The contractors of Australia have not * proved themselves very much superior to those in other parts of the world. Some 6f the .goods which were sent by them to South Africa were a positive disgrace. Honorable members do not know half the truth in regard to this matter. We can only learn from those who took part in the campaign the full facts regarding the criminal neglect exhibited by contractors, who ought to have been imbued with a much greater sense of their responsibility. </para>

                    <para>- I trust that the Minister will accept the amendment. Quite recently in New South Wales scandals occurred in connexion with military contracts. There the officers who were charged with the inspection of the food and clothing supplied were very remiss in their duties. Serious scandals also occurred in South Africa in connexion with the military food and clothing supplied. An investigation took place which showed that one contractor, who had charged a very high rate for his flour, had supplied an article of grossly inferior quality. The adoption of the amendment will make it incumbent upon contractors to supply goods which are up to standard. No contractor who desires to do a fair thing need fear the adoption of the honorable member&#39;s proposal. It is. only those who wish to obtain a contract at a rate which will not pay them, or who think that anything is good enough for a soldier, who will have cause for apprehension. The experience of New South Wales in this connexion warrants me in supporting -the amendment. </para>

                    <para>-! think that the honorable member for Perth deserves to be congratulated upon having moved a very useful amendment. Whilst I sympathize with the objection which has been urged to its application in time of peace, I think that the balance of argument is in favour of the position which he has taken up. The amendment, however, is not sufficiently comprehensive to effect the purpose which he has in view, because I notice that the words used in it are &#34;material or equipment.&#34; These, in my judgment, would not prevent a contractor from supplying inferior horses to the army. </para>

                        <para>- They were so well selected in the case of the South African campaign, that one contractor was sent to gaol for three years for having supplied animals of an inferior type. I do not know whether the amendment would be applicable to a foreign contractor - say a Glasgow company which perhaps may supply dynamite or guns. I should like to know how a foreign contractor supplying material would be dealt with. Further, if - the contractors were a limited liability company - an institution in which &#34; there is no body to be kicked, or soul to be damned &#34; according to the time-worn aphorism, what would happen ? Would the innocent employes - who are bound either to carry out the instructions of their principals, or to forfeit their positions - be sent to goal ? If so, it seems to me that we are putting them between the devil and the deep sea. </para>

The value of the amendment will certainly go down in my estimation if it will punish only local contractors, and allow foreign contractors to commit these offences with impunity.

                    (Northern Melbourne).I gave notice that I desired to call the attention of the Committee to clauses 82 and 83. Clause 82, in addition to empowering the Governor-General to convene courts martial and to appoint officers to constitute them, i gives him the very important power, which should always be retained by him, to &#34; approve, confirm, mitigate, or remit the sentence of any court martial.&#34; Honorable members will see that the next clause enables the Governor-General to delegate any of these powers, either generally or in relation to any particular case or class of cases, or in regard to any military district, and that delegation is to be revocable by him. I feel that it is right that the Governor-General should be able to give officers the power to convene courts martial, and to appoint the members of those courts, but I submit to the Committee that it is important that he should not be allowed to delegate to officers his power to approve, confirm, mitigate, or remit sentences. It constitutes the only power of appeal that is open to a soldier, because he has no right to appeal to the ordinary courts from a court martial. A court martial can affect a man&#39;s liberty and property and in some instances forfeit his life. I think that it should be understood in every case that the Governor-General - and the term, of course, means the &#34; Ministry &#34; - shall have the power to say - &#34;I shall mitigate that sentence, or I shall remit it or confirm it.&#34;

                    <para>- The only reason for proposing that the Governor-General shall have the right to delegate these powers is that owing to the extensive area of the Commonwealth undue delay might otherwise occur in dealing with these matters. It has been the custom for the Governor-General to delegate these powers, either wholly or partly, to the Commandants of various districts. If the papers relating to a case had to be sent say from Western Australia to the Governor-General in Melbourne, arid the offender concerned had to remain under arrest while they were passing to and fro, the practice would not only not be conducive to the expedition of public business, but there would be other grave objections to it. If a court martial in Western Australia passed a sentence of seven days&#39; imprisonment on a soldier, and the papers relating to the case had to be sent to the Governor-General in Melbourne before any action could be taken to remit or confirm the sentence, what would become of the man while the Governor-General was considering his case? He would be in durance for perhaps a month. </para>

                        <para>- In that case, I presume that he would be .allowed out on parole for three weeks or a month, and if, in the end, the Governor-General confirmed the sentence, he would then have to serve it. The immense area with which we have to deal constitutes the difficulty in the way of the honorable and learned member&#39;s proposal, i agree with him that, if we could avoid it, we should not allow the Governor-General to delegate the power to approve, confirm, mitigate, or remit these sentences, butt I fail to see that there is an}&#39; escape from the position. If a court martial sentenced a soldier to a term of imprisonment which the Commandant considered to be too severe, he would be able, under the clause as it stands, to mitigate the sentence at once, instead of the man being kept in gaol while the papers were being transmitted to the Governor-General. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that all we can do is to say that the delegation of the power to deal with the matters referred to in paragraph (c) shall relate only to short sentences. I should be very glad to strike out the paragraph, but for the fact that I feel it would result in very great inconvenience. In these circumstances I think it would be better to permit the Governor-General to delegate his powers in regard to approving, confirming, mitigating, or remitting any short sentences, or in regard to all cases in which the offender would suffer by reason of the delay that would necessarily take place in securing the actual authority of the Governor-General for the mitigation of the sentence. </para>

                        <para>- I think that matter might be left to be expressed in the . document of delegation. The powers given to the Commandant could be limited in that way. The idea is that these powers should be delegated to the commandant in each district, but I do not think that we could define short sentences in this clause. </para>

                    (Northern Melbourne).I recognise that there is a great deal of weight in the argument which the Minister has advanced, and I realize also that very great difficulty would be experienced in defining the term &#34; short sentences &#34; to which this power should apply. I notice that subclause (2) of clause 83 provides that -
                </para>
                <para>The delegation .... shall not prevent the exercise of any power by the Governor-General. but after there had been an appeal to the General Officer Commanding, the Governor-General would probably say - &#34; I decline to act now because the General Officer Commanding has already dealt with this matter.&#34; We might provide that the Governor-General shall have the right to exercise this power, whether it has been already exercised or not. We might provide that, even if the commanding officer to whom an appeal had been made had confirmed the decision of the court martial, the Governor-General should still have power to review the case. </para>

Under clause 9 1 a person tried by court martial may be assisted in his defence by counsel, but sometimes boards of inquiry are constituted by the person who is really the accuser. </para>

                        <para>- No; a board of inquiry merely makes an investigation, and sends in a report to an authority who has had no chance of seeing the demeanour of the witnesses examined, or of forming an unbiased opinion. For instance, a complaint is made against a soldier, and the Commanding Officer is directed to hold an inquiry. That officer has perhaps already recommended the man&#39;s dismissal. What I propose will only apply in time of peace. </para>

Such a provision would prevent comment. such as that which has taken place in England in connexion with the ragging cases of which we have heard so much. I have no objection to the press being compelled to keep silence until the proceedings of a court martial are over, but once a finding is come to, the press should be able to make any comment thought proper. I move -

                    (Northern Melbourne).I should like some information in regard to this and the subsequent clause. Clause- 89 provides that a court martial may require any person to give evidence and produce documents, and under clause 90&#39; every person who disobeys an order to appear, refuses to be sworn, or refuses or fails to answer any question, or to produce any document, will be liable to a penalty not exceeding &#163;100. These provisions, would apply to civilians, but, if my recollection is correct, it is not usual to give a court martial such power in regard tocivilians.

                    <para>- I wish to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister a matter which affects a good many people in the Commonwealth. Recently a blind man took passage by steamer from Melbourne to Tasmania, but it was not until after the vessel had gone several miles beyond Williamstown that it was discovered by the authorities on board that he was blind. Although he had paid his passage and was accompanied by a person who was not blind, the ship was put back and the blind man was landed at Williamstown. I wrote to the Premier of Tasmania upon the subject, and received a reply dated 29th July, as follows : - </para>

                    <para>Referring to your letter of the 19th ulto. with regard to the restriction imposed upon blind, persons landing in this State, I have the honour to inform you that your letters were submitted to the Crown law officers, who advised that under our law the master of a ship arriving in Tasmania with passengers likely to become a charge upon the public is required to execute a bond for &#163;100 for each passenger ; this provision extends to blind persons. </para>

                <para class="block">I should like to know if it would not be possible for the Prime Minister to make representations so that blind persons may be allowed to travel throughout the Commonwealth, without being subjected to the restrictions which prevailed prior to federation. Because a person is so unfortunate as to be blind, he should not be brought up standing by artificial barriers every time he attempts to move beyond the limits of his own State. </para>

                    (Northern Melbourne).I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether an opportunity will be given to honorable members, in connexion with the Budget, to discuss a matter of very grave importance to Australia, which is now exciting much interest in all the States, viz., the relation of the States debts to the Commonwealth. I am sure that it would be advisable to have as much light as can be afforded thrown upon this matter as early as possible. I had a notice of motion on the paper dealing with this subject, but as private members&#39; business has been shelved, and Government business now occupies the whole area, I have had no opportunity of bringing it forward. I hope that during the debate upon the Budget we shall have some illumination from. some source in regard to this serious problem, and I think honorable members will be glad to have an assurance from the Prime Minister that something is being done, or that he will give the House an opportunity of discussing it as soon as possible.

                    <para>- Answering the last question first, I may inform the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne that there is not the least intention to stifle debate upon the Budget, or to take the slightest course that would prevent the freest expression of the views of honorable members upon the subject referred to. With reference to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and my statement regarding the electoral divisions, perhaps I should have been a little more explicit. I said that the reports regarding the electoral divisions would be submitted on Thursday, in the expectation that the debate on the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill would probably be sufficiently advanced upon Wednesday night to allow of that being done. If necessary, we shall go on with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill on Thursday, and, if possible, finish it before we proceed to deal with the, reports upon electoral divisions - unless the consideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill reaches such a point that we cannot further postpone the electoral divisions, which must be dealt with before long. As to the case of the unfortunate blind man who was mentioned by the honorable and learned member for Corio, he will recollect that the Parliament of the Commonwealth is itself a little sensitive in regard to any interference with its laws or institutions by the States Governments, and it would not be surprising if, in their turn, they were rather sensitive to any interference on our part. For that reason I am always chary of interfering in any way which could be called, in the least degree critical or unfriendly. Therefore, I should feel very great delicacy in making any suggestion to the Premier of Tasmania upon the subject to which reference has been made. We are bound to believe that the States Parliaments will do what is right. </para>
