It will be within the recollection of honorable members that yesterday I stated that I had given orders for the evidence to be printed, notwithstanding the decision of the Printing Committee. As to the minutes, I am told that an answer was given in another place, which was strictly in accordance with the law, to the effect that they are the property of the Chairman of the Commission. I. took an early opportunity to have a conversation with him on the subject, and he at once and spontaneously informed me that he had not the slightest desire to adhere to the legal position, but would be very glad if the minutes could be published.

As J indicated last night, I propose that this House shall agree to the motion which I have moved, with such amendments as may be considered, not merely desirable in accordance with the predilections of any honorable member, but necessary, and that - the motion, as amended, shall be sent to the Senate with a message asking for the concurrence of that Chamber. I shall ask the representative of the Government there to take such steps as will bring the question before the members of the Senate for their consideration, and I am not without hope that that procedure will bring about the necessary agreement between the two Houses. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has asked me, in view of the statement he has heard, that the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> is not to be purchased in Brisbane, whether I will make arrangements under which it may be obtained in that and the other principal cities of the Commonwealth. I am wholly in favour of that course being adopted, and I thought that such arrangements were in existence. The arrangements for the distribution and publication of the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> are to a certain extent in the hands of the Department of External Affairs, and also to a certain extent in the hands of the Treasurer, under whom the Government printing is done. I shall take occasion to have a conversation with my right honorable friend the Treasurer with a view of bringing about what is desired. It is entirely in line with my own view that this and other Commonwealth publications should be made available as easily as possible in all parts of the Commonwealth. </para>

The Government is not of opinion that it has persisted in a course which has evoked a want of confidence on the part of the House or of the country, or which disentitles it to either. Therefore, the ground of the honorable and learned member&#39;s question, in my view, disappears. </para>

Deductions for rent of quarters as fixed under the State laws will remain in operation until the classification of the Service which is now in progress has been completed, and no distinction in this respect is made as between postmistresses and postmasters. Where vacancies occur, however, and it is necessary to advertise same, the rent deduction is fixed at 10 per cent. , as provided by section 64 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. Upon the completion of the classification the whole question of rent deductions will be adjusted. </para>

            <para>- I should like to take advantage of this proposal to ask the Government why they allow Order of the Day No. 6 - Conciliation and Arbitration Bill - to remain on the business-paper? Do they propose to take any other steps in regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, or are they allowing an idle order to remain upon the paper?&#34; The Prime Minister has already told the House that he does not intend to go on with the measure, and the usual procedure is to move the discharge of such an order from the business paper. I should like to know whether the Government are relenting over the matter, and whether, after all, they mean to make an effort at the eleventh hour to put that Bill through ? </para>

            <para>- I question whether my honorable friend is very serious,, or as serious as he usually is, in asking this question. His seriousness in ordinary is so great as to be almost jocose, and I am not quite sure whether he has not reached the stage of jocosity on this occasion. However,, the honorable member will not object to this patch on the face of that beauty known as the notice - paper ; because he will consider that as in the case of the -beauties of old days, even the existence of what he may consider to be a patch may bring out the stronger points of adornment. We have nothing to say as to the question asked. The Bill is very well where it is. </para>

                        <para>- It is all very well to blame Victorian representatives. Honorable members opposite are in the habit of imputing all sorts of motives to those who happen to disagree with them. I recognise that the Victorian representatives have as much right as the representatives of New South Wales or other States to express their opinions, and I regret that the cry of State against State should have been raised in connexion with the motion. A very good example was set by the Prime Minister when he stated that every honorable member should have a free hand, and that no attempt would be made to coerce any one into voting for a particular site. As a matter of fact it is well known that Ministers differ as to the best site for the Federal Capital. </para>

                        <para>- Surely it is better that the Government should take up their present . position than attempt by a party move to force a particular site upon Parliament. We have to consider, in dealing with this question, that when once this question is settled it will be disposed of for ever. Possibly, I have been as impatient as any honorable member to see the site fixed for the capital; but I have recognised the great difficulties that beset the Government. The Prime Minister said that he was quite prepared to consider any amendments that might be proposed, and I hope that some of the amendments foreshadowed during the discussion will prove acceptable to the Government. I am sure that whatever our views may be with regard to the merits of the proposed sites, we are all anxious to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. We have almost reached the stage at which we may hope to arrive at a solution of the difficulty. Notwithstanding the action of the Senate in regard to a similar motion, the discussion in that branch of the Legislature has disclosed the fact that a majority of senators have very carefully considered the question, and have made up their minds regarding it. Naturally they are a little bit shy about adopting a course which may result in a choice of which they could not approve, and we can easily understand their hesitation before taking the final plunge, which will commit them to a selection for all time. I am glad that it is not necessary at this stage to say anything regarding the relative merits of the proposed sites. It is better that that aspect of the matter should be dealt with at the Conference of both Houses. Whilst many of us have strong convictions, I do not believe that there is one honorable member who is not prepared to alter his mind if it can be shown that some other site is better than that which he advocates. </para>

                        <para>- It would be almost impossible to find a site better than Bombala ; but one cannot tell what may happen. I hope the Government will agree to accept, in a modified form, the amendment proposed by the honorable member for North Sydney. It might prove very awkward for honorable members representing western districts if they had to make a direct choice between Orange, Bathurst. and Lyndhurst; and the same remark would apply to honorable members representing other divisions of the State. It seems to me reasonable that we should at&#39; first reduce the three sites in the western district to one, because there is no reason why an honorable member who is in favour of Orange should not also be well-disposed towards Bathurst. I think that we should make a mistake if we now attempted to select site for the capital. It is not necessary for us to do so at this stage. We are not armed with sufficient information to enable us to fix a site for the capital itself. &#39; The Commissioners point out not only that they are not prepared to select a site for the capital, but that much more information is necessary, and that much more consideration should be given to the matter before any determination is arrived at. Some honorable members seem to consider that there is a wide divergence between the reports of the Commission of Experts and the Commissioner appointed by the State of New South Wales, but the summaries of the reports practically agree. We should direct our attention to the selection of a territory within which the capital may be established. Who will dare to say that we should without the fullest consideration commit ourselves to a site, and to the expenditure of a large sum of money? We should make haste slowly, and if there is any reasonable doubt in the minds of honorable members, and if it is possible to obtain any more and better information, we should not, because of any outside cry, rush in and perhaps make a mistake which we should ever afterwards regret which would cost the Commonwealth dearly, and which could not be remedied. I hope that honorable members will forget for the time being any differences that may have existed between New South Wales and Victoria. Are the representatives of Queensland, of Western Australia, or of other States any less patriotic than those who represent the more populous States? In. considering this matter we must not count the cost that will be incurred to-day, or tomorrow, or next year, but the ultimate outlay. We must bear in mind the ultimate results, and we must re me member that it is possible that, perhaps even in our time, some of the smaller States may become more populous than either New South Wales or Victoria. We must keep in view the possible developments of the States, and we must consider that a site which would be convenient only for representatives of Victoria and New South Wales might be extremely inconvenient for those who represent other States. As a representative of New South Wales, I have yet to learn that the people of that State have any divine right to the control and trade of the capital. I have yet to learn that we have any right to select a site that will divert the trade to Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- It is high time that honorable members protested against the continuance of this old wrangle between New South Wales and Victoria. The representatives of the latter have been accused of a desire to cast a block vote in favour of a particular site. That such an accusation is ill-founded is proved by the fact that when the representatives of New South Wales held meetings to discuss this question, no taunts of that character were indulged in. </para>

                        <para>- I do not accuse anybody in particular. I believe that there is an honest desire on the part of honorable, members to select the best site. For this reason I hold that our first duty is to decide upon the territory within which the site shall be located. Last night some question was raised as to the awkward position in which honorable members might be placed if they were called upon to record a vote upon every site. Now, there are two sites in my. electorate, and a third upon its boundary. If it had its deserts it would probably include three or four more. It seems to me that the sites which were reported upon by the recent Commission should be grouped within particular areas. For example, the Southern area should include Albury and Tumut ; Armidale would require to stand alone ; and Southern Monaro would embrace Dalgety and Bombala, just as Lake George would include Yass. That is a suggestion which, I think, the Prime Minister might well consider. I believe that its adoption would tend towards a solution of this question, especially in view of the discussion which has taken place elsewhere. We now know that the action of the other branch of the Legislature, in declining to meet this House in Conference, was prompted by the fear that the votes of its members would practically be &#34; swamped.&#34; But in the light of the debate which has taken place in this Chamber, members of another place now know that a majority of honorable members intend to select the site which they deem to be best. I have no doubt, therefore, that &#34;these resolutions, if adopted, will meet with the concurrence of the other House. Certainly, they will receive more consideration than was bestowed upon them last evening. &#34;There seems to be a general desire amongst honorable members that further information -should be obtained in regard to the value of the land which is embraced within the areas comprised in the different sites. It has been pointed out that whilst the Constitution prescribes that the Commonwealth shall acquire a minimum area of 100 square miles, the report of the last Commission contains no information as to the value of the land in the different eligible localities. Personally, I take it that we should be guided in our conclusions upon the matter by the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline> who, in collecting information for &#34;.the New South Wales Government, was careful to call expert evidence upon this point.  His  report gives the value not only of the minimum area of 64,000 acres, but the approximate cost of a much larger area. </para>

                        <para>- I was also pursuing ah unselfish line of argument, because if the site were determined from the stand-point of beauty alone, it would be located in my electorate. But even though a particular locality may be beautiful, or may be connected * with the State capital by railway, it surely ought not to be given the same number of points as a place which possesses a magnificent climate, a good port, a grand water supply, or a large area of land which can be purchased at a reasonable price. If one carefully examines the report of the last Commission, one will find that very many points which were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> have been fully confirmed. At the same time there is a good deal in the contention qf the honorable member for Gippsland. We must consider the question of land values before we adopt these resolutions. Some honorable members have contended that so long as the land is worth the money it does not matter what we pay for it. But I would point out that in one locality there may be- splendid country which is admirably adapted to closer settlement, but which, owing to the absence of a railway or a market, is worth practically only its prairie value, whereas another area which comprises land of the same quality may be worth five times as much. We all know that around some of these sites the land is very valuable. In my own district some of the best country in the world can be purchased for &#163;4 or &#163;5 per acre. </para>

                        <para>- Some honorable members have a very crude idea of the value of land. The land of which I speak is of the best quality, and is altogether unlike that sandy soil blown about the streets of Melbourne, with which the honorable member for Melbourne Ports is familiar. He may make light of this question, but it is one of the utmost importance. We should enter upon the work of selecting a site just as carefully as if we were going to pay for it out of our own pockets. Would it be reasonable for us to select a site comprising land worth about &#163;20 per acre when we might obtain another site comprising land of equally good quality, and worth in its unimproved state only &#163;5 per acre? With the assistance of the money of the people, giving access and markets, we could readily raise the value of that land to &#163;20 per acre. I was pleased to hear the statement made by the Prime Minister that he intended to place before the House an estimate of the value of land in the several sites submitted to us. I have no doubt that it will be complete in every respect, and enable us to come to a proper decision. Such information is absolutely necessary. In selecting a site we are very much in the position of a man who desires to purchase a house. He may see a magnificent structure which he would like to possess, but he would hesitate to pay for it five or ten times more than the price at which he could obtain an equally suitable building. While I recognise that sentiment must creep into the consideration of this question, I feel that we should not overlook the commercial aspect of it. We wish to obtain the best site at the least cost. Reference was made by the Prime Minister to the Crown lands situate within the sites submitted for our consideration, and I am pleased to know that New South Wales, through its Premier, has intimated its willingness to present the Commonwealth with any Crown lands that may be within the territory selected by us. But, after all, it would be unwise to attach too much importance to that fact. We know that in view of the earth hunger which has existed in Australia for sometime, it is unlikely that any Crown land of value has not been grabbed up. </para>

                        <para>- I would call the attention of the honorable member for Parramatta to the amendment moved by the honorable member for Gippsland, which specifically asks that the price of land in different sites therein named shall be ascertained by the Government before this question is finally decided. It seems to me that the remarks made by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro bear directly on that point. So far as I can understand, he is not dealing with the specific values of any one site as compared with another, but with the question of relative values here and there. His remarks might apply not to one or two, but to the several sites. I see no reason whatever to rule the honorable member out of order. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member appears to think that I am alluding to his electorate when I speak of&#34; the desert land in the west. The Prime Minister, in moving this motion, urged upon the House the desirableness of passing it, but I take it that honorable members would not be prepared to deal with this question in the absence of a thorough knowledge of the values of the various lands. The Prime Minister informed us yesterday that he favoured the resumption of a large area, and we know that on a prior occasion he stated that he was in accord with the proposition submitted in favour of the resumption of a very much larger territory than 100 square miles. He went further and informed us that he was not prepared to allow any territory acquired: by the Commonwealth to pass out of its hands. He says practically to the land speculator - &#34;Hands off ; this is the property of the people, and it will remain their property for all time.&#34; If we are to spend the money of the people in acquiring a large territory and in building the Federal city, the people are entitled to the unearned increment. I take it that the Prime Minister inferred that at the proper time he would be prepared to show the House how the necessary funds could be provided. We have already heard a statement from the Treasurer showing that he is entirely in accord with the system now in vogue in Canada, where the banks are compelled to invest a certain proportion of their funds in Government .bonds and securities. If a similar course were adopted in the Commonwealth we should probably obtain a revenue from that source, sufficient not -only to provide for the purchase of a site, but for the erection of the necessary buildings. It would be a handsome source of revenue to the people of the Commonwealth. I am strongly in favour of the contention that we should view this question from a commercial stand-point. We should deal with it just as if we were proposing to :spend our own money in this direction, and we should select a site that will give the best return to the people. We can secure -that end only by dealing with this issue in the way suggested by the honorable member for Gippsland. Nothing is further from my thoughts than a desire to discuss the relative values of the various sites. I can quite understand points of order being raised by representatives of some of the western districts of New South Wales- </para>

                        <para>- Most of the owners are opposed to the resumption of their land, because they know that the building of a Federal Capital would at once increase its value. I am in accord with the Prime Minister in the stand which he has taken. But much as I want a Federal Capital, and strong as I am in upholding the compact embodied in the Constitution, I would, rather than put this unearned increment into the hands of owners of large estates, wait until we can come to some more patriotic arrangement. Surely it will not be contended that the land should not be resumed. No one will advocate that we should erect a Parliament House and other public buildings, lay out streets, provide a water supply, and go to great expense in other directions, and then allow the owners of property in the district to reap the added value which these improvements would give to it. In my opinion the Federal territory should include, not only 100 square miles, but 1,000, or even 3,000 square miles. </para>

                        <para>- It will probably be found, before the debate is finished, that that area can be obtained in the district in which the site which will be selected is situated. The honorable member, from the discussion, he has heard in this Chamber, and from what he knows of the feeling in another place, must be able to make a pretty shrewd guess as to which that site will be. I, however, do not propose to give any information on the subject now, because this is not the time to do so. The . people of New South Wales are in accord with the proposal of the Prime Minister. They think that the un&#39;earned increment created by the building of the Federal city should go, not to private individuals, but to the Commonwealth. But they are not anxious that there should be undue haste in the settlement of the question. So far, information has been obtained under pressure of time. Commissioners, engineers, and others have been sent from one place to another in the State almost by express, so that Parliament may be furnished with information. The people of New South Wales, however, show no feverish anxiety in respect to the matter. They do not support honorable members who say that the representatives of Victoria wish to do something dishonest. </para>

                        <para>- Although honorable members may wish to joke upon this subject, I am in earnest in regard to it. . I have not tried to have it settled, and then thrown every obstacle in the way of settlement. I have not raised points of order to prevent information from being obtained. All I ask for is a fair field and no favour. The people of New South Wales, however, know that everything possible has been done. Notwithstanding the hostile criticism which it has evoked, nothing has been suggested in substitution for the motion. Although honorable members pretend to feel alarmed at what has happened in the Senate, I am satisfied that if we carry the motion, with, perhaps, necessary amendments, it will be concurred in by the Senate. I should have no fear of that, even if we tacked to it the name of some site, because I know that the site acceptable to me is acceptable to most honorable members here, and to a majority of the members of the Senate. Right triumphs in the end, and notwithstanding the cry raised by the Sydney newspapers, and their references to a toy State, they must face the inevitable. The people of Australia federated in order that trade should flow, not to Sydney, but to its natural port, and the representatives of every State have as much right to speak upon this subject as have the representatives of New South Wales. When the people of Australia have given their verdict, the people of New South Wales must accept the decision, and they are content to wait until the matter can be decided properly and for ever. I hope that it will pass without a division, so as to give strength to the attitude of the Government in another place. I feel satisfied that while honorable members may disagree in regard to the details, they are all at one in desiring that the best site shall be selected, and that the business shall be conducted on the most economical lines. I earnestly hope that the best possible site will be chosen, and that we shall have a. city, not only beautiful to look upon and delightful to reside in, but which for all things that tend to make life more useful and noble will rival and outstrip all other cities in the world, and thus be a fitting, centre for the Government of the Australian Commonwealth. </para>

If the honorable member who interjects wants to know the name of the place, it is Southern Monaro. </para>

                    <para>- It is quite refreshing that instead of witnessing a dispute between the representatives of New South Wales and Victoria, we should see one between two New South Wales members. The spectacle is quite a new one. Hitherto the attacks have been by the New South Wales members upon the Victorians. </para>

                        <para>- I do. There is, however, a very serious desire to deal with the matter from a business-like point of view, and not to have it rushed through without the fullest information being brought before us. The best argument that could be adduced for that point of view has been put forward by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, who has notified the House that in the report which was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline> on behalf of the New South Wales Government, the land valuations of the proposed sites were given. I, however, am not able to find that anything more is given than the value of the land&#39; that would be required to make up the 100 square miles limit. </para>

                        <para>- There need be no delay in obtaining the information which we require. In a number of instances the land values are given in the report of the New South Wales Commissioner, and it will only be in regard to a few of the sites not quoted in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver&#39;s</inline> report that valuations would be required. Let honorable members look at the matter purely from a business point of view. If a firm or company were desirous of starting a business anywhere - and I adduce this instance because the selection of a capital may be regarded as equivalent to a business transaction - would they first of all fix the place where they intended to carry on business, so that the values would be put up on them? </para>

                        <para>- The same would apply, I suppose, to the case of the wharf resumptions. At any rate, it would be very much more satisfactory if we had these land valuations before us. As regards the wharf resumptions in Sydney, I am under the impression from my own experience that very considerable sums might have been saved if instead of resuming, in the method that was adopted private arrangements had been made for acquiring the land. </para>

                        <para>- It may have been difficult, but, at any rate, it could have been done. At all events, my view is that the proposal of the honorable member for Gippsland is a sound one - that we ought to have full information before us and that it can be obtained in a very short space of time. It could be obtained within two or three weeks, so that the whole matter could be settled during the present session. There would be no difficulty in getting it settled before Parliament was dissolved. I can assure honorable members that in arguing the matter as I have done, I have no desire to delay the settlement of the site whilst the present Parliament remains in existence. </para>

                    <para>- Up to the present stage I have refrained from taking part in the debate in order to facilitate business, and to allow the House to come to a decision with regard to the matter before us. But we have now arrived at that stage when I think it is necessary to explain my own views. Up to the present moment the subject has been discussed as though only two States were interested in this great undertaking. While it may be very edifying to the representatives of those States to be slang-banging each other in connexion with their local rivalries- </para>

                        <para>- It has been done all through the debate. The question has been discussed as though Victoria and New South Wales were the only States concerned. We have had an exhibition from the Government whip, who has complained bitterly of the attacks that have been made from this side of the Chamber ; but, in my opinion, if the honorable member is in earnest about the matter he should have been more conciliatory than he has shown himself to be. I should have preferred to see the Government taking the responsibility which properly attaches to their position. The resolution is of such importance that they ought to have taken that responsibility by bringing down a Bill in the ordinary form. It has been said that there are hopes of an understanding being arrived at with another place. As far as I can judge from the debate which took place, there is a distinct opposition to anything of the kind ; and I am afraid that between the two stiles - the Government failing to take the responsibility &#39; for their action, and the unwillingness of the other Chamber to give up certain rights - the session will end without anything whatever being done. Not being a representative of either New South Wales or Victoria, I can speak from a disinterested stand-point. Judging from the statement contained in the newspapers published in Victoria, and even in New South Wales, there is an evident desire - I do not think I should be speaking too strongly if I used the word conspiracy - to prevent the provision in the Constitution relating to the selection of the capital site from being carried into effect. Not one representative of Victoria will have the courage to stand up against the press of that State and advocate the establishment of what is termed the &#34;bush&#34; capital. I hold that this provision is one of the gems of the Constitution, because I believe that if the Federal territory is wisely selected &#39; the revenue derived by the Commonwealth will defray the whole cost of Federation. I believe, further, that if the capital site is not selected by this Parliament, there will be no chance of the selection being made by the next Parliament. What is the meaning of all the agitation against the &#34; bush &#34; capital ? Why all this clamour that either Sydney or Melbourne should be the seat of government ? </para>

                        <para>- I doubt whether the honorable member will be courageous &#62; enough during the next electoral campaign to advocate the establishment of the capital. The honorable member for Gippsland has suggested that some steps should be taken to protect us against paying exorbitant prices for the land which may have to be resumed within the Federal Capital area. I sympathize with his object, but do not think his proposal is practicable. Does he believe that we could obtain valuations from every owner of land within any of the proposed sites, and at the same time select a site before the expiration of this Parliament ? I am sure that the honorable member knows that his plans could not be carried out even if we sat here until Christmas. I hope that the Government will stiffen their backs in regard to this question. </para>

                        <para>- If I were a member of the Government I should insist upon a settlement of this question before the House dissolves. The matter is of sufficient importance to justify the Government in staking their existence upon its satisfactory settlement. They need not fear the result of assuming a firm attitude. They will obtain the support of a number of members of the Opposition. They, however, appear to be afraid of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> I wish to know what the Government have done in connexion with the &#39;acquirement of private lands within the Federal Capital area. On the 7th June, 1901 - that was long enough ago to have given the Government fair warning - I directed the attention of the Prime Minister to section 125 of the Constitution, which provides that the seat of government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by Parliament, and shall be within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, and shall be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth. I went on to point, out that a number of sites in various parts of New South Wales had been offered to the Commonwealth, and that probably within each of these sites some land was held in fee simple. I therefore asked the Prime Minister whether anything could be done to get such land placed under offer to the Government prior to the selection of the site, so that we should not be compelled to pay&#39; very dearly for the properties which we might desire to resume. The Prime Minister replied that &#34;all considerations of that kind will come under the careful review of the Government, who are giving special attention to the question of the site of the Federal Capital.&#34; I presumed from that answer that either the laws of the State would enable the Government to acquire lands for public purposes on reasonable terms, or that it was intended to introduce legislation which would protect us against the payment of exorbitant prices. If we cannot insure that the land shall be sold to us at prices apart from any added value that may result from our action in regard to the capital site, we shall have to pay dearly for any property that we may require. I hope that before this discussion is ended the Government will tell us what they have done in this respect. If no action has been taken, and no inquiry has been made, the answer given by the Prime Minister amounted to nothing. I would urge the Government to stand firm. &#39; There is not the slightest chance of any choice being made by the next Parliament. We find that the candidates for the representation of Victoria in the Senate are already denouncing the proposal for the establishment of a &#34;bush&#34; capital. They are afraid of the press and of the electors. It is all very well for some honorable members to say that they are prepared to loyally abide by the terms of the Constitution, but as an old saying has it - &#34;There are more ways of killing a cat than by choking it with butter.&#34; I submit that the proposal of the honorable member for Gippsland is intended to defeat the object of the Constitution. It will result in delay and place obstacles in the way of a settlement. It is of the utmost importance that we should take definite action before this Parliament is dissolved. Even if we select the site before the session closes, it does not follow that we shall not continue to meet in Melbourne for som&#39;e time. If we allow the matter to stand over until the next Parliament is assembled, proposals will be made for a referendum with a view to secure an amendment of the Constitution by eliminating the provision that the capital shall be not less than 100 miles distant from Sydney. The question will then be raised that the seat of government should be either in Melbourne or Sydney, or alternately in both. The very moment that such a decision is arrived at we shall be called upon, either to pay rent for the buildings which we at present occupy, or to purchase land at a hundred or a thousand times the cost of that which is contained in any of the suggested capital site areas. Cannot honorable members see the conspiracy which is in progress <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> I feel so strongly upon this matter, that although it is a great inconvenience to many honorable members, including myself, to be compelled to devote so much time to their parliamentary duties, I hold that we should be justified in remaining here till Christmas in order to have the capital selected. We can talk about the expenditure afterwards. If the question be not absolutely determined during the present session, there will be some justification for the complaint that the Government are not in earnest about the matter. Personally, I should have preferred the matter to be dealt with by Bill. However, the Government are still hopeful that the other Chamber will concur in these resolutions if they are adopted, and therefore I shall support them with the amendment submitted by the honorable member for North Sydney. </para>

For instance, at Bathurst - as will be seen by reference to page 14 of the summary of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver&#39;s</inline> report - the total improved value of 64,000 acres outside the municipal boundaries (less 5,530 acres of Crown lands) at &#163;4 per acre, is &#163;233,880, whilst the improved value of the land within the municipal boundaries is &#163;913,184. Similarly in the case of Orange, the improved value of 64,700 acres (less 10,800 acres of Crown lands) outside of the municipal boundaries, is &#163;365,000. If the town of Orange be included, the improved value of lands within the municipal boundaries is 592, 26, making a total of &#163;957,426. </para>

                        <para>- But the other report sets out the cost of bringing an adequate supply of water to the various sites. In the case of Wellington, the improved value of 91,500 acres which are outside the municipal boundaries (less 15,890 acres of Crown lands) at &#163;3 per acre is &#163;226,830, and the improved value of lands within those boundaries is &#163;167,535. The land values of the site at Carcoar-Garland, as roughly estimated for the whole area, including church and school lands, but excluding the town of Carcoar, total &#163;200,000, or at &#163;3 per acre for 50,000 acres which are outside the municipal boundaries,and&#163;35,000 for lands within those boundaries, &#163;185,000. Therefore it is altogether a mistake for honorable members to suppose that in nearly every instance a fair value has not been placed upon the Crown lands. </para>

                <para>The improved value of the area within . the municipal boundaries of the town of Bombala is given at &#163;72,665 ; for the residue, about 74,000 acres, a fair average would be from &#163;3 to &#163;4 per acre, some tracts being worth no more than 30s. per acre, while others are worth &#163;7. This Federal territory site of 125square miles (80,000 acres) is in my opinion, altogether inadequate, and an extension of area is suggested which would increase the area up to 1,200 square miles approximately; and the average improved per acre value of the increased area would probably be &#163;3. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the Prime Minister has obtained a valuation from the secretary of the last Commission. In the case of Tumut there are 41,000 acres of country lands which, in their unimproved state, are worth &#163;104,000 ; 300 acres of town lands, which are valued at &#163;37,000 ; and 500 acres of suburban lands, which, in their unimproved condition, are worth &#163;10,000. The improved value of alienated land - that is with existing improvements approximately estimated - is set down at &#163;322,000. Honorable members will, therefore, see that there is really no necessity to go beyond <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver&#39;s</inline> report to obtain an average value of the lands in the vicinity of the various sites. It was stated this afternoon that the Commonwealth would be compelled to acquire the land which it requires at its improved value. I interjected that we need not do so. In this connexion I would point out that the Darling Harbour Wharves Resumption Act of New South Wales contains the following provision : - </para>

I feel sure, however, that they will meet the Commonwealth Government as liberally as possible in every way. If I were Premier of New South Wales I should certainly grant the Commonwealth Government all the Crown lands, irrespective of what area they might comprise, so as to assist in establishing an extensive site for the Federal Capital. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that they have yet made any definite offer. We shall select a site, and, at the request of the Commonwealth Government, the New South Wales Government reserved the land so that there shall be no further alienation. I believe that the stipulation -applies only to the 64,000 acres provided for by the Constitution. They were not requested to go further. I do not think that they have yet made any offer in respect of a gift of Crown lands, but I have no doubt that the whole matter will be settled in a way most satisfactory to the State Government. Whatever Crown land is contained in any Federal area has to be given without payment. The motion proposes that a site shall be selected by means of an &#34; exhaustive ballot.&#34; I do not quite understand what an &#34; exhaustive ballot &#34; means, but I take it that the interpretation placed upon these words will be that the whole of the sites are to be submitted together, and that honorable members will be asked to make a selection by one ballot. It. seems to me that that would be a most unwise course to pursue. For example, a large number of members from the north might favour the selection of a site in that part of New South Wales, while another large section from the south might vote for a southern site, with the result that the intermediate sites may be at once rejected. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. It seems to me that this provision should be amended, and that honorable members should indicate by numbers the relative value in which each site is held by them. In other words, I think honorable members should number the sites in the order of their preference. In that way the site which honorable members placed last on the list would at once fall out, and further ballots would take place until a final selection had been made. </para>

                        <para>- No; I think that the other system would have that objection. I have directed the attention of honorable members to this matter, because I consider it to be one of the utmost importance. I desire that, in any event, a fair method of arriving at the opinion held by the majority of honorable members shall be adopted. It would be much to be deplored if any course were followed which would have the effect of accidentally destroying the chances of some of the sites which, although at first low down on the list, might, as the ballot proceeded, under the system suggested by me, attain a far&#39; more prominent position. I think we should use every endeavour to prevent the rejection of sites in the earlier stages of the voting. The honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> has condemned the Government for failing to do this, that, and the other thing, but I would inform him that the Government have taken very little notice of the way in which certain sections of the press have attacked their action in this matter. They are not dominated by either the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> Their fixed determination from the first has been to bring this question to an issue as soon as public business would permit. That desire has been in our minds from the very outset. </para>

                        <para>- If we had not held this fixed determination the motion would not now be before the House. We have advanced the consideration of the question to its present stage, and it is the intention of the Government to do all in its power to secure its settlement during the present session. In these circumstances I do riot think it is quite right for any one to blame the Government for the action which they have taken. This should not be a party question. I fear that the proposal made by the honorable member for North Sydney would not get over the difficulty to which I have referred. Another suggestion which has been made to me is that a vote should be taken on two sites at a time, and that the one receiving the higher number of votes should be included in the final list submitted to the House. That would be a course very similar to that proposed by the honorable member for North Sydney, but I do not think it would be a proper one to pursue. </para>

I believe that if honorable members will give my proposal careful consideration, they will recognise that it is a good one.

                    <para>- I agree with the&#39; honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> that it is about time that honorable members representing States other than Victoria and New South Wales had something to say on this subject. I did not intend at first to take part in this debate, but while I recognise that Victoria and New South Wales are very keenly interested in this question, I have to deplore the fact that, during the course of the discussion, we have heard so much provincialism. It gives colour to the assertions made in the press in regard to the intriguing and wire- pulling said to be going on. Such practices have not come under my notice, but I fear the intriguing and wire pulling that will go on outside of this Parliament if we fail to determine this question before the close of the present session. I feel sure that there are such powerful interests at work that if we cannot come to a definite decision during this session the intention of the Constitution will probably be frustrated for some considerable time. We have an evidence of this in the attitude adopted by some of the candidates for the next Federal Parliament. Amongst their number is one gentleman who has posed in this State as the champion of land nationalization, and yet we find him indicating to those whose suffrages he is seeking that he is opposed on the plea of expense to one of the grandest manifestations of this principle that the world has ever seen. </para>

                        <para>- I do not mention names; but it is most significant of the power wielded by the press of Victoria that a man holding such definite views on the subject of land nationalization as does the individual to whom I refer should be compelled to resort to so deplorable a subterfuge in relation to a matter of this kind. I am anxious to see the Capital Site question settled, because I believe that the Federal capital will supply an object lesson to Australia, and perhaps to the world. I am very glad that the members of this Parliament as a whole appear to be thoroughly seized of the advantage of the non-alienation -of this land, and I take it that it is precisely that principle to which so much objection is being raised. By its adoption a a very considerable revenue will, before many years are over, be raised from the land, so large that perhaps the whole expense of the Federal Government may be met by it. The effect of such evidence of the&#39; beneficent operation of the principle will be most striking to the people of Melbourne, a city whose land values amount to several millions of pounds, upon which not a penny of taxation k levied for the benefit of the State. <inline font-style="italic">Bo</inline> doubt the present condition of things in Melbourne is highly acceptable to the few favoured individuals who enjoy it, and I apprehend that their hostility towards the selection of a capital in the bush is determined to no small extent by the principle that will be adopted in regard to the land and which in its beneficent operation will be an incentive to citizens elsewhere to obtain revenue on similar lines. While I am willing to recognise that we cannot get away from the financial aspect of the question, I am far from agreeing with those who wish to be guided in this matter entirely by business considerations. Business considerations are all very well in their place ; but, to look at this matter from a commercial point of view, would be to take a very short-sighted view indeed. Business people do not usually concern themselves very much with posterity. But I take it that in this matter we have a very important duty to perform as regards the future generations of Australia, a duty some of whose circumstances at least far transcend the mere question of pounds, shillings, and pence. Moreover, I can easily realize a position in which we should be led entirely astray if we determined our actions wholly by the consideration of the probable cost of resuming the land of the Federal territory. What we have to consider is not so much the present cost as the value which the land is likely to obtain in the future. A great many considerations must enter into a determination of this kind, many of them entirely foreign to the business point of view. I hope that honorable members will give them most careful thought. The future prosperity of the Federal Capital will not depend upon its initial cost, but upon its accessibility, its healthfulness, its picturesqueness, and the policy applied to its development. If we keep those aspects of the question carefully in sight, we may be enabled to make a very good bargain indeed for posterity. We may assure Australia of a capital which will be a favoured place of residence, which will develop into an important city, supplying in many respects an object lesson to the whole world. I hope that these aspects of the question will not be lost sight of, and that we shall, in all our deliberations, remember that the future of this territory is entirely in our hands. As regards the method of arriving at a decision, I do not agree with those who wish us to vote for particular districts. If the sites in any district had pretty well the same characteristics there might not be so much wrong with the method to which I take objection. But we know that the sites within some of the districts are entirely dissimilar. The voting therefore should be for particular sites and not for particular districts. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but I hope that we shall arrive at the final selection by gradually eliminating those which are regarded as the least suitable. I should like to see a vote taken upon a method of procedure which would leave us at the last, say, four sites to choose from. We should take what might be called a reversed preferential vote ; that is, we should indicate our opposition to certain sites, and those which have no chance whatever would thus be thinned out. There would remain two or three from which we could make our final selection. If we then had an opportunity to discuss their merits <inline font-style="italic">in extenso,</inline> the chances are that we should be able to arrive at a wise decision. I hope that this matter will be given the most careful consideration, because so much depends upon the methods adopted. I wish to see the motion carried pretty well as it stands on the notice-paper, and I shall give it my support. </para>

I take it that we should pay to the private owners of land in the Federal area only what that land was worth before this discussion took place. </para>

                        <para>- We have adopted the principle of resuming private land within the Federal area. I believe that the people of New South Wales will be willing to make us a present of any reasonable area of Crown lands over and above the minimum, but so far as the resumption of private land is concerned, are we going to put aside a good site because there happens to be a large amount of very valuable private land adjacent to it? Are we going to sacrifice an ideal site for the sake of &#39;the few thousands which the resumption of private land would cost? This land when resumed will be a great asset to the Commonwealth. The more valuable the land the greater will be the income derived from it. Other things being equal, it is desirable that the site should embrace valuable land so that we may create a great industrial centre, and thus insure that the Federal Capital shall not be a mere town in the bush, but the centre of a teeming population, giving wealth, dignity, and prestige to the political centre of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- From his Ministerial experience my honorable friend knows that the Parliaments of Australia are very keen, in connexion with land resumption, to prevent the adventurer and speculator from getting the best of the Government. We can effectually protect ourselves, and I should be very sorry if the mere matter of the price that would have to be given for the land in a certain area were allowed to enter into the question of the selection of the site. We want a site which will be the best for Australia, and make the best centre of its dignity and prestige. Therefore, although it might have been desirable to obtain the information indicated by the honorable member, the fact that it has not been secured affords no reason for the delay which would be involved by adopting the honorable member&#39;s proposal. I agree with the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> that it would be most disastrous to allow this matter to stand over until after the next general election. It has been reported that it is proposed to spend millions and millions of pounds upon the Federal Capital within the next few years, and although these reports are absolutely frivolous and unfounded, they have produced an impression upon the minds of the public which will probably operate against an early settlement of this question. A compact was made between New South Wales and the other States, and common sense and reason urge that effect should be given to the terms of the Constitution by this Parliament. If the capital site question be thrown into the arena of general politics during the next election, the most unfriendly feeling may be created between New South Wales and the other States. I do not agree with the honorable member for Perth in his objection to the proposal of the honorable member for North Sydney. I think that it is only reasonable that we should bring the ultimate choice to within as small a compass as possible. We should group the geographical areas as the honorable member for North Sydney proposes, because in some cases there is practically very little difference as regards the character of the country and the general situation between contiguous sites. Therefore, where two or three similar sites are proposed it will be best to reduce the number down to one. We must recollect that honorable members - and much less the people of the Commonwealth - can know but very little of these sites. The holiday touring which took place in connexion with the inspection of the sites could not have added very largely to the information of honorable members, and it is our duty to reduce the selection down to as small a compass as possible. For instance, if there are three sites which, apart from local feeling, do not differ very widely from one another, why should we not decide which is the best, and thus get rid of the complexity created by having to consider the claims of contiguous sites ? I think that the honorable member&#39;s proposal has. common sense to recommend it, and I hope that it will be accepted. I would urge the honorable member for Gippsland to withdraw his amendment, because it is clear that if we are to make a final selection of the capital site during the present Parliament his proposal cannot be carried out. I am sure that the honorable member desires to act fairly to New South Wales, although naturally he would like the Federal Capital to be situated as close as possible to Victoria. </para>

We must look forward to the possible developments of hundreds of years. &#163;250,000 would be a, very small amount to spend in acquiring an asset which would be at least worth that sum at the outset, and which would increase in value to a much greater extent than land of lower quality. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. SYDNEY</inline>SMITH (Macquarie).I had not intended to speak, and should nOt have done so but for the course which events have taken. I regret the delay that has occurred in dealing with this important question. When New South Wales entered the Federation it was understood that the capital site should be selected at the earliest possible moment, and I believe that a majority of honorable members are anxious to carry out that compact. The Government have not exhibited that expedition that the importance of the subject demanded and they have not led the House in the matter. I am very sorry that the motion submitted by their representative in the Senate has been rejected. I admit that the objections raised in that Chamber deserve the consideration of honorable members, but at the same time the importance of having the capital question settled warranted honorable members in agreeing to a departure from the ordinary course of procedure. Therefore I felt it my duty to support the proposal submitted by the Government. I do not agree with those who prefer that this matter should be dealt with in a secret manner. My name has &#34;been referred to as the representative of a district in which two of the proposed sites are situated, and I am quite prepared to &#34;take the responsibility of making my choice between them. I think that other members who happen to be in a similar position should take the same course. We ought to deal with the matter in an open and straightforward way, and be prepared to defend our actions at the proper time. With regard to the question of land values, I hope that the information in the possession of the Prime Minister will be submitted to honorable members at an early date. The honorable member for Gippsland urged delay because we had not full information at our disposal, and because he feared that if a determination were arrived at at present land values would be raised, and the Commonwealth would be required to pay a much larger sum than if the- land within the proposed sites were valued prior to the final selection. There will be no -difficulty in safeguarding the Commonwealth against any undue demands by land-owners. The, State laws in New South Wales provide that, in the case of land resumptions, compensation shall be paid upon the basis of the value prior to the date of resumption. The Minister for Trade and Customs has stated the position very clearly, and if the State laws should not prove sufficient to protect the Commonwealth against exorbitant demands, there would be no difficulty in introducing the legislation necessary to achieve that result. I do not intend to speak at any great length, because I feel that a protracted debate will involve further delay in the settlement of this most important question. I am anxious that expedition shall be used, and I regret that the Government are not exhibiting a firmer front, and are not displaying more determination in grappling with the difficulties which present themselves. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro pointed to the delay which had taken place in connexion with the appointment of the Commission of Experts. Authority was given by this House for the reference of the sites question to&#39; a Commission in October last, and a promise was made that the Commission should be appointed before the end of last session. They did not, however, commence their work until January last. Although the Minister promised that the report of the Commission would be laid upon the table of the House in April last, it was not forthcoming until the following July. Several weeks ago I preferred a request that the evidence taken before that Commission should be printed. </para>

                        <para>- I know that ia some Victorian constituencies opposition is offered to any proposal to expend money upon the Federal Capital site at the present time. In my judgment, however, it is unfair to raise that objection at this late period of the day. As honorable members are aware, the electors of New South Wales refused to agree to the draft Federal Constitution when the first referendum was taken. Subsequently a Conference of Premiers was held at which they approved of an arrangement by which New South Wales was to be granted the capital, and upon that condition she joined the Federation. That arrangement was subsequently indorsed by the people of Australia upon a second referendum. All that I ask is that that compact shall be respected. I cannot understand the reason underlying the agitation which is now in progress throughout Victoria to indefinitely postpone a settlement of this question. Quite recently one of the &#39; newspapers in this city pointed out that the Constitution imposed no time limit within which it must be decided. It urged that it did not matter whether the&#39; seat of government remained in Melbourne for an indefinite period so long as the Federal compact was ultimately carried out. </para>

                        <para>- As the Prime Minister has pointed out, there is no necessity to expend more than &#163;500,000 at the present juncture. It is the policy of the honorable member and of other representatives of this State to hoodwink the people of Victoria by raising these fatuous objections. Personally I do not believe that the electors themselves agree with the view which is taken by them. At all events, at a big meeting which was recently held in the Melbourne Town Hall: - a meeting which was convened by the supporters of the Maffra movement to protest against the selection of the capital - the great majority of those present carried a resolution in favour of keeping faith with New South Wales. I would further remind the House that not very long since the people of Maffra strongly advocated the construction of a railway to a certain place which found favour in their <inline font-style="italic">eyes.</inline> Possibly they have arrived at the conclusion that the site in question will not be acceptable to a. majority of this Parliament, and accordingly have changed their attitude. If the records of the State Parliament were consulted, I think it would be found that the people of Maffra had done very well out of the Government of Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- There is no necessity to spend millions of pounds. I agree with the statement of the Prime Minister that an outlay of &#163;500,000 will be ample for some time. We ought to derive sufficient rent from the lands which we resume to pay interest upon the cost of their resumption. I repeat that it is the policy of the honorable and learned member for Corio to make it appear that a large sum will require to be expended to carry out the compact with New South Wales. But I would point out to him that when the people of Australia adopted the Constitution no stipulation was made as to the amount of money which should be expended upon the future Federal Capital. I regret that the late Commission did not furnish us with estimates as to the outlay which would be involved in the acquisition of the various sites. Of course the principal question which we have to consider is the number of points which should be allotted to them on the ground of their distinctive features. I trust that I shall have another opportunity of placing upon record the reasons which actuate me in voting for any particular site. There is no doubt that if the terms of the compact which was entered into with New South Wales are not respected, a good deal of dissatisfaction with Federation will be created - dissatisfaction which will materially interfere with, the settlement of other important questions at the approaching elections. In view of the brief period which is at our disposal prior to the prorogation of Parliament, I feel that I shall best be conserving the interests of New South Wales and &#169;f the Commonwealth by making my remarks as brief as. possible, and I shall, therefore, not trespass upon the time of the House at any further length. </para>

                    <para>- I regret that the Government have failed in this instance to pursue the ordinary course, and to take upon themselves the responsibility of asking this House to select a particular site for the Federal capital. That feeling of regret is all the more pronounced because of the decision which has been -arrived at by another place. It appears to me, however, that the Government are acting wisely in proceeding with this motion notwithstanding the action taken by the Senate. I have always held that, as the people of Australia, as a whole, have pledged themselves to New South Wales in the matter of the capital, a decision should be arrived at as soon as possible in regard to this question. Although we may select the site, it does not follow that we should incur a large expenditure in erecting buildings or carrying out other works upon it ; but, unquestionably, the site of the Federal capital should now be determined. The earnest desire evinced by honorable members representing New South Wales that this question should be at once settled reminds me of the pictorial advertisement showing a baby in a tub straining to reach a cake of Pear&#39;s soap, with the statement at the foot of it that &#34;he won&#39;t be happy till he gets it.&#34; It is evident that they will not be happy until this question is settled, and it is equally clear that the Federal Parliament will not be very happy until it has been dealt with. Honorable members from New South Wales will not give us any peace until a decision has been arrived at, and for that reason also it seems to me that a selection should be made as early as possible. If the amendment moved by the honorable member for Gippsland were carried, it would involve very great delay, and render it impossible for a site to be selected during the present session. In the first place some time would be occupied by the House in determining which of the three sites should be selected, while another place would also be occupied for some days in arriving at a like decision. As to the suggestion that if a selection were made in the terms of the motion we might be called upon to pay more than a reasonable price for the land, it seems to me that the Minister for Trade and Customs and the honorable member for </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Wentworth have shown very satisfactorily that we shall be protected by the laws prevailing in New South Wales, as well as by the fact that land in that State is valued from time to time for land taxation purposes. In these circumstances, it is highly improbable that the people of Australia will be called upon to pay for this land a price largely in excess of its true value. While I agree that a site should be selected without delay, I wish it to be clearly understood that I do not advocate any extravagant expenditure. Notwithstanding the sanguine views held by some honorable members, a considerable sum of money must necessarily be expended on the construction, for example, of waterworks, and the interest on borrowed money expended in that way will not be met for some time. Then, again, if a site is selected which is not connected with the railway system of the State, a line will have to be constructed, and will not pay for some time to come. It remains to be seen whether any country can successfully manage its lands under a system of land nationalization. I have always advocated the making of the attempt, and it seems to me that although we should probably be unable to obtain from the various works a return sufficient to pay interest on the money borrowed for their construction, yet with good management, in a comparatively few years we should have no cause for regret. If there is a fear on the part of the people that extravagant expenditure will take place in connexion with the construction of the Federal capital, it seems to me that we might wait for a time, and do no more than select the site. I believe I am right in saying that the site on which Washington is erected was originally swamp land, and that at least ten or twelve years elapsed before the Government of the United States took steps to build upon it. Therefore, if the people of Australia declare at the next elections that money shall not be expended by us in erecting the Federal city, we might follow the example of the United States of America and allow the work to stand over for a time. I fail to see why we should not wait. The people of New South Wales would be satisfied that the compact had been observed if we merely selected the site of the capital. They would know that when we were in a better financial position money would be spent in erecting suitable Government buildings and laying out the city. </para>

                        <para>- lt was no part of the compact that a site should be at once selected, much less that the capital city should be immediately constructed. I have always held that the site of the capital should be selected as soon as possible, and I have not been led to change that opinion by the statements in the press, or by the opinions of my friends. As a matter of fact, I have not met a Victorian who is opposed to the selection of a site. All that many of the people of Victoria fear is that the selection of a site will be followed by extravagant expenditure in connexion with the building of the city. Every Victorian with whom 1 am acquainted expresses a desire that the compact shall be observed. I intend to vote for the motion. I shall oppose the amendment moved by the honorable member for Gippsland for the reasons I have given, and I trust that the matter will be decided this session, so that this bone of contention may speedily be removed. </para>

                    <para>- I do not desire to detain the House at any length ; but there are a few words which I should like to say with regard to the amendment which has been moved by the honorable member for Gippsland. I must confess that, like other honorable members, I was at first sight somewhat taken with the amendment ; but there is no doubt that whatever other effects it might have, it would lead to the postponement of this question for the consideration of the next Parliament. J must confess that I do. not think that would be by any means an unmixed evil. I see objections to the determination of an important question of this kind during the last days of a moribund Parliament. It appears to me that some of the apprehensions expressed by certain honorable members - especially those representing New South Wales - as to what might happen if the question were not decided during the present Parliament, are due to a feeling on their part that the people of Australia do not share their desire that the site of the capital should be selected forthwith. </para>

I can explain that eagerness only .by the supposition that they apprehend that the electors as a whole will not indorse the views now put forward by them. Sofar as the people of Victoria are concerned, I would point out that if the electors of this State are determined upon a certain course!, members will be found in the next Parliament who . will see that that course is adopted. The mere selection of the site will not carry very far forward those who desire to see the capital forthwith erected. </para>

                        <para>- I am dealing with one point at a time. I have never approved of the compact that was made at the Conference of Premiers, and subsequently embodied in the Constitution ; but I am one of those who for the sake of federation accepted that, with other provisions in the Constitution of which I did not approve. I, consequently, feel bound to assist in carrying out the compact which was then made, however much I may- have disapproved of it at the time. I think that the idea of some honorable members that the whole of this work was to be completed during the life of the first Federal Parliament is an utterly unreasonable interpretation of the Constitution. I am sure that the people of Victoria, at all events, never dreamt of any understanding such as that we should hurry off post-haste to the Federal Capital and take possession either of temporary or permanent buildings there. A matter of this kind is one in which deliberation rather than haste should be observed. I think that the selection of a site, the determination of the way in which it shall be laid out, and the time at which it shall ultimately be ready for occupation, are matters in regard to which undue haste should not be displayed. This very important matter has been somewhat degraded of late by the fact that instead of regarding it solely as a question of the Federal Capital, some honorable members appear to be endeavouring &#39;to make political capital out of it. It is being mixed -up with the forthcoming election. If there is one question among many which should -not be mixed up with the exigencies of a particular general election, it is a matter -such as this. I have also noticed with regret that there appears to have been something in the nature of rivalry among some sections of the House as to who should take the most credit when he goes before the electors, as we all very shortly shall do, for having pushed forward the consideration of this question. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to say distinctly that in voting for a motion which will secure the determination of this question, I am not in any way pledging myself to what I regard as the extravagant demand of some honorable members that we should forthwith commence to spend large sums of money in erecting the capital, and that we should take special train to it as soon as a habitable building can be there erected for -us. I intend, if I am a member of the next Parliament, to see that we proceed with deliberation and do not indulge in any extravagance. I venture to believe that the selection of a particular site for the capital in New South Wales will cause a willingness on the part of many people in that State, who are now rushing this question forward, to proceed with more deliberation than has been exhibited up to the present time. That deliberation is necessary.. </para>

                <para>Mi-. McCAY. - I am astonished at the remark made by the honorable member. I am surprised to hear it asserted that we have shown deliberation in dealing with this question, when, during the first Parliament of the Federation, and, despite all the other work we have had to perform, we have proceeded so far towards the determination of where the capital shall be. If the honorable member thinks that we have acted deliberately in this matter, I should like to have eyesight good enough to enable me to observe what he calls haste. It seems to me that instead of this work being deliberately carried out it is being done with great expedition. I, for one, certainly never anticipated that during the first session of the Parliament we should go so far as to settle the site of the capital. </para>

As the honorable member for Wannon has pointed out, many years elapsed after the selection of the site of Washington before the building of the capital was commenced, and it was half a century or more before Washington really became a city, or in outward appearance worthy of the Federation. </para>

                        <para>- They nearly had a civil war in America before they settled upon Washington. _ <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCAY.</inline> - I hope that we shall not have a civil war here. I have never placed the same importance upon the advantage of having the Federal capital situated in any particular State as others appear to place upon it. I was surprised, indeed, that the electors of New South Wales were so much influenced by the provision in the Constitution which says that the site shall be in that State. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the people of Victoria are as much entitled to their views as to what should be done as are the people of any other State. Some honorable members show great resentment because the people of &#39; Victoria hold opinions which differ from those which they hold. Although there may be faults connected with the Kyabram movement, it is a movement towards economy, in which Victoria is leading the way, and is one of the most wholesome exhibitions of public feeling that Australia has ever seen. It must be followed in its essentials by the people of the other States if this country is to grow and prosper. We have had a saturnalia in many matters, and it is time that we sobered up. </para>

                        <para>- I, at times, have ventured to take my own course regardless of what others may have thought of my actions. It seems to me that we have proceeded without undue delay. In my opinion there has been no delay at all. But, while I am prepared now to support the proposal for the determination of the capital site question, I reserve to myself the right to say later at what rate we should proceed with the building of the Federal capital. I am not prepared to go in for heavy borrowing in order that we may hasten the establishment of the Commonwealth Government and Parliament there. While I am prepared to vote for the settlement of the Federal site question in pursuance of the undertaking which I, with other electors, gave when we voted for the Constitution in its present form, I wish to protect myself from being considered as pledged to proposals for the immediate building of the Federal capital. </para>

I need hardly say that in my opinion the ballot should be an open one, and that every honorable member should be responsible for his vote. On the ballot-paper each member should indicate the order of his preference for the sites submitted, and the scrutiny should be followed by a transfer of the votes given in favour of the site supported by the lowest number of voters to the site supported by the next largest number. </para>

                        <para>- Practically the Hare Spence system as applied to a single choice. I do not believe in it as applied to a multiple choice. The adoption of that system will prevent, not merely caballing or lobbying, but all those combinations which may be imagined if we have a succession of ballots as one site after another is dropped out. Each member will make his selection once and for all, and the ultimate choice will be clear of the suspicion of improper motives. The system, of course, has its disadvantages, as all systems have, but not one disadvantage can be urged against it which could not be urged against the system of taking a fresh ballot whenever a site has been rejected, while there are objections which might be urged to the latter system, which do not apply to the former. I do not agree with those who think that the Government should have taken the responsibility of submitting sites from which one could be chosen. </para>

We should have heard a great deal about brutal majorities, or whatever is the parliamentary form of that phrase. This is not a matter which should have any party complexion at all, and the Government are acting wisely in preventing it from having that complexion. I think the amendment will have no practical effect but delay. That is not ostensibly its intention, and I do not think it is a subterfuge to cause delay. In my opinion, however, we &#39; have already sufficient material to be reasonably sure of getting, on the whole, our money&#39;s worth in any site we may select. I shall vote against the amendment,- and support the motion in its present form, reserving to myself the right to say later how far and how fast we shall proceed with the building of the Federal Capital. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the Government have proposed the right method of selecting the site that is to be the future capital of Australia, but the adoption of the amendment suggested by the honorable member for North Sydney would be an improvement, because I think it would lead to a better selection. Failing the adoption of that suggestion, to which there does not appear to be much opposition, however, I suggest that the Government should consider the possibility of treating the western district as one site. The actual location of the Federal Capital can be determined afterwards if that site is selected. Those in the western district of New South Wales who took an active interest in this matter came to the agreement that there should be no competition between the various proposed sites in that district ; that they would leave it to the Federal Parliament to choose the best site, and the Commissioners were asked to report upon three sites in the district, though practically those three sites may be regarded as one. Some of the representatives of Victoria complain because reference has been made to their action in favouring delay. I do not think that they have any right to complain, seeing that Victoria is the only State in which there is an organized effort to prevent the selection of a capital, and in which the endeavour to stave off the settlement of the question for an indefinite period is actively supported by the press. Although it is always wrong to attribute improper motives to an honorable member, the the fact that several of the representatives of Victoria are in favour of delay justifies us in being very anxious for the settlement of the question this session. If the honorable and learned member for Corinella thinks that a delay of two and a half years is too short to be taken into consideration at all, we must . assume that in his opinion it would not matter if the capital site were not chosen for five or ten years. The honorable member for Wannon said that the New South Wales members will not be happy until they get the capital site chosen, and he and the honorable and learned member for Corinella seem to think that the representatives of New South Wales are unreasonable in- wishing to have the matter settled so soon. They overlook the fact that the people living in the districts in which these nine sites are situated are waiting for the determination of the question by Parliament. The Crown lands in those sites are locked up from settlement, and it is unfair both to the Government of New South Wales and to those who wish to settle on the land to allow this state of things to continue longer than is necessary. We need, therefore, make no apology for urging the Government to see that the provision of the Constitution is complied with as soon as possible. I think, too, that after the site has been chosen temporary buildings should be erected, so that Parliament can meet there, and be free from local influences, such as the Maffra-Kyabram movement, with its pratings about economy. The honorable member for Gippsland has been lauded in the daily press of Victoria for his statesmanlike proposal in moving the amendment. He appears to assume that the people of New South Wales are desperately anxious to sell their land to the Federal Government, and consequently he proposes a Dutch auction, and wishes us to ask them to say at what price they will sell their land. Where there are towns close to the proposed sites, property owners in the neighbourhood are averse to the selection of those sites for the Federal Capital. They were very strongly and decidedly opposed to it because they realized that the capital would not be so close to their towns that they would receive any very great benefit from the new settlement. The honorable member for Gippsland seems to think that those who have land within the proposed sites are likely to offer it at low prices, because they are anxious to get rid of it. But that is about the most amusing idea of which I have heard. Although the honorable member claims to know all about land transactions, he shows an utter lack of acquaintance with the conditions which prevail within the areas reported upon by the Commissioners. The honorable member seems to think that in the event of our not having the land properly valued beforehand, the owners will claim boom prices. If that impression be correct, it is not at all probable that they&#34; would now offer to sell at low prices. The amendment proposed by the honorable member would involve, in the first instance, the selection of three or four sites. Then it would be necessary to decide the area to be embraced in each case - whether it should be 100, 200, or 1,000 square miles. Having decided that point, we should have to send surveyors to mark out the areas. We should then require to communicate with the land-owners in each area, and ask them to name the lowest price they would be prepared to take for their properties. Upon the receipt of their replies we should have to send round valuators to inspect all the properties, and afterwards the valuators would have to compare their valuations with the offers made by the owners. The honorable member is not prepared to say that we should select the site obtainable at the lowest cost. He realizes that it might not be wise to take the, cheapest &#171;ite ; but he indicates that we should be influenced in our &#39; selection by the valuations which most ne&#39;arly approach the assessments of the valuators. The honorable member apparently expects that a certain amount of patriotism will be exhibited ; but the land-owners in New South Wales, like those in other States, desire to get as much as possible for their property. We know that the State always has to pay a little more than other people for any land that it may require, but the New South Wales laws provide safeguards Against any exorbitant prices being demanded. I am astonished that those honorable members who profess to be anxious to observe economy should calmly contemplate the expense that would be involved in surveying four sites and having valuations made of the properties within four areas, instead of one. I hope that we shall practise economy by insuring that there shall be no unnecessary expenditure in connexion with the selection of the capital site. The selection should not depend upon the price at which we can obtain the land, but upon the situation and climatic and other considerations. I do not consider that the Government should be called upon to take upon themselves the responsibility of selecting a .site. I believe that by the method they have proposed we shall arrive at a satisfactory .result in the most direct manner possible. If the Government had introduced a Bill naming any particular site, the whole of the nine sites would have been made the subject of discussion, and honorable members would have been required to come to a decision in respect to each of them. I give the Government every credit for having adopted the course best calculated to arrive at a selection independently of any party considerations. I hope that the Government will succeed in following out to a final conclusion the course which they have marked out in connexion with this question. I shall support the amendment proposed by the honorable member for North Sydney, because I think it will assist us in arriving at a fair conclusion. If that amendment is not carried, I hope that the Government will agree to submit the three western sites together. We cannot say at what point within any of the proposed areas the capital will be situated, and I think that in the first instance it would be preferable to submit the -three western sites as one. I am untrammeled so far as my vote is concerned. Those who had the task of suggesting sites did not travel so far west as my electorate. Some of my constituents believe that they could point out very good sites for the Federal capital within the Darling electorate, but I am perfectly free to make my choice between those which have been reported upon by the Commissioners. I hope that we shall be able to make a final selection and dispose of the whole subject, once and for all, before the session closes. </para>

                    <para>- The sooner we get rid of this Capital site question the better. I do not think that anything has done more to provoke an anti-Federal spirit than the struggle for the Capital. I regret this very much. I have always been content to leave the question absolutely to the untrammelled decision of the Federal Parliament ; but at the same time I recognised that there were many others who were not prepared to do so. The result was that we had to agree to the stipulation made by New South Wales that the Capital should be located within that State, a certain distance away from Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the granting of the Capital to New South Wales was the turning point between success and the failure in&#39; connexion with the adoption of the Constitution. I know perfectly well that there were other amendments of the Constitution to which I attached more importance, such, for instance, as that relating to the power of the Houses at a joint sitting. I thought it very important that a simple majority should rule instead of a two-thirds majority. I should have preferred to leave the whole matter of the Capital site to the Parliament, and I do not think that any injustice would have been done to New South Wales in the matter. I believe that the struggle which New South Wales made for the Capital, induced something like resentment on the part of others, and so heightened a difficulty which was naturally serious enough. </para>

However, whilst I regret that it was necessary to do this, I recognise that the compact was entered into. I had the honour to represent the State of South Australia at the Conference of Premiers at which the matter was arranged. By the representatives of the other States, outside of Victoria, the question was looked upon as one chiefly between the two most populous States, New South Wales and Victoria, and when we found that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner was willing to accept the proposal of the Premier of New </para>

                <para class="block">South Wales with reference to the adjustment which now appears within the four corners of the Constitution, we saw clearly enough that the difficulty was capable of being removed in that way, and we assented to it. It would ill become any one of the Premiers who agreed to that arrangement, or, indeed, any one who voted for the acceptance of the Bill with that stipulation on the referendum to do less than carry it out at the earliest reasonable moment.. That is the position I intend to take. I hope we shall do all we can to settle this trouble in the way provided by the Constitution, and with the best of grace at the earliest possible and reasonable date grant New South Wales the Capital. I do not say that we should hurry, and thus possibly make a mistake that would be fraught with great trouble&#39; to the Commonwealth ; but at the same time I do not favour any suggestion as to the inexpediency of haste for the purposes of justifying delay that ought not to take place. I should be only too glad to see an arrangement arrived at, and to visit New South. Wales - if it be the will of the electors that I should do so - as a member of the Federal Parliament. We have been verY happy here in Melbourne.&#39; Victoria has done everything possible to promote our comfort, and to treat us in the way we ought to be treated, and we should be grateful accordingly. But the people of New South Wales will welcome us quite as heartily, as, indeed, would the people of any other State. There is a sentiment in this matter towards the Commonwealth Parliament that will induce the people to do everything possible to expedite its entry to the Federal Capital, and the sooner the terms of the Constitution are carried out the better. Of course the expense that will have to be incurred in connexion with the establishment of the Capital is an important consideration. I am not making that statement with the slightest intention of justifying delay, which should not take place&#39;; but I trust that, before we reach the final stage, we shall at least be able to form a rough estimate as to the difference in cost of the proposed sites. Even without the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Gippsland, which commends itself to my mind, although I am not prepared to vote for it at this moment, because of the fear of unnecessary delay, I trust that the Government will do everything they can,. before the two Houses are asked to vote, to &#34;lay before honorable members every possible information that could guide them to a right conclusion in this matter. I do not regard the Government as being in the slightest degree to blame for delay. The question is a big one, and we have been very busy. Of course I might be expected to take a biased view with regard to a portion of the time during which the delay is said to have occurred. I believe that the manner in which this question has been pushed and pushed and pushed by some honorable members at different times has not been calculated to assist the movement, but has caused it to be regarded as of a party character. I hope, however, that &#34;we shall now sink any party differences and deal with the matter in a businesslike way. What is the best way of doing it? A8 regards this proposal, I say to the Prime Minister that if he can carry it - and I shall vote for it - it is the best which can be adopted. I shall be delighted to see it carried. As a member of the House of Representatives, I should welcome more frequent applications of the principle of joint sittings to the decision of various questions, though if I were a member of the other Chamber,- I do not know that I should view the matter in quite the same light. The closer we can get to the Senate, and the more matters of national importance can be determined by a joint vote of the Houses the better. It is probably patent to members of the other branch of the Legislature that the Senate is not quite so likely to get its way by agreeing to a joint sitting as it is by the adoption of the usual course of procedure. When there are two . bodies, one of which is twice as strong numerically as is the other, and when the feeling of each runs in a different direction, what is the result of their meeting together ? The probable result is. that the view of the more numerous House will prevail. At present the Senate undoubtedly has the right of veto. It is not compelled - unless it consents to a joint sitting - to submit itself to the will and weight of superior numbers. </para>

                        <para>- Looking at the constitutional position which renders the concurrence of the two Houses desirable, I am inclined to think that if I were a member of the Senate I should be disposed to prefer a proposal by one House and its submission to the other, or a ballot by each. If, under those circumstances, we arrived at the same conclusion, so much the better. As a matter of common practice, the two Houses do not sit together. In that &#34;way the Senate preserves a power which would scarcely exist if it consented in all cases to a joint sitting. However, let us hope for the best. I imagine that this step has not been taken by the Government without some attempt having been made to ascertain the feelings of the other branch of the Legislature, and, consequently, I hope that the best results may accrue from it. If, however, it should so happen -that the Senate, in the first instance, cannot be induced to consent to a joint sitting, possibly an agreement may be arrived at in the usual way. If that were proved by actual experience to be impossible, I take it that the other branch of the Legislature would recognise that the solution of our constitutional difficulties is to be found in a joint sitting of the Houses, and would assent to that course with the best result. I merely wish to add that, whatever we may do as regards the selection of a site. I trust that we shall resolve not to part with the fee-simple of the land. The idea underlying the proposal for the establishment of a Federal Capital and for acquiring a country area, which will be our own property, is that it shall be retained so that the increased value which may be given to it by Federal expenditure shall benefit the Commonwealth. When people talk of expenditure and possible loss in this connexion, and when they sneer at a bush capital, I venture to think of a capital which will be erected upon good land - the Crown land being a gift to the Commonwealth and the private land acquired upon reasonable terms - and which, as regards public expenditure, shall increase in value from year to year, such value being retained for the benefit of the Commonwealth - a handsome endowment for all time. In thi3 connexion we have only to look at the experience of other cities. Had an equally well considered policy been adopted in regard to any one of our capital cities, and had the land been retained for the public benefit by being let upon terms at a fair rental, with periodical reappraisements, I venture to think that instead of private speculators monopolizing the improved value of city lands there would have been reserved for the good of the public, a value which can hardly be over-estimated, and which certainly would have contributed to the enjoyment by the citizens of Australia of easier times than they expe&#39;rience to-day. When people talk of extravagance, I say that in connexion with Federal management there has been no . extravagance which, in the slightest degree, justifies the criticisms to which we have been subjected. Rather, I believe, that we have set an example to the States Parliaments. I know perfectly well the sentiments of the Treasurer&#39; in that direction, and I am aware that he has never spared himself, either in. the State Legislature or in this Parliament, to give effect to the greatest practicable economy. I believe that both sides of the House have supported that policy,- and I am sure that careful as we have been in the past, we are not likely, in connexion with this Federal Capital, to rush headlong into thoughtless expenditure. I shall, indeed, welcome the time when, not only shall we have a Federal Capital which is worthy of the name, and which is free from local colour - Australian in itself - but when we shall have satisfactorily settled a Jong-vexed question, which, under the terms of the Constitution, it is our duty to settle at the earliest possible moment. </para>

Personally, I do not care twopence about it. It cannot affect. me upon the West Coast of Tasmania. Indeed, 40,000,000 Kyabramites with their tails cut off would not affect my position. At the same time, I desire to see justice done to the people of New South Wales. I would suggest to the Prime Minister that in the Bill dealing with the acquisition of the Federal territory a clause should be inserted providing that the land-owners interested must sell their lands at the price at which they were valued prior to the accomplishment- of Federation. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad to have that assurance. When I was at Tumut one man who drove me out to see &#39; the site declared that it was a crying disgrace that his land was not within the fives or ten miles limit. He affirmed that his. landlord had given him notice that when Tumut was selected as the capital site his. rent would be doubled, and that when his lease expired he would not be able to secure its renewal. It seemed to me that there was a capital confidence game upon the lines of the bunko-steerers of New York. I trust that the democratic members of the House will carefully consider this question before they arrive at a decision. The success of the experiment will be eagerly watched by people in all parts of the world. We desire to get as far away as possible from the settled portions of New South. Wales. I do not wish our chances of doing so to be jeopardized by the selection of any particular site, unless we have an absolute guarantee that we can acquire all the land that we desire. Suppose, for example, that&#39; we select a site in New South Wales, and. the State Government says to us, &#34;We will grant the Commonwealth the minimum area, prescribed by the Constitution, namely ten. miles square.&#34; Naturally the Commonwealth Government offices would be built upon the centre of that area. A private syndicate would then be in a position to construct an electric tramway just outside the Federal territory. The result would be that the city would grow up outside the Federal boundary and the private syndicate would reap all the benefit of the Commonwealth expenditure. That is the trouble against which we have to guard. If we carry these resolutions and the Senate declines to agree to a joint sitting of the Houses, what will be the result ? We shall have wasted time in discussing an absolutely negligible quantity. Why should we not get to work at once and select a site *! Why should not this House itself come to a decision <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If it be the desire of honorable members to proceed to a vote at once I will discontinue my remarks </para>

                    <para>- I desire to say only a very few words on this subject. In the first place, I consider it our duty, now that the Government have submitted this, motion, to observe what I believe is the requirement of the Constitution,&#39; and the common understanding in the various States, that we should determine the site of the Federal capital. It is only fair to New South Wales that we should do so. Whatever our decision may be, there is one thing with which we cannot afford to palter, and that is our honour. I cannot vote for the amendment moved by the honorable member for Gippsland, for the reason that it would commit us, in the first instance, to the rejection of all sites save those specially mentioned in it. It would compel us to take that course before we had given any consideration to the matter. I feel embarrassed by the wording of the motion, because it seems to me that it would commit us beforehand to accept and to vote in all circumstances for the site selected by the joint sitting of both Houses. </para>

I should like the Government to say whether they cannot see their way to alter the wording of that, and, perhaps, the preceding paragraph, by providing that the names of the three- sites which receive the highest number of votes be reported to the House by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Speaker,</inline> and that it is expedient that a Bill be introduced after such report has been made to the House, to determine whether the seat of the Government of the Commonwealth shall be the site which receives the majority of votes, or either of the two remaining ones. </para>

I am not sure that we have sufficient material before us to enable us to finally determine this great question. I feel pressed to a great extent by the view presented by the honorable member for Gippsland, that if we passed the motion in its present form we should bind ourselves when the Enabling Bill is introduced to vote for the particular site selected at the joint sitting, and not to reject it under any circumstances. I feel undoubtedly embarrassed in that if we bind ourselves hand and feet, as we should do if we passed this motion, I am not quite certain that we should be able to acquire private lands - and, after all, I understand that it will be mostly private lands that will be required - as economically as we should be able to do if there were some choice left to the Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I think we might come to an agreement. I do not anticipate any difficulty in that respect ; but I feel strongly that a difficulty will arise, in that we shall have to make a definite selection in the absence of sufficient information to enable us to determine what the cost will be. The Prime Minister may, of course, brush aside that difficulty by showing that the Government is in possession of sufficient information to enable us to arrive at the probable cost of acquiring the land. I do not feel prepared at the present moment, however, to say that I will accept, whatever may be the cost to. the country, any site which the joint sitting proposes. That is my position. I do not think we have the means or the materials to enable us to ascertain the probable cost. At all events, I am not in possession of them. If we were to do what is suggested by the amendment - select three sites and eliminate all others - we should act unfairly, but if the Government could see their way to allow three sites to be reported to the House, leaving the Parliament to decide, on satisfactory information as to the probable cost, which of the three should be finally selected, I think we should be relieved of a great deal of difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- I do not agree with my honorable friend. I do not hesitate to say that we must not palter with this proposal. It is an undertaking given in very strong words in the Constitution, and we know quite apart from the mere words of the Constitution what the compact really was. However advantageous it may be to Victoria to have the Parliament meeting here, I do not think we should be justified in doing what would amount practically to a breach of that undertaking, and therefore I feel bound to assist in settling this question at the earliest moment. My only desire <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> that it should be determined on the best possible basis from the stand-point of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I distinctly stated the position. I said in answer to a question that any honorable member who in the course of his speech expressed a desire to move an amendment must at that stage intimate the terms of the amendment to the House, and that when the proper time came I should put the amendment so notified and handed in to me from the Chamber. Pour amendments have already been notified and submitted to me. The first is that moved by the honorable member for Gippsland, the second that indicated by the honorable member for Bland, the third that foreshadowed by the honorable member for Werriwa, and the fourth that proposed by the honorable member for North Sydney. Those amendments will be put in their order. </para>

                    <para>- Before the question is put I desire to say that it is my intention to support the motion, but that I think there is much weight in the suggestion which has just been made by the honorable and learned member for Indi. I was not in my place in the House yesterday, but when I read the speech delivered by the honorable member for Gippsland I felt disposed to support his amendment. In view of what I have heard this afternoon in the House, I feel constrained, however, to withhold that support. I think that the amendment is unnecessary. Although its object is entirely right, its effect would be only to cause delay. I believe I am justified in saying, as a representative of South Australia, that there is no disposition on the part of the people of that State to fail in any way to do justice to New South Wales in the matter of the compact entered into in regard to the Federal capital. South Australia is content that a site should be selected. That having been done, the expenditure of money may be left for future consideration; there is not the least occasion for hurry, and I may say that I shall strenuously oppose anything in the way of extravagant outlay. </para>

                            <para>- The method of balloting provided for in the motion is in effect this : Honorable members must first vote each for a single site. The site which obtains the lowest number of votes is then struck out, and a fresh ballot is taken, honorable members voting again , each for one of the remaining sites. Those who voted for the site eliminated after the first ballot - let me call it site X - will, on a second ballot, vote for the site which is their second preference. The site for which the lowest number of votes is cast on the second ballot is eliminated, and a third ballot is taken, and the voting continues in that way until one site alone remains. When a member loses his first choice, he transfers his vote to his second ; when he loses his second choice, he transfers his vote to his third ; and so on. The system proposed is similar to that adopted in the United States in. their Conventions, when they ballot until an absolute majority is obtained by one candidate. But the system allows arrangements to be made and possible bargaining to take place between the ballots. What I suggest is that each member should give a preference vote for each of the sites, but that he should do it once and for all in the first ballot. If the system which I propose is adopted, one ballot-paper will be given to each member, and opposite his first preference he will place the figure 1 ; after his second preference - the site he would choose in the event of his first preference being rejected - the figure 2 ; after his third preference - the site for which he would vote in the event of his first and second preferences being rejected - he would place the figure 3. </para>

Instead of having seven or eight ballots before a final decision is reached, there would be one ballot, but the same result would be obtained. The system has the advantage that it makes the balloting free from any possible imputation of interference between the ballots. &#60;- </para>

                        <para>- I see nothing in the amendment which will assist us in coming to a reasonable and clear decision upon the question. If the amendment were carried, we should have to declare at the first ballot the opinions we hold regarding every one of the sites submitted. The amendment means that honorable members cannot be trusted after the first ballot to give a second preference according to their second choice. It seems to be assumed that we do not recognise the responsibility attaching to our office, and therefore cannot be trusted to do what is right. The inherent weakness of the proposal lies in the .assumption that we can learn nothing to-morrow that we do not know to-day. Why should any honorable member be debarred from altering his mind between the first and the second ballots ? Why should he not learn something after the taking of the first ballot which would cause him to alter his opinion in regard to the remaining ballots? The honorable and learned member proposes that if I vote for site X as my first choice, and that happens to be the last on the list when the primary votes are counted, that site will be defeated and my second choice will become my first choice in the second count, and so on right down the list. Does the honorable member seriously argue that in an ordinary exhaustive ballot I should depart from my second choice on my second count ? </para>

I think the amendment should be agreed to. I explained on a former occasion that as the motion stands it would absolutely commit honorable members to vote for the site reported to the House as agreed to by the Conference. -My difficulty is that I am not personally in possession of sufficient information to guide me as to the probable cost involved in the selection of any particular site. I feel that we ought to proceed in any event to the selection of a site now. Since we have been invited to do so, it would be a contravention of our duty to refuse. I desire, however, to proceed as economically as possible, and to feel sure that we shall not embark upon any unnecessary expenditure. I think that the capital should be established upon the most economical basis consistent with the object we have in view, and, therefore, carrying out the idea suggested by the honorable member for Gippsland, I think that it would be advisable to ask that three sites should be submitted so that the Houses may make a final choice in the face of fair competition between the sites as to the cost. If the Prime Minister can afford the House the necessary information earlier so that we may judge for ourselves as to the advisability of selecting any one or other of the sites, that would probably be sufficient ; but I do not like to vote blindfolded or to commit myself to support whatever site may be determined upon by an absolute majority of the Conference. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite conscious of the excellence of the motives of my honorable and learned friend, but I cannot quite bring myself to believe that the amendment has as much practicality as generally marks &#39;his proposals. I think, on the whole, that the project would plunge us into difficulties greater than those we must necessarily encounter. If we were to determine upon three sites at the Conference, those three sites would have to be dealt with in a Bill, and it would be very difficult to bring forward any Bill without either leaving a blank to be filled up by selecting one of the three sites by each House in turn, or by including the whole of the three sites in the Bill in the first instance, and leaving the final choice to be made by an exhaustive ballot or preferential vote. One of these consequences must ensue, and in case of either of them we should be involved in difficulty. We should have to overcome the difficulty as to voting if we nominated three sites to be determined by the Houses either separately or together. If we left a blank to be filled in by the House of first instance, so to speak, that House would insert the name of a site or district, and if the other House differed- and, of course, we know that it is within the bounds of possibility that it would - that name would be removed and another would be substituted. Then we should have the whole trouble over again, and we should have to proceed by the usual parliamentary method of amendment, objection to amendment, and insistence upon the amendment of the amending House. After that we should have a Conference, and after that what <inline font-style="italic">1 - . -</inline></para>

                            <para>- There would be great difficulties at any rate, because if the Conference of the two Houses disclosed an adherence on the part of each House to the site that it had named, it would not be able to report any agreement. The difficulty of coming to an agreement would be largely enhanced by the degree .of pardonable and proper pride which members of each House would have in the decision of their own Chamber. </para>

Probably it could be removed - as I pointed out yesterday - only by a dead-lock, which would result in the loss of the Bill, or by the selection of some site which each House might accept for the sake of peace, although each might think it inferior to that which it originally supported. Therefore, it would probably be a site which was not so good as either of the sites which had been named in their respective proceedings. That would be a very serious difficulty, and in view of the obstacles to which I have directed attention, I would recommend the honorable and learned member for Indi to withdraw his proposal. </para>

                            <para>- We have been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> - and it quite accords with my own view in framing these resolutions - that a discussion of the merits of the several sites - which, of course, would include the question of the cost of resuming them - does not come within the scope of the resolutions. As soon as they have been passed, however, I shall lay certain papers upon the table of the House, and I shall ask my honorable colleague the Minister for Defence to lay a copy of them upon the table in the other Chamber. Honorable members will then see what would be the approximate cost of resuming 100 square miles of territory around each site named in the report. I am also in possession of figures which I have obtained by telegraph from the Lands Department in Sydney, and which I hope will be supplemented by a fuller statement shortly, which give the cost of resuming an .area of twenty miles by twenty, of twenty-five miles by twenty-five, and of thirty miles by thirty, or, in other words, of 400, 600, and 900 square miles respectively. The relative positions&#39; of the various sites will also be clearly shown in those papers. In the meantime, however, it seems to me that we should adhere to the one straight line which we have to observe in regard to these resolutions. Our duty is to adopt a course of procedure irrespective of what our opinions may be upon the merits of the different sites. </para>

It seems to me that if we depart from the course which he has suggested we shall land ourselves iri a serious difficulty. Even as matters stand trouble may be experienced in constitutionally preventing honorable members from endeavouring to include in the Bill dealing with the selection of the site some town, other than those which have been reported upon by the Commission. If we are required to deal with three sites we shall only add to the labours of the Conference, and in view of the short period at our disposal prior to the close of the session, anything which requires that work shall be done two or three times over, should be discountenanced. </para>

If we were not hampered by any regard for the provisions of the Constitution, the difficulty with which we are confronted might be much more easy of solution.

                    <para class="block">Although in another part of the Constitution there is a provision from which it might possibly be inferred that the seat of government means the Federal area, I do not think it can be contended that it has that meaning* in a section which draws so sharp a distinction between the seat of government and the territory in which it is situated. The seat of government is one place, and the territory is another. Consequently, if we are not very careful, we may find ourselves dealing with the question of the whole territory instead of exercising our first function, which is to determine where the seat of government shall be. If, therefore, the House does not desire to hamper itself by paying too much regard to the 4,000 acres. which is the area mentioned in the Commissioners&#39; report, it will be necessary to go further than this amendment contemplates, in order to clearly define its intention. To use the word &#34;district&#34; without any explanation would probably cause the motion to be construed as referring to the selection of the Federal territory. That is not our first purpose. We wish to proceed step by step according to the provisions laid down in section 125 of the Constitution. Our first duty is to determine the seat of Government. Possibly we might add to the amendment words which would remove portion of the objection which applies to it. For instance, I take it that the power which the Parliament possesses, within the limits assigned to it, is a plenary one, and is therefore capable of being delegated. I might refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Apollo Candle</inline> case as an illustration of what I mean. Just as in that case power was given to the Collector of Customs to declare that certain articles were dutiable, so power might be conferred upon a Commission to select the place upon which the capital should be built after we had determined its locality. If that is the object of the amendment, no doubt the honorable and learned member for Werriwa will co-operate with his friends with the view to getting us out of the difficulty in which its adoption would land us. I am not so strongly wedded to the use of the word &#34; site&#34; as to make a long fight in its favour. At the same time I hold that we are taking only the preparatory step towards determining the seat of Government, which is quite distinct from the territory within which it is to be located. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. They show very plainly that for the time being Melbourne has been accepted as an alternative to the seat of government. I feel myself altogether in the hands of the House, a.nd not at, all adverse to the spirit of the amendment. Nevertheless, if any words are inserted we should make it perfectly clear that the place mentioned is not the seat of government, but a place within which we, afterwards, intend to give some statutory direction as to things to be done towards making the seat of government. If the House uses the word &#34;districts,&#34; instead of itself specifically selecting the seat of government, it will have to constitute some delegated authority, which, within a certain area, will be empowered to select the seat of government for it. T do not think that any difficulty would be experienced in that respect. If the House selected the district in which the capital is to be located, it might be quite content to allow experts to determine the site of the city. Personally, I think that such a tribunal could select it better than we could. Upon that aspect of the question I should like to hear the views of honorable members. Probably the honorable and learned member for Werriwa will co-operate with his friends with a view to safeguarding us in the matter, otherwise I think we should adhere to the terms of the resolution. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir WILLIAM</inline>McMILLAN (Wentworth). - The intention of the amendment is no doubt good. When once we have decided upon the territory, no doubt an exhaustive consideration of the whole area, with a view to throwing further light upon it, would be a very good thing. But in view of the saving of time which will thereby be effected, I think it is better to adopt the resolution in its present form, and to allow the Conference to consider the question which has been raised, especially as it involves a constitutional point. As the Government is at one with the honorable and learned member for Werriwa in his desire that the best site shall be selected within the area, it might be possible - before the Conference meets - to frame a resolution which would be in the nature of an instruction. to the Government, in the drafting of the Bill. I suggest that we should pass the resolution in its present form, and allow the matter to stand over for further consideration. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ISAACS</inline>(Indi).- I agree with the remarks of the honorable member for Wentworth. We are not passing an Act of Parliament, and, consequently, we are not bound by the verbiage of this resolution. So long as we understand its meaning, the Bill, which will be introduced at a later stage, can provide for all the technical differences which will arise by reason of the wording of the Constitution. I do not anticipate that any difficulty will be experienced if we pass the motion in the form in which it now stands. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the suggestion made by the honorable and learned member for Werriwa is in its essence an excellent one, although it might perhaps be practicable to allow the phraseology of the motion to stand, and to make the desired provision in the Bill itself. I trust that Parliament will be seized of the unwisdom of finally fixing upon any site that may be suggested as the actual location of the capital The Commissioners themselves have already recommended that a proper contour survey should be carried out before any final selection of the site of the city is made. We are quite competent, no doubt, to fix the location of the capital in a general way ; but I, for one, am convinced that in two instances a hurried selection, made primarily on the part of local residents, and an equally hurried inspection by the Commissioners, has &#39; led to an error in regard to the best position in which to build the city itself. In view of that fact I think that, in the absence of further expert advice, it would be highly unwise to come to a final determination in this respect. We should have a detailed survey to assist us, and I think that the necessary provision could be made in the Bill, founded on the resolution arrived at by the Conference, or by the Houses sitting separately. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HIGGINS</inline>(Northern Melbourne).I cannot help inferring from the speeches which have been made that we are disposed somewhat to depart from the right track in dealing with the motion as it stands. The resolution that has been carried relates to a determination, not as to the Federal territory to be acquired, but as &#39;to the seat of government. The first paragraph in the motion is, that a conference be held- &#34;to consider the selection of the seat of government.&#34; The Constitution places no obstacle in the way of the extension of the Federal Territory right up to Sydney, as long as the seat of government itself be distant 100 miles from that city. The proposal to fix a district is a very vague one. What we shall have to do, if the motion stands, is to consider the seat of government, or, in other words, the particular place at which the Federal Capital shall be erected. If honorable members look at section 1 25 of the Constitution they will see that it provides that the seat of government shall be determined by the Parliament ; that if New South Wales be an original State it shall be within that State, and be distant not less than 100 miles from Sydney. There is no restriction, so far as the territory itself is concerned. </para>

Under the third paragraph of the motion the intention appears to be that an exhaustive ballot shall be taken as to the sites which have been reported upon by the Commissioners as suitable for the seat of government. We have already obtained evidence, and the House, by resolution, has already determined upon a certain number of districts as being best adapted for the purposes of a Federal capital. This motion simply follows upon the determination already arrived at by the House, and declares that there shall be an exhaustive ballot in relation to the sites which have been reported upon.

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs that this amendment would practically re-open the whole question, and leave us as we were when the work of inspecting the various proposed sites was first -entered upon. When this matter, was remitted by the State Government of New South Wales to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline> a large number of presumably suitable sites were put before him for consideration. After a very exhaustive inquiry, he reduced the number to three - Orange, Yass, and Bombala. Subsequently, in appointing expert Commissioners to submit a report to the House, we decided to widen the scope of the inquiry by submitting to their consideration the nine sites which had been reported upon by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver.</inline> The motion proposes that a Conference shall take place between the two Houses to deal with the sites reported upon by the Commission, and if we turn to the report of that Commission we shall find that it deals practically with the site of the proposed .city rather than with the broad question of the territory to be acquired. As a matter of fact, it does&#39; not touch upon the territory to be acquired. All the information that we have as to the question of territory is that which has been compiled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline> and thus, if we adopt this amendment we shall practically set aside as useless the report presented by the Commission which we appointed. I think that that Commission would have been well advised if it had dealt with the broader question, and its failure to do so has to some extent placed us at a disadvantage. If we wish to arrive at a satisfactory decision we can dp so only by carrying the motion as submitted by the Government, with the modification suggested by the honorable member for North Sydney. We should deal with the question as the Commission appointed by us has dealt with it. Once having selected the site of the city itself we should decide upon the territory to be acquired. I feel that if we adopted this amendment we should re-open the whole question and be led into an almost interminable discussion that would practically defeat the object which we have in view. </para>

Then in the last line of the paragraph, after the word &#34;establish,&#34; the word &#34; therein &#34; might be inserted. The paragraph would then read - </para>
                    <para>That at such Conference an exhaustive open ballot be taken to ascertain which of the localities reported on by the Royal Commission on sites for the seat of government .... is in the opinion of the members of the.

                            <para>- I suggest the use of the word &#34; localities &#34; for the reason I have given, that it is the word used in the resolution under which the Royal Commission was issued. The Commissioners reported upon certain localities, and indicated what they considered the best sites in those localities for the seat of government. The adoption of my suggestion would not prevent the extension of the Federal area to&#187; any distance that Parliament might see fit to adopt upon the advice of those who may afterwards be appointed to choose the exact site for the Federal city. If we agree to the paragraph, amended as I suggest, we shall provide for the decision that a certain locality - one of those reported upon by the Commissioners - is the best for establishing there in the seat of government. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JOSEPH</inline>COOK (Parramatta).- I strongly urge the honorable and learned member for Werriwa to withdraw his amendment. It takes us back to the stage at which we were when we provided for the appointment of Commissioners to make an inquiry respecting certain sites. The Commissioners were appointed to find out which of certain localities would be the most suitable within which to locate the seat of government. I submit that we ought not now to be asked to take a course which would mean a fresh inquiry, and prevent the selection of the site by this Parliament. With the expert evidence at our disposal, we should now be in a position to make a final selection, and the object of the motion is to enable us to do so. Having come to that point, the honorable and learned member seeks to take us back to the position at which we were twelve months ago. </para>

                    <para class="block">Those localities were specified. In my opinion the Commissioners went beyond their commission in reporting upon alternate sites in three or fourinstances,and their action in doing so has been criticised by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> in his later report. Some honorable members might be disposed to vote for the Tumut site reported upon by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline> but the Commission reported upon quite a different site. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline> on page 24 of his report, states that in his opinion the area suggested - 80,000 acres - is altogether inadequate, and asks whether we should not consider the advisability of providing for a very much larger area. After the speeches which I have heard in this Chamber, and especially that of the Prime Minister upon the motion of the honorable member for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Malley,</inline> some time ago, I feel certain that honorable members are of opinion that 80,000 acres is an inadequate area. Later on I shall have an opportunity to express my opinion on the action of the Commissioners in selecting alternate sites in some localities and refusing to do so in others. I should like to know why they reported upon -an area of 4,000 acres. What do we wish to know about an area like that ? </para>

                    <para>The Prime Minister has pointed out a difficulty. We cannot get away from the fact that we shall be practically hand cuffed if we attempt to say that any one of the sites recommended by the Commissioners is the very place that we intend to build upon. Our trouble is to define the area approximately. We should first choose a territory and afterwards fix the capital site within that territory. We should engage surveyors and engineers, the very best in the world, to fix upon the place that would be most suitable for the capital. I realize the difficulties which have been indicated by the Prime Minister, and therefore I shall not support the amendment, but I should prefer to define the territory within which the capital is to be fixed, and stop there. </para>

The honorable member for Eden -Monaro appears to be attempting to create difficulties beyond those which are inevitable. I hope that the honorable and learned member for Werriwa will withdraw his amendment. The word &#34; district &#34; is too comprehensive, and the word &#34; locality &#34; would be preferable. They talk of the western &#34; district &#34; of New South Wales, which includes an area of 87,000,000 acres. Honorable members seem to forget that we are dealing with a series of resolutions and not with an Act of Parliament, and that close definitions may be embodied in the Bill which will have to be brought before us. Honorable members fully understand that we shall only select the Federal territory, and that the Capital site will have to be fixed within that territory at a later stage. I do not suppose that even the Commissioner who reported upon the sites could fix upon the exact spots suitable for a Capital. We all understand what the word &#34;site&#34; means, and as. the motion has been very carefully framed, we should allow it to stand. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad that the amendment has been moved, because it affords me an opportunity of making certain remarks which I was not able to address to the House last evening. When the question of the Capital sites was under consideration last session, the Minister for Trade and Customs made a promise that an inspection should be made of a site which was not included among those referred to the Commissioners, and I think that this locality might be included within one of the districts contemplated by the honorable and learned member for Werriwa. The Minister said - </para>

I do not know why the Minister did not carry out his promise. It was because of his failure in that respect that I took exception to the report of the Commissioners and to the manner in which it was presented to this House.

I quite agree that to use the word &#34; districts &#34; would re-open the whole question as to the area from which the sites should be selected, but I think that the word &#34;locality&#34; might be adopted as a limitation of town district, and that it might be made to include the Upper Murray site, which is certainly a very promising one. </para>

                        <para>- I have not yet spoken upon the motion, but my silence must not, however, be taken to convey complete acquiescence. The discussion which, has taken place has confirmed the opinion I have entertained from the outset that the motion was hastily submitted to the House. The Constitution prescribes that we shall first acquire a territory. That territory might be secured by the Government even without consulting Parliament, although it would no doubt be inexpedient for them to do so without submitting a series of resolutions or a Bill. The motion would have been more appropriate if we had already acquired the Federal territory. The sixth paragraph says- </para>

                            <para>- This is the position : Section 125 of the Constitution provides that the Parliament shall determine the seat of government. The view of the Government upon this matter was explained by me last night. First, we must determine the seat of government by Act of Parliament. When that determination has been arrived at, it will be for the New South Wales Parliament to pass a law - after such negotiation as is necessary - surrendering to the Commonwealth the territory which is comprised within the site selected. The Parliament of the Commonwealth will then pass a law accepting it as Federal territory. That step will bring the area surrendered under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. At that process I stop. There are several other processes to be undergone, but that is as far as we need contemplate going at the present time. If at this stage we complicate the question under consideration by deciding as to the Federal territory, we shall be leaping before we come to the stile. Our first object should be to determine the seat of government. To fix the Federal territory before we have absolutely defined its extent and boundaries - even if we had the power to acquire it in that way - would be premature, because our first business is to determine the seat of government. </para>

                            <para>- I do not attribute too much importance to the words &#34; shall have been acquired.&#34; In considering the whole of the ramifications of that section, I do not think they will bear the interpretation which the honorable and learned member would place upon them. If we deal with the question of the Federal territory we shall be anticipating what ought to be done after the seat of the government has been selected. I am merely stating the view at which I have arrived after long consideration. But, apart from all other objections, if we use the word &#34;district,&#34; or &#34;locality,&#34; or &#34;territory,&#34; even if we do not encounter some such obstacle as I have mentioned, we shall be confronted with another difficulty. We shall be using an expression which requires pome sort of definition without assigning any limits within which it shall apply. Therefore, quite contrary to our wish, the Federal territory might be almost co-extensive with the whole of the State in which the capital is to be located. That is a difficulty which might be insuperable. If the word &#34; district &#34; is employed we shall have to use it in juxtaposition with other words, which will show the kind of district we mean. If we used the word &#34; locality,&#34; which has been suggested because it coincides with the expression which is employed in the Commission, and therefore has some sort of signification in that connexion, we might guard it by omitting the word &#34;sites&#34; in the resolution, and insert in lieu thereof the words - &#34; The following localities, namely Albury, Armidale, Bathurst, Bombala, Dalgety, Lake George, Lyndhurst, Orange, and Tumut.&#34; We might use some expression which would convey a definite meaning as applied to the localities which were reported upon by the Commission. Unless some such suggestion is adopted, I think that the words&#39; contained -in- the &#34;resolution are susceptible of less danger than are those of the amendment. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ;but not a further investigation of a particular locality. There is all the difference in the world between the two things. The one means that a survey shall be made preparatory to the erection of buildings upon the exact site, and the other, that a further investigation shall be made into the merits of a particular locality. I understand that the site which is specially favoured by the honorable and learned member for Werriwa has been omitted, and that he now desires its claims to be considered. If. he achieves his purpose it will be quite open to the Conference to reconsider the merits of any other sites. The honorable member for Grampians will be entitled to have his proposal reconsidered. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware of that ; but my similes, and those put forward by the honorable member, do not always apply to the same facts. I would put this consideration before honorable members : Is it not possible that by grouping the districts we might eliminate from one or other of them a site which, when subsequently compared with the site selected from another group, would be considered, in our judgment, the better of the two ? Let us say, for example, that there are two sites in one district. Only one can be the better of those two. We take that one. Then we deal with another district. Only one can be the better of the two in that district. We take that one. Then supposing that the ballot results in the rejection of the other sites - it is not necessary to suppose that it would, but we are simply considering this case by way of illustration - we should have to choose between those two. It is quite on the cards, however, that in the district dealt with in the first place, there might be two sites better than the one in another group selected to compete with only one chosen from the first-named locality. To that extent we should be fettering our choice. It may be that, in the opinion of the House, district A contains three sites which have claims for consideration, but if this amendment were adopted we should be bound to select only one of those three sites, and to compare it with one in district B, which might be worse than either of the two rejected in district A. The more the honorable member examines his proposal the more will he be convinced that my suggestion is correct. There is another point which I would submit to his consideration. Expedients of this kind, as compared with the straight-out method of the exhaustive ballot, are to some extent novel, and if, by so much novelty as we introduce into our proposal we increase the risk of disagreement with another place when the two Houses exercise their votes together - if another place agrees to meet us in conference - we shall be in a worse position. We shall be in a worse position if we increase the difficulty of inducing them to agree to meet us in conference, by laying down at the threshold a method of discussion which, being novel, may not appeal to the members of another place as being equal to an actual straight-out exhaustive ballot. I am not bigoted in regard to this matter, and I am not putting forward what is merely an imaginary difficulty. I see in this amendment a danger which may appeal very strongly to us when we come to the point of whether the Senate will agree to accept this process. If we lay down this procedure we may expect more difficulty than if we refrain from doing so. The proposal for an exhaustive ballot does not suggest the danger that the two Houses will not by that method arrive at a selection which represents the majority of the vor,ing &#93; power of the Parliament. If we have a process which will lead to that conclusion, is it not better that we should cleave to it rather than set up another process which, even if it&#39; would guide us to an equally safe conclusion - and I do not for one moment? admit that it would - would nevertheless possess an element that would be much less likely to tend to the two Houses arriving at an agreement of that kind which is absolutely necessary before we can vote at all. </para>

                            <para>- Then no &#39; doubt some honorable member who is equally conversant with the facts will be able to do so. The suggestion that because three sites have been bracketed together in a passage in the Commission a greater measure of fairness would be extended to the others by applying the system of grouping to them carries no conviction to one&#39;s mind. I shall ask the House to say that the absence of the application of the expression in question to other groups of sites referred to in the resolution for the appointment of the Commission is some evidence that the use of it in one particular case is exceptional, and covers no governing implication that should cause it to be applied to all the sites named in the report. Without wishing to adopt any . strained . view of this proposal, I really think that if the honorable member reconsiders the matter he will see the advisableness of withdrawing his amendment as being calculated in itself to prevent the Senate from coming to a oneness of purpose with us by agreeing that a vote shall be taken at a joint sitting of both Houses. In my opinion, anything which would lead to that result has, as I pointed out last night, some element of danger in it. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to point out to the Prime Minister that the grouping of Orange, Bathurst, and Lyndhurst, in the resolution referring to the Commission the work of inspecting and reporting on these sites, was due to no mere error in drafting. It was deliberately done. Here is what the Minister in charge of the resolution said at the time - </para>

I have always recognised that the neighbourhood of Orange and the sites proposed at Bathurst and Lyndhurst are really part and parcel of the same area, and would have to be included in the Federal terri-, tory if any site near the Canobolas were selected, otherwise the territory which is available at the latter place would be insufficient. </para>

                            <para>- Is it not strange . that all these suggestions come from the representatives of one State which has always been protesting its <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> in this matter? I am simply quoting <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to show that it has always been the Ministerial intention that these three sites - Orange, Lyndhurst, and Bathurst - should be treated as one. Inasmuch as some honorable members hold different views as to the relative value of these various sites, we think ic is. fair that they should be able to consolidate their votes when we are asked to come to a final determination. That is the main reason for this amendment, and if honorable members are prepared to determine this question upon lines of fair play they will not raise the faintest objection to it. The motion means that these three sites have been reported upon separately, and are to be dealt with separately by us, in spite of the intention that they should be regarded as one. The amendment, however, proposes that we shall revert to what was the original intention of the Minister, and so enable the vote for the western sites to be consolidated when the final determination has to be arrived at. </para>

                        <para>- I find myself unable to consider this question from the point of view taken up by the Prime Minister, and I feel that he has overlooked certain facts in arriving at the conclusion which he put before the House. We are endeavouring to arrive at a position in which we shall be called upon to select one site. It is a question of the selection of one and only one site. It is proposed, however, that more than one site in a certain district shall be submitted to the Conference, notwithstanding that they are in certain respects similar. The amendment moved by the honorable member for North Sydney, instead of seeking to limit the Conference&#39;s choice, would give it a greater opportunity to make a satisfactory selection, inasmuch as it would enable it to make a selection first of all of the best site in each district. Three districts are named - that embracing Orange, Lyndhurst, and </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Bathurst, that embracing Albury and Tumut, and the district embracing Bombala and Dalgety. The report of the Commission shows that the sites in each of these districts possess many features in common, and if the amendment be carried the Conference will be asked to select that which it con aiders to be the best in each group. The whole of the sites will be submitted to the Conference, and it will be in a position to make first of all a special selection, with the result possibly that, at the outset, sites, which otherwise would receive special consideration later on, are balloted out. The amendment introduces no difficulty, no complication, and no injustice, but will secure a greater degree of justice and of special consideration. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The proposal meets the wishes of honorable members supporting the sites in the Western District, because* they feel that a greater degree of justice will be done to each site than if the motion is carried as it stands. If the adoption of the amendment would inflict injustice upon any of the other proposed sites, ,it is open to honorable gentlemen who are interested in those sites to make that apparent. I feel sure that, if they do so, the honorable member for North Sydney will be perfectly prepared to meet them. The contention of the Prime Minister, that we should not agree to any amendment lest we widen the difference between this House and the other Chamber, might have been a pertinent one early last evening, but it do&#171;s not apply now, inasmuch as the Senate have rejected the motion as originally presented by the Government. It is as reasonable, if not more reasonable, to suppose that, by agreeing to the amendment, we should get rid of possible difficulties which may have presented themselves to members of the Senate, and led them to vote against the motion. I believe that the amendment provides a fair and reasonable way of arriving at a decision, and will insure the merits of each site being dealt .with with more special consideration than is possible under the proposals of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- When the honorable member for North Sydney suggested this amendment last night, it rather commended itself to my judgment, but, having considered it seriously since then, I see an element of danger <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> it. The position is put in a nutshell by an interjection of an honorable member, who said that the &#39; object of the amendment is to make the best horse in each stable start for the race. The unfortunate feature of the proposal is, to continue the simile, that there may be three high-class bipod horses in one stable and three wretched weeds in another, and it will be necessary to exclude two of the blood horses in order to admit one of the weeds. The three best sites might all be in the one locality. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Gippsland has used a sporting simile, and says that he is afraid of a weed beating a blood horse. We are trying to weed out the weeds. Surely, he does not think that this is an alphabetical arrangement, such as he tried to provide for last evening. We hope that the best horse will win, whatever stable it mav come from. Nine sites were reported upon by the Commissioners, and the adoption of the amendment will reduce them to five. Surely that is in the direction of simplification, and in the interests of both this House and the Conference. The Prime Minister contended that the motion should be allowed to remain as it stands, because if it were amended some difficulty with the Senate might be created. I cannot understand that argument, because the amendment leads to simplification, and does not create difficulties. The honorable member for North Sydney has made an admirable classification of sites. He makes Armidale to stand by itself as the northern site, Lake George to stand by itself as the central site ; while Orange, Lyndhurst, and Bathurst are grouped together as the western sites ; Bombala and Dalgety, which are only about thirty-five miles apart, and are therefore for all practical purposes one site, are grouped as the southern site; and Tumut and Albury as the south-western site. Surely it is in the interests of simplification to, in the first instance, deal with Dalgety and Bombala as one site. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and thus each site may lose some of its support. What the honorable member proposes is that the best site should be chosen from each district. In the long run only one site can be chosen. The honorable and learned member for Corio is very much afraid of combinations, but it is very much better for him to have the sites in which he is interested - Albury and Tumut - dealt with in the first instance as a group. The adoption of the amendment would not prevent the selection of either Albury or Tumut, but, to continue the sporting simile, it would give those who support them a preliminary canter, and might enable them to decide which was the better horse to enter for the final. The reputation of the honorable member for North Sydney is a sufficient guarantee that the object of the amendment is to secure simplification and fair treatment. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that I quite understand the amendment, but I do not like what I do understand about it. The wish of the House is to obtain the very best site possible ; it is not a question of districts at all. The proposal of the honorable member for North Sydney is, I understand, not to invite a vote in the first instance upon the sites, but upon certain districts. From that this may follow : One district may contain three proposed sites, one of them far and away the best under consideration, and two inferior. If the voting were upon the sites themselves, no doubt the first site in that district would be chosen ; but the proposal is to lump the best site with the two inferior sites which may be contiguous to it, and to oppose the district containing them to another district in which there are, perhaps, three second class sites. The result would no doubt be that, instead of the best site being chosen, the district in which the three second class sites were situated would be selected, to the exclusion of the district in which the best site was situated. , That seems to me absurd. The proposal seems to me to provide for a gigantic system of logrolling in the interests of the various sites in a district. In this way a district may be selected which does not contain the best site, and the best site may be rejected. We require one site, and one site only. Are we going to take a fair, straight-out vote upon the question which is the best site available, or are we to first select some particular district ? It is not a question of districts, but of sites. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the right honorable member for South Australia quite misunderstands the proposal. I am sorry that he used the word &#34;log-rolling,&#34; because what- . ever view may be taken as to the wisdom of agreeing to the amendment, the proposal is honorably made. I am surprised that the Government have not fallen in with the proposal. In view of the many claims advanced on behalf of different parts of New South Wales, it was agreed to allow a wide range for the selection of the capital site, and we now have nine sites submitted to us. Do honorable members mean to say that if these nine sites are placed before them they will not be puzzled to make a selection ? As. some of these sites group themselves together naturally into geographical areas, it is proposed that we should first select one site in each group. ^ If there are three sites within, a certain area, the attention of honorable members should be concentrated upon that geographical district in the first instance. If it be agreed that one of the three sites is decidedly the best, how can any injustice be done to the other two ? We should absolutely eliminate from our consideration the sites least suitable, and thus minimize the confusion. I do not understand how the choice of honorable members could be in any way limited, or how the effect of the ballot could be neutralized by adopting that course. The proposal of the honorable member is to reduce the selection to three, four, or five sites by eliminating those in the geographical groups which are least worthy of consideration. </para>

                            <para>- We should have nine sites to submit to the ballot, and of these seven can be grouped into three geographical areas. We should in the first place decide as to the best of the sites in these three groups, and thus leave five sites upon which to exercise our final choice. I do not understand how we could stultify ourselves by adopting that business-like expedient. It is a procedure which is intended to simplify matters and to concentrate the&#39; attention of honorable members upon the sites with which they are called upon to deal in turn. As honorable members have not had an opportunity to thoroughly inspect the proposed sites, or to exhaustively consider the reports which have been presented, it is desirable that we should simplify the process of selection as far as possible. </para>

                        <para>. - The right honorable and learned member for South Australia touched the vital point just now. If the amendment were adopted we should, in the first instance, have to strike out one place, say Albury or Tumut, before it had been pitted against sites in other localities. Their claims would not be considered as against those of sites in other localities, and we should be robbing some of the best sites of a. fair chance of selection. </para>

                        <para>- Like the honorable member for Gippsland, I was at first rather enamoured of the amendment submitted by the honorable member for North Sydney. Upon further consideration, however, I find myself unable to support it. Reverting to the Australian simile which was imported into this matter at an earlier stage in the discussion, it appears to me that, whilst we are all agreed that the first horse must of necessity be in one or other of the various stables, the amendment would compel us to assume that the second horse cannot by any possibility be in the same stable. as the first. It is said that the process of elimination must necessarily reduce the number of sites to one. But I would point out that a great deal will depend upon the particular stage in the voting at which our preference is expressed. It is quite possible that the final preference of this House may lie say, between Orange and Lyndhurst, or between Bombala and Dalgety.. But the amendment of the honorable member for North Sydney preludes any such assumption. It assumes that there can only be one eligible site in each group. I hold that as the amendment interferes with the free action of honorable members in voting upon the question of the final selection of the capital, it is objectionable upon that ground. It seems to me that the simple and effective means of deciding the matter is the exhaustive ballot which is proposed by the Government and I shall support it. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt that the reference of the honorable member for Gippsland to a horse race was fairly illustrative of our present position in regard to this question. This is a. great race - a bigger event than is the Melbourne Cup - for which all the horses, all the mules, all the donkeys, all the billy- goats, and all the &#34;scrubs&#34; should be allowed? to enter. Only the other day, in Sydney,, the owner of Marvel Loch intended to- &#34; scratch &#34; him, but that a friend who had backed him for &#163;1,000 persuaded him to start the horse. As a result he&#39; won the Metropolitan. The amendment of the honorable member for North Sydney would wipe out all the &#34;scrubs,&#34; abolish all the pacemakers, and might result in the &#34;scratching&#34; of the wrong horse Might I- suggest to honorable members that the whip has a good deal to do with the result of this great race. In this event the racehorse Bombala possesses a good jockey who is an excellent whip. The full blooded horse, Bombala, with distended&#39; nostrils, high withers, and long neck, drinking in the sweetness of his own breath as he flies along, cares nothing for the billy-goats behind him. I trust that the amendment will not be accepted. Upon most matters I think that the honorable member for North Sydney makes very wise suggestions, but upon the present occasion I cannot agree with him, because he wishes, to unduly limit our choice. </para>

                        <para>- I am surprised at the attitude which is assumed by some honorable members who urge that they should be given an opportunity to exercise a final choice upon various sites, when the very object of the ballot proposed is that the number of sites should be gradually reduced. The amendment of the honorable member for North Sydney is one of the very best means to insure that a fair selection shall be made. To my mind, the geographical situation of any site will be a very important factor in the determination of this question. When we meet the other Chamber in conference upon the relative merits of the different sites, we shall discover that means of communication, accessibility, &#38;c., will very largely influence the votes of honorable members. For that reason, I think that the number of sites which have been reported upon in particular localities should be narrowed down. Then, when we come to make a final selection, we shall be afforded an opportunity to make a fair choice. The right honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> spoke about selecting the best and the worst sites. But the difficulty is that, in the Monaro district, the two sites of Bombala and Dalgety rank about equal, and the same remark is applicable to the three sites in the western portion of New South Wales. If a great difference existed between the relative merits of the different sites, there would be no need for the amendment which has been submitted. It is because the sites are so equal, and because it is desirable that honorable members in voting upon this question should be largely guided by geographical considerations, that the proposal of the honorable member for North Sydney is necessary. Possibly something may be said in favour of the objection which has been raised by the Minister for Trade and Customs. What is applicable to Dalgety and Bombala does not apply to the same extent to Albury and Tumut. Although Dalgety and Bombala are situated in the same district, they are not so close together as are Albury and Tumut. On the other hand, the three sites in  the Western District of New South Wales are practically one. Therefore, it cannot be reasonably urged that they should not be narrowed down to one before the final selection takes place. Throughout the  whole of the discussion upon these resolutions we have fought for the system of open  voting. But the proposal of the Government would induce honorable members who favour a particular site to arrange to vote together. I support the amendment, because it provides a better way of arriving at the desired result than does the resolution. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. SYDNEY</inline>SMITH (Macquarie).When this matter was under consideration upon a previous occasion, I suggested to the Minister for Trade and Customs that in order to give a fair chance to the eligible sites in the Western District of New South Wales, the Orange site should be taken, to include those at Bathurst and Lyndhurst. At that time the honorable gentleman thought that my suggestion should be adopted. He said - </para>

                    <para>That clearly shows that Orange, Bathurst, and Lyndhurst, were referred to the Commission as comprising practically one site. If honorable members will turn to the map submitted by the Commissioners, they will see that a distance of only some twenty-five miles separates the three sites. Lyndhurst is midway between Bathurst and Canobolas, and all that I desire is that the &#39; three shall be considered as one. We know that they are equally good sites. I have no desire to shirk my responsibility by declining to vote on this question. I intend to support art open ballot, and, at the proper time, I shall be prepared tq openly indicate my choice. I think that the amendment moved by the honorable member for North Sydney would satisfactorily meet the position. I cannot understand, the remark made by the right honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> that it would give a chance for log-rolling. I fail to see that it would be possible for such a thing to occur. If the amendment be carried honorable members- will be called upon to give a straight-out vote. Unlike the Government, we say that there should be no secrecy, but that every honorable member should be called upon to accept the full responsibility of casting his vote in the broad light of day. The honorable member for Corio referred a few minutes ago to some system of gerrymandering. He should be a good authority on the subject, because he has been employed in that kind of work for some time. </para>

I have heard some honorable members discussing propositions which are not really contained in the amendment which I have submitted, and I have heard others intimating that they have arrived at conclusions which are altogether foreign to my proposal. The honorable and learned member for Illawarra has been led to move an amendment of my amendment because of the declaration made by the Minister of Trade and Customs that he is prepared to fulfil the agreement that was arrived at by him and by this House when the Commission was appointed.

                    <para class="block">Could anything be plainer? The names of Lyndhurst and Bathurst were placed in brackets, and were not treated as separate sites. The Commissioners were merely directed to report upon Lyndhurst and Bathurst in connexion with Orange because of their proximity to that site. We find however, that the Government now propose to deal with these as three separate sites, and that honorable members, like the right honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> defend that procedure. I am astonished at the attitude taken up by him. </para>

Indeed, &#39; it is in accordance with the view expressed to-night by him, although he seeks to induce this House to deal with the proposal in a different way.

                            <para>- T shall not; but the Minister for Trade and Customs and his predecessor in office will have an opportunity to do so. The Minister for Trade and Customs will have an opportunity to substantiate the promise made by him to-night. Is he going to desert it when called upon to take action <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I have no desire to speak of this matter in sporting parlance such as has been adopted by some honorable members, but if at the outset we select the best site in a district, no injustice will be done. The site of the capital will be determined largely by its geographical position, and by first selecting one site in each district, we shall be free to decide by exhaustive ballot which is the best site in the five separate geographical areas. There is nothing in my proposition which would have an injurious effect upon the chances of any one of these sites, and no honorable member has succeeded in showing that there is. Now that the Minister for Trade and Customs is in the Chamber, I should like to point out to him that the honorable and learned member for Illawarra has moved an amendment of my amendment, which would limit it to the western group. The Minister stated that he believed that the sites in that district should be treated as one site. Is he then prepared to support my amendment as limited by the honorable and learned member for Illawarra? </para>

Lyndhurst and Bathurst were mentioned in parentheses as attached to the Orange site. &#39; The Commission, however, reported upon them as three separate sites. I wish to provide for fair play to all the sites, but I think that fair play will not be given to the sites, in the western district at any rate, if the amendment is not agreed to ; and that it will be found that there will be a splitting of votes in regard to other sites of which there are two in one district. </para>

Directly we arrive at the stage when there is an absolute majority in favour of a site, that is, when more votes , have been cast for it than for the other sites together have received, the ballot will be finished. </para>

                            <para>- If, when there are four sites left, one site receives more votes than the other three together, it will be the site chosen. The word &#34;absolute&#34; does no harm. It is not applied here as it is applied in the Constitution to the absolute majority of the members of the House. This is merely a provision for an actual majority of the votes cast, and when that point is reached the exhaustive ballot must be regarded as concluded. When we reach a point at which say four sites are left for selection, and one site obtains more votes than all those recorded for the other sites put together, surely that must be regarded as the termination of the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to know if the Prime Minister can indicate whether the Parents Bill will be taken to-morrow. If it is intended to adjourn to-morrow, perhaps we might meet in the morning in order to enable us to pass the Bill through the Committee stage, and get away in the afternoon. </para>

                            <para>- I would ask the honorable and learned member not to press his request that we should sit tomorrow morning, because there are certain matters which require to be dealt with by Ministers - such matters as generally arise at this stage of a session - and I have arranged for a Cabinet meeting to-morrow morning which would have to be abandoned if the honorable member&#39;s desire were complied with. As to other matters I may mention that the Supplementary Estimates have yet to be considered. The Patents Bill is now in the hands of my honorable colleague, the Attorney-General, whose place I filled only for a time in moving the second reading of the Bill. That measure will have to be gone on with, and in view of its importance and of the fact that it has already been passed by the Senate, honorable members will, I am sure, be very anxious to see it disposed of. &#34;We are awaiting the receipt of the Defence Bill from the Senate, and that Chamber will have to consider the resolutions which we are now sending up to them, together with the motion relating to the Eastern Extension agreement. Taking all these matters into consideration, I cannot very well fix any time for the adjournment. I do not see that there is any probability of our adjourning over Friday. It is more than probable that we shall ask the co-operation of honorable members in transacting as much business as possible this week. The more honorable members give us their co-operation in that direction, the more nearly will they approach the consummation of their desire to leave these precincts. </para>
