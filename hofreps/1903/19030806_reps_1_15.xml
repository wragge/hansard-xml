            <para>As it has been repeatedly stated in Parliament that the existing regulation with respect to the guarantees required beforeundertaking the construction of telegraph and telephone lines asked for in country districts, and reported upon by the officers of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department in the States concerned as non-paying, are too restrictive, inasmuch us the cash deposit which has been asked for involves the immediate payment of a sum of money beyond the capabilities of the persons concerned, it has been decided to make an alteration which, while to a certain extent safeguarding the revenue, will afford material relief. </para>
            <para>Before proceeding to state the nature of the alteration, it may be well to point out that, under the System requiring a larger cash payment, the amount required to be deposited is placed in the Savings Bank, and is only drawn upon as far as necessary, the balance with accrued interest being returned to the guarantors at the expiration of the five years for which the guarantee is given. </para>
            <para>The alteration now determined upon is as follows :  - Instead of askingfor a payment in cash equal to two-thirds of the cost of construction and instruments, together with the actual operating expenses for the five years covered by the guarantee, it has been decided that, if the inquiries made by the Postmaster-General&#39;s officers in the several States are satisfactory (that is, that they show that there is a probability of the line asked for earning a moderate revenue at the expiration of five years),a cash deposit of 10 per cent. per annum on the cost of construction and instruments, and operatingexpenses, for two years, together with a bond to secure payment of any deficiency in revenue to the extent of 10 percent. per annum, plus the operating expenses for an additional period of five years, will be accepted, and the line, Ac, provided, if money is available. The payments under the bond to be made annually, and within a month of becoming due. If at the expiration of the period for which the bond is operative the line is not returning . 10 per cent. per annum and operating expenses, the Department to have the option of extending the period, if the guarantors agree, or failing such agreement, of closing the office and removing the line and instruments. It must, of course, be understood that these provisions will only apply to lines required in the public interest, and not to those required for private or personal purposes of individuals or companies. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I rise to continue the debate upon this very important Bill with a very keen sense, not only of its interest, but of its far-reaching importance. There is no doubt that attending the advent of the first Federal Ministry there were many difficulties and necessities which will not attend the duty of Ministers in a subsequent Administration. But this first Federal Ministry has had one great advantage, in having to bring before the House, from the nature of the case, a large number of measures which have been called machinery measures, and which should be kept as far as possible free from any party action or party tactics. We have a good illustration of that fact in the business which has engaged our attention during the present session. We have a Defence Bill, upon which there can be no party issues ; we have had a J udiciary Bill of similar description in that respect ; we have a Naturalization Bill ; and now we are dealing with a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. I suppose if there ever was a measure about which party feeling should not circle, it is a measure of this sort. The first question which occurred to me in connexion with this Bill, and it was a very serious one, was this : Is this an opportune or a proper time for introducing this particular measure for exercising the power, which has been given to us by the Constitution to deal with this particular subject? After very mature consideration I have come to the conclusion that the better opinion is that we cannot very fairly, since the Government have introduced the Bill, refuse to discuss it, for any reason based npon the time of its introduction. The object which the Bill has in view is so excellent, that one fears to incur the responsibility of awaiting some large industrial dispute in order to find ourselves without the necessary machinery for dealingwith it. Upon the whole, I have come tothe conclusion that the introduction of this Bill at the present time is justified. Thenext question for consideration is one which agitates the public mind very keenly at the present moment, and that is the question of economy. There is a very strong and a very natural desire, which I have no harsh words to describe, that in the beginning of this Federation anything like unnecessary or premature expenditure should be strictly discouraged. The prospect of establishing another court in the Commonwealth has, perhaps, led a numberof persons to be unfavourable to the introduction of this measure, but I am glad to notice that it is framed upon economical lines. In the first place, it really does not involve the creation of a new court, but simply the addition of a branch of jurisdiction to the High Court, because the  President  of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration is to be a Justice of the High Court. I do not suppose that Ministers intend under this Bill to endeavour to increase the number of Justices of the High Court which we have fixed in the Judiciary </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Bill. It is, perhaps, scarcely necessary that I should ask the Attorney-General to say whether the provision that this Bill, when it has become an Act, is to be administered by a Justice of the High Court is looked upon by the Government as giving them power to add to the number of the Justices. </para>

              <para>- I thought not, but perhaps it is just as well to clear away any possible speculation on that point. So that we are not in this Bill adding, so far as the  president  of the court is concerned, to the salaried officers of the Commonwealth. I do not know what the view of the House will be, but, when we come to deal with the Bill in Committee, I shall make a very strong appeal to the Committee not to appoint at the present time two other members of the court as permanent members at a yearly salary for a period of seven years. There is machinery in the Bill which enables an appointment to be made in each trade dispute of a representative of each of the parties to that dispute, and I think that, for the present, that machinery ought to be considered as amply sufficient, and until the necessity for appointing permanent members of the court is made clear. I think the least sanguine amongst us hope that this court will not often be called upon to deal with Inter-State disputes. The number of subjects upon which disputes will range beyond the- borders of one State is, I hope, limited, and I hope the occasions on which they will occur will be found to be more limited. I do think that we should not add a high salary to the expenditure of the people unless absolute necessity is shown for it, and I therefore hope that in this measure some alteration will be made to prevent these permanent appointments being immediately made. With reference to the Bill itself, we sometimes forget, though we should always recollect, that when, dealing with questions of this sort, our position is widely different from that of the States. The States within the sphere of their jurisdiction, have all the prerogatives of the Imperial Parliament. Whilst they legislate within the sphere of their powers - and their powers are not defined by any Statute, but include a wide range of parliamentary powers - the States Legislatures are entitled to pass Acts having an effect and a range of which the </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Commonwealth Acts, except upon one or two subjects, are incapable. This is one of the subjects upon which we cannot legislate with the freedom with which a State can legislate. We, in the exercise of our legislative powers, will always remain in one sense the creature of the High Court, because there is not an Act or a line of an Act that we pass which is not liable to be declared null and void, if, in the opinion of that court, it exceeds our statutory, not our constitutional, powers. The difference between a Legislature with constitutional powers as they are understood under our system of parliamentary government, and a Legislature which is a creature of statutory defined powers is immense, and it is very obvious in connexion with this matter, because the first question we have to consider - a question, to which I am about to address myself - could not possibly arise in a State Parliament. Before we seriously deal with this Bill, we have to consider what are our powers of legislation with reference to it, and we have to look to the words of the Constitution in order to discover them. Sub-section (35) of section 51 of the Constitution contains words which at  once  suggest considerable difficulty of interpretation. There we are empowered to make laws with respect to &#34; conciliation and arbitration.&#34; Now I would ask the question - &#34; with reference to what &#34; ? and the sub-section defines &#34; for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State.&#34; Those words which govern the whole of the sub-section point to the fact of an existing state of things, to a thing which has happened, a dispute which has extended from one State to another State. Therefore, the sub-section limited in that way to the investigation of known facts, has a considerable difficulty in it  owing to the introduction of the words &#34; for the prevention &#34; of such disputes. How can you prevent a fact which has already occurred <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The expression is not&#39; at all a precise one in view of the limitation of our powers. I take it that no one will endeavour to read the sub-section to mean that our powers relate to disputes which do not extend beyond the limits of any one State. I fancy that no reader of the Constitution would take that position, because if he did it would be idle to insert the words &#34; disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State.&#34; Those words are idle, unless they are intended to limit our powers, and, no doubt, the object at the time clearly was not to interfere with purely State matters, but to enable us to deal with those matters when they assumed an inter-State significance. </para>

              <para>- No ; because it is not necessary in reference to a fact to state that it must have occurred. However, I do not wish to labour this matter. It is onewhich requires consideration, and one which crops up in more than one form in connexion with the Bill. Now the Bill itself recognises the view I have put in two ways. In the first place it defines what an industrial dispute is within the meaning of the Bill. That is a most important thing to do. In defining industrial disputes it uses the words of. the Constitution, &#34; extending beyond the limits of any one State,&#34; so that the definition runs in a sense with the definition of the Constitution as I am interpreting it. There cannot be any dispute withinthe meaning of the Bill, except in the sense to which I shall refer, unless it is, as the Constitution says, a dispute which has extended beyond the limits of any one State. I am quoting the definition given in the interpretation clause. Clause 2 says - </para>

          <para>So that on the very forefront of the Bill the Government have, and I think properly, too, kept carefully within the express limits of the Constitution, and have declared that the Bill shall have relation only to such disputes. It is in one sense an inconsistent declaration, because two of the clauses of the Bill conflict with it. Of course we can. never forget, when we are considering the Bill, that we are really dealing with the result of the labours of the late Minister for Trade and Customs. No man has more freely and promptly acknowledged that fact than has the Attorney-General, and I am sure that, whatever our views may be with reference to the Bill, no one can read it without a clear impression as to the immense amount of labour and ability which has been bestowed upon it. Now, there is an inconsistency with reference to clause 2, which provides that the Bill is to have relation only to disputes beyond the limits of any one State. I need not trouble the House by referring to clause 36 at present, because it is vague and will call for some observations later on. But clause 37 provides - </para>

              <para>- In that sense the clause is strictly consistent with clause 2, if it has that meaning, and as I have said the interpretation clause gives the words &#34; industrial disputes &#34; that meaning. But the section is not worded with a proper view to our powers or the powers of the State. We cannot legislate with regard to anything that a State Industrial Authority can do or cannot do. A State Industrial Authority cannot do anything except under the authority of a State Act. Our powers cannot be imparted to that State authority, with reference, at any rate, to matters of this kind, unless the State authority under an Act of Parliament of the State is in a position to carry out what we desire. The next clause 38 is even more capable of criticism. It provides - </para>

              <para>- Yes. The interpretation clause defines &#34;State Industrial Authority&#34; as an authority establishedunder a State Act. Now, I am bound to point out that in States where there is no Act upon this subject, we have no power to legislate that the Governor of that State may request us to do anything. We have absolutely no jurisdiction over the Governor of a State to request him to do anything. He may do it under some local Act. The limitation, therefore, will have to be very carefully expressed. We do not want to trench even upon the susceptibilities of the States, and, clearly, the Governor of a State can only be the mouth-piece of the Government and the Parliament of the State. On the assumption that there is no State Act and no State Industrial Authority, the words require some consideration. I wish now to come to clause 4 which defines the objects of the Bill. Its first object is to prevent lock-outs and strikes in relation to industrial disputes. I suppose it is that object which really influences the public mind of Australia more than does any other object in connexion with the measure. It is this commanding inducement which has caused so many people, with certain inherited ideas of the range of government, to forget all their prejudices and all their views as to the proper functions of government, in view of thef act that the Bill comes so largely into conflict with the personal liberty of the individual. Theseideas have been set aside - as they have to be - I believe, more for that reason than for any other. The Attorney-General has given us all the poetry of which this matter is susceptible, and I do not desire to compete with him in a vein in which he is unexcelled. But I wish in a word or two to emphasize what he said in. this way : these questions between capital and labour are so interwoven, not only with the industrial, but with the social and political fabric that, upon that ground alone, it seems to me we are fully justified in making even daring experiments. I look upon this Bill purely as an experiment, and when we refer to the prevention of lock-outs and strikes as one of its chief objects, we must not forget that people who are equally intelligent with ourselves - the representatives of labour in the two greatest Anglo-Saxon populations of the world - are just as keenly hostile to legislation of this character as our friends in the labour bodies of Australia are favorable to it. It is a subject which is most interesting. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; and I am quite hopeful that the result of this experiment will shpw that even in the field of social economics, Australians can win victories and set examples which will teach the rest of the world. I admired the speech of the Attorney-General, because, whilst I was aware that for many years these matters had profoundly agitated the most acute intellects of Great Britain and the United States, he seemed to have settled all of them, if not entirely to their satisfaction, at least to his own. I only regret that we have not some other editions of my honorable and learned friend to spare for the benefit of other countries, so that these difficult problems of law, philosophy, politics, and history, which are unravelled so easily and gracefully by him, might also be adjusted in other parts of the civilized world. It is a source of infinite regret that there are not other editions of my honorablefriend available, and also that we could not possibly spare him even for the benefit of mankind at large. Upon one occasion Abraham Lincoln, one of the grandest figures in history, used an expression which will be regarded by the AttorneyGeneral as the veriest folly. He said - &#34;Thank God, we live in a country where men can strike.&#34; There is something lying at the root of that expression, we may be sure, seeing that it was used by that distinguished man. </para>

              <para>- I am quite willing to suppose that the honorable member is accurately interpreting the expression used by Lincoln.I simply called attention to that expression, which was quoted by the leader of the labour organizations in America only the other day with absolute approval. Indeed, I suppose that in the United States one may witness some of the most interesting developments of this question. There, many of the States have been so engrossed with the desire to settle industrial disputes that they have passed laws with reference to them. But in all America there is no State which has passed a compulsory arbitration law. There is only one instance in which the United States </para>

          <para class="block">Congress has interfered in these matters to an extent which might seem to restrict individual liberty. That case had reference to the transportation service, and in. the year 18SS a very mild measure was passed, which had no effect. In 1898, however, a further Act of a more effective character was passed, and it is rather interesting, in the light of recent events in Australia, to note that when the Bill was introduced into Congress its provisions included the seamen of the United States, who, however, made such a desperate protest against their inclusion that they had to be exempted from its operation. One of the provisions of that Bill was for arbitration, but not for compulsory arbitration, and it contained a further provision that no man could leave his employment without giving a certain number of days&#39; notice - I think it was 30 days. </para>

              <para>- Of course the intention was to bind both employer and employe. Before leaving the United States, I may say that the urgency of this question is very apparent there. We can quite realize that, because the painful and bloody disputes which occur in the United States in reference to industrial matters must shock the humanity of every observer. Still, in spite <inline font-style="italic">oi</inline> the terrible sanguinary development of these disputes there, the labour federations of the States resolutely opposed and condemned the introduction of the principle of compulsory arbitration. Their object in doing that, whether it is wise or not, is not difficult to discern. There is no doubt an enormous virtue in the overwhelming power of brute force, and sometimes that is all which the working classes have behind them. They are so entangled in that country in a mesh of corruption*, which  extends even  to the courts of the United States, that one can easily understand - -especially in view of what we have learned about injunctions issued by judges which have the effect of interfering with the actions of individuals under the heading of &#34;contempt of court&#34; - that the whole of these occurrences have probably poisoned the mind of the labour federations of America against anything of this sort.- I wish to say that in my opinion the attitude of the labour bodies of Australia in agitating for this system of settling industrial disputes may finally result in one of the last things that they would wish to accomplish. But from the aspect of things as they are, it seems to me that it reflects infinite credit upon the labour bodies of Australia, that they are willing to intrust their liberty - aye, even their subsistence - to judicial decision. I cannot understand the position taken up by persons who are not closely identified with the labour bodies of Australia, and who find in this attitude of those bodies something to denounce as if it were unwholesome, as if it were selfish, as if it were endangering the- stability of our industrial or political fabric. It is, in my opinion, one of the grandest displays of intelligence and a readiness to sacrifice the one weapon which labour has, that certainly has no parallel in any other part of the world. My great anxiety lies in the fact that the active power, which is to stand between these two great interests in &#39; times of conflict and excitement, is to be a Judge of the High Court. I entertain that anxiety not because I doubt the absolute impartiality of any possible Judge of the High Court, but because in dangers and difficulties which may come upon us, when the conditions of life are harder than&#39; they are now, there may be some degree of apprehension as to the entanglement of that high and pure tribunal of a British community in the desperate struggles of large bodies of  His  Majesty&#39;s subjects. The danger, to my mind, will not be to those who wish to intrust the Judge with these duties. The danger is that in time to come the unsullied and unquestioned reputation of our Bench for purity and impartiality may come, through the distorted vision of keen and bitter conflict, to be questioned. We are thus making an experiment, not only with the industrial classes, but with . our court of justice. I feel no reserve, whatever, in saying that the experiment is one to which there are a number of objections. It is an experiment which is surrounded with quite a multitude of fears, but there is one substantial gain which comes to us by this willingness, on the part of those who represent the physical strength of our Commonwealth, to place themselves under the reign of law and order, administered by a High Court of Justice. It has this great advantage : that under such conditions we may hasten the time when these two great powers will more clearly realize that when conflicting interests arise the proper relationship which they ought to bear, one to the other, should be more like that defined, and wisely defined, in some of the northern districts of England. There we find an institution known as the North of England Manufactured Iron Association, which, for 30 years past, has had a standing board of employers and workmen, who sit side by side at the same table, and decide matters affecting the trade. If they fail to come to a decision, they refer the matter to an outside umpire. During the last 30 years no less than twenty disputes affecting wages have been, dealt with by that great association of masters and men without a rupture. </para>

              <para>- There are a number of other cases. I am simply referring to this as one remarkable instance of the power of voluntary agreement and conciliation. I think that even those who intend earnestly to support this Bill must never forget that a voluntary  agreement arrived  at between these two conflicting powers without any loss of self-respect or any sense of personal defeat is worth a thousand forced adjudications by a Judge of the High Court. I suppose the most vital necessity in the relations of these two great powers is that there should be a loyal feeling on both sides. The master should have a generous feeling for those whom he employs, and those who are employed should exercise a loyal and friendly spirit to those for whom they work. Every employer must know that the labour of every man smarting under a sense of defeat in some great strife is worth something less than are the results obtained when these disputes are settled in a friendly, businesslike way. One of the advantages of settling these disputes in that way is that the arts of the advocate are thrown away. Appeals to passion made before such a board as that to which I have referred are idle, for every man sitting round the table knows all about the matters that have to be determined. The lawyers who are retained have not the same knowledge, and it is useless for them to waste time in making eloquent appeals to men who are familiar with the, whole subject. It is of no use to talk of the weight of such appeals as compared with the calm discussion of the subject by men who know all about the matters at issue. Therefore, voluntary agreement has the condition of perfect knowledge on the part of both the parties who have to decide the question. A Judge in the north of England was called in as an umpire in connexion with an industrial dispute - but not under a law of this kind - and although some of his observations would not be quite apposite, I think that he gave an accurate description of the state of mind in which even a Justice of the High Court would find himself when called upon to deal with such disputes. I refer to a statement made by Judge Ellison, which is to be found in a work by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. and Mrs. Webb,</inline> entitled <inline font-style="italic">Industrial Democracy.</inline> He was called in as an umpire, and at pace 229, Vol. I., we find the following statement made by him : - </para>

            <para>And when you have, done that, it is for me to deal with the question as well as I can ; but on what principle I have to deal with it I have not the slightest idea. There is no principle of law involved in it. There is no principle of political economy in it. Both masters and men are arguing and standing upon what is completely within their rights. The master is not bound to employ labour, except ut a price which lie thinks will pay him. The man is not bound to work for wages that won&#39;t assist (subsist) him and his family sufficiently, and so forth. So that you are both within your rights ; and that&#39;s the difficult}&#39; I see in dealing with the question. </para>

          <para class="block">Therefore, the first difficulty with reference to a Justice of the High Court is that he will start with an absolute want of acquaintance with all the facts connected with the dispute. The rules upon which the experienced, competent man could &#39; proceed will be unknown to him. But I quite agree that if we must have some person to decide these matters, if they must go in a contentious stage before a final authority, we must have a final authority who has the one indispensable qualification of absolute indifference to the interests of both parties. He must be in a position in which he is absolutely isolated from any sort of relationship with either or both of the parties. Therefore the method prescribed in the Bill seems to be the only one which can well be followed. I should like to see in this measure a provision that no organization shall be allowed to apply for an. adjudication in an industrial dispute, unless it can show that it has sought a voluntary conference to arrive at a voluntary agreement, and that that request has been refused, or that the conference itself has failed. </para>

              <para>- I should think there would be no objection to it. One of the best features about the South Australian Act - and in this respect I look upon it as being infinitely wiser than any other that I have seen on the subject - is, that it puts the sphere of conciliation in a prominent position. I am glad to see traces of the same object in this Bill. I spoke most strongly against the- New South Wales Conciliation and Arbitration Bill on that very ground. There are several stages through which these disputes should pass, before they come to be matters for a Judge to determine. The first is a voluntary conference, a refusal to hold that conference, or a failure of it. Secondly, there should be an attempt at conciliation - the whole power of the State and the court being devoted to the task of conciliation - of bringing these great bodies to consent to a friendly adjustment of their difficulties, which will send master and man back to their labour without any sense of humiliation or failure. The Bill very wisely enjoins that that conciliation shall be attempted, and that it shall be part of the express duty of the  president  to try to bring it about. The provisions on the subject, however, are rather vague. Every attempt should be made to obtain first from a conference a voluntary agreement, because it is more in accordance with the individual intelligence and independence of the men concerned, with the ordinary genius of our&#39; way of doing tilings, that the two opposing parties should exhaust the efforts of reason and agreement before force is invoked. The principle of conciliation seems to me to have been discounted and reduced to an altogether unfair position by a defect in the New Zealand Act, which is not repeated here. </para>

              <para>- I am very glad to hear it. For years past there has been in New Zealand an impotent Board of Conciliation, which the parties to disputes have known to have no sort of power. I wish to provide . for attempts at conciliation which take another aspect. The  President,  the man. who must be respected and regarded in the work of conciliation, because he has the  ultimate power of decision, should sit in the Court of Conciliation. Conciliation is the basis of all legislation of this kind. We have had attempts at conciliation all over the world, but the necessity for this Bill is the necessity for having power behind such attempts. Those who look upon the measure more as an arbitration than a conciliation Bill do it and the effort which it &#34; embodies an injustice, and I hope that anything which can be done in Committee to carry out and make effective attempts at conciliation will be done. There are some provisions which are capable of giving great trouble in the future. Clauses. 11 to 14: are intended to prevent employers from dismissing their men, and employes from ceasing to work on account of an award by the court. The object is a sensible one, but, as the clauses are worded, both employers and employes will be reduced to a pitch of servitude which I cannot think is the intention of the framers of the Bill. When an award has been given upon a dispute between two great industrial bodies, there will be no limit of time within which the employes concerned may leave their employment, or the employers will &#39; have freedom to discharge their men. If at the end of a year after an award is given a man desires to leave the service of his employer, the Bill throws upon him a liability to a proceeding in which he must bear the onus of proving that he is leaving . for some other reason than because the award did not suit him. So with employers, there is the liability to be brought before a tribunal to prove that in any action which they have taken in the dismissal of their men there is no element of an attempt to get rid of an award. </para>

              <para>- It might be. Such a limit might have the effect of nullifying an agreement - for, say, three years - for a longer term than the time fixed. I admit that the subject is a difficult one to deal with, but I do not think that I am abusing the patience of the House in pointing out these matters. It is better that we should deal &#39; with them than that the people outside should deal with them in some distorted and unfair manner. With reference to the provisions about a lockout or a strike, we must not think that the danger of such occurrences has been avoided, or that they will be prevented by the Bill. The danger is left under another name. All that the Bill does is to prevent employers from dismissing their hands, and employes from leaving the service of their employers in a body,&#39; if there is a dispute pending between them. </para>

          <para class="block">It is only when a dispute has extended beyond more than one State that the measure will operate, so that its provisions can refer only  to actual disputes extending  beyond more than one State. Therefore, the power of an employer to dismiss every man in his service without making any demand upon him, and the power of employes, subject to the requirement of having to give notice if they are. paid by the week, and similar conditions, to leave the service of their employers, is left absolutely intact so long as there is no dispute existing between the parties. The fact that an employer chose to discontinue his business would not constitute a dispute. In New South Wales the difficulty was that the shearers had not begun to work, and a similar difficulty would arise here if an attempt were made to apply the provisions of the measure in a case in which there was a practical lock-out or strike without a dispute. Under the Bill the court will have jurisdiction only over disputes, and disputes which extend over more than one State. </para>

              <para>- I have looked at the following clauses, but they all seem to me to turn upon the definition which I have read. My right honorable friend is practised in the art of bringing every one under the provisions of penalty clauses, but there is nothing in clause 9 which, it seems to me, can make the other clauses apply to anything but an industrial dispute extending over more than one State. We have no power to legislate for anythingwhich is not an existing industrial dispute extending over more than&#39; any State. Paragraph (c) of clause 39 is also open tothe objection to which I referred as to what a Governor of a State can or cannot do. I  now come to deal with perhaps the most important of all these clauses.  I refer to clauses 03 and 65, which really are the vital clauses of the Bill, as to the scope of the powers of the authorities. Honorable members will find that in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(d)</inline> of clause 63, there is provided a power in the court - always as regards &#34; an industrial dispute.&#34; which words must be read into this Bill at every stage - . </para>

              <para>- We do not desire to shirk this question. I could get up, and, after making a few complimentary remarks upon the Bill, sit down. But I say that we at least desire to show the people of Australia that we know what we are doing. I spoke in New South Wales against what is known as the common rule about as strongly as any man ever spoke against anything in this world. It shocked all my instincts of what was fair and just, but it waspassed, and I am bound to say that in New South Wales, so far as I know, there has been no sort of evidence that there is any real hardship or injustice inflicted by it. All through I am speaking of this departure as an experiment, and I am convinced that the common sense which leads one to endeavour to prevent these industrial wars will be found equally effectual to cure any wrongs or injustice which turn out to be real and substantial as the result of its administration. </para>

              <para>- The court may vary the award, and a person who finds the award specially injurious to him may apply to have it varied ; but, of course, if these variations are numerous the effect of the principle will be destroyed. However, I am supporting this Bill with a full knowledge that in this and some other respects it involves one of the most serious violations of all the principles upon which our system of politics and our system of justice have hitherto been administered. But, just as in martial law, all the sanctions and usages of civilized life disappear, is it not better that, in this case, they should disappear for a time in order to prevent the destruction, bloodshed, and hatred which these quarrels engender ? </para>

              <para>- I am coming to that point, but paragraph (e) to my mind raises very serious difficulties some of which are constitutional. There is a power in this paragraph (e) &#34; to direct within what limits of area, if any, and subject to what conditions and exceptions,&#34; and so on, the new conditionsproposed shall operate. I desire to point out that there a power is assumed which we do not possess. We do not possess the power to apply any rule&#39; all over Australia. I think if there is any contention that this power of settling disputes which have extended beyond more than one State will give a general power to govern States in which there is no dispute, it will not be found to hold good. The sphere of the award must be within the sphere of the mischief contemplated by the Bill. With reference to a lock-out or a strike, we must remember that since Western Australia and New South Wales have passed Arbitration and Conciliation Acts, and there cannot be a strike or lock-out in those States, strikes and locks-out dealt with under this Bill can be those only which will extend from Victoria to Queensland, skipping New South Wales, or from Victoria to South Australia and stopping there, or from Victoria to Tasmania. </para>

              <para>-It is quite possible that in a state of dispute the jurisdiction would attach. But reverting to the other point, we must, I think, make it perfectly clear that we are not claiming in this Bill a power to extend, a common rule beyond the State in which we are dealing with a dispute. I do not know whether the Government have any intention, in using these words, to assert such a power. </para>

              <para>- The only point with which I am concerned is that in our anxiety to do good we shall not forget our constitutional limitations. &#34;We must not show a disregard of the prerogatives of the sovereign States which are in the Commonwealth. They are in the Commonwealth, but they are still sovereign States in connexion with all subjects not expressly defined as within our powers. This is a paragraph which, to say the least of it, is couched in language too general and too loose to define properly our constitutional powers. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; but in a different way. The words here used are not words of limitation, but words of universal power. To say that the court shall have power &#34;to direct within what limits of area if any &#34; is to use language which usually means a power to act generally. That is the point I should like to have considered, and I refer to it simply as a matter which occurred to me in going over the Bill. This question of jurisdiction comes up in another way. Honorable members will see by reference to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(d)</inline> of clause 63 that the power to make a common rule shall be equal to the right to make a common rule applying to any industry affected by the award. That is rather a vague expression. We could understand a common rule applying to the industries which are represented before the court - we could understand the expression as applied to those two litigant interests. Suppose, however, that there were a dispute between two bodies, and some other bodies had, to a certain extent, a sphere of industry which overlapped. Is it contended that the common rule could be made to apply to industries not within the range of the industrial dispute before the court? </para>

              <para>- Those are all questions of fact to be covered by definitions. My honorable and learned friend the Attorney-General uses expressions which sound very beautiful at the time, but when the light has faded and we have to read his remarks by daylight, we sometimes find a wealth of language which affords no information. I wish to give a vivid illustration of that in connexion with this matter of the common rule. I wish, however, in fairness to say that this remark does not apply to the great majority of the sentences of my honorable and learned friend. I just happened to see this one, and I do not say there are any others in the whole of his speech. This one attracted my attention, and it bears upon the common rule and the range of it. The Attorney-General said that &#34; the common rule will not be necessarily the common rule throughout Australia.&#34; That expression gives us no information. Of course, it will not necessarily be the common rule throughout Australia, but the question is - Can the court make it so ? None of us know what a court will do in a given matter. No one can use the term &#34; necessarily&#34; in connexion with the award of any court, but when we are dealing with matters of jurisdiction we want something more definite than that. The first point is - Can this common rule be applied at all beyond the area of the dispute which is being adjudicated upon ? </para>

          <para class="block">I do not desire to be hypercritical. This is too great a question for anything of that kind. I only wish to point out substantial matters. But certainly that language does not prepare a man in a shop in Fremantle, or Brisbane, or Hobart, to learn that under this Bill his every day work - not only an employer, but a workman - is governed, or may be affected by a decision of the court of which he has never heard. I admit that every objection is to be discounted by the fact that we have such a great and pressing object in view that we must be careful that we do not, in the refinement of our difficulties and objections, destroy the broad benefit running through the measure. I do not wish to do that. There is another point we must not forget. There is a provision empowering the court to prescribe a minimum rate of wages, and to fix a lower rate in the case of persons unable to earn that minimum rate. This question of the minimum rate is, I suppose, the one most canvassed in labour circles all the world over. We do not know what the effect may be. It may work badly. If the minimum rate is to be regarded as the lowest reasonable rate, it may inflict the greatest injury on workmen ; and if, on the other hand, it is to be construed as the highest possible rate, then the greatest injustice may be inflicted upon employers. It is possible that the minimum rate may be held to be the highest rate. How any one could fix a minimum rate which would justly apply to hundreds of thousands of men,and the results of their labours, I cannot understand. </para>

              <para>- If it is designed to mean the lowest reasonable rate it will be far less objectionable to the employers. Of course, we hope that upon this question we are prepared to legislate in a spirit of absolute disinterestedness as between employers and their workmen. Even my honorable friends who represent more particularly the interests of labour will, I am sure, endeavour, as we all will, to deal with absolute fairness and equity as legislators who have great powers of interference with the occupations and interests of the different classes of the community. We are engaged in a most serious undertaking, and I am sure that we are all anxious to make it a success. The object of every one who wishes to support the Bill is to make it as little objectionable as possible, to disturb individual interests as slightly as possible, and to promote individual initiative and enterprise as much as possible. There is another point which requires very serious consideration in the interests of those working men who are not members of trades unions. I do not attempt to disguise my opinion that trades unions are the evolution of intelligence. So far as my reading and study of history and human nature have gone I have come to look upon a union - whether of employers or of men - as thef orm in which the most intelligent spirits assert their vitality and their power. I entertain no sort of unfriendliness towards them, but rather the opposite. I have the keenest belief in that sort of evolution which makes labour speak with one voice as much as possible, and which causes capital to speak with one voice as much as possible. With only two voices reason may prevail, but in the tower of industrial Babel what . hope is there of any rational settlement of the everlasting differences between these two great powers? But some provision needs to be made for those men who, whether rightly or wrongly, are not members of labour bodies, and I am now commenting upon the sort of organization which will be registered under this Act. I jim not referring to trades unions generally. The remarks which I am about to make - and I hope that the House will consider them - bear upon the difference between men who are members of organizations which are registered under this Act, and individuals who are not members of those organizations, because, when men are equally able and respectable, a legal preference is to be given to members of registered industrial organizations as against men who are not members of them. That opens up a consideration of this sort : we do not need to read much before we find that, just as the capitalistic employers have their methods of looking after their own interests so trades unions may possibly have their methods of looking after their interests. I suppose that when work is slack there will be nothing more embarrassing to the members of trades unions who will have a preference, than the efforts of a large number of persons who are engaged in the same calling to become members of their organizations. </para>

              <para>- Something must be done. For instance, if some provision were made in the schedule of the Bill as to the rules of these organizations - if some safeguard were placed upon the face of the law which would prevent an abuse of it, in the nature of an exclusion of men who desired to become members of these trades unions which will have a preference - it would only be a matter of common fairness, because it would promote the interests of the organizations concerned in a legitimate way. Every fairminded organization of labour must rejoice at an accession of strength. </para>

              <para>- I do not see any evidence of it. At any rate, the Bill does not provide for it as clearly as it should do. There is  another clause in this Bill, and  it is  practically the only other to which I shall to-day direct attention. I refer to clause 92. Perhaps I may be allowed to point out that I do not object to that clause, because it is impossible to make the measure a success without it. Therefore, I am not selecting it merely by w&#187;3&#39; of objection. But it must be remembered that, in the ordinary operation of this Bill, no labour body will come under its provisions unless it registers under it. The act of the labour bodies is a voluntary one - they need not come under its provisions if they abstain from registering. But the  employers  cannot escape from itS operation, because it applies to every employer, even if he be not a member of any organization. </para>

              <para>- I wish to point out that there are two parties to a dispute - the one who makes a complaint and the other whom he drags into the court. The language of the interpretation clause makes the matter perfectly clear. That is the clause to which we must turn for information as to the meaning to be attached to different words. In that provision, industrial dispute is defined to mean &#34; A dispute in relation to industrial matters arising between an employer or an organization of employers &#34; - I ask honorable members to note the alternative - on the one part, and an organization of employes on the other part.&#34; Now, au organization of employes under another interpretation means one registered under this Act, so that an employer who is not a member of an organization registered under this Act is liable to be taken into court by a body that is organized and registered. But the labour bodies -which are not registered are not liable to be brought into court by a body which is registered. To <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> mind, it is impossible to carry out the Act, unless some distinction is made. But I am sorry to say that in the discharge of our public duties we have reached this state of things : that if an honorable member declares his intention to support the second reading of a Bill, and ventures to criticise any word of its provisions, the public are at once told, &#34; Here is a nice contradiction. Here is a gentleman who is going to vote for the Bill, and who has been picking it to pieces for half-an-hour.&#34; That sort of  namby-pamby  business on the part of Members of Parliament is absolutely unworthy of this House, and of the people of Australia. It is our duty not only to think for ourselves, but to endeavour to have some regard for the rights and interests of others. In matters affecting capital and labour, we must remember that for the moment we should rise above the facts - that we are in a country where manhood suffrage obtains, where labour numbers 10,000 for every capitalist, and where we have to do or try to do as much justice to that one man as we should do to the 10,000 who are prepared to applaud our whole  souled  admiration of this measure. I am anxious - perhaps some one else would have done so later on - to take up this attitude before the public : I am anxious to say that lam aware of this and of that; that J. recognise the hardships of this provision and of that provision ; and that in the interests of this great experiment, I feel that we are bound, since we have to deal with the matter at all - and it is infinitely better to deal with it before a war than during one - to show every man whose interests are at stake, and . the public generally, that we know what&#39; we are doing. We are bound to show them that we are not accepting the Bill because it has been well and ably drafted by a distinguished man, but that we are subjecting it to the* keenest possible scrutiny. That is the course which I intend to follow from first tolast in the consideration of this measure. In clause 92 we have a power of the most arbitrary character ; but I say again that unless such a power were in the Bill itmight well fail at the critical moment. The clause is just as far reaching - and fairly so - in its effects upon the trades unions of Australia as it is upon the employers. The question of whether a body is registered or not is not considered in clause 92. A great organization of employers, for selfish reasons, might try to evade a tribunal oE this kind in a case of dispute ; on the other hand, a great body of employes, for similar reasons, might endeavour to evade this tribunal when the necessity for its work arose. But this clause, which I think is absolutely necessary, provides that if a dispute has arisen, and is of a character necessary to enable the Federal Court to deal with it, the court may have it brought before it. The hands of the court are not. to be tied at the most critical stage, perhaps, in our history, because some one or other has not registered. The effect of this power is that, given the constitutional right to intervene, the court can bring before it any body of employers or of workmen in a trades union. Of course, it would be manifestly impossible for the court to bring an individual before it, but any trades union, or branch of a trades union, may be brought before it. The Governor-General in Council will have to take the political responsibility for its action. But there is a safeguard, because the GovernorGeneral cannot take the action of bringing the parties before the. court except on the recommendation of the  President.  Thus, there is a double safeguard. We have first the initiative of the High Court and the responsibility of the Governor-General in Council. The power may in some cases perhaps bring Ministers into a very unhappy and delicate position. But we shall all hope that if this Bill is passed, whatever Ministry may be in power, will act firmly and fearlessly, without regard to. the power - of any body of employers or any .body of workmen. This court will have the full right to drag from its recess any trades union which is plotting mischief, or any employers&#39; federation which is similarly engaged ; there will be power to bring them, before the court and to adopt rules for- them. That is another new departure of an extreme character. If these bodies will not frame rules for themselves the court will have power to frame them for them. That is a provision which although unusual and extraordinary, is absolutely necessary if this Bill is to be an effective living instrument to effect the grand object for which it has been framed. No man is more sensible than I am of the multitude of points in which the provisions of this Bill seem to shock all one&#39;s instincts of personal liberty, and all one&#39;s desire to see a free Commonwealth composed of free and independent subjects. I cannot help feeling that this Bill, instead of marking, in one sense, an enlightened stage, is one of the most humiliating confessions that have to be made - that with all our civilization and development, these great powers have not yet become sufficiently civilized to be able to settle their disputes as other men are generally able to do. In no sense is this a triumph for humanity. It is a confession that the ordinary rules have failed, and that we have to grope about for some method which is clumsy, and, perhaps, inequitable, with all the hardships which are incident to a state of civil war, or martial law. But, still we, in this young Commonwealth, viewing the history of the great nations where these giant interests fight to a point at which human life is ruthlessly sacrificed - remembering that behind all these employers and workmen there stands that great helpless element in our national life, the women and children of Australia; remembering that the homes of labour will, under a Bill of this sort, be more secure from the misery of poverty, and the agitation and dangerous ebullition of class feeling; remembering the great humanity which deals with this imperfect state of things - will, I hope, cheerfully pass this Bill, trusting that the time will come when, under a more rational and voluntary arrangement of intelligent men representing these great interests, a method will be found of settling their disputes without any recourse to legal machinery. </para>

            <para>-I was indeed delighted to listen to the eloquent speech delivered by the AttorneyGeneral in introducing this Bill to the notice of the House. It seemed to me that a happy fate had directed that it should be his lot to introduce it. I felt that he spoke with the enthusiasm which he possesses for the subject of industrial conciliation, and with a force which it would be impossible to excel, and which was convincing evidence that he had the subject at heart. I know full well that he has, since it was my lot years and years ago to obtain his valuable assistance in framing, for the first time in Australia, a measure for industrial conciliation embodying the compulsory element. But, great as was my delight in listening to the Attorney-General, I was almost equally delighted by the remarks which fell from the leader of the Opposition. It seems to me that we have come to a desirable stage in Australian history, when both sides of the House are determined to address themselves to this all-important question, independently of all party considerations, for the purpose of achieving the best results in the interests of the whole community. It seems to me that in circumstances such as these it is evident that there is not likely to be any substantial opposition to the second reading of the Bill, and that it will be an advantage to get into Committee in order that we may address ourselves to the details of a subject with which we intend to deal liberally. I fully recognise all the difficulties which have been pointed out by the leader of the Opposition. Any legislation of this kind is of an experimental character. I have yet to learn that Australia fears to embark upon a course of legislation for which there is no established precedent. She is content to make her own laws for cases as they arise. As in the States legislation which&#39; was previously without precedent has been adopted with the most beneficial results, so I hope that here, in the Parliament of Australia, the same course will be followed, with equally good results. I first propose to touch shortly upon some of the observations which fell from the leader of the Opposition. My intention is to condense my remarks as much as possible, and to avoid travelling over the ground which has been trodden by the AttorneyGeneral, because it would be a work of supererogation to say what has been already said by him. The sooner we get <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> close quarters with the details of this measure the better. The leader of the Opposition referred to - amongst other matters - clause 2, which, he considers, clashes with clauses 37 and 38. Knowing something of the drafting of the measure, I know that it is not intended to do that, and, recognising the point which could be made as the clause now stands, I introduced into the first part of it the following words - </para>

              <para>- Their insertion would have prevented the suggestion which has been made that the clause is inconsistent with subsequent provisions, because the clause would have contained the declaration that it is paramount to all subsequent clauses - that we are dealing only with industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State, and that subsequent clauses which might be differently construed are not so intended, as such effect is specially provided against in clause 2. I hope that the Attorney-General, if he finds that the point taken is otherwise well founded, will try to meet the leader of the Opposition by the insertion of necessary words of the character to which I refer, </para>

              <para>- Yes, and I think that their insertion would have been sure to satisfy the leader of the Opposition. I take it that our object is to deal only with matters with which the Constitution empowers us to deal - disputes extending beyond the limits of a State. Here I should like to say this : The word &#34; prevent &#34; suggests action by the Commonwealth before a dispute extends beyond the limits of a State. We all know the advantage of earliest action in these matters. The sooner one interferes in regard to these disputes, the sooner opportunity is given for the &#34;interchange between the disputants of conciliatory expressions and views, the better. </para>

              <para>- The very thing. It is one thing to conciliate people on the borders of a dispute, before passion has been aroused and they are practically at each others throats, and another thing to interfere when they are in the heat of temper, and the veriest trifle may develop into a deep-seated grievance. I think that mollifying influences should bebrought to bear with all possible despatch. One might .just as well seek to organize a. fire brigade in the midst of a conflagration as to arrange for conciliation and arbitration when people are in the thick of a dispute. We hear of the rejection of proposals, for conciliation and arbitration. Why ? Because human nature generally wants to getall it can. I make no distinction between masters and men in this respect. I trust that in a matter of this sort I shall never make such a distinction. I say treat all fairly ; treat all alike. Such schemes as I have been associated with in this respect have, I venture to say, been marked by fair play. It has been my wish to provide for fair play. If any proposal which I havesubmitted elsewhere had been less fair to one side and more partial to the other, itmight have been received with greater enthusiasm by one side than by tha other ;. but I conceive that in a matter of this sort we have a sacred duty to perform. Justiceshould be the foundation of whatever provision we make. No special heed should begiven to one side or the other, butfair provision should be made for both. I defy any honorable member to find within the four corners of the Bill which we are now engaged in considering any provision whichmakes an unjust distinction between masters and men, or makes any difference at all between them. The advocacy of .the Bill&#39; must be founded on fair play to both masters and men to commend the measure tothe public mind, and to make it one of -which we shall afterwards be proud, instead of one of which we may hereafter be ashamed. The leader of the Opposition hascalled attention to the fact that the Bill differs in important respects from both theNew Zealand and the New South Walesmeasures. </para>

              <para>- In both New Zealand and New South Wales considerable success has been achieved by the laws in force there. But in New Zealand conciliation is provided for by boards and arbitration by a court. As a result, the conciliation hoards have been made the means of delaying and defeating justice, and the trouble and expense of investigations before them has had all to be gone over again in the Arbitration Court. In New South Wales there is noword of conciliation within the four corners of the Act. There, only arbitration and the giving of awards is provided for. There is no duty cast upon any one to try to bring the disputants together by conciliation. Here I reecho every word that has been said about the importance of a settlement being arrived at by conciliation rather than by the making of an award. But both the system of conciliation and that of arbitration are infinitely preferable to the present state of affairs when the settlement of a dispute is in no way dependent upon the right of the parties, but upon their might - might which may be opposed to right; might, which may be but fancied, but still rules. When agreement is obtained by conciliation there is no heart-burning, no feeling of resentment, no unwilling yielding to superior force, but, on the contrary, a sense that right has been done ; and each party is content to go on his way and to make the best of things. But when the strength of one of the parties is beaten down after a prolonged strife, and poverty, misery, loss of interest on capital, or threatened ruin has compelled a settlement, with what different feelings do the parties return to the renewal of the work upon which may depend their daily existence ? The beaten party is discontented, animated by feelings which we can well imagine, and which it is not necessary to describe. It looks to the future to bring about a reversal of the result of to-day, and is determined at the earliest opportunity to take advantage of any fancied weakness of its opponent to renew the strife. In New South Wales they do not provide for conciliation. What, then, do they do? They exercise the power when the parties come before the court by refusing to adjudicate. There is no trust or duty on the  president  or any member of the court to exert himself in the slightest degree to bring about a better state of things. The parties are left to their own resources. I am pleased to think that this justifies the course I took thirteen years ago when framing a Bill dealing with this subject. &#34;Under that measure, the  President  is at all times charged with the duty of endeavouring to reconcile the parties to industrial disputes. Under that provision much good has been done in the State from which I come by the interference of the  President  in disputes. The first  President  was the <inline font-weight="bold">Hon. Mr. Justice</inline> Bundey, and the second is  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Commissioner</inline> Russell, whose good fortune it has been to exercise a reconciling influence successfully in several disputesamong various classes. Let usselectforour  President  the highest judicial authority obtainable. As regards the High Court, this Assembly did not hesitate to make what was considered by its majority a sufficient provision - a provision far in excess of what the tribunal provided for by this Bill will cost. Yet I venture to tell honorable members that the avoidance of a strike such as the maritime strike of 1890 by the conciliatory influence of the  President,  or of a board of the character to which I have referred, would have saved Australia a sum far exceeding all the sums which have occupied the attention of the other judicial Courts of the States throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth for years. In disputes between private individuals, hundreds of thousands of pounds have been involved, but who shall over-estimate the saving to Australia had we been spared the disaster to which I refer? </para>

              <para>- Or the shearers&#39; strike. I do not consider the Bill likely to be called into operation in comparatively small matters, though there will be cases, and I hope they will be few, in which it will be necessary to interfere. But no State tribunal has authority to deal with disputes affecting more than its own State. Federal legislation alone can deal with such disputes. In view of the extent of the ramification of organizations which takes part in industrial disputes, State legislation is powerless. I can tell honorable members that it was the maritime strike of 1890 which led to the introduction of legislation in the various States - I allude especially to New Zealand and South Australia. I hope that we shall have no more strikes of that character. We feel that they are less likely to occur if we provide for tribunals which will satisfactorily deal with them when they arise, and will endeavour to nip in the bud troubles which may, if they are allowed to . develop, cause the utmost difficulty. No attempt is made within the four corners of the Bill to provide for dealing with a dispute before it extends to two States. But I am inclined to think that we have the power to prevent this exclusion. &#34; Prevention&#34; is the word used in addition to &#34; settlement.&#34; What does &#34; prevention &#34; mean <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Surely the interpretation of our Constitution is not of a character which will deny the most beneficial results. It is well that the court should have power to interfere to some extent when a dispute is likely to extend beyond the limits of any one State before it actually does so extend. It seems to me that that is included in the full interpretation of the law as we have it, and as it was intended by the framers of the Constitution. At the same time, I find no fault with the Government for not at this moment contending for that larger interpretation. In not providing for the exercise of the larger power under the Bill, I take it that they do not attempt to abandon the right to the larger construction. </para>

              <para>- At the same time we are experimenting, and as we proceed we shall learn. It may be wise - I think it is wise - at the present moment to proceed on the more limited lines ; but when, by the aid of the High Court, it is possible, or when it becomes necessary, to deal with the matter on a more extended basis, I hope that the Government will not be reluctant, not only to claim that power to which they are entitled, but to call upon the House to exercise it for the good of the Commonwealth. I think we do well to avoid the mistake which was committed by New Zealand in providing for a separate Court of Conciliation, and the mistake which was made by New South Wales in providing for no measure of conciliation at all. &#39;In this connexion I am interested in recollecting the fact that, in 189.1, I was examined before the New South Wales Strikes Commission, in Sydney, and had the pleasure of giving evidence, and of placing before them the Bill which I had drafted on the subject. On this particular point I was questioned, and answered as follows : - </para>

            <para>Under  3&#39;our  Bill you seem to do both under the same terms and under the same provisions ? - No. I give priority to the duty of reconciling the parties, and reconciliation is a question of agreement ; and if one party, by holding out, renders conciliation impossible, then I give the board power to make an award. I think it is better to confine these two powers to one tribunal, otherwise delay would be caused, and other conditions might intervene.  1  think also that by that delay one side might be encouraged to persevere in a position it would not otherwise adhere to. </para>

If you will refer to &#34;Procedure,&#34; clauses 44 and 45, you will see in clause 44 that every board shall &#34;carefully and expeditiously inquire into and investigate any industrial dispute&#34;; and in clause 45 it is provided that in course of such inquiry &#34; the board shall make all such suggestions, and do all such things, as shall appear to them as right and proper to be made or done for securing a fair and amicable settlement of the matters in dispute by agreement between the parties.&#34; That, therefore, is their first duty; but it then goes on - &#34;and, if no such settlement shall be arrived at, shall decide the question according to the merits and the substantial justice of the case.&#34; Then the matter of conciliation, as opposed to a final award, is emphasized by clause 40, which says - &#34; It shall be lawful for the board to temporarily refer the matters to a committee of their number, consisting of an equal number of representatives of employers and employes, who shall endeavour to reconcile the parties.&#34; I think it is clear that the first duty is reconciliation, and I provide several facilities in that way : and I only declare that, if no settlement take place, then an award shall be given. </para>
            <para>Your use of &#39; &#39; decision &#34; practically means &#34; adjudication&#34;? - Yes. </para>
            <para>But a Board of Conciliation proper could not decide anything: it could not come to a decision ? - This is a Board of Conciliation and Arbitration, and there is no doubt whatever about the functions it possesses. The term &#34;conciliation &#34; points to the primary duties of the board, and it is just as attractive as any other. </para>
            <para>Still you see there are two duties to perform ? - Undoubtedly. </para>
            <para>There is the double duty of conciliation and arbitration K - Undoubtedly. </para>
            <para>And in your opinion it is a question of detail whether you have one board or two boards ? - I should not like to have two boards. Speed and finality are desirable, and if the Board of Conciliation had no power to decide, you would be confronted with difficulties that did not arise in the first c-ise. </para>

              <para>- Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to have such recognition by any of the States, and when I notice that the House of Representatives of the Parliament of Australia is prepared to address itself to the task of conciliation and arbitration with an enthusiasm which has seldom been evidenced before, I feel that some of us may take pleasure and pride in having had some share in paving the way. I have never looked upon this as a party question, and I never will. I believe that this legislation is for the good of both masters and men.Who could overestimate the loss of wages whichhas resulted from strikes? Who could compute the loss of interest upon capital and of capital itself from similar causes ? To what more noble work is it possible for any of us to address ourselves than the furtherance of industrial peace, and how base is the man who thinks of party considerations in connexion with a question of this kind. Here I should like to say a word or two to honorable members regarding a matter upon which I can today speak with a freedom that I did not previously enjoy.In this connexion I have known no party, and have not hesitated to seek suggestions and advice from all quarters. Astonishment was recently expressed when the quarters in which I had sought advice were revealed, and I desire to say that my conduct has been consistent from first to last, and will continue so to the end. With regard to the first Bill I drafted the work was new to a considerable extent, and it was undertaken in the public interest. I was a private member, and I had no object but the wish to do what was right in a great cause. I drafted my Bill and I submitted it to all sections. Among others, I consulted my old friend and late colleague, the Attorney-General. There is no man, perhaps, from whom I have at times been more divided by party lines than <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon.  His  aid was also sought, and freely given. I recollect also that I have in my possession one of the original drafts of my Bill, annotated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> with whom at the least I was not associated politically at that particular time. I also have drafts returned which bear my indorsement &#34; Confidential ; any suggestions thankfully received up to such and such a date.&#34; These I received and acknowledged in every case. It is strange that when I am able to point to a record of this description it should now be suggested that I acted in the slightest degree unnaturally in what I did recently. I think I did right. I have always thought it a good thing to get the best information upon a subject regarding whichI wished to do the best work, and I chink that if more subjects were approached in that spirit the better perhaps might be the result. There was no secrecy in regard to the matter. In a speech which I made on the 17th December, 1890, in the Legislative Assembly of South Australia, I had not proceeded three minutes before J had informed that House of what I was doing. I am reported as having spoken upon the question as follows: - </para>

              <para>- There is no doubt about it. Now that it is known, Jet the fact be appreciated, and I am sure that honorable members generally will consider I am right in mentioning it with the permission to which I have referred. When I first introduced this Bill in 1890, the chief object which I had in view was to deal with questions of vast importance - questions such as the maritime strike which occurred in that year, and which was one of the worst industrial disasters from which Australia has ever suffered. I go further, and say that the same reason - the maritime strike- - animated <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reeves</inline> in dealing with this particular matter. The one  cause of special attention being directed to the question was the necessity for conciliation and arbitration to avoid disasters of the character I have mentioned. States may very well be left to deal with every-day industrial disputes within their own borders by means of their local legislation. The Bill provides that no organization of less than 100 members can bring a dispute under the notice of the Arbitration Court. Large matters, such as the maritime and shearers&#39; disputes, can, however, alone be dealt with by Federal legislation. Here I should like to call the attention of honorable members to the fact that in 1890, when I first spoke upon this matter, I recognised the necessity for interference, and that Federal legislation would be ultimately requisite for the satisfactory settlement of disputes of this sort. I spoke as follows : - </para>

            <para>It was difficult to find a subject of greater importance than the supply of facilities for the settlement of industrial disputes. At present there were no facilities whatever. As a result, contending parties in labour disputes generally attempt to wear each other out. People interested, either as employers of labour or labourers, had no means of adjusting their differences, except by having recourse either to a lock-out or to a strike. Those were two barbarous expedients. Lock-outs and strikes were productive of disaster, injury, and, in many instances, ruin to capitalists and employes. The waste of energy, the loss of capital, and the loss of the means of profitably employing capital and labour, were hardly possible to be over-estimated. They had had a terrible experience lately in connexion with one of the most important labour disputes in the civilized world - the greatest strike on record, so far as Australasia was.concerned. It would not be possible - however the Bill might be construed - for the Legislature to pass a Bill which would finally dispose satisfactorily of industrial disputes. The matter must eventually, on account of the extensive ramifications of the unions, become one for Federal legislation. (Hear, hear.) Still, each colony might strive to prepare the way for Federal legislation by introducing to the notice of its local Legislature such schemes as might appear to be effectual for the purpose. </para>

          <para class="block">Here I desire to call, the attention of honorable members to, the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reeves</inline> was induced to move in this connexion by the same cause - the maritime strike. He wrote as follows in a letter which was rerecently published in a New Zealand newspaper : - </para>
          <para>I now come to the question of mv indebtedness to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston.</inline> In the latter part of 1890, I came to the conclusion, as the result of the maritime strikes, that it was necessary, to try compulsory arbitration in labour disputes. </para>
          <para class="block">I would call attention to the origin of steps for industrial conciliation in the two States which I have mentioned, and I put to honorable members this : That in connexion with industrial legislation, long since initiated, strenuously fought for, and now about to bear fruit in the Federal area, we ought to make as sure as we possibly can that the cause of sailors and ship-owners shall be dealt with, and dealt with satisfactorily, by making provision for the prevention of the recurrence of those disasters which first directed attention to the need for legislation upon these lines. How far shall we fall short of our duty in this respect if, as regards the prime cause of all action in this connexion, we fail to deal satisfactorily with the matter to which I have referred - a strike which, though spent years ago, may all too soon recurl I am deeply concerned at this moment lest, in connexion with maritime matters, the Bill should pass in a form of which I cannot approve. Not only do I point out the origin - as regards <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reeves</inline> and myself - of the legislation which was introduced in New Zealand and South Australia, but I ask honorable members to recollect what has been the Federal feeling in this connexion since then. In 1891 I was attending .the Sydney session of the Federal Convention. There I endeavoured to obtain power for the Federal Parliament to deal with the question and it was refused. Afterwards, in 1897, in the Convention which met in Adelaide, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins</inline> sought to obtain the necessary power, and I did my best to support him. We were defeated, and it was not until the final session of the Convention, which was held in this very chamber in 1898, that we obtained the requisite power. We obtained it in the terms which have been referred to, but which we would have made much more elastic had it been possible to do so. In 1891, in 1897 and in 1898- every time reference was made to the importance of Federal legislation upon this subject - it was urged for the purpose of preventing a recurrence of the maritime trouble - the old trouble, of which we had had such bitter experience. The position at the present moment is that there is trouble ahead. Australian masters and Australian men are doing their best to continue an amicable arrangement as long as they can. The position is such that an agreement regulates the existing state of things until the 31st January, 1904; and that recently, in pursuance of the provisions of that agreement, which was entered into in December, 1902, the ship-owners and seamen met, when the seamen could not concede a proposal for a reduction of wages. The agreement at present operating is the only bond between the parties, and it expires upon the 31st of January of next year. The difficulty is that the ship-owners are exposed to competition of the severest character. As honorable members know, I believe in protection. I believe in protecting our local industries against cruel and unfair competition. I believe in the importance of the ship - owning industry. I believe in the preservation for Australia of the Australian coastal trade. I do not propose anything to the extent of preventing competitors who subscribe to the same conditions and pay the same wages from sharing in that trade. But I know the competition to which the Australian ship-owners are at the present moment subjected. Under the agreement to which I have referred, they have to pay - I am speaking roughly and am notoverstating the figures in the slightest degree - from &#163;6 to &#163;7 per month-- </para>

              <para>- Yes. What have we to do ? Is not America an intelligent nation? It is not a nation of which the world has reason to be proud. On no condition whatever does it permit our state of things to exist. I do not ask the House to go so far as they have gone. But I say that we should provide at least for equal conditions in our coastal trade. Who could seriously think of dealing more rigorously with our own people - with Australian ship-owners - than with foreign ship-owners? Who would dare to approve of such a policy ? Let any one who would dare to advocate it, stand before any audience in Australia, and I venture to say that his doom would be pronounced. Does this Bill deal with a competition of this kind ? I assert that it does not. Does it attempt to deal with it ? No. Does it provide equal treatment for all? Does it provide for the exclusion of the foreigner from our coastal trade? Nothing of the sort. The foreigner is to be free as the sunlight. Does it provide that when a foreign ship-owner interferes with our coastal trade he shall subscribe to the conditions to which Australian ship-owners subscribe? No. A distinction, and an invidious distinction, is made, but not in favour of our own ship-owners. We talk largely of our Empire, but we are favouring, not the British ship-owners but the foreigner. The first trouble in this connexion related to a German ship known as the <inline font-style="italic">Shamrock.</inline> Was it not an audacious assumption of the name? She came from Hamburg, where she was registered and manned, and the wages paid to her crew were of the character to which I have referred. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; I believe in fair play to our ship-owners as well as to our men, and if we carried the clause as it stands, there would be either a reduction of the wages of seamen, or the Australian shipowners would have to go out of the business. I have heard, time and again, complaints, and justly-founded complaints, on the part of people who have embarked their capital in . this direction, as to the nature of the competition to which they are subject. Protection was intended to do away in the home market with competition of the character to which I refer, and it has done so to a considerable extent. What is the position which ought to be taken up to-day in regard to our maritime industry ? Are we to allow this state of things to continue in relation to the foreigner? If so, down will come the Flag. If we passed the Bill in the shape in which it is now proposed, with no authority over the foreigner, and a case went before the court, what would be the result? If I sat as the  president  of that court, I could not in justice deny to the Australian ship-owner the right to reduce his seamen&#39;s wages. I could not do so because of the fact that he has to pay twice the rate of wages which the foreign ship-owner is called upon to give, and is exposed to competition which can be carried on at half the cost to which he is subjected. &#34;What case would the Australian ship-owner make out when before the court ? He would say - &#34; You cannot, as regards the foreigner, increase the rate of wages to the Australian level. How, then, amI to live? For the sake of the Flag, for the sake of fair play, and to prevent my ruin, do what you can only do - reduce the price and enable me to hold my place.&#34; How could we get away from such a position as that ? </para>

              <para>- Let us take care that it shall be: This is not a question relating to the fiscal issue ; it is a question of fairness and of justice. To select the foreign ship-owners for free admission to our coastal trade means that Australian shipowners and men must be the victims of cruel competition. That is the position today. The rule proposed to be applied is nothing except a further binding of those whose hands are already sufficiently bound. The cause of the trouble - foreign competition - is to have absolute freedom. I trust that the Attorney-General and his colleagues will not resist, in Committee, amendments such as may be necessary to give the relief sought, and properly claimable, instead of the mockery - that is the expression which I felt justified in applying to the Bill in this respect - of no relief. Instead of relief we have in the Bill a further binding of men who in no way require to be bound. The intruder is welcomed and freed from all restriction, but the native-born is bound again and again, and is left without help so far as the regulation of this competition is concerned. I venture to ask the House how such a position can be justified ? I pause for a reply. The creation of such a position never entered into my mind in connexion with an Arbitration Bill required for maritime purposes. What is the subject on which the masters and men chiefly&#39; differ ? It is the question of wages. Yet, there is no application of the provisions of the Bill to foreign ships and foreign wages. Foreign wages are to be the rule. The Dutchman, the cheapest worker in the world, and the most exacting ship-owner, are to be admitted free if their vessels fly a. foreign flag. Our own ship-owners, and the British ship-owners in some cases, are selected for regulation ; but we are not to regulate those who compete with them. </para>

              <para>- I have not spoken to them. Do not let any one be put off with the promise that the ship-owners will not alter the rates of wages for twelve months. For the sake of twelve months&#39; present peace, are we going to barter away our right to immediate protective legislation? I venture to think not. Put away those frivolous pretexts. Now is the time and opportunity for which we have laboured for years to pass a Federal law to deal with maritime matters, and is it to be used only for the purpose of hampering Australian ship-owners while it allows foreign competitors to go free? I never dreamt of a law of that kind. Whatever may be the provision adopted, I never dreamt that specially favorable treatment would be given to foreigners as compared with Australian ship-owners. Is that the sort of thing we thought we were getting ? When we were dealing with the restriction of alien immigration, we agreed to a provision which places bars and bans upon the crews of all ships not receiving current Australian wages, and are we to be told - as we are told - that the provisions of this Bill are to have effect only as regards British ships trading between Australian ports; that only the crews of our own ships are to be paid the current rate of wages, and that no restriction is to apply in regard to foreign ships or to ships which come from distant parts? I go further. How did the Privy Council rule in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Kingston</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Gadd ?</inline> That decision is fresh in every one&#39;s knowledge, and has been admitted by the Attorney-General to constitute authority for dealing as we please with matters of this sort. </para>

              <para>- It applied to ships which do not come within the provisions of this Bill. It applied to ships such as the vessels of Hie Orient Company, which finish their  voyages  in Australia. But this Bill does not apply to such vessels. Any vessel, and above all a foreigner, coming from abroad and finishing its voyage in Australia, or leading here for a voyage  to some  foreign part, is exempt, even whilst engaged in the coastal trade, from the operations of the Bill. We let the foreign-going, and especially the foreign-owned, vessels go free ; we allow them to cut down rates and compete with our own trade ; and we say that we will not lift a finger to apply the provisions of an industrial conciliation measure to them to save our people from the consequences of their competition. The case <inline font-style="italic">in re Keyn,</inline> over which the AttorneyGeneral lingered so long, is a decision which has nothing to do with this matter. That case was as follows : - A foreign ship on a foreign voyage happened to come within the three mile limit, and ran into another ship. Some one was killed by the collision, and a charge of manslaughter was laid, the jury bringing in a  verdict  of guilty. The question was raised whether the ship, being a foreign vessel on a foreign voyage, was subject to the criminal law. Thirteen Judges heard the appeal, and seven of them held that there was no jurisdiction, because, prior to the passing of an Act of the 28th year of Henry VIII., the Lord High Admiral of England had no jurisdiction over foreign vessels on the high seas proceeding, on foreign voyages, and as the statute transferring his jurisdiction to the Criminal Court only transferred the jurisdiction which he then had and nothing else, jurisdiction in the case under appeal had not passed. What on earth had that decision to do with the matter which I am discussing? </para>

The foreigner engaged in coastal trade in Australia is sharing that which belongs to us.

          <para class="block">But what we ure asked is to pass this Bill, and to look to the future for something in the shape of a Navigation Bill, which we are to be denied to-day. The right time to provide for the jurisdiction of the courts for conciliation and arbitration is when we are dealing with a Bill such as this. Why did not the Government introduce a Navigation Bill when dealing with the Immigration Restriction Bill, to insert in that measure the provisions which apply to the crews of vessels ? It is not necessary to have two .Bills. It can as well be provided in this Bill that Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration shall Iia ve jurisdiction over all vessels, foreign or local, engaged in the coastal trade as it can be declared in the <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> Navigation Bill. There is no virtu re in a Navigation Bill as compared with a Conciliation Bill, so long as the authority is constitutionally given by this Parliament ; we can confer it in either measure. There is no merit in a title. Surely a matter of title is not one upon which I would have, parted company with the other members of the Government. I venture to consider that the matter of the disagreement was something substantial. In my opinion it is a substantial cause  for a difference  to say that those who stand in need of immediate Federal  legislation in  connexion with maritime matters, and for whom such legislation was chiefly intended, are, instead of gaining relief from sufferings which they have endured in a competition which is hardly to be borne, to be still further denied it, and to be left to the future t0 hope for that which, even if given now, would have been all too long delayed ? </para>

              <para>- If seamen ever look to the Minister for Defence for a vote in favour of this reform they will look in vain. When the Ministers talk as they do now of this as going to be done, but not just at the present time, a delusive picture is drawn for the public gaze of the members of the Cabinet going before their constituents, and unanimously advocating the reform which I ask. The Minister for Defence does not intend to do that. He knows perfectly well that what I say is so. A picture has been drawn for public acceptance which I venture to think will never be realized. The interruption, of the right honorable gentleman, if it lets out anything at all, lets out an amount of light which renders it impossible for honorable members generally, or for the public, to hope for the realization of the picture which has been drawn for their acceptance, but which his attitude renders impossible. </para>

              <para>- The right honorable gentleman need not try to bother me by seeking for statistics on that subject. We know full well what has been the position for years past ; how the seamen and shipowners have been appealing for relief. I stand in this position : I was asked by the seamen&#39;s representatives what the attitude of the Government would be in regard to, first, a complete Navigation Bill;  secondly,  iti regard to a short Navigation Bill dealing with wages, <inline font-style="italic">&#38;c.;</inline> and, thirdly, iri regard to a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. All of them were in my department. As was my duty, I stated that I could not indicate what the attitude of the Government would be until I had consulted those who could authorize me to speak. I met the men pursuant to appointment here to give them the answer which I told them I could not give without authority. What I told them then was this : &#34; A complete Navigation Bill ? No. Such a measure would be too lengthy to pass this session. A short Navigation Bill? No. A Conciliation and Arbitration Bill ? Yes.&#34; Knowing the circumstances as I then did - and they are now known to all - I made that statement by authority. But would it have been decent of me to tell the men that a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill applying to their case would be introduced when I had reason for thinking that such a Bill would be introduced as would give them no relief ? I venture to think that I should have done wrong indeed in saying that if I had thought that the relief they sought would not be afforded. They asked for three measures ; two of these I denied for the reasons given, and the third, I told them, would apply to their case. How would it lie in my mouth to stand and defend a Bill which would not give relief to our Australian  seamen  from the competition of foreign. crews and of oversea ships ? How could I, after my promise, introduce a measure which would not have applied to their case, and which would have been of no use to them, seeing that it would afford them no protection against the reduction of their wages to an equality with those paid to their cheapest competitors in the Australian seas ? . </para>

              <para>- There is only one authority, and that is the Cabinet or its head. I was sorry, as honorable members know, to sever my relations with those with whom it was a pleasure to work, and with whom I have been associated for a long time, but it would have been a sadder day and a sorrier day if, after having led the representatives of the seamen to believe that relief would be given, I had stuck selfishly to my seat in the Cabinet when my pledged word had been overruled and set at nought. What could I have done ? Could I have mentioned the word &#34; conciliation &#34; to them whilst I knew that the Bill would contain no provision applying to them? They asked for bread. This would, indeed, have been a stone. Was it thought that I would do such a thing wittingly ? How could I mention a Conciliation Bill and lead them to suppose it would apply to their case, while I knew that it would give them no relief in that respect ? Though I should have been glad to continue in a work in which I have been engaged, early and late, for a matter of- fourteen years in one way or another, a work which has made many of the clauses now before us for consideration familiar to me, it seems to me that I had better stand here as a private member, as I am, and advocate the cause in which I believe rather than resist, as I should have had to resist their claims under the trammels of those with whom I was associated in the Ministry, and who, in differing from me, would have been exercising a right to which they were entitled. Proud as I was of my Ministerial position, I am a prouder and better man to-day than &#34;if I had surrendered my principles. There has been some talk in the press with regard, to my return to office, and statements have been made as if I had receded, or had thought of receding, from the position which a fortnight ago I felt it to be my duty to take up. I never contemplated anything of the sort. I now appeal tomy old colleagues to give these men the relief for which they ask, not at some uncertaindate, but now. Now is the golden opportunity, which may be grasped by means of Federal legislation. &#39; The relief 1 ask for istheir right, and if it is conceded in the Bill I promise that I will sit behind my old friends, that I will work day and night, that I will slave day and night, until theAustralian seamen are permitted by the equitable award of a competent.court to befreed from that foreign competition which is so cruel, and which everything possible should be done to remove. </para>

Derham, the  president  of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures, states that thisis hurried legislation, but he is apparently oblivious of the fact that the Government put this measure in the forefront of theprogramme which was announced when the Prime Minister spoke at Maitland, and of the further fact that almost every candi-&#39;  date for election to this Parliament expressed his opinion one way or the other, and that the great majority of honorable members were returned as supporters of the general principle of compulsory arbitration. Under these circumstances it seems to me that it should be described rather as delayed legislation than as unduly hurried. In view of the important position in which this plank was placed by the Government at the last election, and the  important position  which it occupied in the Governor&#39;s opening speech this session, I think that the Bill should have been introduced some time ago, in order that we might give it that full consideration to which it is entitled before the House is. prorogued in October. However, I think that there is still time to pass the measure after fair consideration. I am encouraged to believe this, because the right honorable the leader of the Opposition, and a number of honorable members who follow him, as well as the Ministry, are in accord with the members of the labour party so far as the main principles of the measure are concerned. When we assert that there is necessity for legislation of this character, we have to consider the conditions which govern industry at the present time, and I think it must be generally admitted that of recent years the general industrial conditions have become so changed as to necessitate altogether new legislation. In the old days, individual employers gave far greater consideration to the fair claims and the necessities of their employes than has ever been done by the vast trusts and corporations which now conduct industrial concerns, and of which it has been said that they have &#34;neither body to be kicked, nor soul to be damned.&#34; Employers of the days gone by were prepared to pension their worn-out workmen, or were prepared to find them work more suited to their &#39; advanced years, and, although they paid them less wages, they did what they could, generally speaking, to make the conditions comfortable. I could quote quite u number of instances in New South Wales in which proprietary or joint stock companies have been formed to take over large works formerly carried on by private employers, such as I have described. These companies have absolutely changed the conditions, have introduced sweating iis . far as possible, and have shown no consideration whatever for the feelings of their workmen. We find&#34; that change going on all over the world to-day, and as labour begins to recognise that the ten- dency of the large industrial companies is inimical to the rights of the individual workman there will be a greater probability of strife,  locks-out,  &#39;and strikes, working untold injury to the community. To my view, strife is almost inevitable in the absence of regulation by the State. It is a.ll very well for people to say that the lion must lie down with the lamb, or that capital and labour must work hand-in-hand. That idea is not carried into effect to any great extent, and it is not likely to be under our present competitive system. While competition lays its iron hand upon the employer, he is, in many cases against his own desire, constrained to reduce wages far below what he believes to be a fair rate. When I was  president  of the Sydney Trades and Labour Council, about ten or eleven years ago, I joined others in waiting upon a number of employers, and asking them to give their employes shorter hours, and to support a general movement for the early closing of shops. One employer said - &#34;I quite admit that the hours worked by those in my employ are altogether too long, but the shopkeepers on every side of me are allowed to keep open as long as they choose, and if I close my establishment one-half of my trade will go to those unscrupulous people who will insist upon having their pound of flesh.&#34; He said that he was prepared to give any reasonable sum towards a fund with the object of setting on foot an agitation for a State regulation of the hours of closing. That applies to thousands of cases. I remember another case in which tailoresses were concerned. They were receiving comparatively fair wages : their wages were not high, but they were sufficient to keep body and soul together. They were receiving 9d. per pair for making trousers, when a man came along and reduced the price to one-half, or 4Ad. per pair. He secured contracts at a much lower rate in consequence of being able to impose on the necessities of these people who were anxious to find employment of some sort, and, as a result, he was a thorn in the side of all fair employers in the city of Sydney, who were compelled to make reductions, although they did not go so far as he did. I cite this instance for the purpose of showing that the inevitable tendency of the present competitive system is to bring employer and employe into conflict on many occasions. In Australia we have had a very- bitter experience of strikes. As an officer of a trades union I have never advocated strikes. I have always looked upon them - though I was a unionist even prior to the time when I finished my apprenticeship - as a last resort. In the absence of legislation upon industrial matters, and without trades unionism, I believe that the worker would be poorly off indeed, because very frequently, even though a strike may not succeed, the. fear of its repetition prevents attacks being made without very considerable reason, and thus mimimizes  the number of outrageous attempts on the part of unscrupulous employers. Therefore, whilst </para>

          <para class="block">I believe that strikes are necessary under some circumstances, I recognise that even when they are successful they inflict such injury on the individuals who are most affected, as well as upon the State as a whole, that we should make any experiment within reason, adopt any expedient, and go to any length rather than suffer their continuance. So far as Australia is concerned, we are not in the condition that some newspapers would have us believe. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> recently wrote as if the Common weal th were free from any industrial trouble at the present time. What about the coal strike at Outtrim, which has been in progress for the past six months. That was not brought about by the initiative of the men ? In that case an attempt was made by the employers to reduce the wages of the men by nearly one-third. They were engaged upon piece-work at so much per ton. Naturally the men objected to such a sweeping reduction. They offered to submit their case to arbitration, but the employers - as is too frequently the case - refused to be conciliatory, aud declined to accept anything short of absolute . submission to their terms. The men have repeatedly offered to submit their case to arbitration. That strike has now continued for six months, and has undoubtedly inflicted a great injury upon the people who are chiefly concerned, as well as upon the State of Victoria. It cannot be a good thing for Victoria that these mines should remain idle all that time. Of course, it is alleged that the strike has ceased, but from what I can hear it is a long way from being finished at the present time. The men who were originally locked out are still insisting upon their right to work at reasonable wages. </para>

              <para>- In this particular case, I dare say that the wish was father to the thought so far as the employers and the newspapers were concerned. Throughout Australia it is true that there is not just at the moment a probability of a strike amongst the shearers, but every year there is the possibility of trouble of that sort occurring. It occurred last year in New South Wales. I do not desire to debate the wisdom of enteriug upon such a strike, but I do say that those who have followed developments, so far as wool productionin New South Wales is concerned, must admit that there is substantial reason why the men should be paid an increased wage for the shearing of sheep in that State. We know that during recent years the sheep-breeders have succeeded, by means of selection, and by using only good stock, in adding materially to the weight of the wool in the fleece, and incidentally have created a concertina-necked sheep, which is exceedingly difficult to shear - at any rate very much more so than was the lighter class of sheep. That is another question which will have to be dealt with within a comparatively short time. I hope that all these matters will be settled satisfactorily by conciliatory methods. Our experience, however, is not such as to justify that hope in all cases, or to do away with the necessity for such legislation as we are now considering. I hold that it is the duty of the State to interfere. All over the civilized world that duty has been recognised in one form or another. It is true that outside Australasia no country has adopted a compulsory arbitration law, but attempts have been made all over the world to devise some method by which the State can assist in the speedy settlement of these disputes, the undesirability of which is universally recognised. In New South Wales and other States the voluntary method has been tried, and without success. The New South Wales Parliament passed a system of conciliation which depended upon voluntary movement on the part of the individuals concerned. </para>

          <para>Mr.WATSON.- I intend to deal with that matter at a later stage. We gave that Act a fair trial, and it proved practically a dead letter - so much so that eventually Parliament struck the salaries of the members of the court off the Estimates rather than continue in existence a tribunal which had no work to do. I was one of those who voted for the omission of their salaries under those circumstances. The action of the Legislature was a confession that the Act had failed. In Great Britain we find that the conciliation boards set up by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mundella</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ritchie</inline> - although they did some good - have failed to prevent loss. Big strikes are continually occurring. In Germany, the Courts of Conciliation have succeeded in settling about 4 per cent. of the disputes that arise, and in France - where the longest trial has been given to the semi-voluntary system - a trial extending over almost a century - they settled some 10 per cent. of the disputes. All these facts go to show that the voluntary system is not the success which some people would have us believe. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W</inline> alpole, the Secretary of the Employers&#39; Federation in Melbourne, assured the good folk of that organization last night that the voluntary system would achieve all that is desired. How any gentleman who has investigated what is transpiring all over the world can seriously make a statement of that sort I cannot imagine. </para>

              <para>- It is a good old phrase, and in reply to those who use it I might mention that about twelve years ago I was not very much enamoured of the idea of compulsory arbitration. It seemed to me that considering the class bias which prevailed in the Legislature of those days, and bearing in mind that that bias was to&#39; some extent reflected in the appointments to the Judicial Bench, it was not a wise thing for us - when we had some chance of winning by means of a strike - to hand over to a body in which we were unrepresented the power todetermine all the industrial troubles which arose. Further I had doubts at that time as to how we could insure that a strike would terminate with the pronouncement of any judicial decision. In this connexion I am glad to acknowledge that the first inkling which I gained of a satisfactory way out of that difficulty was when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> and afterwards <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reeves,</inline> publicly put forward the proposals to make trades unions responsible before the court, to make their funds responsible, and thus influence their members. With regard to compulsion, I might point out that the whole basis of society rests upon compulsion in one form or another. At any rate we must adopt the appearance of compulsion if society is to be preserved. Of course, compulsion does not obtrude itself upon our views as such. Why? Because the great majority of the people are law-abiding. They know the law, and are loyal to it as the expression of the will of the citizens generally. When, therefore, it is asked - &#34; How will you get the trades unions to abide by the decisions of the Arbitration Court ? &#34; my reply is that the moral effect of a union declaring a strike off - even though it be, as in the case of the recent Victorian Railways strike, by the unauthorized act of the executive - will be so great that the trouble will at once lose the dimensions of a strike, and resolve itself into a dispute with a few individuals. It will cease to be a representative movement, and therefore will be practically within control. So far as compulsion is concerned, I hold that we see it exercised every day. When the first Factory Acts were introduced in England 100 years ago the cry was raised against them, both by employers and political economists, that they would have the effect of ruining British industry. I suppose that the same old cry, that they would drive capital out of the country, was also raised then, just as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Derham</inline> has been telling us that owing to the restrictive legislation passed in Victoria during the last few years capital is being withdrawn from this State. </para>

              <para>- Quite so. We have long had this objection to any interference with the conditions of employment or with industry. It has been raised concurrently with the development of the factory system. Every attempt to prevent sweating, every attempt to prevent&#39; the employment of child labour in the horrible way in which it was utilized up to 100 years ago and for a considerable time subsequently, has always been opposed on the ground that we have no right to interfere by law with the industries of the country. I contend that the State has an absolute right to say under what conditions any industry shall be carried on, and has the right, if the necessity can be proved &#39; for the assertion of  that  right, to pass any legislation as between employer and employed. The day of <inline font-style="italic">laissez faire</inline> has passed.  We are not likely to be guided by that doctrine now, especially in view of the fact that we have- some little experience of the action of our neighbours in New Zealand to work upon. There is one other aspect of this question to which I should like to refer, and that is that in supporting compulsory arbitration, the labour party are assailed by two sets of people. When I speak of the labour party, I do not mean to suggest that they are the only reformers in the land, but those who have associated and combined under the title of the labour party are assailed in this connexion by people who belong to the two extremes in politics. On one hand, they are assailed by employers of the class of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Derham,</inline> and similar hysterical personages who fear-- </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Derham</inline> is a strong advocate of protection for the employer, but he is rather weak in his advocacy of the protection of the employed. We have the extreme individualist and the fearful man on the employer&#39;s side, opposed to compulsory arbitration. The labour party has just as many bitter, if not more bitter, opponents in the extreme reformers on its own side. Although the labour party as a whole throughout Australia&#39; have adopted the principle Of compulsory arbitration, we find that even to-day there is a considerable section of extremists, both in Victoria and New South Wales, who scout any idea of handing over their liberties to any tribunal such as is contemplated by this Bill. This feeling on the part of the extreme reformers is, perhaps, similar to that which moves the British and American trades unionists in their opposition to compulsory arbitration. I believe that the ground on which the British and American unionists  oppose it to-day is that which led the trades unions of Australia to oppose it some twelve years ago. In those countries they are practically without representation in Parliament, and they have not even an opportunity of making their voices heard, much less their votes felt, so far as the action of the Judiciary is concerned. </para>

              <para>- Yes, as the leader of the Opposition pointed out, they have much greater cause to fear the Judiciary - I refer not so much to the Supreme Court Bench as to the minor courts - of the United States. But in any case, as exemplified in the repeated injunctions invariably issued against the men by the American courts, they have every reason to fear courts constituted on such a basis. The trades unionists in England have only quite  recently  adopted the view that it is a proper thing for them as unionists to take part in politics. They are coming round to the position which was decisively agreed upon in 1S90 by the trades unions of Australia and New Zealand, so that the fact that they do not now see eye to eye with the great body of unionists in Australia on the question of compulsory arbitration does not mean that they will continue to occupy that position. We find <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cronin,</inline> a representative of one of the strongest, unions in Glasgow, strongly upholding the idea of compulsory arbitration, even in the present circumstances. </para>

              <para>- I have been looking through the debates of the last two Labour Congresses held in England, in September, 1901, and September, 1902, and I find that the smaller unions were almost invariably in favour of compulsory arbitration. Some of the large unions also favoured the principle ; but those constituting the large majority of the total membership of the big unions were against it. They were led to adopt that view by a variety of circumstances. </para>

          <para>It seems to me that that gives the key to the position in Great Britain. It is not that the trades unions prefer - so far as many of them are concerned - to rely altogether upon the blunt and boomerangfashioned weapon of the strike, but that they have no confidence in a Parliament into which they cannot send representatives save at an enormous expense. There is no payment of members, and they have to meet all the governmental expenses of election. They are, therefore, placed at a great disadvantage in securing representatives of their own classes, or of their own way of thinking, in Parliament, and they are unable for that reason to criticise the acts of the Judiciary from a responsible vantagepoint. </para>

              <para>- That is so. I believe that public opinion will have that restraining effect upon improper decisions. That is what I meant to suggest. I do not believe that the mere clamour of some individuals - myself amongst them, perhaps - should have any particular weight on aJudge who is fit for his office. But I think that we need not have any apprehensionas to the broad lines of justice upon which, cases of the kind dealt with in the Bill will&#39; be determined. Assuming that the labourbodies generally will lose something - that they will not get the full measure which they might obtain if they resorted to the arbitrament of an open struggle - I believe that in the long run the average gain under the decisions of the court will be higher than that obtained under the old system. I believe that will be the result, after allowing for what they would lose in the attempt to gain anything at all under existing conditions. In my opinion, strikes without a law of this kind have, on the whole, helped to improve the position of the working men ; but under a law such as this I think that on the average they will do better than they would by resorting to the method of striking. One other feature which I might mention is this : <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Derharn</inline> says that by this legislation it is proposed to hand over the country to socialists and faddists. </para>

              <para>- Yes, and generally with unsatisfactory results. I wish now to say a word or two in regard to the experience of New Zealand. Although their Act has been in operation only for some eight years, a period which is too short for the experience gained in it to be a certain guideas to the result of compulsory arbitration under all circumstances, that experience should be instructive to us. I especially wish to refer to the New Zealand experience because there has been circulated in my district and in other parts of the Commonwealth a series of misstatements and most damnable half-truths in regard to their Act and its working. They have had practically no strikes in New Zealand since the Act was introduced, and although we were assured some little time ago that the people there are chafing under the restrictions of this legislation, I must say that during a visit I made to the colony last summer I found no indication, in either the North or the South Island, of any but one opinion on the question of compulsory arbitration. When the Bill was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reeves,</inline> the opposition in Parliament was fairly strong, and its opponents in the press and among the public, especially among the employers, were exceedingly numerous. But last summer I found the concensus of opinion almost unanimous in favour of the measure, so that the parliamentary opposition has abandoned the intention of repealing or seriously amending it, and has recognised that it would be a forlorn hope to try to convert the people on the subject. I do not wish to assert that the prosperity which New Zealand has undoubtedly enjoyed during the last eight or ten years, and particularly since the Act has been in existence, is due only to its operation. It would be foolish to do so. But it is quite fair to refer to the material improvement of of the conditions of New Zealand during that period to meet the arguments of those who say that the Act has operated detrimentally to industry there. Perhaps the surest evidence of the incorrectness of that statement is, not the development of agricultural production in the colony, which is, no doubt, due to some degree to the Closer Settlement Act, which has thrown more land open for settlement and cultivation, but the development of the manufacturing industries, which come more particularly under the operations of the Conciliation and Arbitration Law. According to the New Zealand <inline font-style="italic">Year Book for 1902</inline> the number of factories increased between 1896 and 1901 - a period of five years - by 704, the number of males employed in them by 12,452, and the number of females by 1,885, a total increase in the number of males and females employed of 14,337. To show that there was not a disproportionate increase in the employment of females, as was complained of by the leader of the Opposition some time ago in regard to the factory conditions here, I may mention that the increase in the employment of males is equal to 54.17 per cent., while that in the employment of females is equal to 42.81 per cent. </para>

              <para>- In 1896 the wages paid to males and females amounted to &#163;1,907,000, while in 1901it was &#163;3,098,000, a difference of &#163;1,191,000. Those figures take no account of the wages paid in the Government railway workshops and printingoffice, and exclude the dressmaking, tailoring, shirt-making, millinery, and other similar businesses, in regard to which no figures were collected in 1896. The value of the land used in connexion with factories shows an increase of &#163;649,000, the value of the buildings an increase of &#163;676,000, and the value of the machinery and plant an increase of &#163;837,000; a total increase in five years of the capital invested in factories of &#163;2,163,000. As I have indicated, I do not wish to place any dependence for the &#34;purposes of this argument upon the progress of industries dependent upon agricultural production, such as meat freezing and preserving, tanning and fellmongery, cheesemaking, and so on, although I may remark in passing, that the increase in the production of those industries&#39; in the five years was &#163;3,867,000. It is of more importance &#34;for my purpose that the increase in the output of factories specially subject to the operation of the Act amounted to &#163;2,703,000. Those figures show that the employers of New Zealand have very largely increased their invested capital, and pay much bigger sums in wages now than they did in 1896, notwithstanding the restrictive nature of this legislation. Here is another fair comparison. The total production of 1900 showed an increase over that of 1895 of &#163;7,591,000, while the increase at the end of the previous period of five years was only &#163;775,000. It may be objected that this prosperity is largely due to New Zealand&#39;s natural resources, because she has good land and a good rainfall. I do not think, however, that she has as much good land as Victoria has, and while in some places the rainfall is too great, over a large area it is not nearly sufficient for agriculture, though it may be large enough for pastoral purposes. I should like now to quote a few opinions upon the New Zealand experience. The first is that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd,</inline> an American, who wrote a book called <inline font-style="italic">A Country Without Strikes.</inline> He approved of the Act, and congratulated the people of New Zealand upon having passed such a beneficent measure, and he advocated the introduction of similar legislation to that of the United States, of which he is a citizen.

              <para>- That is indeed interesting. I am sorry that I have not the names here. It is satisfactory to find that a Commission comprised of men who do not belong to the labour party - there was only one labour man on it- and who are therefore not so likely to be prejudiced - speak in this congratulatory strain upon the working of the New Zealand measure. The Employers&#39; Federation have circulated a most misleading statement in connexion with the report of the Royal Commission, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Outtrim</inline> was <inline font-weight="bold">chairman. Mr. Walpole,</inline> who objects to the Victorian Factories and Shops Act, says- </para>

          <para>When I put it this way before the country, people told me I was talking nonsense. </para>
          <para class="block">That is a remarkable instance of their insight. He goes on to say that the report of the Royal Commission confirms his statements. That was untrue. The Commission recommended that a move efficient measure should take the place of the factory legislation then in force in &#39;Victoria, and that something more comprehensive and more elastic should be provided. They suggested that instead of the  Chairman  being an individual of comparatively no standing, or a man not sufficiently known to cause the people to place reliance in his decisions, a Judge of the Supreme Court should be placed in the position of arbitrator or umpire. The Factories Commission report upheld the principle underlying the Factories and Wages Boards.. And yet we find a man so foreign to any sense of what is decent that he circulates the story that the report of the Commission substantiates his objection to the principle of the Factories Act. The Commission said that the Factories Act was defective and provocative of trouble between individuals, and they recommended a more comprehensive and wholesome method of overcoming the difficulties that had to be surmounted. Before I pass away from New Zealand legislation, as to which I have just been quoting the opinions of some people who are qualified to pass a judgment, I might refer to another misstatement that is being circulated by the Employers&#39; Federation with a view to prejudicing the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> says - </para>

            <para>The effects of the Act (that is, the New- Zealand Act) on industry are well shown in the case of two of the largest industries of New Zealand. For instance, boots and shoes, on which there is a duty of 22&#163; per cent., the quantity imported in LS94, before the Act came into force, was of the value of &#163;139,000; while, in 1901, under the Act, it was &#163;21.1,000. The importations of slop goods and apparel in 1894 were valued at &#163;301,000 ; in 1901, with a duty of 25 per cent., they reached a value of &#163;4(53,000. </para>

          <para class="block">That is one of those half-truths which are accepted sometimes as equivalent to fact. If he had wished to be fair, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> would have shown the increase in local production. I have not been able to ascertain the increase in the amount of the reexports to the islands with which Now Zealand does some trade, but apart from that, it is sufficient for me to show the increase which has taken place in home production. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> shows that the an- nual  importations of clothing and boots and shoes had increased during the seven years, from 1894 to 1901, by &#163;234,000, I was unable to obtain the value of the output of the articles mentioned in New Zealand during the year 1894, and therefore the comparison cannot be mad&#39;e complete, although the omission may tell rather against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> than in hisfavour. From 1S95 to 1901, or ti period of one year less than that quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole,</inline> the increased local production of boots, and clothing was &#163;242,000 per annum or- &#163;8,000 in excess of the increase in the importations of those articles. The deduction intended to be drawn from the statementcirculated is that the effect of the New Zealand Arbitration Act has been to hamperlocal manufactures, whereas, as a matter of fact, they have considerably increased since the Act has been in operation. Another statement made in reference to the New Zealand Act is that it is working to the disadvantage of the employers and is creating dissatisfaction amongst the employes. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> has referred to the award which was made in the painters&#39; case. I admit that in that case it appeared to me that the Judge of the court did not appreciate his position. The court made an award with regard to the employment of painters to the effect that from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. certain wages should be paid, that from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. an increased rate should be allowed, and that after 10 p.m. a double rate should apply. Some employer wished to start his men before 8 o&#39;clock in the morning, and an application was made to the court for an interpretation of the award, and, notwithstanding that the award provided .that between <inline font-style="italic">i0</inline> p.m. and 8 a.m. certain rates should be paid, the Judge interpreted the award as meaning that the double rate should not be paid after 12 p.m., or to men who started work in the morning before 8 a.m. I was in New Zealand some time ago and inquired into this matter. The men did not object to the alteration of the award or to the interpretation placed upon it, but they took exception to the fact that no notice was given to them,, and that they were not represented when the application was heard by the Judge. They were justified in expecting that they would be notified of any application for an interpretation of the award, and they very properly complained that the Judge had altered the award without giving notice to the parties affected by the alteration. I do not see that that tells in any way against the Act. Now, coining to the experience in New South Wales, it has been urged that, because the shearers&#39; strike occurred after the Arbitration Act came into force in that </para>
          <para class="block">State, the Act has been proved a failure. It does not follow that because a particular Act has failed in detail the principle upon which it is based is not a good one, or that it cannot be applied with effect as a general rule. So far as the shearers&#39; dispute was concerned, I believe that, if the Act had been strictly followed, that might have been referred to the Arbitration Court, and would have been so referred. The Act contemplated the recognition of only one union, either of employers or employes in any particular trade, industry, or calling. The Registrar allowed the registration of two unions in the same calling, which was totally opposed to the spirit of the Act, and the court held that it had no power to interfere with his decision. </para>

              <para>- Yes, and I think that in this Bill we should take care that the court and not the  president  or the Registrar should decide where conflicting applicants for registration are concerned. It is a matter of the highest importance that we should register only those organizations which represent the great majority of the men employed and which are undoubtedly <inline font-style="italic">bon&#226; fide.</inline> The organization which is registered against the Shearers&#39; Union, and which is called the Machine Shearers&#39; Union has been demonstrated to be an employers&#39; organization. As compared with &#163;227 received in the form of subscription from members, &#163;1,200 was received in the form of donations, and the only persons who made donations were employers. It was an employers&#39; organization, which was intended to act as a buffer between employers and the Act. That is one of the defects that we can remedy, and which the authorities in New South Wales are now seeking to remedy so far as their Act is concerned. Then I may point to the fact that, but for the existence of the New South Wales Act, there is no doubt that very serious strikes would have occurred recently in the coal-mining industry at Newcastle and in theIllawarra district. Again, at Broken Hill to-day we find a dispute which is equivalent in its importance to that which occasioned so much bitterness and loss a few years ago being amicablysettled before theArbitration Court. Although, in New South Wales, the Act has been in existence only a short time, its results have been of a very encouraging nature, and I am glad to say that a large proportion of the employers who were formerly opposed to the compulsory system of arbitration are now in favour of it. Indeed, I believe that, within a very brief period, the majority of the employers will favour the compulsory clauses of the Act. I am just reminded by the honorable member for Fremantle that the experience of a compulsory arbitration law in Western Australia has been a very satisfactory one. I do not claim for a moment thatthisBill will settle all the important disputes which may arise, but if it settles only 50 per cent. of them the result will be an immense gain to those immediately concerned as well as to the general community. We can, therefore, afford to overlook the instances, put forward by interested or ignorant persons, of the failure of the Act in the States in one or two particulars. It has been said that the success of the law in New Zealand is no criterion that it will ultimately prove successful, because that country has been enjoying a season of unexampled prosperity. I say deliberately that a large measure of that prosperity is due to legislation of this character - legislation which was denounced as an interference with the liberty of the subject, and which, it was declared, would shackle private enterprise. As an old New Zealander, I well remember that seventeen or eighteen years ago the trade of that country was depressed, industry was almost nonexistent, and men and women were ill-paid from one end of it to the other. Yet its resources then were just as good as they are to-day. These facts go to show that the prosperity of New Zealand is not to any extent due to causes other than legislation of this character. Whilst it is true that, coincidently with the working of this Act, New Zealand has enjoyed prosperity, on the other hand New South Wales has not experienced unduly prosperous times during the period that the Act has been in operation there. During a period of depression in that State, consequent upon the drought, the Act has worked satisfactorily. Notwithstanding the almost complete wiping out of a large proportion of our agricultural and pastoral resources, it seems as if the Act is going to give fair satisfaction. In considering the necessity for the present Bill,of course we have to bear in mind the limitations imposed by the Constitution. In this connexion, I may say that I. disagree with the manner in which the Bill seeks to limit the application of laws such as these under the Constitution. Section 51, subsection(35),of the Constitution, says that the Commonwealth may legislate upon matters of conciliation and arbitration &#34; for the pre-  vention  and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State,&#34; whereas the Bill under consideration will apply only to industrial disputes which extend beyond the limits of any one State. The omission of the words &#34;prevention and settlement of &#34; has some significance. In my opinion, the Bill limits the power which, under the Constitution, we have a right to exercise. I hope to see the Bill exercise to the full the powers conferred under the terms of the Constitution. To my mind, the words &#34; prevention and settlement &#34; imply that we are justified in taking cognisance of a dispute which at the moment may exist only in one State, but which there is reason to fear will, if not prevented, extend to another State. Under the Bill it would be necessary to wait till the dispute had extended beyond the limits of one State before the machinery provided could be brought into operation. I contend that if there is any virtue whatever in legislation of this character, it is more important that we should prevent disputes from arising than that we should settle them after they have occurred. Therefore, I trust that the Government will make the language of clause 2 harmonize with that employed in the Constitution. Bearing in mind the class of disputes to which we are entitled to apply legislation, I think there is a necessity for a measure of this kind. In the first place, a number of industries exist, the interests of which are scattered all over Australia. Leaving the seamen out of the question for a moment, I would point to the case of the wharf labourers. Their interests are common, and are simultaneously affected right round the coast of Australia. The shipwrights occupy a similar position. Then it is possible that a shearers dispute may affect more than one State. To a large extent their organizations are, at present, federalized, and later on I understand they will be completely federalized. Then there is another class of industries which deserves some attention at our hands. In several of the States at the present time there is practically no factory or other regulating: legislation, so far as industry is concerned.. I fear, .therefore, that, unless something isdone to insist upon a rough equalization of the conditions under which labour shall be employed in certain industries, so faras climatic and other influences will allow - provision, of course, being made for difference in the cost of living - those industries will gradually gravitate to the States where no legislation exists, and where unrestricted competition holds sway. I do not think that any one would desire that state of affairs to be brought about. Take, for instance, the case of the women workers, whose wages in New South Walesand Victoria are regulated by an Arbitration Act and a Wages Board respectively. I am told upon very good authority that a large amount of work which was formerly done in the Sydney factories has recently been sent to Brisbane, to be turned out at sweating rates, . because it will pay the firms concerned to bring the goods from the Queensland capital to Sydney, rather than have them manufactured locally at the reasonable rates which prevail. </para>

              <para>- In New Zealand the same difficulty has been experienced. Applications were made for an award of the court in the three large Southern centres of Dunedin, Christchurch, and Wellington. No such application came from Auckland, with the result that the court made an award which affected each of these three large towns. The position in Auckland was that the employers and employes came to an industrial agreement without invoking the aid of the court - an agreement under which the rates fixed were lower than those which the court, had decided upon in the case of the towns mentioned. As the New Zealand Act applies to provincial districts, and not to the whole colony, the court could not alter the agreement entered into between the Auckland employers and employes, but it felt that, as the goods manufactured in that city entered into competition with those produced at the other centres, its only alternative was either to force the Auckland rates up a little, or to reduce those of Dunedin, Christchurch, and Wellington. I mention this circumstance, to emphasize the fact that in connexion with quite a number of industries, the products of which come into competition throughout the various States of the Commonwealth, we are justified in asking that some regulation shall be insisted upon in order that those interested may be given a fair chance of competition. Coming to the provisions of the Bill relating to seamen, I desire to say that I sympathize very largely indeed with the view entertained by the right honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston.</inline> He takes exception - I think very properly so - to the peculiar restriction which the Government have imposed in exempting seamen from the operation of the measure. </para>

              <para>- The omission of any apparent restriction of that kind seems to me to carry us to this extent : that even if we go no further, the matter will be left open to be dealt with under the Navigation Bill; that anamendment of this particular provision will not be necessary in order to maketheNavigation Acteffectivein its operation through this court. I do not say that that is all that need be done. I believe that we should take advantage of the first opportunity which presents itself to give some measure of protection, not so much to the ship-owners, but to the men who are employed under these conditions. Both sections, of course, are entitled to consideration ; but I think that there is a greater suggestion of trouble in this direction than the Attorney-General indicated a few days ago. I understand that the executive members of the Ship-owners&#39; Federation have indicated their unwillingness to consider any proposition such as hasbeen indicated for an extension of the duration of the present agreement. </para>

              <para>- I do not know that any written application has been submitted, but I understand that a verbal application has been made. I contend that in the first place we have no right to seek to extend to British ships any conditions that we are unwilling to place on the shoulders of foreign ship-owners. I have a strong feeling in favour of giving privileges to British shipowners - including in the term, of course, our local ship-owners - which we would not extend to foreign ship-owners. I certainly think that we should not adopt the converse position and go to the extent of imposing disabilities on those who are employed locally. I admit that one has to be guided by the possibilities, and I am so anxious to have this principle affirmed, and to have the benefits of the Bill conferred upon the many thousands of men throughout Australia, that I am not going to risk the passing of the measure because of any desire which I may entertain that it should be carried, at the present moment, to its fullest possibility. I am desirous, at the same time, that we should do everything in our power consistently with the passing of the Bill to see that a fair and adequate measure of protection is assured to the seamen. They have to work under conditions which entitle them to every help at our hands, and I trust that the House will be willing to extend it to them. </para>

              <para>- I think that a mistake has been made by the Government in specifically excluding civil servants from the operation of this Bill. It is all very well to talk about the rights of the States, and to say that civil servants are on a plane different from that occupied by the ordinary industrial units of the community ; but we must recollect that railway servants have been specifically included and brought within the operation of the New Zealand Act. In New South Wales railway servants as well as the employes of the Harbor Trust, the Water and Sewage Boards throughout the State, and all such semipublic bodies have been brought within the provisions of the State Arbitration Act. Those bodies are all under commission, and, in a degree, are managed independently of Parliament, but their servants are Government employes, and are on the same plane as are the railway servants of Victoria. </para>

            <para>- Yes. My contention is that a few weeks ago we very narrowly escaped a Federal railway strike. So far as the dispute affected Victoria, I am convinced that had there been an Arbitration Court in this State, as there is in New South Wales, there would have been no strike, no bitterness, and no loss. </para>

The power of the Federal Government is invoked simply because a strike of railway servants would be an interference with the carriage of the United States mails. If that policy is adopted in the United States of America, where there is no general pretence to invest the courts with power to adjudicate on these matters, but simply a desire to protect the carriage of the mails, surely if there was a likelihood of the extension of the strike beyond the confines of one State, we should be justified in saying to the State which refused to take action to quell the disturbance in a fair and reasonable manner, &#34;Such an occurrence must not take place.&#34; </para>

              <para>- I am aware of that fact, but I referred to the stoppage of the mails in the United States of America only by way of illustration, and as showing the extent to which we should go in view of the fact that we aim at something more than do the people of the United States. We have a right to interfere. It is all very well for local people to say that the States Parliaments are the guardians of the rights of their own service. We know that in practice that principle amounts to very little. To what extent were we able, for example, to control the Minister of Defence in regard to the detailed application of the money which Parliament voted for defence purposes? We gave an expression of opinion in a certain direction, but the right honorable gentleman overruled the opinion, and said, &#34; I will save money in a different way.&#34; I do not say that his action was improper, but I contend that it is almost impossible for a Parliament to devote the time and attention necessary to sift out the relative value of each person&#39;s work or the conditions under which he labours. That remark applies with particular force to the branches of the public service in which mechanics and artisans are most employed. A Parliament could not find time to go into all the details of any trouble under which such men laboured. It can lay down broad lines of policy, It can vote a lump sum for the railway or any other similar service ; but it is almost impossible for a Parliament of even forty or fifty members to attempt to obtain anything like a detailed control of the service. </para>

              <para>- Our experience of Select Committees in New South Wales was the reverse of satisfactory, so far as any serious work was concerned. This is one of the directions in which I think the Bill should be amended. I arn sorry that the Government have not seen fit to make some provision for the exclusion of lawyers from the court. I say this in no spirit of antagonism to the legal profession. I recognise the need for good lawyers in the community, and certainly the need for a little moral regeneration so far as some of the legal profession arc concerned! But the experience in New Zealand is that the parties are able to do without lawyers, and the result is that cases have been decided at an infinitesimal cost. A few pounds has been found absolutely sufficient to carry every case through the court. Each party to a dispute is represented before the court by its secretary or some such responsible person, who in most cases knows quite as much of the details at stake as could any lawyer. </para>

          <para class="block">New South Wales, where lawyers are allowed to appear in the Arbitration Court? There one party to a dispute selects a good lawyer, and pays him a huge fee, and the other side naturally feels constrained to pledge its last shilling in order to secure the services of a man of equal ability. That is one result, and an even worse result is that a man feels that the Judge, accustomed as he has been to the legal procedure of a court, is encouraged, by the appearance of lawyers before him, to rely to a greater extent than he ought to do upon legal forms and technicalities which should not be entered upon. I know that the Attorney-General quoted an opinion given by Judge Cohen as to the need for lawyers in the court. I have the greatest respect for that Judge, who is an able and fair minded man ; but, at the same time, he was noted in the ordinary courts for the fact that he placed a good deal of reliance upon the technical aspects of the law. That tendency, perhaps, leads him now to be rather glad of the assistance of legal gentlemen, when a case is being considered by the Arbitration Court. </para>

              <para>- One of the members of this House is a lawyer who is a secretary to a union. That, however, is not the practice in New Zealand. Probably the unions could not afford to pay lawyers to act as secretaries. In my opinion, as an experiment we should exclude lawyers, and if afterwards it is found necessary to allow them to appear, we can amend the Act. I am informed, however, that the experience of New Zealand is that money is saved by excluding lawyers. </para>

              <para>- It depends upon the resources of the weak. Without wishing to say anything derogatory of lawyers, I think that the man who has most money can secure the best talent, and that the party having the best talent is most likely towin. I think provision should be made for the varying of agreements. Under the Bill an agreement may be entered into between an organization of workers and an organization of employers, and if it is registered under the rules of the court, its operation is equivalent to that of an award. I think that the court should be empowered, in the event of a dispute in regard to the same trade or calling being brought before it by other parties, to vary such an agreement so as to make it harmonize with any award which it may make. </para>

              <para>- I do not think so. The court appears to have no power to vary an agreement once it accepts it. The matter is, however, only one of detail. There is one other principle of the Bill to which I shouldlike to devote a word or two, and that is the preference which is given to unionists. I agree with the leader of the Opposition that ample provision should be made to insure that the court shall have power tolay down the conditions under which men may be admitted to unions which are now in existence, and I believe that it is necessary for several reasons to give preference to unionists. In the first place, the basis of this Act is the recognition of the unions as responsibleentities. They must be recognised at all points as responsible parties. </para>

To guard against it, it is necessary to provide that no man shall be penalized because he is a member of a union, and has made a complaint which, in the opinion of the court, is justifiable. Preference should be given to unionists so long as unions do not become close corporations. We should give the freest opportunities to persons desiring to earn their livelihood in particular industries to join the unions governing those industries, and to compete for whatever work is available. </para>

              <para>- The general spirit of unionism to-day is not so restrictive as the right honorable gentleman thinks. Before the maritime strike, the wharf labourers&#39; and coal lumpers&#39; unions in Sydney asked for a deposit of &#163;5 before they would consider an application from persons desiring to become members, and they elected new members very seldom. I, as a member of the Trades and Labour Council, denounced that kind of unionism at the time. I said that we had no right to ask for certain conditions for unionists, and then prevent people from joining the unions. </para>

              <para>- Yes, though I think that the court in that instance went too far. I feel that we are justified in passing this legislation, and although the honorable member for Wentworth has stated that we have had only a short experience of the working of the New Zealand Act - and indeed of any legislation of this character - I say that we have had a very long and somewhat painful experience of the absence of such legislation. Even though it be true that we shall not succeed in settling disputes in every case, and that there will be occasional failures, I think that the sum total of the operation of the Act will be a huge benefit to the peopleof the Commonwealth. I desire to see something like fixity of conditions given to industries generally, so that we may escape from the uncertainty and trouble which has been so frequent in the past. </para>

          <para>- This clause provides that the permanent military forces shall at all times, and that the members of the citizen forces shall, when on active service and at all times when on duty or wearing their uniforms, be subject to the Army Act. That provision has been modified to some extent by omitting the Articles of War from the definition of the Army Act in the interpretation clause, but this is a form of legislation to which I have a particular objection. The Army Act means any Acts amending it or in substitution for it, and for the time being in force, and the members of our Defence Forces would therefore be subject to any amendment of the Army Act, however stringent it might be. I agree that perhaps it is convenient to provide that in times of war the Army Act shall apply because it contains a great many provisions that are applicable to such circumstances. But it seems ridiculous to provide that every member of a rifle club who has to do his one day&#39;s annual training shall be subject to the various stringent conditions of the Army Act, which are as unknown to him as the contents of a Babylonian cylinder would be to us. Surely we are capable of drafting: our own Acts and regulations for the discipline of our forces ? The Defence Act of Victoria provided that only after a proclamation had been issued, calling the troops out for active service, they were to be subject to the Army Act and regulations. I do not see any reason why we should not declare exactly what legislation shall apply in times of peace and times of war. There are about 200 sections in the Army Act, a great number of which are entirely inapplicable to our circumstances in Australia. They would subject our citizen forces to a number of disabilities and to punishments to which, I am sure, honorable members would never agree. </para>

        <para>My object is to alter the clause so that both the permanent and the citizen forces shall be subject to the Army Act only while on active service. I admit that in time of war it is necessary that we should have stringent conditions applying to our soldiers. All the ordinary rules of society have to be suspended at such a time. The forces must be absolutely pliable instruments that can be made to do whatever is wanted, and therefore it is necessary to have the fullest control over them. In time of peace, however, the case is different, and we may very well rely upon our own Act and regulations. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HIGGINS</inline>(Northern Melbourne).I suggest to the Minister that this clause should be postponed, because it is really of more importance than appears at first sight. Having regard to the fact that we have amended the Bill so that even our permanent forces cannot be compelled to serve abroad, the Army Act is wholly inapplicable to the Altered conditions. The Act involves the principle that men shall be at the absolute disposal of the authorities and liable to go wherever they are told. </para>

            <para>- I am very sorry that the Minister entertains such contempt for his officers in Victoria. Apparently, he resents the action of any honorable member who ventures to criticize his Bill. I desire to point out that the Imperial Army Act may at any time be so altered as to impose upon these States conditions which would absolutely deprive our soldiers of any liberties which they enjoy at the present time. In addition it must be remembered that the definition of the Army Act includes not only that Act but future Acts of the Imperial Parliament amending it, which really hands over all legislation to an outside body. Under that Act, any officer who attempts to commit suicide is cashiered, whereas a common soldier is imprisoned. Similarly, if an officer becomes intoxicated whilst upon duty he is cashiered, whereas a soldier convicted of the same offence is either imprisoned or fined. Further, if an officer embezzles any of the regimental funds he is cashiered. </para>

            <para>- He could be cashiered, whereas a common soldier would be sent to gaol. I would also point out that there is a good deal of doubt as to whether, by a general order issued under the Imperial Army Act, the punishment of flogging does not apply to the Army. Certainly that statute may be as good as the Minister for Defence wishes us to believe, but I think that the Committee ought to be made acquainted with its provisions. </para>

          <para>- I do hope that the Committee will not go so far as the honorable and learned member desires. The Imperial Army Act is a code of penal law for the government of the Army. That, together with the Articles of War and the King&#39;s Regulations, which have not been embodied in this Bill, is the law which governs the Army.. They were originally called Articles of War, but in 1881 they were revised and passed into law in the form of the Army Act. That Act of itself has no force in England, but every year a statute is passed bringing its provisions into operation. It seems to me that in time of war the Commonwealth military forces ought not to be placed in a different position from that occupied by the other soldiers of the Empire. If our soldiers have to fight alongside British soldiers, there ought to be one Act which is applicable to both. Otherwise the position would certainly not be conducive to discipline. The Army Act and the King&#39;s Regulations are in force in every State throughout Australia except Victoria. What harm has resulted from their operation ? At the same time I thought that it was unnecessary to burden ourselves with the King&#39;s Regulations, seeing that a great many of them are not applicable to our conditions. It seems to me that if there is one body of men who must be subject to discipline it is the military. How are the armies of every civilized nation kept together as they are except by strict discipline? </para>

          <para>- I do not know whether this is another plank in the Imperial platform, but the Minister seems to strongly advocate the retention of the clause. He practically admits that he knows nothing whatever about the provisions of the Army Act, and merely invites honorable members to read it. But I would point out that it covers 700 pages. I could understand his action if we were to make that Act a schedule to this Bill. But I object to including in this measure about ten lines which cover an Act containing about 200 sections. Conditions that might apply to the Imperial Army would not apply to Australian troops. </para>

          <para>- I trust that the Committee will not go further than to. adopt the amendment proposed by the honorable and learned member for Corinella. If this clause be omitted, and all reference to the Army Act struck out of the Bill, it will be necessary for us to go back on what we have already passed. We have already agreed to the interpretation clause which defines what the &#34; Army Act &#34; means. On the merits of the case it seems to me to be desirable that we should retain a reference to the Army Act. I shall certainly oppose the omission of this provision, which would render it necessary for us to amend the interpretation clause. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HIGGINS</inline>(Northern Melbourne).This clause must be read in conjunction with clauses 56 and 57. Part IV. of the Bill to which they belong provides for a levy <inline font-style="italic">en masse,</inline> but I cannot see the value of such a provision, unless we have a community of trained soldiers upon which to levy. Although I did not speak upon the amendment of the honorable and learned member for West Sydney last night, I feel that to be logical the Committee should, if it intends to pass these clauses, provide for a system for the training of our people for the defence of the country. No specific exemptions are made in the Bill ; the clauses apply to all persons between the ages of 18 and 60, so that even the Minister himself might be called upon to serve unless he were specially exempted by the proclamation of the Governor-General under clause 57. This part of the Bill goes far beyond any provision of the kind that is made ill Canada. That country, it must be remembered, is contiguous to&#39; the territory of one of the biggest powers in the world, and is open to attack at any point along a very extended land boundary, so that it is certainly not necessary for us to go further in providing for defence than Canada is prepared to go. There is a good deal of force in the contention of those who wish to introduce something like the Swiss system here, under which every man would have to undergo military drill and learn to handle a rifle ; because it would be ridiculous to compel men to enlist in time of war if they had had no previous training, and were quite unacquainted with the weapons of warfare. Clause 56 appears at first sight to provide for the calling upon persons to enlist in the order of certain specified classes, but a closer consideration of the provision shows that the Government may either at once call upon all persons between the ages of 18 and 60, or may call upon them in the order of the classes specified in sub-clause (3). The power of exemption given to the Governor-General by clause 57 is a tremendous one, and such as is given to no Governor of any other British possession. In my opinion, there should be specific exemptions in the Bill itself. But not even persons whose religious scruples prevent them from fighting, such as the Quakers, the Christadelphians, and others, are exempt. I do not think that we can do better in this matter than follow the example of Canada. Indeed, the Minister himself, in his last Bill, provided for specific exemptions. </para>

          <para>- Surely the Minister is not so weak as to drop a clause for that reason. Personally, I should like to see all these clauses negatived, so that our defence force, except for the permanent soldiers enlisted for specific and special work, should be a purely volunteer one. If I find that it is impossible to get honorable members to consent to that, however, I shall ask them to strike out paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> of sub-clause (2) of clause 56. </para>

            <para>- Soldiers cannot be trained in a few weeks or months. As the Minister was committed to these clauses, he should logically have adopted the amendment of the honorable and learned member for West Sydney. He cannot accuse me of opposing the Bill, but when I expressed my views upon its general principles during the second reading debate, I said that I should have to vote against these clauses. I think that they are utterly unnecessary, because they are never likely to be put into force, and, unaccompanied by other provisions, they are &#39;useless. We are more likely to require some such power as this in connexion with our naval defence, but no such power is taken. I do not think that the public are prepared to adopt a general system of training such as was proposed by the honorable and learned member for West Sydney. I believe that the spirit of our people is such that when men are wanted for the defence of Australia we shall always have any number of volunteers ; it will never be necessary &#39;to use compulsion in order to get men to enlist. These provisions, in my opinion, will have the effect of lowering the spirit of our volunteer system, and I hope that the Minister will recognise that the Committee are opposed to them, and will allow them to be negatived. </para>

            <para>- I hope that the Committee will not strike out these clauses. Similar provisions are in force in the States of Queensland, Tasmania, and South Australia. This clause is a transcript of a section which finds a place in the statutes of three of the States, and I believe it is a very good one. I do <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> anticipate that it will be utilized in the near future. I hope that it never will be. But there is an obligation resting upon all of us in times of great difficulty and danger to defend our hearths and homes, and this clause merely emphasizes that &#34;fact. It cannot do any harm to any one in this country. The power to .make a levy <inline font-style="italic">en masse</inline> is surrounded with considerable safeguards. It can only be exercised in time of war. If Parliament is sitting, it must be communicated with before any action is taken. If Parliament is not sitting at the time, it will have to be summoned within ten days, and will then be in the position* to take upon itself the whole responsibility of giving or declining to give the necessary authority. I think it is right that we should have in our Defence Act a. recognition of the obligation which lies upon every member of the community, and that we should declare to the world that we have- 1,000,000 men between the ages of 18 and. 60 who are prepared to defend the country against invasion. </para>

It is generally conceded thatif we had an invasion here there would beno difficulty in finding all the men requiredto defend the country without any compulsion whatever. If the people did not want to fight it would be very difficult to compel them to do so, but if on the other hand they realized the necessity of repelling an invasion they would volunteer for the purpose. </para>

            <para>- I intend to oppose theclause^ Last night the honorable and learned member for West Sydney proposed that steps should be taken to compel ouryoung men between the ages of 18 and 21 to submit to a certain amount of discipline which would&#39; fit them to take part in thedefence of the country. That was very different from . the proposal to make a levy <inline font-style="italic">en masse</inline> upon the people, irrespective of their ability to act as soldiers. Moreover, there is no occasion to provide by Act ofParliament that the people shall be levied upon <inline font-style="italic">en masse</inline> for military purposes, becauseno compulsion which is applied to the wholebody of the people could be exercised unless. they were ready to act without such/ compulsion. Surely if, as was urged by some honorable senators, the training of our young men between the ages of 18 and 21 would involve too much strain upon the community, it would be too much to expect the whole population to submit to be called upon for military service. There is nothing inconsistent in my attitude with regard to the two proposals. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCAY</inline>(Corinella). - I do not think the honorable member for Darling should be twitted with inconsistency.  His  position is perfectly clear. He is prepared to compel every one to go out and do military training when there is no fighting to be done, but he does not wish them to be compelled to go out in time of war. There is no inconsistency in that position. It must be one of great comfort to those who do not desire to fight. The honorable member is paying full consideration to the susceptibilities of those who do not wish to turn out when fighting is going on. The only people who would be engaged in the real work of defence would be those who were willing to fight. </para>

            <para>- Oh, yes; you could. If you put a man in the firing line he would have to do his share of the fighting, because he would have to go along somehow. The honorable member says that we could not force the whole nation to take up arms in time of war if. they were unwilling to do so. The majority would, however, be willing to do so, and they would bring along with them those who were reluctant to go to the front. I believe in making men fight in time of war, and I shall therefore support the clause. </para>

          <para>- I cannot understand the opposition directed to this clause. I can understand a great many of the arguments that have been used against Australians being compelled to leave the Commonwealth upon active service ; but I cannot understand why any opposition should be raised when we are asked to include in the Bill an announcement that the people of Australia are ready to defend their country in time of need. It is the highest duty of every citizen, when his country is in danger, to stand in the ranks, if need be ; and we can do no harm, but may do a great deal of good by announcing to the people of the world that our Australian citizens are prepared to be called upon to defend their country against an invader. I cannot understand how any one who claims to look upon Australia as his home, as something to be defended, and kept unsoiled by the touch of an invader, can object to this provision. In time of necessity it should not only.be the moral duty, but should be regarded as the privilege, of every citizen to serve in the Defence Forces. </para>

        <para>I submit the amendment because I think that the power contained in the paragraph in question is never likely to be exercised. The principal argument advanced in its favour by the Minister is that it constitutes a sort of placard to foreign nations of the force that in case of emergency we could put into the field. From the right honorable gentleman&#39;s own statement, it is a mere advertisement - a sort of red flag - a warning of danger. Further, I do not think that there is. any need to give the Executive power to call out all the military forces of the Commonwealth. In time of danger an ample number of volunteers will be available. </para>

            <para>- But this clause provides for the calling out of youths who may not entertain a desire to become soldiers. I quite agree that eighteen years is a very good limit to fix in the case of volunteers, because a young fellow of that age may have the requisite physical capacity, as well as the desire, to adopt a soldier&#39;s life. But allmen are not physically constituted alike. Some have a more delicate constitution than others, and many youths of eighteen are niere school-boys. I know that at the time of the American Civil War, the young men of eighteen years were the last to be called out. I think that the age&#39; limit should be altered to nineteen years. I do not think it matters much whether the whole clause is retained or rejected, because in Australia there will always be a sufficient number of volunteers forthcoming in time of emergency. </para>

          <para>- I think that this clause is of some consequence. It may be a mere placard, as it has been described by the honorable and learned member for Northern &#39;Melbourne, but placards sometimes serve very useful purposes. The clause contains a declaration that in the dire arbitrament of war, when the country is in danger, we are prepared to place ourselves unreservedly in the hands of the Executive for the purposes of defence. I can see no harm whatever in embodying a declaration of that kind in the statutes of the country. If that is the intention of the provision, the fuller we can make it, in its presentment of the force available, the better. I take it that the youths of eighteen years of age who are scattered throughout the Commonwealth represent a very considerable force. Since this clause contains a declaration of the character to which I have referred, I hold that we should allow no exemptions from service, except those which are imposed by physicial disability. It occurs to me that in placarding our deliberate intention to defend our shores at all hazards when the tocsin of war has sounded, we rather emphasize the voluntary aspect of our militarism in time of peace. Therefore, I hope that the honorable member for Grampians will withdraw his amendment. </para>

          <para>- I also trust that the amendment will be withdrawn, because its adoption would deprive us of amost efficient fighting force. Under this Bill we have made provision for the training of cadets, and probably some of the best men. whose services we shall secure will consist of young fellows of eighteen years. I was a. volunteer before I was that age, and was just as good a man then as I was a few years afterwards. I would further point out that in the recent South African war some of the very best stands made by the Boers were made by mere boys who were undereighteen years of age. </para>

I un derstand that it is quite open to any young man of eighteen years to volunteer. I do not object to that. But if a youth of that age does not desire to offer himself for military service, I do not think that we should compel him to do so. All men are not constituted alike. Some have more physical courage than others. But seeing that in the previous clause the Committee have decided that persons of eighteen years of age shall be liable to serve, I do not see that we can very well go back upon our decision. </para>

          <para>- I think that the question raised by the honorable member possesses one phase which might very well be ventilated. Although this clause is tantamount to a placard which proclaimshow our citizen forces are to be called out, there is nothing making it mandatory that the Government shall act in the way prescribed. It would be a wise Government which first called for volunteers. Although the clause gives them an extreme power, I hope that it will be used only in cases of extreme urgency. </para>

          <para>- I shall indicate what I propose to move, and if the honorable member&#39;s amendment is on the same lines I shall be glad to accept it. Notwithstanding the Minister&#39;s dissent, there are a number of people who, rightly or wrongly, strongly object to fighting of any kind. Personally, I do not go so far as that. There are also a large number of persons who object to serve unless they feel that they are fighting in a just cause. They also should be exempted. I shall ask the Minister to do what he did in clause 32 of the first Defence Bill, and by specifically exempting a number of persons make it unnecessary for them to depend on the mercy of the Ministry. </para>

There are some minds so bigoted that they cannot conceive of any conscientious objection which they do not share themselves.

            <para>- It would be very easy for a Christadelphian to produce the articles of his creed. There would be no difficulty in proving the existence of a conscientious or religious objection of the kind. We must, in justice to the Minister&#39;s clause, take care to prevent the evasion of conscription by men who might desire to make a farce of it. If the Committee has come to the conclusion that every one shall be liable to serve with the Defence Force, a man should not be allowed to escape merely because he says that he has some conscientious objection to fighting. He should be compelled to prove his right to exemption, and that point is provided for in sub-clause (2). This principle will apply to a certain number of sects. I notice that, in Canada, Quakers and others have been expressly exempted. </para>

          <para>- I should like to draw the attention of the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne to the fact that the clause provides only for the calling out of the population for the defence of Australia when there is no other remedy left. He contends that a question of conscience includes the conscientious belief of a person as to the injustice of a particular war ; but no person, whatever his opinion on the merits of the war itself, can remain neutral when the enemy is firing shot and shell into his own house. This is not a proposal for the calling out of persons to undertake a war of aggression. </para>

          <para>- The honorable and learned member is usually one of the clearest-headed men in the Chamber, but I have never seen an)&#39; one more muddled than he appears to be in connexion with this Bill. I do not see how a person who has no religious objections to warfare itself can claim to be exempt from defending his country because he does not subscribe to the justice of some particular war in which it is involved. When a man has expressed bis opinions, as it is open for any one to -do under our democratic institutions, he must, if overruled by the majority, be prepared to submit&#39; to the popular will, and, above all, when the question at issue affects the very existence of the State. We all respect the honorable and learned member&#39;s conscientious  objections to  warfare, but I do not think it can be admitted that persons should be exempted from serving in defence of their country when it is threatened with invasion, merely because they hold the opinion that the war originally was- an unjust one. Does the honorable and learned member mean to say that if his house were attacked by a man, he - though he had unwittingly been the aggressor - would allow it to be pulled down about his ears, and his family murdered in cold blood while he stood by protesting <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

While it does remain, we cannot pretend to make all those allowances suggested by the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne.

          <para>- I think that the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne goes too far in his idea of exempting  any  one who objects to a particular war. This Bill is for the defence of Australia, and not for any other purpose. It is not a Bill for aggressive warfare. No Australian should have a word to say about the rights or wrongs of the defence of Australia. I cannot, understand the honorable and learned member when he says there ought to beexemptions, not only in favour of thosewho have conscientious scruples against warfare generally - such  people as  the Quakers - but that we should respect the conscientious scruples of those who do not like any particular war. There are conscientious scruples against war of any sort entertained by members of particular churches and denominations. It would be the most abhorrent form of tyranny to insist that they should waive their conscientious convictions and go out to fight. But the honorable and learned member proposes to throw the onus of proving that they have those objections upon the people who entertain them. To my mind it is a matter- of impossibility to prove that a man has religious and conscientious objections. He might prove that he had religious objections by proving that he belonged to some religious body holding tenets against warfare, but how could it be proved that a man held conscientious objections? It would be impossible to get any proof that I can think of as to a man&#39;s conscientious objections, except by requiring him to make an affidavit or affirmation. It would meet the case if an amendment were made to add the following words : - </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Provided that no person shall be called upon to serve if he has religious or conscientious  objections  to so serving, and makes an affidavit to that effect. </para>
        <para class="block">If we are going to exempt people for conscience sake we can get proof of their conscience only by something tantamount to an oath. The amendment of the honorable member for Kooyong is somewhat on the lines of one proposed by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piesse.</inline> But it will have to be recast, because it refers to a ballot. There is no provision for balloting in the Bill. It might be provided for by regulations, but the amendment itself would be inconsistent with the other clauses of the Bill. I agree with the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, that it is in the highest degree right that we should allow exemptions from compulsory service. I do not believe in compulsory service. I see no need for it. But if we are going to adopt that principle, it i3 abhorrent to my principles to compel any man to fight if he has conscientious or religious scruples against doing so. If Australia were attacked, I believe that many persons like Quakers and others, who object to war, would be found fighting for the defence of their country. Still, there are men like Count Tolstoi who entertained the strongest objections against fighting of any kind. Quakers are in the same category. The scruples of these persons ought to be respected, irrespective of whether or not they subscribe to any recognised creed. </para>

          <para>- I think that the proposal of the honorable member for South Sydney will meet the case. We might put in some short proviso. But at the same time, I really cannot see any necessity for a special exemption. I am willing to admit that there are some classes of persons who profess a religion which forbids them to bear arms. But surely that class does not wish the machinery of the Bill, to be brought into operation for its special benefit. It may very well trust the Executive Government to deal with it in the same way as with the Judges, bishops, and other ministers of religion, and those whom it would not consider desirable to call upon to serve in time of war. Why should we, in a Bill of this kind, give the members of the Society of Friends a special place <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I think that these gentlemen are making altogether too much of this matter. No one wants to force them to fight if they have religious scruples against bearing arms, but why should such men desire to be placarded in this Bill <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> When extraordinary and momentous occasions arise, full  power is  given to the Government to do all that is necessary, and no doubt they would exempt from service all those who had religious scruples against bearing arms. With regard to the exemption of persons who may not regard a war in which we are engaged as just, I think there is at least one honorable member who would be exempt under such a provision. I do not think that he would regard it as just ; at any rate, it would be very hard to convince him that it was. I hope the Committee will accept the clause, because it seems to me that it is comprehensive enough to meet all cases. </para>

          <para>- I hope that the Minister will adhere to the clause as it stands. I have the greatest respect for people who have ideas differing from my own upon religious matters. I am willing to concede a good deal to those who have conscientious scruples, but I do not think we are called upon to introduce the question of religious belief into this Bill. I perfectly understand the position taken up by those who ask for an exemption from military service. They object to the shedding of human blood, but - without using any stronger language than I think justified - it appears to me that, in this respect, their claim is nothing  but unadulterated  cant. We know well enough that the taking away of human life is a very serious thing, but that does not occur only upon the battle-field. I know it to be a fact that some of the people who have been most strongly opposed to the bearing of arms in times of war have figured as the most bitter opponents of measures intended for the amelioration of industrial conditions which have destroyed thousands of people for every one hundred of those who have been killed upon the battle-field. Such people may consider themselves justified in refusing to take up arms in defence of their homes ; they may feel justified in standing idly by when women and children are being made homeless, or when they are being subjected to starvation or nameless indignities. They may plead that their religious scruples justify them in standing by while all that is being done. We need not force them to fight on the field of battle. We can concede all that under the Bill in its present condition, and I hope that the Minister will realize that the clause as it now stands would give him an opportunity of employing these people in some, useful work in the defence of the country without in the least degree interfering with their religious scruples. I shall support the clause. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HIGGINS</inline>(Northern Melbourne).As I moved the amendment I think I may be permitted to make a few remarks in reply. I have to thank the honorable member for South Sydney for his courtesy. I have no objection to offer to his suggestion ; in fact I am prepared to go further and leave the Minister to prescribe by regulation the way in which claims to exemption shall be proved. I would not even provide for an affidavit or declaration, because I know that those means are abused, but I should leave it entirely 60 the Minister to prescribe how a man should prove his right to be exempted from military service on account of his conscientious or religious scruples. I am strongly in accord with the honorable member for Kooyong as far as he goes, but I do not think that he proceeds far enough. I hold that the man who thinks that a war is unjust is entitled to say that &#39;he will not take up arms against those who are being attacked. Suppose that at the time of the opium war in China, when the whole power of the British Empire was used to force opium on China, there had been a collection of military stores at Perth or Port Darwin, and the Chinese had attacked those stores ; should we have been justified in compelling a man who did not believe in that war to shoot those who were making the attack <inline font-style="italic">f</inline></para>

            <para>- I understand the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne to refer to conscientious objections whether to a particular war or to all war. There is a large and growing body of people who object to war not only on religious, but on political, grounds. It may be that I do not agree with the religious and conscientious position assumed by others ; but there are a number of persons who believe that the best way to defeat evil is not to resist evil. The Tolstoi movement is not only religious, but also political ; and the international brotherhood as opposed to the national movement means that men who - I do not care whether they are governed from Berlin, Paris, or St. Petersburg - regard the taking up of arms as injurious to humanity: That movement is very strong. It is the Nihilist movement in Russia, and Nihilists are largely sceptics. They and similar thinkers would be excluded from the operation of this clause. It is because I object to conscientious scruples not being respected, that I intend to vote with the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. </para>

          <para>- I -.scarcely think that the Committee have finally dealt with it. Had I entertained that impression during the recent division, I should have voted with the other side. At the time, however, I simply thought that the method proposed in dealing with this matter was not the best one to adopt. What we designate, &#34;conscientious scruples,&#34; are very frequently of a higher order than are religious scruples. In the form in which the clause at present stands, I am placed in a peculiar position, because I desire to obtain more than is contemplated by the amendment under consideration. </para>

          <para>- I suppose it is useless for me now to press my proposal in the teeth of so strong an opponent as/is the Minister for Defence. But I think that if we are to respect any scruples we must respect the scruples of conscience, as well as those of so-called religions, which are just as difficult to determine. We might very well take the two classes into consideration, </para>
