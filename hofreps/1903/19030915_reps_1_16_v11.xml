                            Patterson, chairman of the Mungana (Chillagoe) Mining Company, North Queensland, echoed the general feeling when he stated at the meeting of shareholders to-day that little progress had been made in developing the different lodes on the property. But
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Patterson's</inline>
                            hearers were not prepared to find him casting the blame for this on the workers on the field, or to bring up the white labour question. However, this is what he did in the following words: - "I do not say there are not good workers on the field, but, at the same time, there is a large percentage of bad ; and until these are superseded no alteration of existing circumstances can accrue. There is no doubt the climate is against the white worker - who is simply a piece of languid animation under tropical sun and heat - and probably be cannot be blamed for being unable to bear the intense heat also in the underground workings, owing to the decomposition of the sulphide matter in the lodes. This portion of Australia could never have been intended for the European, else the climate would have been more suitable and moderate, and while the nonsensical idea of keeping the whole continent of Australia for the white man alone is maintained, this portion, which contains vast wealth in mineral and agricultural lands, will continue to a great extent to waste ' its sweetness on the desert air.' Had we the same conditions as apply to mining in South Africa with regard to labour, I venture to say a great success would soon be made of our undertaking."

To make my meaning clear, I desire to read the following letter : - i have the honour to contradict some very grossly incorrect statements that are reported to have been made in the Parliamentary debates of the Commonwealth of Australia. On page 3851 , <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bamford</inline> is reported thus - " I wish to tell the House what I have heard upon very good authority, although my authority is not a Minister. Fortunately, there are other avenues of information open to honorable members, otherwise we might sometimes be kept completely in the dark upon most important matters. </para>

                    <para>I wish now most solemnly to assure you that there is not the slightest foundation for this statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bamford.</inline> If  he  did receive any  such information, it is absolutely false. </para>

                    <para>If you are not prepared to contradict this wicked statement, at least I hope you will institute an inquiry before a Judge of Supreme or District Court,'to sift matters thoroughly. </para>

                            <para>- Some of the officers of the Senate received increases previously in order to bring their salaries nearer to those paid to the officers of this Chamber. It was felt by the President and by a large number of the members of the Senate that it wa3 hardly fair that their officers should be paid at a lower rate than ours. I do not know that that is a very strong reason for these increases ; but in order to avoid friction I waived my objections. Although some of the messengers of the Senate have not been in the service so long as have some of our messengers, it has been thought wise to put them on a similar footing. These were the reasons which induced me, after conferring with the Prime Minister, to provide for the increases. I hope that no objection will be raised, because the amounts are not large, and if the increases are not granted some friction may arise. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that is quite fair that officers who have been in, the service only two or three years should be placed on the same footing as those who have long service to their credit. If the position of a senior messenger became vacant it would scarcely be desirable or fair to appoint a junior to his position, and give him the maximum salary at the outset. Whilst I do not object to the increases as such, I think that some better reason than that mentioned by the Treasurer should be given. </para>

                        <para>- I object to the proposed increases for very much the same reasons as those mentioned by the honorable member for Yarra. The President's messenger had increases on two prior occasions, and his salary now stands at £188. It is now proposed to increase it to £204. My idea is that a messenger should be paid to some extent in accordance with his length of service. I understand that the President's messenger has been in the service for only three years. He was formerly a temporary messenger in South Australia. I take the same view as the honorable member for Yarra with regard to the salaries to be paid to junior messengers who fill vacancies caused by the retirement of senior messengers. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that perfectly. Regarding the wisdom, or otherwise, of increasing the emoluments of officers of Parliament, I would point out that in Queensland during the past two or three years, the whole of the civil servants have not only been denied increments, but have actually suffered a reduction of salary I do not think it would be fair to the public servants of that State that we should increase the salaries of any Commonwealth officers during this year. I do not care who this particular officer may be - I have nothing to say against him - but I am opposed to any increases of salary being granted during the current year. I think that the payment of increments might very well be allowed to stand over until times improve. </para>

                    <para class="block">It seems to me that the idea that officers of the two Houses of the Legislature should necessarily be placed upon the same footing has very little to recommend it. In the Senate the work can scarcely be as heavy as it is in this Chamber. The other branch of the legislature does not sit the same number of hours that this House does, and for reasons which we can quite understand. The fact that it contains fewer members necessarily means that there is not the same volume of work to be performed that there is in this House, even if the hours which the two Chambers sat were similar. Most of the salaries paid are upon a fairly reasonable scale, considering that when Parliament is in recess - as we hope it will be more regularly in the future - the officers in question can be granted extended holidays by permission of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> I certainly object to any increments being granted at the present time. In these Estimates I find that the salaries of messengers, typists, &amp;c. are being increased, whilst others who perform more responsible duties and who occasionally are compelled to work overtime, are given no encouragement whatever in that direction. If we cannot find funds to mete out fairer treatment to those who are charged with responsibility, we should not fritter away money in attempting to bring about a parity between the salaries of officers in the other Chamber and those in this. </para>

                        <para>- I think there is a very great deal to be said in opposition to the increase from £380 to £420, which is proposed in this instance. Certainly, the Committee ought to be given more information in respect of the length of service of the officer who performs the duties of Clerk of the Papers and Accountant. In the absence, of any better reason than that which has been advanced by the Treasurer, I am of opinion that the increase should not be granted. </para>

                        <para>- I presume that this is a new appointment which was rendered necessary by Federation. I do not know whether the Treasurer is ignoring that fact. The Clerk of the Papers and Accountant is a transferred officer who probably came here under a promise that his salary would be increased ; but the shorthand writer and typewriter, who has. been recently appointed, comes within an altogether different category. </para>

                        <para>- We cannot avoid granting this increase. The housekeeper was appointed on the1st January, 1902, at a salary of £225 per annum, " with yearly increments of £10," to be proposed to Parliament, up to £250, with quarters, fuel, light, and water. His predecessor's salary amounted to £275 per annum, with an allowance of £25 per annum with quarters, fuel, light and water. This increase was one of the conditions of the housekeeper's appointment. As to the point mentioned by the honorable member for Yarra, it will be found that throughout the Estimates I have allowed for increments in the lowest classes, which will practically be given as a matter of course. Increments to officers in other classes in the service must be dealt with by the Commissioner. That officer has to inquire whether any of them should receive increments, and under the Public Service Act they become entitled to them upon receipt of his certificate. I have, therefore, provided throughout the Estimates sums estimated to be sufficient to cover such increments as the Public Service Commissioner may think fit to grant. Under the Public Service Act, an officer in the higher classes does not become entitled to an increment until he obtains the certificate of the Commissioner, and no increase can be granted without that certificate. </para>

                        I notice, for example, that provision is made for an increase of £10 per annum in the salary of a junior clerk. As far as I am aware the whole of the other salaries are fixed, and I can therefore see no necessity for this item. I do not think it will be spent while the present Treasurer remains in office.

                        (Bland).- Following the rule laid down by the Committee in dealing with officers of the Senate, it seems to me that no increase should be granted in this division to other than junior officers. I notice that provision is made for increasing the salary of a junior clerk from £70 to £80. That is a very proper proposal ; but all the other officers are receiving fair salaries, and I do not think there is any necessity to provide for this item of £60.

It is purely a bookkeeping process, and the Treasurer must know that no real service is rendered for this outlay. I read a statement in the press a few days ago that the Treasurer had made arrangements to save this enormous sum ; but, according to the ex-Minister for Trade and Customs, we cannot now rely on the truth of semi-official statements appearing in the Melbourne press. </para>

I have been making reductions in this direction ever since the inauguration of the Commonwealth, and the item has been very largely reduced. The honorable member last year directed attention to the fact that the proposed expenditure, by way of banking exchange, amounted to over £7,000. That outlay has been materially cut down. The Treasury does everything in its power, in dealing with Inter-State adjustments, to prevent any unnecessary transfer of moneys from one part of the Commonwealth to another. We debit and credit States, and in that way make considerable savings. We are also using the money order account as far as possible to prevent either the sending of money or of instructions for the payment of money from one part of a State to another, or from one State to another.

                            <para>- I believe that we have reduced the total to £200,000 or £300,000 per annum. If we did as we thought of doing at the outset - and as the banks believed we should do - and called in all moneys to the central Treasury and redistributed them again, the exchange would represent an enormous sum. But we do not follow that practice, and we have kept this amount as low as possible. Negotiations are pending between myself and the Banks, but a definite arrangement has not yet been arrived at. We must not overlook the fact that we receive a sum of about £12,000,000 per annum and pay it away again, and that we have large departmental accounts. </para>

                            <para>- No. We have a separate system in relation to any remittances to London. If the individual' States have money in London, and I have to make a payment there, I arrange as far as I can for a payment to be made to them here, and for the States to make our payments from their accounts in England. By this means we' save the exchange. Every effort is made to save this exchange, and I hope that the result of negotiations which are proceeding between myself and the banks will be that when the next year's Estimates are brought forward the amount will be very largely reduced. In fact, I hope that during this year, if I can make the arrangements I contemplate, we shall not have to expend anything like the amount" named. We do not pay the banks the half-yearly charge which they make for keeping accounts. If the banks were to charge us 10s. a year on all our accounts throughout the Commonwealth, the sum we should have to pay would be a very large one indeed. Of course the banks have to incur expenditure in keeping our accounts, and it costs them a considerable sum. But I hope not to have to spend the sum set down, or even a large portion of it, during the year ; and next year if this vote appears on the Estimates at all, I trust that it will be a very small sunn. More than that I do not think I am at liberty to state at the present time. </para>

                            <para>- With regard to interest on current accounts, I may say that, as a rule, we have practically nothing with the banks, because we pay over the money due to the States every week. We collect the money, and nearly every week we pay the States the amount that is due to them, and they place it to their own accounts in the banks. They have their own arrangements with the banks, by which they receive a small amount of interest. The banks did desire to make an arrangement with us that they should pay us interest on the minimum monthly balances, but on the first of the month we have practically nothing in the banks, because, as I have said, we pay to- the States every shilling that is due to them in the course of the preceding month. </para>

                        <para>- On looking at the votes for such requisites as postage and telegrams, writing paper, envelopes, record and other books, and so on, I find that the allowance made to the Senate is nearly identical with that made to the House of Representatives. I am at a loss to understand this. We have in the House of Representatives double the number of members that there are in the Senate, and we do much more work, sitting many more days during the session I think there ought to be some relation to these facts in the sums allotted. I have observed that the note- . paper used in the Senate is very much superior to that used in the House of Representatives, which- is of a very rubbishy quality. It is very hard to pick up a sheet of note-paper which has not some blemish upon it. </para>

                    <para class="block">I hold that that is unconstitutional. If it is to be' done it should be done by Act of " Parliament. Even then I doubt whether an Act can override the Constitution. Under section 35 of the Constitution provision is made for the House of Representatives to elect a Speaker j and in the second paragraph it is stated that the Speaker shall cease to hold office if he ceases to be a member. Yet here is a provision that if the same member who happens to be Speaker is again returned to Parliament after a dissolution the salary will be payable to him during the whole time when there was no House of Representatives in existence. I hold that that is unconstitutional,, whatever may be the policy of it. I am not going to- discuss the expediency of paying the money, but honorable members will notice that there is no such provision in the case of the President. </para>

                            <para>- Of course the right honorable gentleman is quite right. I was thinking of the new standing order of the Senate, under which, I think, the President's tenure of office has been fixed for a term. The real reason, as the . Treasurer says, is that there is no break ; but it seems to me that the Constitution does not allow us to pay a salary to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> for the period when he does not hold his office. </para>

                        <para>- I think the honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> has raised a very important point, which ought to elicit some information from the Government. Apparently the object of the footnote referred to is to place <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> on an equal footing with the President of the Senate. The footnote says - "If returned again to Parliament salary to continue." Why should <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> be placed in a different position from any other member of the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It simply means that, if a dissolution takes place, during the period occupied by the general election, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> will continue to draw his salary. There is no other member of the House who will be placed in that position. Other members will draw their salaries from the time when they are elected. That should be sufficient for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> I cannot see why he should be in a different position from the Chairman of Committees. We - might as well place an asterisk alongside the line which contains the salary of the Chairman of Committees, and say that he shall draw his salary during the period occupied by a general election. It does not follow that because a certain gentleman may hold the office of Speaker in one Parliament, he will be re-elected after the general election. We may sometimes have a Speaker who will not be re-elected ; though I hope that our present Speaker will be. </para>

                            <para>- I never knew that. In New South Wales the Speaker's salary was, I believe, £1,100 per annum, but I understood it was drawn only while Parliament was in existence. </para>

                            <para>- In regard to the item mentioned by the honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> I would point out that there is nothing in the Constitution which prohibits the payment of his salary to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> during a general election. It is quite competent for Parliament to vote thi"? amount if it thinks that it is a fair, reason- . able, and proper thing to do. I have been actuated in placing the item upon the Estimates by the fact that the difference in the case of the President and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> would otherwise be very marked. The  President  would be entitled to receive his salary for the full period, while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> would not. It is said that honorable members lose their salaries during a general election. So does <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> He loses his ordinary salary as a member, but we propose that he shall not also lose his salary as Speaker. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; he receives £400 a year as a member and £1,100 a year as Speaker. It was first proposed that the Speaker's salary should be £1,500 a year in addition to the £400 received by him as a member, but ultimately it was decided to pay £1,500 altogether - that is, £1,100 for the Speakership and £400 for membership. Of course the salaries of Ministers are paid after a dissolution of Parliament until the meeting of the new Parliament, because they must continue to carry on their administrative work- In the same way it will be necessary for the Speaker, during the interval between the dissolution of one Parliament and the meeting of the next, to attend to his share of the business connected with the Departments of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- That action has been taken for a particular reason. Honorable members have considered that the reasons given for the increases proposed have not been sufficiently strong. In this case we are dealing with an entirely different matter. We are here proposing to establish a precedent, and it is on that account that I have had a footnote introduced to direct the special attention of honorable members to the fact. What the practice in other States has been I do not know, but I am informed that it has been usual to allow the salary to continue if the Speaker is re-elected. I recollect that that was done in my time in Victoria on one occasion when the Speaker was returned and re-elected to his office. He was allowed salary for the period during which the House was not in session. </para>

                            <para>- That is open for consideration. We think it is not desirable that invidious distinctions should be drawn between the presiding officers of the two Chambers. As Ministers continue to draw their salaries it seems only fair that the Speaker should be entitled to draw his salary during a dissolution when he has to do the work of his office. The additional point taken that whether he is re-elected or not he ought to be paid if he does the work is a good one, and is deserving of consideration. I ma)' say that I hope that aspect of the case will not come before us. </para>

Whether the honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> is or is not right as to the constitutional aspect of the question, it would be an undesirable precedent to set up that we should make a continuance of the salary of the Speaker dependent upon his re-election to Parliament and to the office of Speaker. </para>

                            <para>- His position as Speaker depends on his being a Member of Parliament, and it is here proposed to pay him a salary when he is actually not a Member of Parliament at all. That is something to which, I think, we should take objection. It is not a personal matter with any of us. We have no objection to the Speaker receiving the salary stated ; but it is a question whether he should receive it when he ceases to be a Member of Parliament. I do not think we have been furnished with any good reason why he should. As regards the comparison between the Senate and the House of Representatives it might as well be said that as honorable senators will be receiving salary although the Senate will not be sitting, whilst members of the House of Representatives, when standing for reelection, will not receive salary- </para>

                            <para>- The members of this House ought to be- placed upon the same footing as members of the Senate. I think it is undesirable in this case that the continuance of the salary should depend upon whether a member of the House is reelected to the House or to the Speakership ; and it is also undesirable that the Speaker, who cannot be Speaker unless he is a Member of Parliament, should .be recognised as, entitled to receive salary during the period when he is not a Member of Parliament. With every good wish for the present Speaker, I oppose the provision now sought to be made. I think we should establish another, and a much better precedent, than we shall have established if we adopt the terms of the footnote to this vote. </para>

                        <para>- It is peculiar that a senior messenger should receive £188 per annum while the steward, who has the handling of and responsibility for a large sum of money during the session, should receive a salary of only £182. The salary for the senior messenger is; in my opinion, fair, and it must be admitted that both officers work long hours ; but it would be only reasonable if the steward were paid a salary a little higher than that of the messenger. </para>

Honorable members surely do not expect me to increase the amounts which I am asked to pay. I am sure, however, that those responsible for recommending these salaries will bear in mind the remarks of the honorable member, and will probably reconsider the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I beg to indorse the remarks of the honorable member for Bland. This is a matter which should be taken into consideration, not by the House Committee, but by this Committee. The steward, in addition to handling large sums of money, has charge of the stock ; and no one can dispute that his work is done most efficiently. The steward ought certainly to rank higher than a messenger. </para>

                        <para>- I notice that the salary of the lift attendant is £65 per annum. The young fellow in charge of the lift is approaching manhood, and I hardly think his remuneration is sufficient. He is kept here until late hours when Parliament is sitting, and has also to be in attendance at other times. A little while ago this attendant in going home one night, after a late sitting, met with an accident, and had his arm broken. That has nothing specially to do with his position ; but still we keep him late here every night, and I think that some little addition might be made to his salary. </para>

                        <para>- The proposed purchase of this bust - because it is subject to Parliamentary approval - of the first Governor-General arose in this way : Before Lord Hopetoun left Australia he gave sittings to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. IUingworth,</inline> whom, I dare say, honorable members who are residents of Sydney know very well by repute as a sculptor of great talent. After Lord Hopetoun had gone away, I was asked, when I returned to Australia, to inspect this bust in plaster. I saw the bust and some photographs of it which had been prepared, and I thought that the work would be excellent when executed in marble. . The artist fixed the price at £200 ; and I suggested that some of the photographs should be sent to Lord Hopetoun, under whose eye the work had, to a certain extent, progressed. This was done, and Lord Hopetoun replied to the effect that the artist had succeeded beyond expectations. That was a private letter, but it was shown to me. Under the circumstances, I came to the conclusion that there ought to be some permanent record of every Governor-General of the Commonwealth, either in sculpture or in painting - that there ought to be placed on record the lineaments of those who have held the position. The present proposal ought not to be complicated by the question as to whether there ought to be records of future Governors-General. A record of our first Governor-General ought, at any rate, to be provided. I think that a good bust of Lord Hopetoun, made before he left England, and before he suffered in health as he did afterwards, would be a more faithful record than a painting done in England after his return. Therefore, as the work seemed to me to be a good one, I, having inquired its price, told the artist that I would ask Parliament to buy it. I informed him that that promise did not amount to a contract with him by which the Government was bound ; but that if Parliament would vote the money the purchase of the bust would be completed by the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not oppose the item. I rise to point out that we are labouring under a mistake when we describe Lord Hopetoun as the first Governor-General. In this connexion I would draw the attention of the Committee to the following extract from a book compiled for presentation to the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Twentieth Century Impressions of Western Australia : -</inline></para>

                        <para>When the Australian Government Act was passed by the Imperial Parliament in 1850, the idea of an ultimate Federation was even then engaging the attention of British statesmen, and particularly those responsible for the control of the Queensland Colonial Office. At that time, of course, we had no separate political existence, and the detachment of Victoria from New South Wales was not completed till the following year, although South Australia had, under charter, attained the dignity of a separate province some fifteen years previously. Western Australia was, geographically, too remote to be specially included in the Imperial plans, but provision was nevertheless made by the Australian Government Act for the establishment of that colony on the same footing as her sisters, whenever the proper time should arrive for the carrying out of that project. In furtherance of the Imperial idea of Federation, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> A. Fitzroy, Governor of New South Wales, received a commission as Governor-General of Australia, the Governors of the other colonies all holding the official rank of Lieutenant-Governor. Any Lieutenant-Governor was to be superseded in his office during the temporary residence in his colony of the Governor-General. It was, however, objected by the residents of Melbourne and Adelaide that their distance from the Federal capital (Sydney) was too great to make the Imperial proposals acceptable. The matter was, therefore, not pressed ; and, on the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> A. Fitzroy in 1855, the title of Governor was bestowed upon Her Majesty's representative in each of the other colonies. And though the distinction of Governor-General was retained by the Governor of New South Wales until 1861 the title carried no real power. So complete indeed has been the effacement of this incident from recollection that to-day Lord Hopetoun is generally described as the first Governor-General of Australia ; whereas, in fact, two of his predecessors held that title in succession over forty years ago. </para>

                        (Kennedy).- I hope that the Committee will strike out the item. The f act that some artist asked Lord Hopetoun to sit for him while he fashioned a model of his bust, and that Lord Hopetoun said that the bust when made was a faithful one, is, to my mind, no reason why we should buy it, although the artist who executed the work deserves every credit for the talent which he has displayed.

If that is not an impression which will live long in the memory of the people, I do not know what more lasting one they want. If the bust is such a faithful representation of Lord Hopetoun, I think he might do us the honour to present it to us, in which case we might use it to adorn Parliament House in the Federal Capital. ' If, on the other hand, the people of Australia are anxious to have a memorial of Lord Hopetoun, why should there not be a national testimonial, and a full-sized statue subscribed for? It seems a paltry thing to vote ±'200 for a bust to perpetuate the memory of a man in connexion with whom the Commonwealth has already spent £40,000 upon a "bust" of a different character </para>

                        <para>- If the item were of » personal character, I would willingly accept the honorable member's advice in regard to it, rather than have any dispute about it. But there is something approaching a principle involved in it, and that is that as a people we should be mindful that we are makers of history. The early days of the Commonwealth will be the subject of historical examination and research, and records should be kept of the main events of our history, and the actors connected with them. That being so, it is for honorable members to consider whether we should, on the very threshold of that history, deny that there is any advantage to be gained in keeping, either upon canvas or in marble, a record of each of the distinguished men who come here. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister has tried to raise an ideal in regard to this matter, but while I think that the Commonwealth at times needs ideals, I do not think that his proposal is a good one. If we are to have an historical record of our Governors-General which will be something like Madam Tussaud's exhibition, it may happen that interim Governor-Generals or -their friends will want to have their features preserved there ; but the right honorable gentleman has made mention of no such proposal. It seems to me that if records such as he speaks of are to be kept, names like those of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes and the late Honorable James Service, which stand out pre-eminently in connexion with the historical side of Federation, should be commemorated in marble or on canvas. But, so far, no such proposal has been made. Although I appreciate high ideals, and love the artistic side of life, I think that the Australian public are too utilitarian to spend money in the manner proposed. If it is intended to preserve the bust of every Governor-General, the proposal now before us is no great compliment to Lord Hopetoun. To use the vernacular, in our expenditure upon his account we have already had a sufficient bust. I shall oppose the item. </para>

                        E. GROOM (Darling Downs).It is my intention to vote for the item. We have to consider, as the Prime Minister has said, the advisability of preserving historical records of the Federation. Parliament very properly votes a large sum annually to preserve for the information of future ages a record of what is said and done here and in the Senate.

                        <para>- <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is intended for something more than a record for the information of the present generation. We have taken very great care that everything done by Parliament shall be faithfully and honestly placed on record, and I am in sympathy with any movement having that object. I think we should also have some portraiture of the first Governor-General of the Commonwealth as an historical record. This Parliament has functions to perform beyond those relating to purely utilitarian matters. Surely, at the outset of our career as a nation we should take some interest in science, literature and art, and show that, as a people, we have some appreciation of all that is noblest and best in life. </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister describes the bust as a work of art, and as a correct delineation of the features of the late Governor-General ; and I think that he has enunciated a sound principle in connexion with this matter. When we establish the Federal capital we shall have to do something to beautify it. Do honorable members propose that we, as a Parliament, should confine our attention to purely utilitarian matters ? A bust of the Governor-General should be included amongst the works of art used, not only to beautify the Federal capital, but to remind the people of the makers of the Commonwealth, and of those associated with them. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members participated in the benefits arising from the expenditure incurred by the late Governor-General in celebrations worthy of the occasion, and we know that not one penny of the money voted by this Parliament went into Lord Hopetoun's pocket. However, that is quite apart from the question now before us. The Prime Minister very properly urges that we should preserve as a matter of historical record a representation of our first Governor-General, and in this regard we cannot escape our responsibility to those who may come after us. The people of other nations would have been glad if their predecessors had taken care to preserve the records of their time by means of statues and other representations of the great characters who have taken a leading part in making history. If that had been done, a benefit would have been conferred, not only upon the nation itself, but upon the whole civilized world. History ought to be our guide, and the Prime Minister was perfectly right when he emphasised the need which we as the first Australian Parliament should supply. I have great pleasure in supporting the proposal. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs was somewhat mixed, because he confused the subject of the encouragement of art with the present proposal. I should be quite prepared to vote more than £200 for the encouragement of art, and I hope very liberal provision will be made in that direction when we have our own art gallery. At the same time, I fail to see why we should spend £200 upon a bust of the late Governor-General, and I admire the courage of the Government in making the proposal in the face of the Kyabram cry for economy. Our system of government does not afford any opportunity for the exercise of special capabilities by the gentleman who may hold the position of- Governor-General. If we arranged to have busts of all our Governors-General, some phrenologist of the future might, on examining the outlines of their heads, say, " There is the head of a wonderfully brainy man. He ought to have figured prominently in the history of the Commonwealth." The phrenologist, however, on searching the records, would find that that brainy man had done nothing, for the simple reason _ that he had had no opportunity. We do not want our Governor-General to do anything beyond making himself genial and presiding over society functions. There is no room for a strong man in that position, because we look after the government of the Commonwealth for ourselves. The actions of men count most in history, and we do not need a bust of the late -Governor-General unless it be intended to make a " joss " of it. I believe in having complete historical records, but I fail to see that the value of such records would be added to if they included representations of the heads and shoulders of our Governors-General. They would afford no indication -of the work performed by the men whom they represented. We are endeavouring to save all the money we can, and I think we may defer the purchase of works of art until we have an art gallery in which we can place them. If we decided to have a bust . «f the first Governor-General we should arrange for busts of all his successors. In such a case trouble might arise in the future -as to where we should put them, and they might eventually be stored in a lumber _100rn </para>

                            <para>- I quite recognise that. When the honorable member is installed as the High Commissioner of the Commonwealth in London he will have to incur much greater expense than will be covered by the salary he receives. I should very much like to see the honorable member appointed, because no one could more fitly occupy the position. Honorable members must be held perfectly free to criticise the Estimates as they think fit, even though references to the late Governor-General may be involved. Honorable members may not know of the fate which has overtaken some of the monuments erected in London. I can remember, as a boy, seeing the Queen Anne monument, at the top of Ludgate Hill, in St. Paul's Church-yard. The weather and time played havoc with that monument, and the last time I saw it, her late Majesty was lacking a nose. Later on, when I saw «, leper at Friday Island, I was irresistibly reminded of the Queen Anne monument, which has since been removed and broken up for road metal. A similar fate might await a statue of our first Governor-General. The honorable and learned member for Darling Downs thought it was necessary that we should adopt this proposal in order that the people who come after us may know who we were and what we were; but my experience is that the only history which will live is that which is to be found in books. The amount of £200 is of no importance, but if the present proposal were agreed to, it would establish an objectionable precedent. A bust of the Prime Minister finds a place in the Sydney Art Gallery, and it looks very well. I have admired it very much, because it is a good representation of the right honorable gentleman. I never beard, however, that the public were asked to contribute towards the cost of that bust. The memory of the light honorable gentleman and also that of Lord Hopetoun will live for ever, and they need no busts to remind the people of their connexion with the early days of the Commonwealth. I hope that the Government will withdraw the item,' because I should be very sorry to see them defeated. I should like to know whether the fate of the Government will depend upon the vote. If the carrying of this vote will involve their fate I shall support them, but if not I shall vote against them. </para>

                        <para>- I shall oppose the item. If honorable members are anxious to have a bust of the Governor-General they should initiate a public subscription with that end in view. A number of citizens of Melbourne desired to have a portrait of the Governor-General, and we subscribed for a painting which is now hung in the Melbourne Town Hall. The present discussion has emphasized the fact that the people of the Commonwealth have nothing to do with the appointment of the Governor-General. If we wished to encourage art by purchasing a bust, it would be infinitely better for us to purchase the bust of the first Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>-At any rate, the Prime Minister has been elected and sustained in his office by the people. On the other hand, the Governor-General is appointed, not to represent the people, but to represent something which is a check and constant drag and veto upon the wishes of the people, namely, the Colonial Office. I fear that by agreeing to this item we shall he establishing a very bad precedent, under which it will be necessary to purchase a bust of each succeeding Governor-General. One does not care about saying anything derogator'y to the first Governor-General, because he was a very popular, worthy, and able man indeed. At the same time, I believe that the best method to adopt in regard to this item is to apply the system which is followed in connexion with the canonization of saints by the Roman Church. I understand that under that system no person can be suggested as a saint until he has been dead about a hundred years. I think it would be wise to eliminate this item, and to see if the reputation of 'our first Governor-General wears for' a hundred years. Otherwise I hold that we should be wasting the people's money in perpetuating the memory of a distinguished official who did not represent the people. </para>

                        <para>- Might I suggest to the Prime Minister the propriety of arranging for the purchase of the busts of the 111 members of this Parliament? I understand that a very artistic bust of the leader of the Opposition is being placed upon the market. These can be bought for1s. 3d. each. Seeing that the Prime Minister is possessed of artistic instincts, I think it would be a very good thing if we could arrange to perpetuate the memory of members of this Parliament in the manner suggested. </para>

                            <para>- Though some honorable members might have supported the proposal had it been confined to the first Governor - General, they were almost compelled to vote against it owing to the way in which it was put from the* Chair. Had a proposition been submitted to perpetuate the memory of a man like Chief Justice Marshall, of the United States, there would have been merit in the distinction. But to select an individual simply because he has occupied a particular office, without regard to merit, is ridiculous. </para>

            <para>Minister for External Affairs*). - I desire to make a short explanation in reference to this division. Upon looking at the Estimates honorable members will see that the salary of the Chief Clerk in this Department has been saved. Reference to the item relating to the clerks, however, will show that the first clerk, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lewis,</inline> who was at Government House under the previous official Secretary, and who received a salary of £325, is now to receive £350. Seeing that he has been removed to a position of very much greater responsibility, and will be called upon to do increased work, the addition to his salary of £25 per annum is a small one. On the other hand," whereas <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lewis</inline> formerly received £325 as clerk to the official Secretary at Government House, we have now appointed in his place a clerk at £120 per annum, thus effecting a saving of £205. The salary of the Secretary to the Federal Executive Council remains the same, namely, £600 ; but the duties of Secretary to the Federal Executive Council and official Secretary to the Governor-General are now being discharged under the one heading and title. Therefore the saving, which has been effected in that respect - if I may refer to division 1 2 - is £205 as against an increase of £25 in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lewis'</inline> salary upon his transfer. </para>

                    <para>- At the bottom of that list honorable members will find that provision is made for one clerk at £100 per annum, and another at £40. These amounts, which will now be paid out of the salary vote, were previously paid out of the vote for. temporary assistance. If honorable members will refer to item 11, "contingencies," they will see that whereas the amount thus spent last year was £240, it has been reduced this year to £100. The increases relating to the remaining salaries between the first and the two last mentioned in this item are the ordinary annual increments granted under the Public Service Act. But for any item which I may have overlooked, I have explained the whole of these alterations. At a later stage I shall move to reduce the item, " Travelling expenses, £400," by £120, as I find that the amount may be reduced to that extent. </para>

                <para>Southafricanailways. - Good positions secured for railway employes. Remunerative appointments, with splendid future prospects, now available for limited number of traffic branch clerks under thirty years of age.

                <para class="block">Two or three men - most of them members of the railway service - have interviewed me in reference to this matter. It appears that the advertiser is seeking to engage some 200 or 300 men for employment in South Africa. He demands from every man who agrees to go there in accordance with the terms of the advertisement, a deposit of £4, and an undertaking to pay him a further sum of £4 upon arrival in South Africa. </para>

The possibility of 200 or 300 reputable men being, first of all, deprived of a certain sum of money, and then stranded in a distant country is so serious that the Prime Minister should cause inquiry to be made into the matter. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister a question relating to the Philippines, which is already beginning to affect Australian trade. The right honorable gentleman is perhaps unaware of the fact that Australian manufacturers of reaper and binder twine, and various other classes of cordage, find it absolutely necessary to import a certain class of Manilla twine. As the result of the establishment of this industry in Australia the price of reaper and binder twine has been materially reduced ; but, owing to certain action taken by the United States authorities, the manufacturers are now placed at a serious disadvantage. When the Philippines were taken over by the United States of America, a promise was made that in accordance with an arrangement which the Spanish Government had previously carried out, the best favoured nation treatment should be extended to the British Government. But the United States of America authorities at the Philippines now impose an export duty of £1 10s. per ton on Manilla twine exported to countries other than the United States. </para>

' I think that the Minister should endeavour to see that the treaty entered into by the Unites States Government is carried out. </para>

Under the new administration, natives in British South Africa, as well as in Portuguese territory who are able to live without working for white men, are being compelled to pay a hut tax of £1 or £2 per head, that impost being levied in order to force them to work in the mines. </para>

                        <para>- It has much to do with us. We owe a responsibility to the many Australians who have gone to South Africa in search of work, and many' of whom are now stranded, because of the fact that a great deal of work is carried on by inferior races. When I brought forward this question last year, the answer made by the Acting Prime Minister was that it was a matter which did not affect Australia. Bub we are responsible for our own acts of war and aggression. If this is a question which does not affect us, how is it that when the Prime Minister was attending the recent Imperial Conference, he did not hesitate to ask that legal practitioners in Australia should have a right to practice in the newly conquered British territory in South Africa ? </para>

                        <para>- If we are able to interfere in these matters in one direction we should be able to do so in another. I should like the Prime Minister to take steps to support the rights of Australians, and of' white men generally, in South Africa. We should use what influence we have as a. Parliament in this direction. We should not allow our desires in this respect to beset aside too easily by the suggestion that we have no right to interfere with the other parts of the Empire. We have interfered and are responsible for the result of such intervention. If we had taken up that attitude in the past it might have been better for us. It seems to me that we ought to do what we can to support the cause of the white races in British South Africa. </para>

                    <para>- Perhaps this is the best time to refer to the action of the Government concerning the Papua. (British New Guinea) Bill. So far as we know at present, the Bill is to be abandoned because of certain amendments that were carried in it in Committee. In one of those amendments I was particularly interested. It had reference to the alienation of land in British New Guinea. An amendment to prevent the further alienation of land was carried by a very substantial majority. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">There were thirty-three votes in favour of that amendment and only nineteen against it. Six other votes were accounted for by pairs, three on each side, making fifty-eight votes out of a total house of seventy-five. Allowing for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the Chairman of Committees, neither of whom voted, there were only fifteen votes unaccounted for. I have spoken to several of those honorable members who did not vote, and know that some of them were in favour of the amendment for the non-alienation of land in New Guinea. That shows that there is a clear majority of the seventy-five members of the House who are in favour of the land of New Guinea being retained by the Crown. Under those circumstances I wish to ask the Prime Minister what the intentions of the Government may be concerning the hand of New Guinea pending the election of a new Parliament. As the opinion of this House has been very clearly expressed, I wish to ask whether, until the next Parliament is elected, and has an opportunity of expressing its views upon the subject the Prime Minister will give us an assurance that land will not be alienated ? The Government should recognise the opinions of the majority of honorable members, as so clearly expressed, and should do nothing in opposition to those views until the new Parliament has an opportunity of expressing itself. </para>

                        <para>- It will be within the recollection of honorable members that I have stated that I propose, before proceeding further with the Papua (British New Guinea)-Bill to make some inquiries. I am row taking steps to that end. My object will be to inquire into several matters affecting British New Guinea upon which further information would be desirable. I include in those inquiries both the question of land alienation to which the honorable member for Kalgoorlie has referred, and the question of the liquor traffic ; as to both of which I desire to obtain further facts before coming to a decision. I may tell the honorable member that nothing that I am doing now will involve my pledging the responsibility of the Government to the alienation of masses of land. I do not propose to settle that question without further consultation with Parliament. </para>

What I will do is this : I will take care that no large blocks are alienated - that no alienations take place except of small areas adapted for agricultural settlement, so that the soil of British New Guinea will not be permanently affected by any disposals made in the meantime, except to an infinitesimal extent. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I have no sympathy whatever with any land-grab alienation, but I think that in the case of settlers wanting to go to British New Guinea to obtain small areas, permission may be granted to them to select, in order that we may not cause stagnation. In the meantime, my mind will be perfectly open to be influenced by the result of the inquiries which I shall make. </para>

                        <para>- I venture to say that the action of this Parliament should put further restrictions upon the alienation of land there. This Parliament was elected by the people of Australia, and it emphatically stated that no further alienations should take place. But because the Prime Minister does not agree with the action of the majority of this House he says that he is going to hang up the Bill until he obtains further information. There has been grave, and I venture to say well-founded complaint, against government by Cabinet. Here we have a clear declaration by the representatives of the people, who are responsible to their constituents, of what they wish, and the Government take an action that is diametrically opposed to the wish of the majority. I venture to say that the action of the Government is quite unsound. The right honorable gentleman also wishes to make inquiries regarding the sale of liquor. It seems that he is ready to put on one side the wishes of the majority of the House on the point in consequence of predilections of his own. If these matters were, in the opinion of the Prime Minister, vital to the Papua Bill, he should have said so at the time the measure was in Committee. That was the time for him to make a declaration, and not after the people, by their associations and representative men, have indorsed our action, and have forwarded petitions thanking the House for what they have done. It is not at all satisfactory that the Government should drop the Bill at this stage, and I submit respectfully that their action is unsatisfactory. I shall watch with a great deal of interest the position assumed by the right honorable gentleman when he is before the people appealing for support in his references to this particular subject. </para>

                    <para>- I think that this matter is very serious. The position taken up by the Government with regard to the Papua (British New Guinea) Bill is not only unsound, but is based upon a frivolous objection. The right honorable gentleman told us when he introduced the Bill that it was so necessary to have it passed that it should be taken through Committee at the earliest possible moment. But because certain amendments were made in it the right honorable gentleman quietly drops the measure. It had been passed through Committee, and remained for a considerable time awaiting its third reading. What are the intentions of the Government <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If the Prime Minister returns, after the general elections, with a majority at his back - and it is very problematical whether he will do so - he will, I presume, test the feeling of the House again with regard to the non-alienation of land and the liquor traffic in British New Guinea. He is treating Parliament with contempt. He knows that owing to the unsatisfactory state of the electoral rolls, and the position we are in with regard to the elections, no one will take any action to turn his Government out of office at the present time. He is merely relying upon that. Practically, he is insulting the wishes of the House on every possible occasion. The right honorable gentleman himself urged that there was a great necessity for the passage of the Bill, but he has dropped it merely because two amendments were put in with which he does not agree. Who are the people who have come to the right honorable gentleman and urged him to obtain further information <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> They are the representatives of one of the biggest firms connected with the trade of British New Guinea - the firm that is likely to do the biggest trade there in the future. I allude to Burns, Philp and Co. They are the people who waited on the right honorable gentleman, in the form of a deputation, to urge upon him what action he should take. Because these people have interviewed him, the desires of Parliament are practically placed on one side and its wishes are disregarded. </para>

Even suppose that certain members of it did come from New Guinea that is no reason why the wishes of this House should be placed on one side. If the Prime Minister made it a vital principle of his Bill, and a vital plank in the policy of his Government, that amendments prohibiting the alienation of land and the introduction of liquor should not be made in the Bill, be should have informed the Committee to that effect. But the right honorable gentleman did not do so. I feel sure that had it not been for the peculiar position we are placed in owing to the coming elections, the right honorable gentleman would not have taken the course that he has done. </para>

                    (Dalley). - I think that this is a very important matter. The Prime Minister admits that the two great reforms which have been carried with reference to British New Guinea - namely, land reform and liquor reform - have induced him to drop the Papua Bill. Those reforms were carried by very substantial majorities. The amendment in favour of the non-alienation of the land was carried by thirty-three votes to nineteen. The Prime Minister, however, has abandoned the Bill, and has given a pledge that he will suspend all matters concerning the alienation of land until he receives reports in answer to his inquiries. So far as the liquor traffic also is concerned, the granting of any further licences is a matter of interest to a majority of honorable members.

                        <para>- It is an important admission from the right honorable gentleman that he will recommend that no further licences shall be granted pending the settlement of the question. Could he not adopt the same course with regard to the alienation of land ? The arguments used by the right honorable gentleman to-day were the arguments he used when we were considering the Bill, and the answer given then is the answer given now, that we know there are speculators in the field, and that applications have been made for an enormous area of land in New Guinea. Hundreds of thousands of acres are in process of alienation,' and applications have been made for enormous leases. </para>

It is clear that honorable members of this House believe that land and liquor reform should be tested in this Territory, where the conditions are almost primeval. I hope that the Prime Minister will adopt the same course in connexion with land alienation in New Guinea that he is prepared to adopt with respect to the liquor traffic there, until the fuller information which is desired can be obtained for the benefit of honorable members in the new Parliament, which must meet within four or five months from to-day. The right honorable gentleman has dropped the Bill in opposition to a powerful expression of opinion by members of this House on the question of land reform, and he ought to prevent any further alienation of land in New Guinea until the matter has been again considered. </para>

                    <para>- I join in the protest against the action of the Government in this matter. In my view their action is exceedingly unsatisfactory. This House arrived at a certain decision after careful consideration of the two courses, and so far as we can judge, the decision to which we came is backed up by public opinion. I believe the course proposed to be adopted by the Government is not only dangerous, but unwarranted. I hope they will reconsider their decision, and endeavour to secure the passage of the Bill through the Senate in its present form. If it is subsequently found to be an impracticable measure, there will be time enough to come back to Parliament for a i reconsideration of the subject. The action of the Government in the matter in flouting the decision of a majority of the members of this House is altogether unwarranted. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that. This House has said that liquor should be prohibited in New Guinea, and as a good democrat I bow to the will of the majority. I voted with the Government on that question because I know that a drop of grog has saved the lives of many men in the Territory. If settlers there are to be forbidden the use of a drop of whisky, brandy or rum, many of them may be driven to commit suicide. I point out that the assurance of the Prime Minister that no more licences for the sale of liquor will be granted goes for nothing when it is remembered that one firm has control of the whole of the liquor traffic in the Territory. If the trade warranted it I have no doubt that other firms would have cut into it long ago. No doubt some did cut in and failed, and they have left the field to Burns, Philp and Company. In connexion with the administration of New Guinea I saw it stated in a newspaper a few days ago that the Prime Minister had some idea of arranging for mail communication with New Guinea, and I should like to know if there is any truth in that statement. The establishment of steam communication with New Guinea would be one of the best ways of settling the Territory. Many people from Queensland would go there, and particularly from the portion of Queensland I represent, if there were ready means of communication provided. I hope the statement to which I have referred is true, because a few thousands spent in improving the means of communication between the mainland and New Guinea would be money well spent. </para>

If the Bill had been considered by the Senate, and honorable senators had taken a different view, I could understand the desirability of our waiting for some little time in expectation' of both Houses coming to some agreement upon points in difference. But the Bill has not been gone on with in the Senate, and it is an extraordinary course for the Ministry to take on their own responsibility, to absolutely nullify the effective voice of this House. The Prime Minister has said that there will be no alienation of land in larger areas than 640 acres ; but I do not think this a sufficient assurance for honorable members. The evil of alienation is being continued, and there is nothing to prevent a man securing any area of land by dummying. I think there should be some conditional grant system instituted until the next Parliament deals with the question. There should be some provision, for instance, that any grant in fee-simple should be subject to the legislation that may be passed next year, so that, if the principle of alienation is destroyed, there will be a right of resumption given in respect of any land alienated in the meantime. There should certainly be some provision against dummying. There is nothing to prevent a man getting -640 acres, and inducing fifty other persons to do the same thing. What is to prevent him purchasing from those persons subsequently? If there is to be no provision against that kind of thing the promise of the Prime Minister, that there will be no alienation of land to any one person of an area greater than 640 acres, amounts to nothing. We know that, in the past, dummying has often frustrated the best intentions of land reform. Stringent provisions have been incorporated in the Land Acts of the States to prevent it, and unless we have something more than a mere promise that there will be no alienation in areas greater than 640 acres, I am afraid that, by the time the Papua (New Guinea) Bill is passed, a very large area of the best agricultural land will have been finally disposed of in fee simple. </para>

There is no cause for complaint at this stage, when it is remembered that the Bill will again be brought before Parliament when we have fuller information upon the subjects with which it deals. When the Bill was being discussed we were not in possession of full information.

If' the Cabinet cannot flout the House by threatening to resign, they can lay this important measure on one side, and carry on the administration in a manner adverse to the wishes of the majority of honorable members ; and that is not sound government. As the honorable member for Kennedy has said, the Government practically have the House at their mercy, and honorable members can do nothing but wait. But it is only fair that the country should know the reason that this Bill has been laid aside. What about the great temperance bodies - those able and intelligent electors who have been complimenting the Government and honorable members on the proposal which they thought there would be no difficulty in carrying into effect? Although only New Guinea is affected, the principles at stake are so important that all the facts should be clearly laid before the electors at the general election. What has to be decided is whether there shall or shall not be any sale of liquor or any alienation of land in the territory, and these questions should be decided by the electors.

                        <para>- In order to prevent any misapprehension, it is just as well that I should inform the House what course it is intended to pursue. I propose to send to New Guinea some properly-qualified person to make the inquiries which I have previously indicated. To assist him there will be appointed the Chief Justice, who is now the Acting Administrator, and a magistrate of experience in New Guinea. I shall not attempt to influence the inquiry in any way, and I shall be largely guided by the result. In the meantime, the limitation which I have put, or which I hope to put, on the alienation, is the best course I can think of as compatible with any progress in the community, and with the desire and satisfaction of those who desire to take up land. Under the present regulations land on lease can be obtained ; if it could not, I should make provision in that direction. In the meantime no harm can be done, whatever system is adopted, because the 97,000 square miles of New Guinea cannot be affected by the disposal of a few acres. As regards the sale of liquor a similar course of inquiry will be adopted, and if the result be a recommendation to apply something like the Gothenburg system, of which I have read something and of which we have heard a good deal, I shall not hesitate to put it in force. If there be a recommendation by such a. commission as I shall appoint, in favour of leasing the land, that system ought, at any rate, to be tried. </para>

                        <para>- I shall give the recommendation serious consideration ; but I cannot say at once that I would agree to adopt it. In the Possession there have already been passed such completely drastic laws with regard to the prevention of the undue sale of liquor, that one is almost at a loss to see why there should be substituted prohibition, which, in case of illness, would absolutely prevent the missionaries from supplying stimulants necessary to save the lives of the sick in the hospitals. With regard to the mails, I have already mentioned the matter to the Postmaster-General and the Treasurer, and I hope before long to arrange for a regular service. </para>

                    (Kennedy). - The Prime Minister ought to give some information as to the nature of the inquiry he proposes to have made. We desire to know what instructions the right honorable gentleman has given, considering the extraordinary attitude which the Government has assumed. If the Government consent to hold over any alienation until the New Parliament meets, the revenue cannot suffer a loss of more than £100 or £200, seeing that last year only £694 was obtained from the sale and lease of land.

But is there finer land in any part of Australia than can be found on Darling Downs <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Yet hundreds of thousands of acres of that land were sold at practically 2s. 6d. per acre, and are now being bought back by the Government at prices ranging from £3 to £7 an acre. In my own time certain land in New South Wales was said to be totally unfitted for agricultural purposes ; and yet, on that land at the present time one may travel for days through farms upon which agriculture of every description is carried on. If New Guinea can be settled only by alienating the lands, we may come to the conclusion that a few people will monopolise a large portion of the Territory. The Government, after taking the extraordinary step of dropping the measure, when a certain amendment had been submitted, ought to give an assurance that during the three or four months between now and the meeting of the new </para>

If the Government are prepared to allow areas up to 640 acres to be alienated during that time, what will be the result ? It is not probable that between now and the meeting of the new Parliament the opinion of the House in this connexion will change very materially. The probability is that if the Bill be re-introduced a similar amendment will be submitted ; and speculators, knowing that, will rush in and secure the land before the measure becomes law.

                        <para>- The honorable member knows that there was plenty of land in Australia in much the same position as that of the New Guinea lands to-day. There is another feature of the question which has to be considered. On various gold-fields in Queensland the mining industry has been seriously hampered, owing to the fact that large areas known to be gold-bearing cannot be worked, simply because of the alienation of the land. We do not yet know the capabilities of New Guinea, and it is quite possible that alienated lands may be found to contain valuable metals. Then, in regard to the drink traffic, if the Government hold their hand between now and the next Parliament, the revenue cannot be effected to any large extent. Last year only £114 was collected in connexion with the traffic, and considering that the Government intend to introduce a Bill next year, it is reasonable to suppose that only a small portion of that amount would be lost. Therefore the course suggested would not affect the finances of New Guinea to any large extent. The Prime Minister has practically told us that in the event of the Commission which is to be appointed reporting adversely to the ideas of the Government he will consider whether he will go on with the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I do not attribute bad motives, but I say that the manner in which the Government have treated the Bill is a deliberate insult to honorable members. Although it was carried by a large majority, the Government have thrown it on one side, and now we are told that if certain amendments had not been made it would have been proceeded with, although the information which the Prime Minister says he desires is not available. He has not told us the nature of the proposed inquiry. In my opinion, we have been shamefully treated, and those who desire that the dignity and the honour of the House shall be maintained, should make the strongest protest against the action of the Government. </para>

                    <para>- I gather from the speech of the honorable member for Kennedy that he blames the Government because, through their delay in connexion with the Papua Bill, numbers of men may go to New Guinea and take up large areas of land there, between now and the making of the inquiry which is promised. I think that I can show him that his fears are groundless. I am one of those unfortunate individuals who are connected with the Hall Sound Company. Although we have spent a considerable amount of money upon the laud which we have acquired in New Guinea, the company is at present in liquidation. We have land there which we should be only too pleased to let people have at even more reasonable rates than the Government are asking. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the matter is of great importance, but the Government certainly have the right to make inquiries before they finally commit themselves, and the trend of legislation foreshadowed by amendments carried in the Bill is such that it would be better for us not to have the Territory, since, if that legislation is. passed, we shall have to spend £20,000 a year upon it with the certainty of getting no development, because there is no likelihood of any land being acquired under it. We do not know yet what promises have been given in regard to the mission stations in New Guinea. It has hitherto been the custom to grant the mission authorities small areas of land upon which to build their mission houses. Are we going to put an end to that in New Guinea, and require that the houses shall be built on leased land? In my opinion such an arrangement would be an extremely unfair one. I think that the Government are taking the right step. </para>

                    (Melbourne Ports).- To my mind the position of the Prime Minister is inexplicable. He tells us that he is going to appoint a Commission, and that if it reports in one way he will act, while if it reports in another way he will merely " consider." I would point out to the honorable member for Kalgoorlie that the amendment carried in Committee in regard to the liquor traffic in New Guinea was not a " 66 Bourke street affair," but was carried by a large majority. I am sure that honorable members do not wish to attempt to do anything impracticable.

                    <para>- When during the last week or two I have seen paragraphs in the newspapers to the effect that the Government propose to drop the Papua Bill, I have regarded them as probable instances of the misrepresentation about which wet have heard complaints in this Chamber of late. I recognise the right of every Government to act as it chooses in regard to important legislation of which it has charge, and, ;if necessary, to drop it if amendments of which it does not approve are carried. That was the course they took the other day in regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. But they accepted without demur the amendments carried against them in the Papua Bill, and allowed the Bill to be reported from Committee. I was under the impression that the third reading was not proceeded with, merely because of the ordinary causes which create delay. I do not know that at the time the amendments were carried the Government had any intention to drop the Bill. There was a great deal of discussion last week as to whether "the Government gave fair notice to honorable members as to what would happen if the -amendment proposed in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and afterwards agreed to, were carried. Personally, I foresaw the probable fate of the Bill if the amendments were carried, and I consider that I had ample warning of the intentions of the Government regarding it. But it is one thing to treat honorable members as they were treated in regard to this Bill, and another thing to treat them as they have been treated in regard to the Papua Bill. The' argument of the Prime Minister in regard to the land alienation question is one which may be applied against him. He says that no harm can be done by not carrying into' law the anti-alienation provisions in the Bill, because no alienation is going on. But the fact is an equally good reason for enacting those provisions, because they can do no harm if no alienation is taking place. With regard to the inquiries of the Commission, whose recommendations are to be adopted if the Prime Minister likes them, and to be " considered " if he does not, surely it is more proper that the House should decide upon such an important question than that it should be left to the Prime Minister. It may be asked - " Why do not those who disapprove o! the action of the Ministry in this matter take steps to make them feel their responsibility?" I do not believe in cutting off a man's head to cure the toothache. The Papua Bill is not one of those measures in which the fate of a Ministry is usually involved, and under the circumstances we are practically helpless. I regret that the Ministry have taken a course which is opposed to the principles of responsible government. If the Government had told the Committee that if the amendments to which they objected were carried they would not proceed with the Bill, they would have been justified in the course which they have since taken. But it was not proper or courteous to allow the amendments to be carried, and then, when no one was looking, to take the Bill out of the back-door and drop it on the dust heap. Such an action is not calculated to endear any Government even to its well-wishers. </para>

                    <para>- The situation in regard to the Papua Bill is, to say the least of it, a very peculiar one. It must be assumed that the Government before framing the Bill had before them all the information available regarding the situation of affairs in Papua, and, therefore, I fail to see what more information they wish to ask for. We have not been told what information they seek to get. The Bill having been altered in Committee, the Government hung it up upon the excuse that they desire further information. What information do they desire? There has not been much said in regard to the liquor question, and I do not know what information they can get in regard to it. We are told that prohibition exists already so far as the natives are concerned, and we are perfectly capable of judging as to the effects of extending that principle to the white population. Therefore no Commission could afford us any additional information. It seems extraordinary also to send to Papua for special information with regard to the adaptability of the selling or leasing system to the lands of the Possession. Only a few white people live in Papua, but perhaps the Government intend to ascertain the views of the natives as to the respective merits of the selling and leasing systems. It is just possible that they may know of some system better than any within our knowledge, despite our boasted civilization. The Government are perfectly entitled to drop a Bill if they do not approve of some of the principles insisted upon by honorable members \ but, at the same time, we are justified in asking for information regarding the system of administration to be followed in the absence of legislation on the subject. The Bill would have given the people of New Guinea a Constitution which would have enabled them to manage their own affairs to a very large extent ; but now the sole control will rest in the hands of the Prime Minister. The right honorable gentleman has indicated that he is prepared to alienate land, and if he does so he will act in direct opposition to the wish expressed by a majority of honorable members. He has not even told us whether he will administer the affairs of the Territory under the regulations or ordinances already in force, or according to his own sweet will. We are entitled to a distinct assurance that it is not intended to alienate any land in the Possession. Attempts have previously been made to obtain control of large areas, and, although I have no doubt that the Prime Minister will exercise great care, I think he should make his intentions clear. We should also be informed whether the administration is to carried on in Papua, or whether the Prime Minister will exercise sole control over the land. Honorable members have every reason to be dissatisfied with the statement which has been made. I should not complain of delay if we could rest assured that nothing would be done contrary to the expressed wishes of honorable members. </para>

A great deal of land has been practically given away in the past, but when better means of communication are provided a sudden rush may take place, and the Minister may be called upon to discharge a very heavy responsibility. Honorable members are entitled to a clear and definite statement as to the Minister's intentions. </para>

                    <para>- When the Bill was under discussion, I spoke at some length with regard to the absurdity of prohibiting the sale of liquor, and of declining to sell land in Papua. I am glad that the Prime Minister had the good sense to seek for further information, with regard to both matters, before proceeding further with the Bill. If honorable members imagine that when a Bill has been read a second time it virtually becomes law, they make a great mistake. The third reading of the Papua Bill has not yet been passed.. If honorable members think that the Government have acted in an unconstitutional or improper manner in holding back the measure, they have a remedy ready to their hands. Surely the other branch of the Legislature, whose special function it is to protect the States rights, will have something to say with regard to proposals which would have the effect of absolutely putting a stop to settlement. It is all very well for honorable members who have had little or no experience of tropical countries, and of the difficulties of settlement in such countries, to pass experimental legislation. If honorable members knew of the difficulties of settlement in tropical countries arising from their distance from the markets, and other circumstances, they would hesitate to agree to such stringent provisions as those now contained in the Papua Bill. We are aware of the difficulties experienced in connexion with the settlement of the Northern Territory of South Australia and of Northern Queensland. Is the land in Papua so much richer than that to be found in those portions of the continent, because it lies sixty or seventy miles distant from our coast ? Distant fields were ever the greenest. Many men have gone from; the Northern Territory to New Guinea, and very few have returned. The majority of those who came back died soon afterwards owing to the mischief which malarial fever had worked upon them. </para>

                        <para>- We know there are over 90,000 square miles in Papua. There is also a very large area of land open for settlement in Dutch New Guinea. The Queensland Government would have welcomed settlement in Papua. I am familiar with the conditions, very similar to those prevailing in New Guinea, under which Melville. Island was settled in the first instance, and I know also of the difficulties which were experienced in establishing the first settlement at Port Essington. At the present time those who desire to take up land can pick and choose for themselves in the Northern Territory, which has a climate very similar to that of Papua. The annual rainfall there amounts to fifty or sixty inches, which is ample for the purpose of agriculture, and there are plenty of magnificent blocks of land along the rivers fit for almost any purpose, although they are somewhat distant from the markets. That land can be taken up without survey for ls. 3d. per acre, five years being allowed for completion of the purchase. Yet, notwithstanding these liberal conditions, not one pound's worth of land has been sold there during the last ten years. Papua reeks with tropical diseases, and it is far distant from the 'ordinary markets ; and if it is decreed that the land there shall not be alienated, and that the liquor traffic shall be prohibited, we cannot hope that settlement will progress. Is it not sufficient to prohibit the liquor traffic with the natives, as in the case of the Northern Territory, or do teetotal faddists desire to make an experiment? If the Bill- were passed in its present form, it would perpetuate the liability of the States to contribute towards the cost of administration. Liquor would be introduced to the island in spite of all prohibitory laws, and that which reached there would probably be of the vilest description. </para>

I have ridden and walked a good many hundreds of miles. I merely rise to suggest that in view of the insertion in the Bill of these two absurd provisions the Government are perfectly right in staying their hands for a little time with a view to making further inquiries. If the Ministry desired to wreck the measure, I would recommend them to adopt one course only. I would advise them to put it through its third reading with these and as many more absurd provisions included in it. as the various sections of this House who are possessed of particular fads chose to insert. Then it should be sent up to the Senate, with a view to see if that branch of the Legislature would pass it with the penalty of £20,000 a year attached to it. </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to defend a certain amount of indulgence in whisky. I object to any person who allows his intemperance upon the matter of temperance to runaway with his discretion. I do not blame the Government for having dropped a Bill which contained a provision of that kind. I hold that it would not work satisfactorily in any new country. In this connexion I could quote the testimony of a man who has lived for many years in New Guinea - I think he is a clergyman - whose remarks recently appeared in the Melbourne press. In that interview he pointed out that there had been no abuse of liquor whatever in New Guinea, and that it had never been accessible to the natives. He declared that no damage had been done; and that, so far as he could judge, there was no justification whatever for this attempted prohibition. Had I thought that this matter would have been raised again during the present session, I should have kept the extract; but any honorable member who cares to look up the files of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper during the past three or four weeks will find the interview to which I refer. That is all that I care to say in regard to the action of the Government. A few days ago I noticed in the press a statement to the effect that the magistrates of New Guinea, who are Imperial officers, are indisposed to continue in their present positions, and to come under the Commonwealth, fearing that by so doing they may lose their rights to Imperial promotion and pensions. </para>

I believe that in Australia we have bushmen who are quite capable of performing the duties of magistrates in New Guinea - not one, but hundreds of them - men who are well fitted for the work, who understand the native races, and who are well qualified to withstand the climate and administer the law. Consequently, I hope the Government. will not hesitate to accept the resignations of these gentlemen, and to appoint others from Australia in their stead. </para>

                        <para>- I do not intend to beside tracked on this matter. Its various phases- "were discussed during the passage of the Bill through Committee, and, by a majority of fourteen in a House of sixty members, we affirmed that there should be no further alienation of Crown lands. If the Prime Minister thought that that decision represented only a catch vote he had an opportunity of reversing it. He has made bo attempt in that direction. Apparently he has read the temper of the Senate to be similar to that of this House. Of course I aru aware that there is a way in which we could effectively protest against the action of the Government in abandoning the measure. The remedy would be to move an amendment to reduce this item of £20,000 by £2. If such <inline font-style="italic">&amp;d.</inline> amendment were submitted, and those who believed in the non-alienation of land, and the prohibition of the sale of intoxicants, voted in favour of it, it would be carried. But the adoption of that amendment would mean the defeat of the Government, and we -are not prepared for that. Honorable members, therefore, are really manacled. </para>

                <para>Mi-. WILKS. - Upon every conceivable occasion we are met in that way. Personally I am prepared to vote for a reduction of the item. I am annoyed that the Government have abandoned the Bill, and so are others. Even the honorable and learned member for Corinella, who, for two and a-half years has given the Government an unqualified support, has condemned their action in throwing the measure aside. The Prime Minister has declared that there is no rush for land in New Guinea. But those who desire to traffic in land are now aware of the temper of this House, and, anticipating that a similar opinion will be held by the next Parliament, they will naturally say - " Now is our opportunity to rush the settlement and to acquire territory." For that reason I ask the Prime Minister to stay his hand. He will find that in the Territory even his idea of agricultural areas - he did not say whether with or without occupation </para>

                        <para>- No vested interests of any moment have to be overcome in Papua, and it seems to me that there is an opportunity for land speculators there. I fail to understand why the Prime Minister adheres so firmly to the stand which he has taken. It would be very easy for him to say - " We have abandoned the Papua Bill ; we think the new Parliament will express an opinion different from that expressed by this House in regard to these matters, but pending the election of the new Parliament we will grant the request of the Committee." I have no desire to move that the item be reduced. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie, who was instrumental in bringing about the more important reform in relation to New Guinea lands, is entitled to do so. </para>

                        <para>- If a game is to be played in regard to the proposed land and liquor reforms in Papua, it will be played at the expense of the people. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports is a staunch supporter of the Government ; but, in view of their action in seeking to disregard the reform in the liquor traffic of Papua, for which we have declared, he would be compelled to vote for the reduction of this item by the sum of £2. The Ministry are simply flouting the decision of the House. Are we prepared to allow Cabinets to override such expressions of opinion. I am "of the opinion that the proposed liquor reform movement is a right one. The House has said that there shall be prohibition in Papua, and has also declared against the alienation of the lands of that Territory. All that is asked is that pending the decision of the Parliament the Government shall hold in abeyance any recommendation or ordinance made by the local authorities in regard to the alienation of the Papuan lands. </para>

                    (Wide Bay). - I do not think it would be wise to allow the statements repeatedly made by the honorable member for South Australia,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. V.</inline>
                    L. Solomon, with regard to' the tropical portions of Queensland, to go uncontradicted. The honorable member never makes a speech without attacking those who believe that white people are able to cultivate the land in that part of Australia. In disputing our assertion he invariably relies upon his experience in the Northern Territory. One would think that no other person had lived in the northern part of Australia, He is evidently one of those who would applaud the statement made recently by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Patterson</inline>
                    at the Chillagoe Company's meeting, that white men are simply useless in that part of Queensland. The whole of Northern Queensland has practically been developed by white labour, and the country lying north of Townsville is now, perhaps, the most prosperous part of Australia. All the great mining enterprises at Croydon, Charters Towers,. Ravenswood, and other places in Northern Queensland are entirely carried on by white labour, and it is absurd to suggest that white men cannot work in that climate. Queenslanders do not thank the honorable member for these repeated insinuations. The statement made by him that there are 90,000; square miles available for settlement in Papua is not in accordance with the official reports.

Some sixty years ago Queensland was.- but very sparsely settled, and as one travels north of Brisbane he finds that settlement takes place rapidly only upon the discovery of gold. The same arguments are being used in regard to the alienation of the lands of Papua, that were used from time to time in the Queensland Parliament in reference to the lands of that State. I have heard it said by those who were interested that they would not give ls. 9d. per acre for land that is now considered to be worth £2 and £3 per acre. Of course they would not give ls. 9d. per acre for it if they could obtain it for ls. per acre. </para>

My desire is that we shall not part with the freehold of large tracts of land in Papua. The Government have no right to flout the will of Parliament. A great principle - the principle of leasehold as against the freehold system - is at stake. The leasehold system is repugnant to many people, but that is no reason why the Government should seek to alter the course which Parliament wishes to follow. This House has said, " We desire the adoption of a certain system," and the Government say "You shall not have it." The time will come when the Parliament will have to assert itself. I have this further statement to make : I desire to know from the Prime Minister whether he has put his view in the form of a minute to the officers whom he desires to prepare the report which he states he intends to lay before Parliament <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Every one will admit that it is not so much what is inquired into, as the form of the question submitted to the persons who are to make the inquiries, that is important. J wish to know what kind of questions the Prime Minister is going to submit to the officers ? It would not be very difficult to put such questions as would almost compel the officers answering them to support the views of the questioner. I hope that the right honorable gentleman will lay upon the table the terms of the minute to be submitted to the officers. That is only a fair thing. Within a few months we shall all be before our constituents, and we should be able to explain to them fully what our views are. It is also mandatory upon the Government that they should show what their position is regarding this question. </para>

                    <para>- An interjection made by the honorable member for Melbourne just now, might lead people to think that the development of the Darling Downs, and of other parts of Queensland, had been affected by the alienation of land. I take the opposite view. I contend that settlement on those rich plains has been retarded by the alienation of land. In the first place, those who occupied lands on the Darling Downs leased them from the New South Wales Government - Queensland being then known as the Moreton Bay District of New South Wales. In order to keep settlers from going to those districts, it was industriously stated that it was of no use for a small man to try to make a living there. The Darling Downs, which has now become the garden of Australia, was described as a place where it was impossible to grow a cabbage. But we had an example of what that country can produce the other day in the form of the produce exhibited at the Victorian Royal Agricultural Show. What has been the result of the alienation of land there? When the Queensland Government wanted to cut up the large properties that were held in pastoral leases, and passed an Act-calculated to have the effect of cutting them up, and' of settling yeomanry on the land, there was wholesale dummying, as a result of which the large estates were still held together. The consequence of such aggregations of land is seen in Victoria as well as in Queensland. What is being done to-day <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The Governments of those States are purchasing large estates for the purpose of settling the population and making the railways pay. The problem that is before the Railways Commissioners in Victoria, and in all the other States, is to make the railways pay. That can only be done by settling the people on the laud, so that they may have produce to send over the lines. Land that was dummied in some instances at 2s. 6d. an acre is now being purchased by the Governments of the States at £4 or <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> per acre. My memory carries me back to the early days of settlement in Queensland, before separation from New South Wales, and I am able to speak with a certain amount of knowledge. I repeat that the problem that now faces the States, particularly in connexion with their railways, has been rendered acute by the alienation of land which has not always been acquired honestly. I do not know that we can expect that a different state of things will obtain in New Guinea than has obtained in the States, if we adhere to the old policy. This House, by a wise decision, has declared itself averse to the alienation of land in the Territory. A reasonable request has been made to the Government to postpone the alienation of public land until, at any rate, after the elections. In deference to the wishes of the House that request should be acceded to. The condition of things prevailing throughout Australia, as exhibited in the late railway strike in Victoria, in the raising of freights and in the cutting down of wages, can be traced to the aggregation of lands in the hands of a few, and to the construction of railway lines by political influence, often for the benefit of estates held by particular individuals. Those estates are only used as cattle runs and sheep walks, instead of being occupied by prosperous farming communities, who, by providing traffic for the railways, would make them pay. In my opinion no matter what expert management may be imported from abroad, or trained in Australia, that problem cannot be solved until the people are settled on the land ; and while large estates are held for speculative purposes, as they are being held in many places, it will be impossible to obtain that settlement which is needed to make Australia, what we hope she will become in the future - a happy, prosperous, and progressive nation. One of the wisest Acts passed by the late Government in Queensland was that for the repurchase of estates. But look at the price that had to be paid for them. I recollect the first settlement in the Moreton Bay district. I know of estates that were then alienated, and which, if the Government required them would have to be repurchased at one hundred times the price for which they were originally sold. Many of these estates have been lying idle ever since. Some properties in Brisbane that were sold for £25 an allotment are now worth on the unimproved value £25,000 per allotment. Some may say that this enhanced value is due to the prudence and foresight of those who purchased the land in the first instance. But we know that it is due to the aggregation of population, and to the improvements effected by the construction of harbors, the improvement of rivers, the building of railways, the erection of telegraph lines, and other developments. At the beginning of our national life as a Commonwealth I do not think we should be afraid to step out of the groove. No one will be harmed by our declaring that the lands in New Guinea which are under our administration shall be held by the Crown for all time. Let those who want to use them pay a rent for them. There will thus be a revenue derived from them, and they will not be held for speculative purposes. I also want to say a word or two about the erroneous idea that seems to be industriously promulgated about the unhealthiness of the- northern portions of Queensland. If honorable members look at the vital statistics they will find that the death rate among the alien population of Queensland is at least three times as great as the death rate amongst the white population. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want to exaggerate, but I desire to emphasize the fact that in calculating the death rate of the white population the infantile population is taken into account. But the aliens who come into Queensland - particularly the kanakas - are adults. When the black-birders go to the South Sea Islands they do not bring back weaklings, but full-blooded, strong men. These people die like rotten sheep from malaria. I have known malaria to be as bad round about Moreton Bay as it is now in the northern districts of Queensland. Indeed,, malaria is invariably bad in any new country, when virgin soil is being opened up, in the neighbourhood of the Tropics. Honorable members can still see the graves of the navvies who first cut their way through the scrub in the western plains, engaged in. railway construction work. A little while ago, when 'we were discussing the question of the prohibition of the sale of intoxicants in New Guinea, there were those who urged that without rum and quinine it was impossible for white men to live in such countries. I know better. I know that the men who abstained from the use of rum when the works to which I have alluded were being constructed, were those who came through best. In the early days of settlement, men who did not drink rum, and sleep under a bullock dray, were considered to have no chance of life. But, as a matter of fact, those who abstained were able to endure hardships far better than those who took intoxicants. </para>

                        <para>- No, they are not ; but I dare say that in the early days of Western Australia the right honorable gentleman saw some pretty hard drinking, just as I saw it in the early days in Queensland. Very often when bullock drays laden with rum were sent up country, the casks when opened were found to contain something else than that they started with. The vital statistics of Queensland prove that white men are able to work in that part of the country quite as well as any alien, people can do. Only a little while ago I was looking over a newspaper that is by no means democratic in its sympathies, and I found there a statement that the men in the cane-fields were cutting cane, and doing it more satisfactorily than it was done in the past by kanakas. I think that any loyal Australian should take these reflections upon the unhealthiness of any part of our territory, when they are known to be untrue, as a libel upon our country. I have travelled pretty well all over the north, and there is no part of Australia, so far as I have seen it,, which cannot be inhabited by white people. I cannot speak of the Northern Territory. The honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. V.</inline> L. Solomon, knows more about it than I do. But I can speak confidently of Queensland, and I say that there is no part of it where the white man cannot work in comparative comfort if he has the proper opportunities. I have no desire to give a vote adverse to the Government on this matter, and I shall therefore not support any reduction of this item, but I do think that the Government should take notice of the opinions expressed here, and should hold their hands until after the next general election, so far as the alienation of land in New Guinea is concerned. The wish of this House on the subject has been expressed in no uncertain way, and the Government by giving expression to the will of Parliament in this matter will also be giving expression to the will of the country. </para>

                    <para>- In this division the sum of £3,500 was put down by the Attorney-General as the anticipated expenditure upon registrars, marshal, and officers, but since that estimate was framed my honorable colleague has made arrangements which enable me to ask the Committee to reduce this sum by £2,000, leaving the sum of £1,500 to provide for Judges' Associates and one or two messengers. For the time being, and I hope for some considerable time, we shall be able to have the rest of the work done by State officers. A small honorarium will, of course, have to be given to those officers for the extra work they will have to do, but, on the whole, my colleague has been able to make an economical and satisfactory arrangement for the conduct of the High Court upon its initiation.

                        <para>- I should like to ask the Treasurer if he can favour the Committee with any indication of the time when the Judges of the High Court are likely to be appointed <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Honorable members are aware, and it is a matter of public notoriety, that the names of various members of this House have been connected with the appointments to the High Court Judgeships. I venture to think it is highly undesirable that matters of this sort should remain in uncertainty. The Judiciary Bill having been passed, there is a necessity for the appointments, and I am inclined to think there is a feeling, with which the Treasurer will not be disinclined to sympathize, that the sooner these things are settled and the present uncertainty ended the better it will be for the constitutional position generally and for the conduct of public affairs. </para>

                        <para>- Because there will be scarcely time for them to make themselves acquainted with the duties of the position, whilst the State returning officers are familiar with the work, and their assistance has been availed of in the compilation of the rolls. If postmasters are appointed for the purpose they will be thoroughly unfamiliar with the duties. I do not know what the M inister proposes to do. But I know there is a strong opinion existing among some experts as to the inexpediency of making new appointments for this purpose. The late Minister for Home Affairs was under the impression that we must have new officers for all purposes, and he required a special staff for public works and electoral matters, but if that idea is pushed to the extreme in this instance the result will be confusion. The State returning officers of South Australia carried out the work for the last Federal elections. I assume that the Federal officer will act as principal returning officer for each State, but I think we ought to utilize the existing State machinery for the subordinate positions. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so in some cases, but school houses are to be found almost everywhere, and they will provide very suitable buildings for the purpose. Electors are required to vote at certain polling places and these have already been arranged for throughout the Commonwealth, although they have .not been finally approved. A great deal of trouble has been taken in connexion with them. Persons having special knowledge, or who are interested, have been consulted, and I believe we shall be able to give satisfaction in this respect. </para>

I do not anticipate that there will be any difficulty. It seems to me that it will not require a genius to manage an electoral division. The States being divided, the taking of the poll for the whole State for senators will be made easier. I can assure honorable members that every care will be taken. Should any honorable member desire further information, I shall be very glad to give it, or to bear in mind any suggestions which may be made. </para>

                    <para>- This is the time at which we should make our suggestions, and we should make them clearly. I think the right honorable gentleman might have made his policy a little more definite. We are now within a few weeks of the time when the electors will first exercise their right to the ballot under the Commonwealth Electoral Act, and the Minister should state clearly the whole position and the policy of the Government. The honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> has suggested that we should utilize the services of the various State returning officers. The desire of the people of Queensland is that Commonwealth officers shall conduct the elections ; and it is for the Minister to declare the policy of the Government on the point. </para>

I admit that there will be difficulties and dangers connected with the first elections under our Electoral Act, but that only makes it all the more necessary to approach the question calmly and deliberately, so that all these points may be stated and discussed before the vote is passed. The electors, who must know a little less than we do, require some guidance. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to receive that assurance. In Queensland there will be a. different form of ballot, a different method of voting, and a different method of counting the votes, from what has been the practice* hitherto in that State. The probability is that only at one centre in each State electorate will the ballot-boxes be opened for the purpose of counting the votes ; and that is a sound policy. Every honorable member is in favour of the principle of the secret ballot ; but that principle cannot be carried out if at each small polling place,, where only a few votes have been recorded, the voting-papers are counted. It is the duty of the House to see that the ballot is secret in fact as well as in law, and that can only be accomplished by having all the ballot-boxes taken to large centres,, and there opened by the returning officer or assistant returning officer, who must mix the ballot-papers before opening and counting them. If that is not the law,, there is yet time to make it the law; but in my opinion the Electoral Act enables the Government to adopt that policy. </para>

                    <para>- I understand that arrangements are being made for the settlement of the various polling places, and I ask the Minister to expedite this work as much as possible. Under section 25 of the Electoral Act before a polling place, other than the chief polling place fora division, can be constituted, reports- nave to be made by the Commonwealth Electoral Officer of the State to the Minister, specifying what polling places are required to meet the public convenience. Unless this work is done quickly it will be impossible in the case of centres which have been overlooked to send word to the electoral officer of the State, and for him to communicate to the central office in Melbourne in time for the Governor-General in Council to make the necessary notification. We understand that the elections are to take place some time in December, and as the polling places have to be declared before the issue of the writs, there remain only seven or eight weeks in which to make the necessary arrangements. I urge the Minister to take immediate steps to have the polling places declared, especially in States like Queensland and Western Australia. When the polling places have been settled by the Governor-General in Council, distant States have to be notified ; and it is only on the publication of that notification that it can be seen whether any centres have been overlooked. In Queensland, since the State polling places were declared - and I suppose these will form the basis of the report of the Commonwealth Electoral Officer - large settlement has taken place in various centres, and, further, some of the polling places in the State electorates have not proved altogether satisfactory. We are not asking for any favour on political grounds, but merely urging that all populous centres shall be fairly and honestly constituted polling places under the Act. I am sure the Minister will give serious attention to the point raised by the honorable member for Wide Bay. In Queensland and other places the complaint is that where there is a polling place, with only five or six electors, and with, perhaps, the owner of the property as returning officer, the secrecy of the ballot is a farce. </para>

                        <para>- It would not be so serious if, for instance, the ballot boxes were taken 150 miles away. When the Electoral Bill was before the House this point was very fully discussed ; but it is really a matter of administration. In ' one State electorate, such as Wide Bay, there may be three populous centres, such as Gympie, Bundaberg, and Maryborough, where the voting-papers ought to be counted. </para>

The idea is that there shall be a returning officer for each division, and at each populous place in such division there shall be an assistant returning officer, with as many presiding officers as are necessary. The presiding officers will send the ballot-boxes to a returning officer, or an assistant returning officer ; and the assistant returning officer will count the votes and send the numbers to the returning officer, who will declare the result. </para>

                    <para>- The assistant returning officer will mix the voting-papers before he counts the votes. I thoroughly understand the point raised. The desire is, first, to maintain the secrecy of the ballot, and, secondly, to have as much expedition as possible. We do not wish to have all the boxes sent to one centre, because that would take up too much time. We had a law to that effect in Western Australia, and the result was that sometimes a month elapsed, and we had forgotten all about the election before we knew the result. The Government will be able to do exactly what honorable members desire, namely, to maintain the secrecy of the ballot, and have assistant returning officers at the various important centres, where the voting-papers will be mixed, before they are counted. </para>

                    <para>- It is vital to the proper administration of the Electoral Act that there shall be an early notification of the proposed polling places. The conditions are different in regard to the State Legislatures, inasmuch as under the Electoral Act, every elector has to be registered on the roll with respect to a polling place where he is supposed to record his vote. I know there is a provision enabling an elector to record his vote elsewhere, but there will be some difficulty in doing so, seeing that he will have to provide himself with a form of declaration. </para>

                        <para>- But an elector will have to sign a declaration ; and experience in New South Wales has shown that, in many cases, such a formality acts as a deterrent. There is no need to withhold the publication of the polling places. If the lists are completed the notification can be issued at a moment's notice, thus enabling the electors to know whether any important centres have been overlooked. </para>

                        <para>- There is another point which I wish to impress upon the Minister, and that is that it would be wise, so far as New South Wales at least is concerned, to adopt the polling places used for elections of members of the Legislative Assembly. At some of these places only a small number of votes is recorded, and there may be a disposition on the part of the Federal Government to abolish them to save expense, particularly since under the Commonwealth Electoral Act provision is made for voting by post. I would point out, however, that these places are a convenience to persons living in isolated parts of the country whose access to larger centres is very difficult, and great injustice will be done to them if the polling booths to which they have been accustomed to go are not provided. The exercise of the postal vote is surrounded by a good many difficulties which will tend towards the disfranchisement of persons living in isolated places, and therefore I strongly urge the Minister to have the list of polling places printed as speedily as possible, so that the necessary corrections can be made before the elections are held. Another suggestion I have to make is that electors be supplied with information in regard to the main provisions of the Act. There are a number of provisions in our electoral law which do not find; a place in the State electoral law, and for. the smooth working of the Act, and for the information of those who will be selected to administer it, the Minister should have a short synopsis of its. provisions compiled. This synopsis should be printed in a. handy form, and while I do not think it possible to distribute it to every elector, copies might be hung up outside polling booths, post-offices, and other places of public resort where they will be readily accessible to the public, who can thus make themselves thoroughly acquainted with the law. If this is not done many mistakes will be made, and informal votes will be cast. </para>

                    <para>- The Commonwealth electoral law is probably more like the South Australian electoral law than it is like the electoral law of any other State ; but it differs very largely from .the States-, laws generally. In all the States the electors have become accustomed to certain polling booths, and I do not want what T regard as unwise economy to be practised7 by the abolition of any of them. Although such a step would, by lessening the number of officers required, effect a certain saving, the economy would be dearly bought, inasmuch as it would prevent a considerable1number of electors from voting. Probably the bulk of the electors, whether they bomen or women, cannot afford the time to hunt round their district to ascertain where they should go to vote. </para>

                        <para>- The expense of the necessary printing and the hire of halls .will so greatly reduce the amount which the candidate is allowed to spend that there will be very little left for other purposes - indeed a candidate who is anxious not- to contravene the law must watch the expenditure of every penny. But as the Act will introduce a great many changes, and consequently create a certain amount of confusion and difficulty, we should see that that is not increased by the abolition of polling booths to which electors have been accustomed to go. It must be remembered that the public have now only a couple of months in which to assimilate the provisions of the Act. I suggest that the Minister should cause to be prepared a short statement of its provisions, not so much for the guidance of officials as in order that electors may know what to do to comply with its requirements. It should not be an elaborate statement, dealing in full with the various exceptions, but one setting forth shortly the duties of the elector, such as that he should ascertain the polling place for which he is enrolled ; and giving him information as to the booths at which he- can vote, what he should do at' the polling booth to which he goes, how he can arrange to vote outside his division, and how he can obtain permission to vote by post. I do not suggest that this statement should be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette,</inline> because that publication is very little read, but I have no doubt that the newspapers would be glad to print it for the information of the public, and that it would do much to prevent mistakes. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt the honorable and learned member will do what he can to instruct the electors of the Corinella division. The electors of Victoria are not less intelligent than those of Queensland. I am glad that the Minister has assured the Committee that Commonwealth officials are, as far as possible, to be employed in administering the Act. That announcement will be hailed in Queensland with delight. During the last month we have heard a. great deal here about gerrymandering ; but if honorable members had sat in opposition to .the Queensland Government which has. just gone to its doom- </para>

                        <para>- Yes. If they had sat in opposition to that Government, they would, know what political jobbery means. The members of that Government have done some of the most diabolical things that it is possible to do in connexion with elections. There is a polling place named Bonna Vanna, out near Cunnamulla, 100 miles from the nearest railway station, which was frequently not appointed a polling place until it was seen that the Government candidate was getting behind. In one instance they put off the election for a month, and rounded-up voters from Victoria, Tasmania, and New Zealand. I believe that they even cabled to the old country for two or three voters who were there. After gathering together as many voters as they could, they conveyed them out to the voting place by special coaches, and defeated the opposition candidate by about ten votes. Some honorable members of the Opposition in this Chamber have complained about jobbery and gerrymandering in connexion with the electoral divisions ; but they would have had greater cause for complaint if they had been in Queensland. Under the Commonwealth. Electoral Act the voters will have a fair and square deal for the first time. We are told by the Minister for Home Affairs that in the first place the assisting returning officer will open the ballot-boxes in the presence of the scrutineers and count the ballot papers without opening them. The boxes will then be forwarded to the Returning Officer for the division, and the whole of the ballot-papers received by him from the various polling booths will be mixed before the count takes place. That will secure an absolutely secret ballot, and will enable a man to vote according to his conscience, instead of at the dictation of his employer. I am acquainted with every dodge in connexion with electioneering matters, and if I had been able to exercise the same power as the Premier of Queensland, I should have brought about an ' alteration in the results of the last State election. Since the- people of Queensland have had an opportunity to make their power felt at the Federal ballot-box, the Premier of Queensland has been absolutely checkmated, and he has been squealing ever since we have been here. If the electoral arrangements for Queensland are fully carried out, the votes given -will truly reflect the opinions of the electors, -and every one will be satisfied. </para>

                        <para>- I do not consider that £450 is an extravagant salary, but I have ji/Il along protested against the appointment of the gentleman who now occupies the position of Chief Electoral Officer. I have nothing against him personally. I have every reason to believe that he is a very estimable gentleman, but I do not think that he is fit to occupy his present position. He has, however, had charge of the Electoral Department up to the present time, and as we are now within a few months of a general election, it would not, perhaps, be wise to "swap horses when crossing a stream." Therefore, I do not propose that a change should be made at present. I should like to know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lewis</inline> has been permanently appointed as Chief Electoral Officer ? When the last Estimates were before us, we were given to understand that no permanent appointment would be made until honorable members had an opportunity to consider the matter. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, after a fashion. I am not under rating the importance of the work, which constituted a big task for any man, however well qualified, energetic, and resourceful. I wish to ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether any provision has been made for the appointment of State electoral officers, other than in the case of Tasmania. Apparently provision has been made upon the Estimates for the payment of any such officers. Unfortunately, the Electoral Act of the Commonwealth differs from those of the States, except, perhaps, in the case of South Australia. The returning officers are to be practically permanent officials of the Government. In New South Wales, and . in most of the other States, the returning officers are appointed merely for the purposes of an election, and all the work connected with the registration of voters, and keeping the rolls clear is done by public servants, who act as electoral officers and registrars, and also in many cases perform other public duties. Under the Commonwealth Electoral Act the returning officers must be public servants, because they will have to perform work in connexion with the purging of the rolls, which will keep them occupied ' all the year round. I am not speaking of the State electoral officers, but of the returning officers, who are responsible for the state of the rolls, and who alone are authorized to issue certificates for voting by post. Therefore, an immense amount of work is placed upon the shoulders of the returning officers in each of the divisions, and apparently no amount is set down for their payment. I do not know, whether the Minister expects men to do this work for nothing. It will be impossible to secure efficiency for nothing, and it will be difficult, if not impossible, to get Commonwealth officers to perform the duties of which I have been speaking, in addition to those with which they are now occupied. </para>

The Estimates should clearly show the cost of the Chief Electoral Officer's staff and also the amount proposed to be set aside in each State for the payment of the returning officers. The additional amount required to defray the cost of an election in any year could then be stated separately. But the average expenditure should be stated, and provision made for it upon the Estimates. </para>

                        <para>- In New South Wales the Government utilize the services of the police in the collection of the rolls, and the same practice is followed in some of the other States. I desire to point out to the Minister that if this work is not expedited there is a very serious danger that all the rolls will not be ready in time to permit of the holding of the elections for the return of members to this House simultaneously with the elections for the Senate. </para>

At the present time neither the head of the Government nor the Minister himself can supply us with accurate information as to the number of voters upon the lists in the electorates of New South Wales. Only the other day certain figures were quoted by the leader of the Opposition, the accuracy of which was disputed by the Prime Minister. Where are the figures which will show that one or other of their statements is incorrect? Have the differences been reconciled ? </para>

I can speak only from what I have seen reported. I am, however, quite willing ' to accept the statement of the Treasurer. But I would point out that the honorable member for Macquarie submitted certain figures relating to the Federal lists which were obtained from the State Electoral Office, and which differed materially from other figures that were supplied by the Commonwealth Electoral Office. It is about time that we knew how many people are entitled to vote under the Federal franchise in each State. </para>

                        <para>- We shall not secure it until after the lists have been finally revised. But we had a right to obtain, approximate information long ago. Here we are with no definite figures as to. the number of voters upon the lists. Those lists require to be exhibited for thirty days so that objection may be taken to them and applications made to have fresh names added. Then Revision Courts must beheld, and subsequently the rolls have to be printed - not as they used to be <inline font-style="italic">in globo</inline> - but with, the names of the voters for each of the polling places separate. I am very much afraid, that if this work is not hurried, we shall find ourselves in some of the States in the middle of an election with the machinery that is necessary for its conduct absolutely inefficient. </para>

                        <para>- We were given a similar assurance in regard to the electoral divisions, and we see where we have arrived: in that connexion. As the honorable member for Maranoa seems to have suffered terribly by reason of the manner in which the electoral rolls are prepared in Queensland, I am naturally astonished that he did not vote differently upon the proposals relating to the electoral divisions. I suppose, however, that he regarded the discrepancies which exist between the number of electors in the various divisions as a matter of such small importance compared with what he has been accustomed to, that he thought we ought to be able to -endure them, or else he was showing us - -as he said he could - how, when he happened to be amongst the majority, he could, work the oracle. I regret that his own suffering has not created in him greater sympathy for the sufferings of others. We have made one bungle, and I trust we shall not make another, and find ourselves face to face with insuperable difficulties when the general elections come round. </para>

                    <para>- When the Estimates were before us last year, the present Minister for Trade and Customs told us he was sure that the expenditure, under the subdivision relating to salaries in the Public Service Commissioner's Department, would not amount to more than £3,500 or £3,600 a year. The present Estimates, however, show a total expenditure of £3,882, as compared with the appropriation of £3,594 made last year. If these expenses are to go on increasing year after year, the Department will prove to be one of the most expensive in the Commonwealth. We find some very heavy items. We have for example - </para>

Although the present Minister for Trade and Customs told us last year that we should not require to expend a very large sum in connexion with this Department, I' felt satisfied that the expense would go on increasing, and the impression which I then formed has been fully justified. The cost of every Department originated by that honorable gentleman has gone on increasing, not by hundreds, but by thousands of pounds. </para>

I agree with the honorable member for Maranoa that there should be no excessive expenditure ; but the area to be covered by the Public Service Commissioner is so great - every one of the Federal Departments in all the States has to be controlled by his officers - that we cannot say that even the amount it is now proposed to vote will cover the cost. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member for Maranoa could not hare carefully examined these items before entering upon his criticism of the Department. He has had much to say as to the increase in salaries from £3,594 to £3,882, but if he examines the items he will see' that that increase is to be accounted for in the first place by the appointment of three* junior clerks at a salary of £40 per annum, which is not by any means a magnificent remuneration, and also by the provision of £65- to meet increments and adjustments of salaries which did not operate last year. These increases have been due to the action of honorable members. The Public Service Commissioner has 15,000 public servants under his control, and naturally great expense is: incurred in regrading the service. As against the item " Expenses of holding examinations, including advertising, £1,000,"' we must not overlook the fees paid by candidates. When it is remembered that the Public Service Inspectors have to travel all over the Commonwealth, and that the Department controls 15,000 public servants scattered throughout the length and breadth of Australia, it will be recognised that th&amp; attack made by the honorable member for Maranoa is not justifiable. As against the expenditure of this Department we have the introduction of a system by which the service is entirely removed from political influence, and that is an advantage to the public. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> was Secretary for Mines and Agriculture in New South Wales, and was always noted for his economical management and all-round efficiency.

                    <para>- I do riot propose to discuss any item in the list of salaries, but I think this is the proper time to call attention to the dissatisfaction which certain regulations, framed by the Commissioner, have caused throughout the service I admit that the Commissioner had an arduous task to perform in harmonizing the regulations of the six States, but I scarcely think that he has kept within the law in framing all the rules. I may be wrong - even the youngest of us are fallible - but it seems to me that some of them do not come within the provisions of the Public Service Act. Honorable members will find at page 9 of the Public Service Regulations one scale entitled "general' allowances,"' while, on the same page, regulation 155 provides for "allowances to certain officers." -I- was curious to ascertain what provision in the Public Service Act justified the Commissioner in establishing two scales of allowances. We are referred in the regulations themselves to section 78 and paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of section 80. Section 78 bears in a very remote way upon the matter. It merely declares that salaries shall not exceed the amount appropriated by Parliament, and so forth ; but the provision on which the Commissioner apparently relies is to be found in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of section 80. The section provides that- </para>

                <para class="block">Not the scales or amounts, but the " scale or amount " to be paid to officers for transfer or travelling allowances or expenses, or for living in localities where the climatic conditions are severe ; and so on. In these regulations we have not one scale as provided for in the Act, but two different scales. We have one scale for officers with certain salaries. They are paid so much as daily allowances, and so much after one week's residence in each place. That scale is about 50 per cent. higher than the scale for officers of the Post and Telegraph Department. All the officers of the service are graded, and the allowances are based upon salaries. In actual effect it comes to this - that an. officer in the Customs Department, the Treasury, or the Attorney-General's Department who is receiving over £300 per annum would receive an allowance of 10s. a day after he had been one week in a place and so long as he remained in that place ; whilst an officer in the Post and Telegraph Department, whose annual salary was the same, would only receive 30s. a week. That is to say, an officer of the favoured Department would receive £3 10s. a week, whilst officers of the Post and Telegraph Department receiving the same salaries and occupying the same grade in the service would receive only 30s. a week. I think that the Minister might fairly look into this matter. </para>

                    (Canobolas).- With respect to what has been said concerning the high qualifications of the Public Service Commissioner, I desire to remark that that officer did good and honorable service in New South Wales. He has had to undertake a gigantic task in connexion with the Commonwealth Public Service, and it is very much to his credit that he has carried it through with the success that has attached to his labours. In passing the Public Service Act we had to deal with States where varying customs and legislation prevailed. ' Our knowledge was not sufficient to enable us to do full justice to the subject at that time, and the Commissioner is considerably hampered by the legislation which we passed. Probably the Minister may see the need of introducing some amending legislation, so as to do away with many of the difficulties that have been encountered. There is one matter as to which I should like to have some information from the Minister. Every now and again a notice appeal's in the Federal
                    <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline>
                    which reads very like a "lost, stolen, or strayed " advertisement, intimating to some officer in a remote place that a Commission has been appointed to investigate charges against him. He is called upon to present himself before the Commission at a certain time on a certain day. The notice is so worded as to give the impression to the reader that action of this kind has to be taken because officers have disappeared. It seems to me to be ridiculous to send such a Commission composed of three officers to investigate a case when it appears that the officer affected will not present himself.

                    <para>- This Works Department is one that requires looking to. There is no limit to its growth, which is coincident with the expenditure on Public Works Offices in the various States. The consent of Parliament was obtained to a certain amount of expenditure for a Commonwealth Public Works Staff, but I do not think that we are prepared to see this expenditure grow year by year until it amounts up to very large figures. I notice that the estimate for this year is about £400 more than last year. </para>

                    <para>- The principle reason for desiring the appointment of an engineer officer connected with the military Department to take charge of the Public Works Department, is one of economy. We think we shall save a considerable sum by the adoption of that course. This officer will continue to act as Consulting Military Engineer, and the arrangement will be found to be an economical one if 'we are able to carry it out. Many of the public works which the Commonwealth has to undertake are connected with the forts, and if we can get one officer to look after that work and generally control all other public works constructed by the Commonwealth at the same time, we shall be doing well. As public works have to be earned out over the whole Commonwealth we require some one to take the matter in hand at headquarters. We especially require some one to take charge of the business connected with the transfer of properties from the States to the Commonwealth. This involves a large amount of money, running into millions, with which the Commonwealth will be debited by the States. The accounts are now coming in from the States, and though we have only received one or two up to the present time, the matter is one which will require a great deal of care and attention, and we must have some one specially to take charge of it. It is not reasonable to believe that the work can be taken in hand by the clerical staff of the Department of Home Affairs. We must have a professional man accustomed to public works and valuation to specially supervise the whole of the arrangements in connexion with these transferred properties. </para>

There is no certainty that the arrangement proposed will be brought about, but I hope that it will, and, in any case, we must have a reliable and competent man in the Home Affairs Department to supervise the whole of the public works of the Commonwealth. The States officers are doing most of the work now, and we have very few of our own officers. </para>

Provision is made for two others at £300 a year each, but the positions have not been filled. I think that the present arrangement with the States Governments for paying for the work of supervision might be improved somewhat. We are at present paying 6 per cent. on the value of the works constructed. That is very well so far as it goes, but under the existing arrangement with the States I do not think we shall ever get an entirely satisfactory service until we have some officer in each State who will be in a way connected with us, . who will have our interests at heart in the supervision of works, and who will be paid a small honorarium by the Commonwealth. The system has been found to work well in connexion with the Treasury Department, and I see no reason why it should not work as well with regard to the Department of Public Works. I am in correspondence at the present time with some of the States, with a view to getting the Under-Secretaries of Public Works, or some such officers, to act as officers of the Commonwealth, in the same way as Under-Treasurers act at the present time in dealing with the Treasury matters. The desire of the Government is to cut down expenditure as far as possible, and to utilize the service of States officers where they can. </para>

I presume that a part of this vote is paid to the Public Works officers in the States.

It must not be forgotten that our public works are being constructed out of revenue, and not out of loan money, and they have been for that reason somewhat limited. I am, therefore, unable to understand how the work which has had to be done justifies the increased expenditure in the payment of Commonwealth and States officers. </para>

We are paying for certain work done, in one case to our own officers, and, in . the other, to the States for their officers, whilst the amount in each case is increasing, and our expenditure upon public works has not been very extensive. I agree that this item may include the services of officers other than Public Works officers, and I should like to know whether it includes the absolutely useless expenditure upon the subdivision of the States into electorates, which we have rejected. </para>

We appropriated £365,000, and we spent altogether, including post-offices - which, however, do not come in here now - £150,000. On public works we spent only between £40,000 and £50,000. </para>

                        <para>- That maybe so, but there has been one officer appointed in New South Wales, and it is proposed to appoint others elsewhere.. The reason given for these appointments is that the States officers cannot properly attend to the work, and that the appointments will reduce the payments which have now to be made to the States. At the same time, however, the pay men b to the States, as it appears on the Estimates, is largely increased. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member for North Sydney has asked a very fair question. Last year we expended £2,919, being £2,639 on transferred services and £280 for "other " services. This year it is proposed to increase the vote for transferred services to £8,000, an increase of £5,400, while there is an increase of £720 in respect of "other" services, and at the same time it is proposed to increase the expenditure on the Public Works staff of the Commonwealth by £1,000. In the face of these formidable figures, some explanation is necessary. The Minister for Home Affairs shelters himself behind the fact that last year, of the amount appropriated, only a certain amount was expended ; but we are told that this was because the officers had not drawn out the contracts. We cannot hope that works will be postponed from year to year, but rather that they will be completed within the year for which the money is provided. </para>

But we cannot superintend works all over Australia, and it is a much more economical nnd better arrangement to utilize the services of the States officers. The Public Works Departments of the States, are familiar with all the buildings, and know what is required, and it is much better to leave the work to them for the present. I hope I 'have given all the information! that is required. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think it matters very much what amount we pay by way of commission to the States, though it will be of importance after the book-keeping period. The Commonwealth will then have to pay it as " other " expenditure - it will then be all " other " expenditure - and debit it <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> amongst the States. The transferred expenditure is debited to the State in which it is spent - we pay the money to the State, and the State itself is charged with it. " Other " expenditure is charged <inline font-style="italic">percapita,</inline> and the proportion of that will be debited to the State in which the expenditure takes place - not in proportion to the total expenditure, but <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> I understand that at present each State is debited with the capital expended in it, So&gt; that if a post-office is erected, the amount is debited to the State, and the percentage charged by the State for carrying out the work is added to the capital amount. When the properties have to be paid for, they will be treated in the same way as the old buildings; in other words, the States will get credit for the capital expended, and also the amount paid as percentage. The States have to pay the money now, and hereafter they will be credited with it. It does not matter what amount we pay now, inasmuch as the States have to pay and hereafter will be credited with the amount when we are paying for the properties transferred. </para>

                    (North Sydney).- I quite agree that it does not matter to our finances what we pay to the States at the present moment, because what is paid is debited to the States. At the same time, my objection is that the amount we are paying for the services of the States officers is increasing, while the expenditure on our own Department is also increasing. The Minister stated that last year £68,548 was expended on repairs and maintenance, and £44,329 on additions and buildings, making a total of £112,000.

                        <para>- I will take the expenditure at that figure. That would represent £5,280 paid to the States for the services of their officers, whereas the amount set down here as being paid is practically only £3,000. Therefore the Minister's explanation does not explain the matter at all. Commission at the rate of 6 per cent. upon the amount estimated to be expended next year - £217,000- would amount to about £13,000. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I have never been able to enthuse on the question where the Governor- General should live, or where the capital should be. Although I gave a reluctant assent to the proposals finally agreed to last year, I do not think that the expenditure upon these establishments should be allowed to grow,' even by a few hundred pounds per annum. I cannot understand why the expenditure last year was so much below the appropriation. </para>

                    (Canobolas). - I do not quite understand the item relating to -the cost of introducing the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Last year £35,000 was voted, and only £1,840 was expended. This year £30,000 is asked for, and this amount will include the expenses in connexion with the introduction of the Commonwealth Act, including the preparation and printing of electoral rolls and electoral registration. Then the cost of the elections is estimated at £45,000.

                        <para>- We have been told that ever since the Electoral Act was passed. Seeing that one of these officers has to be. appointed in connexion with every polling booth throughout the Commonwealth, it seems to me that the Department would be wise if it expedited its work in this direction. Otherwise the necessary machinery will not be ready in time for the conduct of. the approaching elections. So far, the compilation of the rolls has been left in the hands of the local police, and I presume that those officers will be permanently charged with that duty. In New South' Wales, however, the work of compiling and purging the rolls has been intrusted to deputy electoral registrars, who are appointed for that purpose in every division. I should like to know the intentions of the Government in regard to this important matter. </para>

If we can work in harmony with the different States, probably,, we may effect a considerable saving, and, at the same time, secure a more reliable statistical production. This is a matter to which the Minister might devote special attention as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>- The statement of the finances will be completed by the end of the present month. As honorable members know it is impossible for the various States to complete their financial statements for about three months after the expiration of the financial year, and as we have to obtain all our information, check our items, and make them agree throughout the Commonwealth, a considerable time is necessarily involved in reconciling differences. I am informed by the accountant in my Department that the work so far as 'the Treasury is concerned will be complete by the end of this month. The Auditor-General continues to check our accounts as we proceed, and, consequently, I hope that within three or four weeks his report will be ready for circulation. </para>
