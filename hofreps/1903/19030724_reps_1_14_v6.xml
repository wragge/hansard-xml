                        <para>- I wish to know from the Minister representing the Postmaster-General if the paragraphs which have recently appeared in the press, stating that no steps will be taken daring this financial year for the reconstruction of the telephone systems of Sydney and Melbourne, have the authority of the Government? If those statements are correct, I would ask the honorable gentleman what steps are being taken to put the telephone exchanges of the two capital cities of Australia into efficient working order? If there is no intention to improve the service, will the Government consider the advisability of reducing the exceedingly high rates now charged for a very inefficient service ? </para>

                        <para>- The inquiry which the honorable member has made has been anticipated by me, and when the Estimates are under consideration I shall have something to say on the subject. It is, however, impossible to provide metallic circuits - and it is, I presume, of the absence of metallic circuits that the honorable member complains - out of revenue ; that work oould be undertaken only out of loan. funds. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable members will see that in the motion of which I gave notice I used the words "authorizes and ratifies." Those words were adopted under the following circumstances : The signature of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Warren,</inline> the general manager of the company in Australasia, was put to the agreement when the terms had been settled between him and myself and approved of by his board in London, to mark the fact that those terms had been approved of. At the time there was, and there is still, some doubt as to whether his power of attorney covered the authority to sign an agreement of this nature, and therefore we decided to have another agreement executed by the" board in London, signing this agreement in the ' meantime in order that the terms might be fixed, so that there should be no departure from them. Since then we have received an agreement signed by the London board, to which the seal of the corporation is affixed. I used the word " ratifies " in order to cover the signing of the agreement, and the word " authorizes " to meet the event of the motion being proceeded with before we received the second agreement from London. Now that the second and final agreement has been received from London, I have omitted the word " authorizes," and I therefore wish the motion to read as I have moved it. In moving this motion this morning I desire to explain that I do so only to put honorable members, so far as I can, in possession of the facts and circumstances relating to the agreement which it ratifies. I have no wish to force the House to vote upon it to-day, though I should be glad if any honorable member who is ready to speak will favour us with his opinions upon it. There are, however, honorable members who are absent whose claims to speak upon a question such as this I cannot ignore, while other honorable gentlemen will require further time for consideration. Therefore, I shall content myself with putting before the House as clear a statement of the position as I can make, and then, if no other honorable member is ready to continue the debate, will consent to its adjournment until another day. It will be within the recollection of the House that, prior to the Postal and Telegraph Departments of the States being transferred to the control of the Commonwealth, there were in existence four agreements between as many of the States and the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. Those agreements were in respect to the cable which the company had constructed to connect Australia with South Africa, and to thus provide a new and more direct means of communication with England and other parts of the world. The New South Wales agreement was signed only a few months before the Postal and Telegraph Departments were transferred to the Commonwealth, but its terms were the same as those of the other agreements. I refer more particularly to it, however, because there has been considerable controversy as to whether it was a just and proper agreement for a State which was a partner in the Pacific cable to make. The agreement which this Government has made on behalf of the Commonwealth has been attacked upon grounds which seem to me to apply only to the action of the New South Wales Government, and to have no application to our action in basing a new agreement upon the condition of things which we found in existence when we took control. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; and inasmuch as it is a controversy which is being carried 05 from the other end of the world, and particularly from Canada, I think it is but just to those who have made attacks upon our action to say that- they are probably confounding the rights and wrongs of the matter as they apply to the action of New South Wales with the rights and wrongs of the matter as they apply to our action. The agreements to which I have alluded were in existence when the Commonwealth took over the Postal and Telegraph Departments of the States, and their terms amounted to these : The States concerned received reduced cable rates on a sliding scale in return for granting to the company the right to establish offices of their own in the respective capitals of those States, and to have direct communication with the public, instead of receiving and delivering telegrams only through the Government offices. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I call the attention of honorable ' members to the fact that the agreement was practically perpetual, and could be rescinded only with the consent of both parties, so that, if the company had chosen to stand out, the States were bound to the existing state of things until the crack of doom. How those responsible came to enter into such an agreement is not for me to say, nor shall I criticise their action, but inasmuch as the obligations of the Postal and Telegraph Departments of the States devolved upon the Commonwealth upon the transfer of those Departments to its control on the 1st March, 1901, the agreements had then to be accepted by this Government, with the onerous burden in perpetuity in respect to the matters to which they related. But if we look at the development of cable communication, and the advance of electrical science in respect to means of communication other than by cable, the unsuitability of a perpetual agreement of this kind is all the more apparent. Within the first 3'ear after the taking over of the Postal and Telegraph Departments by the Commonwealth, it came to be considered whether it would not be desirable to substitute for the four agreements one agreement applying to the whole Commonwealth, and to get rid of the onus of a perpetual obligation. </para>

                            <para>- The New South Wales Government signed the agreement shortly before the transfer of the Postal and Telegraph Departments of the States to the Commonwealth. That Government held out for some time, but at last it seemed to be convinced that it was a wise and proper thing to follow the example of the three States which had already signed the agreement, an action which, as I have said, I do not feel justified in criticising. We are not concerned as to whether New South Wales acted properly or with wise policy in entering into the agreement with the Eastern Extension Company. Our position is that we found an agreement in existence with New South Wales, as' well as with three other States, and even though that agreement might prove onerous to the Commonwealth there was no means of escaping it. We also had to become responsible for the Australian obligations in respect to the Pacific cable. Therefore" the Commonwealth, whilst having the advantages of both agreements in a certain degree, found itself between two fires with respect to the advocates of both of them. </para>

                            <para>- So far from prejudicing the Pacific cable, the limitations imposed by the agreement will prove distinctly advantageous to it. One of the strongest advantages claimed for the Pacific cable is that it establishes an "- all red " line. One of the advantages claimed for the Cape cable also, which belongs to the Eastern Extension Company, is that it establishes an all British line, <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> the Cape of Good Hope. That advantage, whatever it was, or whatever flowed from it, also accrued to the Commonwealth upon the 1st March, 1901, together with a reduction of the prices for messages upon a sliding scale ; so that telegrams which were at one time charged for at the rate of 9s. 4d. can now be sent for 3s. per word. I am now speaking of the ordinary rates, upon which the Government and press rates depend. In addition to this we had the prospect, in the event of a large increase of traffic, of a further reduction of rates to 2s. 6d. per word.' Now that the two cables are in competition, however, I take it that we may be rather more tardy in reaching that point than would otherwise have been the case. Within three months after the Commonwealth came into existence it found itself, according to the varying views which may be entertained by honorable members, saddled with, or benefited by, both these agreements. In respect of one of the agreements, we were impressed with the onus of it as regards four States, whereas, in respect to the Pacific cable, we were impressed with the onus of it as regards three States only. We were further embarrassed by the fact that one State was a participant in both agreements. This was, of course, a difficult position, and inasmuch as an opportunity was offered to make an agreement applying to the whole Commonwealth in substitution for the old one - without making such alterations in respect to the four already existing participants as to change its character as a transferred service - we took advantage of it. Being impressed with the necessity of making a fresh agreement with the Eastern Extension Company, the reasons for which I have now made clear to honorable members, we set about negotiations. A though the advantage to be secured by the new agreement to the State most concerned - Victoria - was a considerable reduction of rates, our main object was to secure the abolition of the perpetuity clause, in return for the extension of the agreement to the whole of the Commonwealth. Victoria had declined to become a party to the agreement with the Eastern Extension Company. Although they entered into negotiations, and at one time went within an ace of joining the other States in their arrangement with the company, nevertheless, the Government of Victoria, with, my honorable colleague the Treasurer at their head, finally declined to enter into the agreement. Therefore, Victoria and Queensland stood out as regards the Eastern Extension Company. Queensland ma}-, for the purposes of this agreement be largely left out- of consideration, not out of any 'disrespect to her, but because the bulk of her business will be done with the Pacific Cable Company, and therefore neither the burden nor the benefit of the contract with the Eastern Extension Company will be material to her. The inequality which the state of things I have mentioned set up pressed very heavily upon the Victorian mercantile community. It is true that bef6re the institution of the Eastern Extension Company's agreement the ordinary rates had been reduced from 9s. 4d. per word to something over 4s. per word - if I remember aright, the rate was 4s. 7d. per word. But Victoria was excluded from the benefit of the agreement, which brought the rate down to 3s. per word, and in that, respect her mercantile community thought they were hardly treated. Several petitions were . signed, and over 500 Melbourne merchants urged us td place Victoria on the same footing as the other States. I have adverted to one at least of the objectionable features of the agreement concluded between the Eastern Extension Company, and four of the States, namely, New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania. I refer to the perpetuity clause. If no other reason had existed for making an agreement with the company applying to the whole of the Commonwealth, there was the cogent reason that we could not be left in the position of establishing, as to four of the States, a perpetual bond. </para>

                            <para>- No, except so far as I shall mention. The agreement now proposed is very much the same as that now in force, except that it does away with, the perpetuity clause, and provides for a reduction of rates. The old' agreement gives the Eastern Extension Company certain privileges as to the use of special wires, and, so far. as it may be continuous, but in no other sense, the privilege to use the wires is perpetual.. Now the use of the special wires is limited by the term of the new agreement - which, as I shall show, is for ten years, with two years' notice after the expiration of the ten years. </para>

                            <para>- I am not prepared to say ; they may have been in some cases ; but, in entering into an agreement of this extended nature, applying to the whole of the Commonwealth, I conceived it to be my duty to make it the subject of approval by Parliament, either by introducing a Bill or submitting a motion. - I am now placing the matter before honorable members in the latter form, and the agreement cannot come into force until it is ratified by both Houses. At the outset the company were, of course, rather loth to give up the benefit of the clause by which it could hold its right in perpetuity, and, at first, the utmost that could be obtained after long negotiation, was an expression of willingness on the part of the company to limit the term of the agreement to 50 years - a term which I believe applies to some other of ' the company's agreements. As time went on, and the Government were firm in the matter, we were asked to consent to a term of twenty years, which would be conterminous with the company's landing rights at Cocos Island, which is in the track of the' Cape cable, and it was pointed out to us that that was an extraordinarily short term ' for a cable agreement. However, we took the view that if we extended the operation of the agreement to the whole of the Commonwealth we should be entitled to ah even shorter term, and I stood firm, and stipulated that, at the outside, the agreement should not be entered into for a longer term than would be roughly conterminous with the operation of the Braddon clause - with two years' notice of determination. Eventually that was agreed to. I call particular attention to the importance of the fact because of two things. In the first place, the term fixed in the agreement is the shortest to which the company has ever been willing, or has ever been brought to consent in respect to any of their agreements, and the next point is that the fact that the agreement is, as such agreements go, of such short duration is of more importance to us, because it was not made before the cable was constructed, but after the company had incurred all the expense of constructing the cable, and at a time when they might have hoped to obtain an agreement binding the States to the use of the cable on terms which would give them more extended security. I do not take any particular credit to myself, but the Government were firm enough to ultimately secure an agreement for a term of ten years, with two years' notice at any time after the ten years. The agreement which has been laid on the table provides for the modification of the original agreements, and all these are before honorable members It was stipulated that all existing agreements between the company and the several States should be recited and combined in one agreement, and that provision has been so fully complied with that honorable members will find in the recital of the new agreement* everything that is material to the case, and, therefore, everything that is affected by the determination arrived at. A further concession which was obtained was the reduction of the rate for Government telegrams from 2s. to ls. 7£d. per word. The agreement also binds the company to observe the international telegraph regulations as if they had been a party to the International Telegraph Convention. As honorable members who are acquainted with commercial matters will doubtless recognise, that was a very important matter, because doubts have arisen whether the Eastern Extension Company was a party to that Convention. It has often been asserted that it was a party to it, but we thought it desirable to put the matter beyond doubt as far as this agreement was concerned by binding the company to it as if it were actually a member of the Convention. Further, a provision was made that the company could not - and this is an entirely new provision in cable agreements, and makes some approach to compliance with a resolution regarding State ownership of cables moved by me and passed at the Imperial Conference - that the company cannot dispose of any of their cables as here affected without giving to the Government of the Commonwealth, or to that of the United Kingdom the option of purchasing the cables at a price to be fixed by arbitration. </para>

                    <para class="block">We found that notwithstanding all efforts we could not obtain the insertion of a clause empowering the Governments concerned to resume the cable, or any cables in connexion with it . which were material to its working. The best substitute which could be secured and I think it is valuable as a first step - was the provision contained in this agreement, under which the company cannot dispose of the cable itself, or any cables which are material to its working, without first giving an option of purchase to the Government of the United Kingdom, or the Government of the Commonwealth, and setting out that the price in such a contingency shall be settled by arbitration. </para>

                            <para>- Finally there is a reduction in the term of the agreement to ten years, with two years' notice of determination. As I have said, the company had secured landing rights for the cable for Cocos Island for a period of twenty years only. When the negotiations took definite shape another important development occurred. In July of last year, the company, at the request of the Commonwealth Government, tentatively reduced their rates for "Victoria and Queensland, conditionally upon this agreement being finally ratified, to bring them into line with those of the contracting States. From July of last year, therefore, Victoria and Queensland have, at our instance, enjoyed lower rates. Of course, that concession is not of very much consequence to Queensland, because of her closer connexion with the Pacific cable. Upon the agreement being signed, the company adopted another suggestion of mine, which was that they should make a substantial reduction in the charges to India, China, and the Far East generally, making the rate uniform at 2s. 6d. per word to India and China cable ports as from 1st June, 1903. Of course, that concession depends upon ' the ratification of this agreement, but it was a business-like and fairly generous action on the part of the company at my request. Their position of having a perpetual agreement with the majority of the States was so strong that practically it could have been maintained in Victoria by energetic canvassing. This is made very clear by the traffic returns from Victoria for the four months after competition with the Pacific Cable commenced, and prior to the opening of the company's public offices in Melbourne. Prior to that period, the company had a communication office in Sydney with the right of distribution and canvassing to any extent they chose, whilst they were without these rights in respect of Melbourne, nevertheless they did more business in Melbourne than in Sydney. That is to say, a larger number of traffic words were communicated in respect of Melbourne than in respect of Sydney. </para>

I , think it is generally conceded by the authorities controlling both cables that the rates could not be cut down at present without a loss which even the rich company would not be prepared to incur. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Contingent upon the passing of this resolution, I gave them the right to open: an office in Melbourne, on condition that they made the same reduction in respect of 'Victorian messages that they had made in regard to messages for the other States. There is another point to which I desire to refer, because it has been the subject of rumours in various quarters. The company e japhatioally deny the accusations freely levelled against them that they have been guilty of any unfair or unscrupulous dealings. In this connexion, they cite their action in regard to the matter of registered address indicators as a case in point. I should like to read part of a memorandum which I made concerning this matter. It is as follows : - </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>The Government charge an annual fee for registering code address indicators, while the company do not. Consequently, few firms would incur the fee by registering with the Government when it was open to them to avoid it. Traffic would therefore have passed into the hands of the company unless the Government abandoned the charge, and thereby lost a revenue of some thousands of pounds. The company, however, readily agreed to forego this advantage, and not to accept any registrations unless they were first accepted by the Government. </para>
                    <para class="block">Now the company consider that, although they are very freely condemned in many quarters, they have, by reason of . their services - which, nevertheless, we must recollect, have all been paid for - established a close connexion, with the Commonwealth, and have some claim on account of that long association to reasonable treatment. The}' have for years transmitted weather telegrams for the Commonwealth free of charge. They also transmitted soldiers' and sailors' telegrams to South Africa and to China at a nominal rate. Generally speaking, I think that there is no reason to complain of the company on the score of illiberality . But, of course, there is this fact to be considered, that, like every other mono poly, they maintained the higher rates whilst they had an opportunity of doing so in the absence of competition, and it is a fact which must be placed to the credit account of the Pacific cable that, undoubtedly, it was the expected competition of that cable which largely led to a reduction of rates on the part of the Eastern Extension Company. Upon the other hand, when we consider the claims which are put forward by the Pacific Cable Board to prevent the binding force of an agreement such as we now propose to make with the Eastern Extension Company, it must be said that, from the very nature of the case, competition was to be expected as the result of the opening of that cable. The Eastern Extension Company was an existing fact, and was of course in constant touch with the systems of the rest of the world, their lines extending to Australia. Independently of the Cape cable, the company were for many years the holders of a line of cable, without which this country would not have been able to carry on telegraphic communication with the rest of the world ; and even before they started the Cape cable they were in control of that communication. Consequently, when we entered into the arrangement, anterior to federation, which resulted in the Pacific cable being laid, we did so with our eyes open, well knowing that the cable which we were about to institute must enter into competition with that of "the Eastern Extension Company. That consideration of course very largely qualifies the claims made in one direction or another to have such special advantages conferred as would result in one of the cables obtaining a monopoly. At this point I should like to remark that I am not in favour of a monopoly even for the Pacific cable, much less for the Eastern Extension Company. I am of opinion - and I think the majority of honorable members will agree with me - that competition carried to the extent that is healthful in respect of these cables is an advantage even if for many years no profit is realized on the Pacific cable. This competition is one which, provided that it be carried on in a proper spirit, will result in the continuous keeping down of all charges, and therefore is a convenience which applies to the business concerns of every citizen of the Commonwealth, irrespective of whether he uses the cable or not. Therefore I do not think there is much in any argument which would impel us to give such advantages to one of these competing, institutions as would practically drive the other from our shores, because our position as a community would not thereby be rendered any more secure. A very important matter, which does not form part of the agreement, but directly relates to it, is the establishment of a cable ship, and a cable repairing dep6t, in Adelaide, by the. company. The ship which has just arrived is one of the largest and best equipped of its class. It has been specially built for Australian work, and its importance in being at hand to maintain cable communication, not only in time of peace, but in time of war, cannot be over-estimated. The ship is the only cable-repairing vessel- in Australia. Whilst </para>
                    <para class="block">I am upon that subject, I would point out that, under the old agreement, the company were guaranteed freedom from Customs charges upon their cable and materials in any of the States which were parties to that agreement, and also were freed from such charges as harbor and light dues, wharfage, 4'C. As this is a new agreement, it has necessarily been based, in a large measure, upon the agreement which, previously existed, and has been modified only so far as was deemed to be necessary, either by the circumstances of the case, or-in order to free the Commonwealth from any undue burden. The Pacific Cable Company was charged Customs duty even upon the shore length of its cable by the Dominion of Canada, which has throughout taken up an antagonistic attitude in regard to this agreement. In respect of Customs duties the Pacific Cable Board will reap, at our hands, the same advantages as Are enjoyed by the Eastern Extension Company. We have determined - and to carry out the determination it will be necessary only to place a small sum on the Estimates - to recoup the Pacific Cable Board equally with the Eastern Extension Company, any Customs duty paid by them on their plant and material. That is a concession which is granted in most parts of the world, although, as I have stated, an exception has been made by Canada. I refer to this matter in order to show the House that there is not the slightest desire on the part of the Government - who, being the largest partner, would be the most disregardful of its own interests if it took up a different position - to unduly handicap the Pacific cable, or to place it at any disadvantage. My personal sympathies have always been with that project, and I hope, notwithstanding temporary and initial losses, that it will yet turn out to be a sound investment. </para>

                    <para class="block">Pacific cable. But as the arrangement in regard to the Eastern Extension Company is now terminable by t\*0 years' notice after the end of ten years, even the apprehensions of the Pacific Cable Board in that respect are limited by the operation of the agreement which I am asking the House to ratify. At the end of a period of say twelve years, we shall be open to enter into such new agreement as we may think fit with the Eastern Extension Company. I am sure that as now and before, if we do enter into any fresh agreement, we shall take care that it is upon terms such as will maintain every just privilege and right to which the Pacific Cable Board is entitled. And as we have made a concession as to Customs duties in favour of the Pacific Cable Board, independent of any agreement or binding obligation such as was imposed upon us by the distinct agreement with the Eastern Extension . Company, so I propose - and, I think, the House will concur in that proposal - that we shall also extend to the Board an advantage similar to that enjoyed by the Eastern Extension Company in respect of any harbor, lighterage, or wharfage dues which they might be called upon to pay. Thus, in this additional respect, the Pacific Cable Board will also be. placed on an equal footing with the other company. I think that I have now put before the House what I desired to say in explanation of this agreement, in order to supply honorable members' with materials upon which they may found an opinion when later on a vote is taken. ButT should like to quote a very pregnant and well-worded passage from a letter by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Cockburn, who, as we all know, was formerly Agent-General for South Australia, and is still in London. In the. course of a long letter, commenting upon the controversy which has arisen between the Commonwealth and Canada and New Zealand, two of the other signatories to the Pacific cable agreement he has vindicated the action which this Government has taken. He concluded with these words, which, if fairly and reasonably applied to the Pacific Cable Board, are, I think, of very great weight, and worthy of the consideration of honorable members - </para>

                    <para class="block">I think that those words apply exactly to the case which we have before us, and that there is no justification for any undue jealousy being exhibited by one of these bodies of the other. As both of them are capable of rendering us very signal service in our business relations, and, as we as a Government, have no intention- to prejudice the Pacific Cable Board to any greater extent than the existence of a competition of which they knew at the outset must prejudice them - intent as we are on not doing anything which would damage our own proprietary interests in the Pacific cable - I think we may well assent to this agreement as a fair one. It is one which alleviates the position as regards the Commonwealth, instituted by the practical perpetuity of the old agreement, which imports a new term with respect to the acquisition of the cables and their rights, and which in all respects is dictated by a regard for the public interests of the Commonwealth and a spirit of fairness to the Pacific Cable Board. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure the House has listened with pleasure to the clear statement which has just been made by the Prime Minister, and in which he has reviewed the whole historical aspect of this matter. I recognise, and I am sure that every honorable member will recognise, that the Commonwealth Government found themselves placed in a very difficult position by reason of the action taken by the Government of New South Wales, which, within a fortnight after the ratification of the Pacific cable agreement, entered into another one with the Eastern Extension Company. One would imagine that they did so with their eyes open to the fact that they must ' create a considerable difficulty. I agree with the Prime Minister that nothing is to be gained at the present time by reviewing the situation which was created perhaps by the astuteness of the very energetic Eastern Extension Company. That situation may have been brought about by a want of knowledge on the part of the Minister who was in charge of the arrangements at the time as to the difficulties which would follow. My opinion is that we may allow the incident to pass, although it is well known that it has been the subject of very adverse criticism, not only in </para>

                    <para class="block">England and Canada, but in Queensland and Victoria. It seemed at the time as if the Government were prepared to sell an important position in consideration of a temporary advantage. I am very glad, however, that the Prime Minister found himself at an early date in a position to safeguard Victoria, who, to its credit be it said, held from the first that it must keep faith with the Pacific Cable Board. In the course of his remarks, the Prime Minister has removed much of the concern which I felt in regard to this matter. The fear shared by other parties to the Pacific cable agreement, and entertained not only in England and Canada, but in Australia, was that the Eastern Extension Company would receive advantages over and above those obtainable by the .Pacific Cable Board. The Prime Minister has pointed out, however, that apart from the competition which the existence of the Eastern Extension Company necessarily involves, he intends, as far as he can, to place the Pacific Cable Board on equal terms with that company. If such a statement had not been made, I should have proposed an amendment. The Prime Minister has removed the serious blot which previously existed in that a large corporation like the Eastern Extension Company was to be given an agreement in perpetuity. He has cut down that provision by gradations, so that the agreement may now be terminated at the end of ten years, and after two years' notice has been given. The amendment which I thought of asking the Prime Minister to accept was - </para>

                            <para>- That, in my opinion, exactly expresses the position. I deprecate a cut-throat policy, because, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, such a policy is fraught with uncertainty as to permanence. We want to know definitely how we stand, and to have uniform fixed rates, with ' the healthy business competition which should be created by the existence of two rival concerns. That well-equipped and most business-like corporation, the Eastern Extension Company, will lose no opportunity to gain business. They have already profited by the lack of business methods displayed by the Pacific Cable Board in London, and have gained a great advantage by being able to make arrangements in connexion with cable communication with a great many of the business firms of the Commonwealth. No one can blame the Eastern Extension Company for the advantages which they secure, but the Pacific Cable Board ought to be alive to what should be done in the interests of the concern which they control. The Prime Minister, in the course of his remarks, said that we must recognise the obligations under which the community rest for the enterprise of the Eastern Extension Company in the past. The results of that enterprise, however, have been very profitable to the company, as I will show by an extract from a speech* delivered in Canada in May last by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sandford</inline> Fleming, who has always taken a prominent part in connexion with the Pacific cable.

According to the last returns of telegraph business which has reached Canada, the total number of words transmitted between Australia and Europe in 1901 was 2,330,515,' and if this volume of traffic be reckoned at 6s. 4d. per word, we have it demonstrated that there is an actual gain to Australia of not less than £737,850 annually. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is, the amount by which the reduction of rates has benefited the Australian community, and, therefore, if the Eastern Extension Company are now working at a profit with a rate of 3s. per word, they must have been getting magnificent returns when the rate was 9s. 4d. per word. </para>

                            <para>- I dare say that that word would apply, but I would rather speak of the company's action as the extreme use of a business advantage. They took advantage of their position knowing that, unless the Governments interfered, it would be ' extremely improbable that any private combination would come into operation to compete against them, and it reduced its rates only when the laying of the Pacific cable came within the region of practical possibility.

The Pacific Cable Board should have their own offices and carry on their business upon commercial principles entirely apart from the red-tape system which prevails in the Telegraph Department </para>

                            <para>- If the Pacific Cable Board do not adopt business methods with the object of making the cable pay, or at least with a view to avoid loss, the Government should review the whole position in the interests of the community, who will probably have to bear an increasing burden year by year because of the unprofitable nature of the undertaking. The board say that they do not believe in appointing agents, but the Eastern Extension Company have their agents going the round of the business houses every day. Unless active methods are adopted, it is abundantly clear that the community will suffer. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Horace</inline> Tozer goes on to say - </para>

This gives exceptional facilities for uninterrupted communication in Australia, and affords opportunities for secret concessions to customers, one of which, the free registration of addresses, continued in force for at least three months, to the detriment of the Pacific cable. </para>

                    <para class="block">These are some of the advantages conferred upon the Eastern Extension Company, and I think it is only reasonable that the Pacific Cable Board should enjoy exactly the same benefits. When I was in London recently, I had occasion to send and receive cable messages almost every day. Some of these were forwarded by the Pacific cable, and others through the Eastern Extension Company, and I am gratified to be able to state that, with one exception, there was no material difference in the time occupied in the transmission of the messages by the two routes. Usually the difference did not exceed ten minutes. At one time there was some delay in the transmission of messages b}' the Pacific cable route, in consequence of a defect in that portion of the cable extending from the mainland to one of the Pacific Islands. That defect has now been made good, and I am sure that if ordinary business methods are employed there is no reason why the deficit upon the working of the cable should not be wiped out,' and why we should not be freed from all liability for loss in connexion with it. I would ask the Prime Minister to say explicitly whether, in the event of the new agreement being ratified, the Pacific Cable Board will be granted facilities equal to those enjoyed by the Eastern Extension Company ? </para>

                            <para>- There is no provision in the standing orders for allowing Ministers, any more than other members, to speak more than once during a debate. I am particularly anxious to facilitate business, because I take it that the standing orders are intended for that purpose, rather than to hamper us. The question time has passed, however, and a speech in reply can be .permitted only at the close of a debate. Therefore, I am precluded from doing anything of an extraordinary nature to enable the Minister to make a speech at this stage. I am quite prepared to overlook a short interjection, by the Prime Minister, as I have overlooked many others at different times, but I could not permit an open violation of the standing orders. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wonder that there has been a great deal of irritation over the proposed agreement, although I think that it will be to some extent removed when the full explanation of the Prime Minister is made known to those who are principally concerned. Some years ago very great interest was taken in the proposal to construct the Pacific cable, which was looked forward to as one of the most advantageous means of communication with the old country. It was pointed out that the Pacific cable would give us more speedy means of communication, and that it would, therefore, possess advantages for us even in times of peace, whilst in times of war it would give us an "all red" route. I was very much surprised at the very small amount of interest taken in the opening of the line. I happened to be in Queensland a few days after the cable was opened, and I could not help remarking how little ceremony was observed, and how little public interest was taken, in the event, not only here, but in the old world. The arrangement now proposed is one that will not only be of advantage to us by relieving us from a position of difficulty, but will, as has been explained by the Prime Minister, eventually turn out to be the very best, for the Pacific Cable Board. Canada and New Zealand have been complaining of what they consider a breach of faith on the part of the Commonwealth Government in entering into this arrangement. They contend that we have virtually broken the compact entered into ' with them in connexion with the Pacific cable, but, as I think I shall be able to show, it would have been very much better for those who now complain if they had interposed at the time when the arrangement regarding the Pacific cable was first broken by the Government of New South Wales. No one regrets more than I do that that compact was broken. New South Wales was, no doubt, free, technically, to make some such arrangement with the Eastern Extension Company for better terms in consideration of the perpetual arrangement, but, from the Empire point of view, it seems to me that we broke faith with our brethren in other dependencies and in the mother country. At that time it was quite open for the other parties concerned to object strongly to the proposed alteration. But these alterations having been made by certain States it became incumbent upon the Commonwealth Government to ascertain what was' the best course to pursue under the circumstances. The arrangement which the Government -ask the House to ratify' is. is an excellent business one for the Commonwealth. I am indeed surprised that the Prime Minister has been able to secure such advantageous terms with the Eastern Extension Company. I repeat that in the long run it will prove the very best thing possible in the interests of the Pacific cable itself. We are all aware that communication by means of electricity is still being developed, and that a perpetual arrangement, such as the one which the New South Wales Government made with the Eastern. Extension Company, might involve us in a very serious liability in years to come. Under the Marconi system of communication, such an agreement might represent so much waste effort, but we should be committed to its terms, and eventually might be forced to pay a large sum to free us from its operation, if we desired to obtain the advantages of the most up-to-date system of telegraphy.. When the Commonwealth . Government is accused by the Governments- of the Dominion of Canada and of New Zealand of a breach of faith in connexion with this agreement, it is a matter of astonishment that a similar charge has not been levelled against the Imperial authorities. I would point out that the Government of Great Britain approved, in the first instance, of the arrangement which was made by New South Wales. When that agreement was first suggested, a telegram was despatched to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, by the Government of New South Wales, in the following terms : - </para>

Our contract with company expires 3.1st inst. We desire accept their proposals if Imperial Government see no objection, having in view prospects of Pacific cable.

If receipts for years 1808, 1899, and 1900 average £350,000, the 4s. tariff would be reduced in 1901 to 3s. 6d. If they are maintained at £350,000 for the years 1899, 1.900, and 1901, the tariff would be reduced to 3s. in 1902. If average receipts maintained 1900, 1901, and 1902, tariff would be reduced in 1903 to half-a-crown per word. Receipts must average £350,000 for three consecutive years before the next reduction of 6d. per word is made." </para>

Subsequently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain's</inline> reply was considered by the Conference of Premiers, and most of his suggestions were embodied in the arrangement which was ultimately adopted with the Eastern Extension Company. If Canada and New Zealand have a right to blame anybody for what they conceive to be a breach of that arrangement it is certainly not the Commonwealth Government, but the Governments of New South Wales and Great Britain, who ratified it after consultation between them. But, as the Prime Minister declared, we have nothing to do with the back history of this question. It is a legacy which has been handed down to us by the States, and our duty is to do the best we. can under the circumstances. It is absurd to think that we could carry on the transferred service under two different agreements, some States being parties to one agreement, and some to the other, whilst some were parties to both. The Government, therefore, were bound to take the condition of affairs into consideration, and to do their best to enter into an agreement with one company or the other in order to remedy the mixed condition' of affairs. </para>

                        <para class="block">I think that the Prime Minister is to be complimented upon the shrewd and businesslike way in which he has protected the interests of the Commonwealth. The arrangement which he has concluded with the Eastern Extension Company excites my unqualified admiration. I do not see what he has given to the company as a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> for the concessions obtained from that company. It is worthy of remark - because we have recently heard so much about the weary Titan staggering under the too vast orb of his fate - that under the Pacific cable scheme Great Britain contributes only fiveeighteenths of the total cost, whereas the Commonwealth pays one-third, despite the fact that in the event of any grave emergency arising it is estimated that a message transmitted over that line to a fleet or a single cruiser might be worth three times the amount of Britain's contribution. The Government,'! repeat, are to be complimented upon the admirable business arrangement which they have concluded. The Commonwealth seems to have scored throughout the whole of the negotiations. </para>

We ought, if possible, to grant the same conditions to the Pacific Cable Board in regard to facilities for business as those which operate in the case of the Eastern Extension Company. If the Prime Minister can. accomplish that, he will have done something for which the Commonwealth will be extremely thankful. </para>

Personally, I am not in accord with those who join in a chorus of congratulation to the Prime Minister upon having arrived at this agreement. It seems to mc that there is one point in connexion with it which has been entirely overlooked. The Prime Minister considers that this agreement would undoubtedly benefit the Commonwealth generally. A question which should receive very serious consideration is whether or not there has been any breach of the agreement entered into with the other parties to the Pacific cable. . I find amongst the correspondence and papers relating to this subject, which have be6n laid on the table of the House, statements showing that the other parties to the agreement appear to think that if no actual breach has been committed there has been at least a breach in the spirit of the agreement. In a telegram to the Prime Minister of Australia, the Prime Minister of Canada states that the concession ' granted by the New South Wales Government to. the Eastern Extension Company is regarded by Canada as a - violation of spirit of agreement under which. Pacific intentions of cable core was constructed. </para>

                                <para>- That has nothing to do with tha 'matter. All the other parties to the Pacific cable agreement have objected to the proposal, and I think the question might be submitted to the arbitration of representatives of the parties concerned. Assuming that the proposal now submitted to us by the Prime Minister will be of benefit to the Empire generally, there is still a further point to be considered. We have to remember that although one of the four parties to this Pacific cable agreement may believe that it would be to the benefit of all concerned to alter the terms of that agreement, he is not entitled to set his opinion against that of the three remaining parties. The Prime Minister may think that this proposal is best for all concerned, but unless the remaining parties to the Pacific cable agreement are favorable to it, I . think that the spirit of the Pacific cable agreement will be broken by its adoption. Thus it is a matter of the very gravest importance, affecting as it does, the good faith of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>-It would appear from the message - and honorable members will probably have gathered also from other sources - that the Senate has not adhered to the position which it set up in sending us an amendment which, in our judgment, would, if carried, have meant an increased burden on the people, if not, in fact, an origination, <inline font-style="italic">pro</inline><inline font-style="italic">tanto,</inline> of new expenditure. I am happy to say that to that extent the constitutional difficulty which occurred has been settled. But a further question arises. The Senate having abandoned the amendment to which we had expressed our constitutional objection, has sent us a message requesting us to alter the Bill in the direction in which . they formerly desired to amend it. The Senate has acted in this way in the assertion of a power given to them by the Constitution. There may be some conflict of opinions upon this subject, and therefore I desire, before the Treasurer deals with the matter, to make a short statement to the House. AVe propose to make an amendment in the Bill - not that requested by the Senate, but an amendment adopting their words, with an addition which will restrict its application to cases where cane has not been planted by black labour since the 28th February, 1903. In other words, we are prepared to agree to the request of the Senate with a modification, and to turn it into an amendment of our own. Some doubt has been expressed as to the constitutional right of the Senate to make requests where it has the right to make amendments. Honorable members will recollect that we conceded the right of the Senate to make an amendment in an Appropriation Bill not being a Bill for the appropriation for the ordinary annual services of the year, provided that there was no infringement of the provisions of the third paragraph of the 53rd section of the Constitution ; that is to say, provided that the Senate did not affect to increase any proposed charge or burden upon the people. We determined that any amendment which reduced or left the anticipated appropriation as it stood would be within their rights, but we maintained that if they went beyond that, and made an amendment, which, if accepted, would increase the charges or burdens upon the people, they would be exceeding their constitutional powers. They seem to have accepted that position in a spirit of conciliation, and an opportunity has now occurred for us to act in the same way. As I ' have said, there was some doubt as to whether the Senate could make a suggestion by way of increase, particularly in regard to the provisions of a Bill which it had the right to amend. We have given close consideration to that question, and we have come to this conclusion : that where the Senate can amend, it ordinarily is not able to suggest ; but where its amendment cannot be by way of increase, it is intended by the Constitution that it should retain the power of suggestion, as in other cases, Where the Senate admittedly could not make an amendment to increase the burdens of the people, it can, as in other cases, make a suggestion which, if adopted by us and carried into effect, would increase the burdens upon the people. In that way we retain our sole right to make amendments of that nature. This suggestion having come down to us from the Senate, we conceive that we may now honorably end the constitutional difficulty by making, with a modification, the alteration which the Senate has requested, and placing it as our own amendment in the Bill. By doing so, we shall be meeting the views which have been expressed by some honorable members during the earlier stages of the consideration of the Bill, and the modification which we shall propose will prevent undue advantage being given to those who have planted their cane with black labour. That is a position which I think we may fairly and honorably assume. </para>

                    <para>- Honorable members will recollect that originally the proposal with regard to the rebate on sugar applied only to sugar produced from sugar-cane or beet-root in connexion with the production of which black labour was not used after the 28th February, 1902. Subsequently the Minister for Trade and Customs, exercising what he believed to be a legal power, promised the growers that the concession would be extended for a period of twelve months, and in this Bill it was provided that the bonus which we have substituted for the rebate should be paid only in connexion with sugar in relation to which white labour exclusively had been employed since the 28th February, 1903. A strong desire was expressed, however, by some honorable members for a further concession. They wished that those who had for a period of twelve months employed white labour only upon their plantations, although coloured labour might have been used since the 28th February, 1903, should be given all the privileges obtainable under the Bill ; but the House, after consideration, came to the conclusion that we ought not to go further than to fix the date as the 28th February, 1903, giving an extension of twelve months. The amendment requested by the Senate provides that if white labour only be employed for a period of twelve months, a bonus shall be payable, although the cane from which the sugar is produced had been planted by coloured labour after the date fixed in the Bill. We think that that is going too far but wc hope to meet the views of those engaged in the industry by adopting, as a compromise, the provision that coloured labour must not be employed in planting the cane after the 28th February, 1903. To secure a bonus the sugar must be the product of cane planted after that date by white labour, though the bonus will still be payable if coloured labour is used after that date in the cultivation and other processes connected with the growing of the cane, but ceases to be used for twelve months before the bonus is claimed. We propose to add, however, an amendment providing that once white labour has been employed the grower cannot go back to the employment of black labour, and then, by employing white labour again for twelve months, obtain a bonus. If he uses black labour at all, after he has once registered as an applicant for a bonus, he cannot go back to white labour and still obtain the bonus. We are concerned now only about the method of planting. We say that if after the 28th February, 1903, growers deliberately plant with black labour, they shall not receive a bonus for the sugar produced from the cane so planted, although they may employ white labour exclusively upon its cultivation. At the same time we wish to give the white labour policy a fair trial, and therefore we provide that, although growers may use black labour in the cultivation of the cane because in many cases they may be forced to do so in consequence of engagements previously entered into, that will not prevent them from obtaining a bonus on their sugar, so long as the cane was riot planted after 28th February last with black labour, and white labour exclusively has been employed in connexion with its production for twelve months prior to the application for the bonus. I think under the circumstances we may recede from the original position, that to obtain bonuses, growers should employ no coloured labour at all after the 28th February, 1903 ; but we are not willing to go to the length of saving that they shall be entitled to bonuses for sugar produced from cane planted by black labour after the 2'8th February, 1903. What we say to them now is, that they may employ black labour in connexion with the production of cane which has not been planted by black labour since 28th February, 1903, and upon ceasing to use that labour, and employing white labour only for a period of twelve months, may obtain a bonus on their sugar. It seems to me that that is a compromise which will meet the wishes of honorable members, and will encourage planters to use white labour. They must use white 'labour exclusively for at least twelve months before applying for a bonus, and they cannot obtain a bonus upon sugar produced from cane planted by black labour since the 28th February, 1903.

                    <para>- The history of this matter is an interesting one. The Government some time ago introduced » Bill to substitute for the sugar rebate provided for in the. Excise Tariff Act a bonus to which the House agreed almost unanimously, but it was further provided that planters who employed even one coloured person on their plantations after the 28th February, 1903, could not obtain, a bonus if the cane were grown from stools planted by black labour. I thought it mv duty to strenuously protest against that provision, and I pointed out the unfairness of requiring the growers who wished to obtain a bonus to ' root out the cane stools and replant. I believe that my arguments were sound, and I am sorry that they did not entirely commend themselves to a majority of honorable members. But as the matter was further discussed, it was recognised that my suggestion and the proposal of the honorable member for North Sydney offered a fair means of dealing with the question. Now that the constitutional difficulty has been disposed of, and the amendment has been accepted by the Government with a modification, I may be pardoned for expressing some satisfaction at the action which has been taken. I am bound to say that I desired something more, but I am prepared to make a compromise, because I have gathered from some of the leaders of the House that honorable members would not be in favour of paying the bonus in regard to sugar produced from crops planted by other than white labour after the 28th February last. I admit freely that there are some good grounds for taking up that position. Although I have advocated a still more liberal course, it is only fair, to those who differ from me, that' 1 should acknowledge that, if the bounty were paid upon cane planted by other than white labour after February last, those who have relied solely upon white labour for the planting and cultivation of their crops would be placed at a disadvantage. I am anxious that it should be made clear to the sugar-growers of Queensland, that the difficulty in which I was previously placed no longer exists. It will not be necessary for the planters to plough out a single stool of cane, if they employ white labour for a period of twelve months prior to the gathering of their crops. I am glad that notwithstanding the reluctance of some Ministers to agree to this course, the Government have adopted it. I desire to see this question settled, and to let the sugar-growers know their exact position. If the Bill is to pass in the form now proposed, every additional day of uncertainty will tell against the sugar-growers, because they will not be able to claim the bonus upon the sugar produced from crops planted by black labour after February last. I am precluded from taking action to secure more than is now offered by the Government. "We must accept the proposal as it stands, or rejects it altogether. </para>

                    <para>- The modesty of the honorable member for Wide Bay is most amusing. He has obtained a great deal more than he has ever asked for or expected, and now he tells lis that he is almost satisfied. No doubt the honorable member deserved everything that he could possibly get for the way in which he has fought this question. Personally, I think that the Government have acted too liberally. I have thought so ever since they proposed the twelve months period. However, I do not intend to raise any opposition at this stage, because I think the sooner the whole matter is settled the better. I know from telegrams I have received that there is a great deal of uncertainty in the minds of planters as to whether they will be entitled to the bonus, because when the Bill was introduced the date fixed was the 28th February, 1902. I am pleased . to hear the assurance of the Treasurer that no bonus will be paid upon cane which has been planted by black labour after the 28th February, 1903. </para>

                <para>Before making . any more formal answer to the note which accompanies your tender of your resignation (which, pending your reply to this, I do not propose to make public), I wish you to reconsider a step which I consider would be highly injurious to the public interests. You owe it to yourself, to your colleagues, to me, if I may say so, and most of all to the public, to accept this advice. </para>
                <para>The measure in which you feel so anxiously concerned gives you nearly all that you have asked. Any measure of the kind is a momentous advance in industrial legislation, and I know of no parallel to it in the laws of any Federation. In the form which the Cabinet is prepared to indorse, it is far-reaching, and will do more for the settlement of industrial strife than any measure of the kind in existence. On this, our first Federal essay in such a field, I ask j'ou earnestly to be satisfied with so much. There are those among your colleagues who have conceded much in accepting the Bill, even without the extension of awards made under it to the crews, not parties to a dispute, of shipping not Australian, whether British or foreign. The views and opinions of these colleagues should be considered, as well as your own. </para>
                <para>I do not expect a reply this evening. 1 should be better pleased if you would consider this note between now and to-morrow. </para>
                <para>Surely it is right that I should ask, and that you should give, further consideration to this matter, remembering not only your past loyalty to your colleagues, but also the loyalty they in their turn have rendered you, and the cordial relations which have so uniformly marked our official ; ind personal intercourse. </para>

My leader does not require to be told what are my feelings towards him - how strong ray personal attachment, nor how deep my political regard and loyalty. Whatever my many faults, want of loyalty finds no place amongst them. I value very highly loyalty to a great cause. This cause of industrial conciliation has long been dearest to my heart. It has ever been recognised as most needing legislation, especially in the Federal area, for the prevention of disasters such as the maritime strike. Shorn of all application to seamen or cheap crews - not Australian - which invade our coastal trade, any Federal Conciliation Bill would be a mockerj', for which it would be idle to expect earnest support, and with which I cannot be associated, apart from the circumstances under which the seamen have foregone their claim to special navigation legislation this session. </para>

                        <para>I have publicly stated our intention to introduce a comprehensive measure, for the passage of which within that period ample time would thus be afforded. I mean a Navigation and Shipping Bill, containing a provision for the payment of our ruling rates to the men engaged on all vessels, even from abroad, taking part in our coastal trade. This could constitutionally, and without doing violence to any international law or usage, form part of such a measure as one of the terms on which we grant the privileges of our coastal trade. As j'ou are aware, the opinion of the Cabinet is that the provision you desire to make in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill would be open to objection on both constitutional and international grounds if placed in a measure having such distinctly different purposes, and would be likely to defeat itself. The insertion of the provision in the Navigation Bill is therefore in our judgment the course best calculated to secure to our seamen the protection which we, like yourself, desire to give them. We have, however, declined to deal piecemeal with the objects of our Navigation and Shipping Bill, and His; Excellency in his speech on opening Parliament intimated that Ministers were not sanguine of being able to deal with . that measure this session. </para>

                <para>To the facts disclosed in these letters I have not much to add. The severance of such relations as have existed between my right honorable friend and his colleagues,, independently of the warm regard which has always subsisted between him and me, is a thing not to be contemplated without- considerable sorrow, and the personal aspect of the matter is one that to me is especially painful. No one, however, can with hold from my right honorable friend, or from his colleagues I hope, the tribute of respect which adherence to deliberate political beliefs should evoke. As the measure is not on the table, I may, perhaps, give a very short statement of the point at issue, and if in that state merit I' lack any frankness or candour, I trust that my right honorable friend will supply my deficiencies. As honorable members know, it is the intention of the Government to bring in a Bill dealing with the question of conciliation and arbitration. It was also their intention to introduce during this session, if possible, a Navigation and Shipping Bill, but that intention - as has been announced - must give way for the present. The Navigation and Shipping Bill is to contain a provision, as to which I am committing no breach of confidence in making an announcement, because it has been the subject of several public statements on my part. Every Government or rather every Parliament has a right to dictate the conditions upon which the privilege of joining in its coastal trade may be enjoyed, as was clearly laid down the other day in the decision of the Privy Council in the ships' stores case. As a condition of according that privilege, we propose in the exercise of our undoubted right of defining the terms under which it should be enjoyed to provide that the ruling rates of wages which are payable by our shipowners to seamen employed in our own coastal trade shall be paid by all who engage in that trade, even though their vessels may come from abroad. However, that provision is a regulation of navigation or shipping, which, we think, should properly be included in a Navigation and Shipping Bill. As to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, without going into details, our difficulty arose in this way : My right honorable friend desired to insert a provision which would cause awards to extend to seamen and shipping, not purely Australian, but coming from abroad, and, of course, following the scheme of the Bill, those awards would operate as rules to that extent, even though the whole of the persons engaged in that trade were not represented in the arbitration. The difficulty which the Cabinet saw in that provision was that in an Arbitration Bill it did not in itself constitute a condition attaching to engagement in our trade, as did the ships' stores provision in the Customs Bill, but that it was a provision which my right honorable friend sought to insert in a measure having for its general scheme of application the settlement of industrial disputes in our midst, the extension of which, from State to State, did not seem to us to imply an extension of the area of dispute beyond their territorial limits. We thought, therefore, that such a provision would be open to objection on two grounds. In the first place, we thought that in the case of the crews of vessels owned abroad it could not legally operate beyond our jurisdiction, and, therefore, that it might be defeated by a decision of the courts. Secondly, we thought that, unless it found its proper place, that is, in a Navigation and Shipping Bill, it would be open to objection from those outside our jurisdiction, especially from international sources. I do not desire to disclose more than is necessary for. our purpose, but while the members of the Government generally could see that such a provision would probably find its place presently in legislation apposite to the question, we could not see how it was to produce the intended effect if we placed it in an Industrial Arbitration Bill. That is the whole of this difference between my right honorable colleague and the other members of the Ministry. It is purely a difference of opinion - of conscientious opinion - on both sides. My right honorable friend holds strongly that if this provision would be legitimate in one class of Bill it would be legitimate also in another. We, on the other hand, think that it can only find its legitimate place, so as to be constitutionally valid and to be effectual, in a Bill dealing with the conditions under which we admit others to the privileges of our trade. I am happy to be able to assure the House that, save for our differences in regard to this Bill, there is nothing whatever between 'us officially, and that there is nothing at all of a personal character. In circumstances of this kind, where there is no tension of feeling, and where we have been engaged, as we have been for a long time, in endeavouring to bring ourselves into line on such a matter, the fact that there has been absolutely no quarrel between us only intensifies the sorrow which the severance occasions. I wish to assure the House that throughout our official connexion I have had from my right honorable friend nothing but loyalty, and throughout our personal association nothing but high regard: </para>

                            <para>- But a time sometimes comes in our history when we deem it to be only our duty with deep regret to take a certain course, severing us, in some respects at least, from, for example,' a Ministerial association which has been long enjoyed. It seems to me that when such a time comes it is the duty of both parties to the difference of opinion to bow with mutual respect to the inevitable. The step which I have taken - and which I can assure honorable members I have not taken without the utmost consideration - is one to which it- seems to me there is no alternative. ' What is the position ? It is this : I feel strongly in regard to many matters. I hold strong views in regard to many matters ; but I feel especially strongly on the question of industrial conciliation and arbitration. I have done my best to make it the study of my life, and, it seems to me, that I owe to it a loyalty which exceeds all other considerations. A time has come when I must either resign my association with my old friends in the Ministry, or consent to advocate before the House and the public legislation in which I do not believe. In these circumstances, what am I to do? There is one question above all others in connexion with industrial conciliation, and especially in connexion with Federal industrial conciliation which .is of the gravest importance. I refer to the application of the principle of conciliation to the maritime question - to our coastal trade - for the purpose of the avoidance of a disaster such as the huge maritime strike which occurred some years ago. In 1890, when I had occasion to introduce certain legislation in the South Australian Parliament, I had not spoken for five minutes before I pointed out that, although we were trying in that State to do what we could to prevent a recurrence of the evil to which </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">I have referred, we could not act effectually until we had obtained Federal legislation on the subject. I referred then to the maritime strike as being the inspiring cause- in connexion with one or two other great industrial struggles which we had then recently experienced - of the introduction of the legislation which I was advocating at the time. What is the position to-day? There may be some difference of opinion, but I claim to have an intimate acquaintance with the true position of affairs. I know that it is only by timely concession and mutual consideration that trouble has been avoided. The position to-day hangs upon the lightest thread. I know full well that time and again I have done what I could in the matter, for the purpose of inducing further consideration. That consideration may be given, but I assert that no Federal Conciliation law will be worthy of the name if it does not provide for the settlement of questions of the character to which I refer -disputes between those who are engaged in our coastal trade. What is the difficulty ? It is this : The Australian ship-owner generally is prepared to concede fair wages to his men, but he does it to-day in these circumstances - that he is exposed to the cruel competition of others who know no similar regard for those whom they employ. To-day the Australian ship-master carries on his business in these circumstances - that he gives double the wages paid by those who compete with him in the coastal trade of Australia, if the Bill which I should have had to advocate, if I had remained in my accustomed place, were passed in the shape in which I have been permitted to introduce it, no remedy would be possible of application. In these circumstances, painful as the position is, and re-echoing every word that my leader has uttered, I see no alternative than the course which I propose to pursue. It is not so long ago that, speaking to the representatives of the shipping industry, I told them that we could not introduce a Navigation Bill at this stage, but that a Conciliation Bill would be introduced which I believed would in some measure give the remedy. I thought at the ' time that I spoke with authority. I may have misunderstood the position, but whatever misunderstanding there may be, , I am content to pay the penalty doing that which I believe to be my duty, and at the same time wishing good luck to those with whom I have had the honour to be associated. </para>

                        <para>- - Having regard to the position which I occupy, I do not think that the House will expect me to say much on the present occasion. I am ignorant of precedents, for an occasion such ns this has never before occurred during my parliamentary career. It would be equally bad taste for me to say one word as to the merits of the controversy. All that I can say is that we honour aud respect the principle by - which the right honorable member for- South Australia is actuated in determining, when he finds that, on what to him is a vital question, ho differs materially from his colleagues, to resign his office rather than surrender his conscientious opinion. I think that is a sound principle of Cabinet Government, and I hope that it will never be' forgotten. The whole principle of Cabinet Government is that upon all important matters the Cabinet shall be a homogeneous whole. On behalf of the Opposition, I thank the Prime Minister for having given this information to the House at the earliest possible moment. Nothing would have been more undesirable than for the Government to allow a period of misunderstanding and rumour to elapse during which the actual state of affairs would not have been known to the public. We know exactly now what has occurred, and before I resume my scat I feel that, as I have had many differences with the right honorable gentleman who has resigned his office, I should say that, in spite of those differences, I consider he has always acted up to his lights at any rate. I beg to assure him, oh behalf of myself and the Opposition, of our hearty respect for his conduct to-day. </para>
