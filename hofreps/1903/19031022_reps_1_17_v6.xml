                    <para>Gentlemen,</para>
                <para>I have been profoundly touched by the signal honour you have done mo in handing me the Address from each of your two Houses, authoritatively representing as they do the warm-hearted people of Australia. That you have been kind enough to give such generous expression to your feeling that I have done my duty by my Sovereign, the Empire, and Australia during my term of office as Governor-General will be to me an ever grateful remembrance, and I shall value this Address as one of the highest honours I could possibly receive. </para>
                <para>I wish to thank my Ministers and the members of the first Commonwealth Parliament of Australia for their unvarying kindness and courtesy to me and mine ; and Lady Tennyson, who has throughout been closely associated with me in the" performance of my duties, and, may I add, richly merits your encomium, desires me to convey to you her heartfelt gratitude for your kind words and wishes. She and I have spent five truly happy years among you, and the people of Australia will always bo very near our hearts, while you may rest assured that, wherever I am, I shall continue to advocate their interests to the best of my ability. </para>
                <para>It is true that I came into office at a time when many great difficulties had to be encountered ; but by your " common sense," patience, and perseverance these especial difficulties have been overcome. I shall ever remember with pride that I was His Majesty's chief representative in Australia when the Constitution of the Commonwealth was being established on a firm basis - that as such I assented to the four great Acts which are the four corner-stones of the Constitution, and helped to place the coping-stone on the edifice by the creation of your strong Federal High Court. </para>
                <para>In my journeys through Australia I have- been enabled to see for myself how wonderful the resources - how rich the products of your country are, and how splendidly loyal are the people. </para>
                <para>I have full belief that United Australia will take a high and worthy rank among the nations of the world, and add her contribution to the welfare and the glories of the British race, and aid the mother country to fulfil her great Imperial mission. </para>

                        <para>. - I omitted last night to perform, a duty which obviously belongs to as, because I understood that a more fitting opportunity would present itself to-day. . I refer to the expression at the close of the session of our high' appreciation of the manner in which Mr.' Speaker and the officers of the .House have discharged their duties. The session now drawing to a close has not been so interminably long or so gravely serious as that which preceded it, but it has been rich in legislative work and marked by achievements upon which we shall be able to look with satisfaction in the future. The officers of the House have at all times been courteous and have rendered necessary assistance to honorable members. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has been, - in a sense, not only our controller, but the confidant and counsellor of. honorable members in all matters relating to the business of this Chamber. I take it that we are exceptionally fortunate in finding ourselves in this splendid building, surrounded by a staff of diligent and courteous officers, and presided over by a  Speaker  who has filled his position with dignity, and who will leave an honoured name behind him. </para>

I think that at the close of this Parliament we have also reason to be satisfied with ourselves. We have had an exceptionally difficult task to perform. We have had to deal with the question of a new Tariff, the much- vexed white Australia question; and many other important matters. </para>

The inference to be drawn from the condensed report which appears in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> this morning is that in my reference to the attitude assumed by the right honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> and. the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, I conveyed the idea that it was a very bad thing for Australia that they were' members of this House. I -wish it to be clearly understood that I had no such idea in my mind. I fully acknowledge the good work which lias been done, both in State and Federal politics, by the right honorable and learned member for South Australia, and I have not the slightest reason to cast any reflection in a general way upon the honorable member for Kalgoorlie. </para>

                        <para>- Yackandandah happens to be in my electorate, and, although I am intensely grateful to the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne for taking an interest in that town, I wish to assure him that it was one of those places to which I specifically referred the other evening when discussing this subject. I submitted the name to the Minister for Home Affairs who took a special note of it. I thoroughly agree that a good deal of confusion has occurred in regard to the rolls, and in that locality, as well as in others, their rectification is undoubtedly necessary. I strongly urge that so important a matter, not merely to candidates, but to the whole of Australia, should receive attention at the hands of the Minister. That is only one instance in which there has been confusion. All around Wodonga, and various other -towns in the same electorate - I do not think it is necessary to give their names - the immediate and earnest attention of the Government is required to the remedy of existing evils. </para>
