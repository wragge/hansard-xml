May she ask questions of this quality every day. I point out to the member for Makin, and indeed to members opposite, that the Howard government's new Medicare safety net is the biggest structural improvement to Medicare since it was first brought in 20 years ago. Thanks to the MedicarePlus safety net, in a full year, more than one million Australians will receive higher Medicare benefits. More than one million Australians who face significant out-of-hospital, out-of-pocket expenses will receive higher Medicare benefits. That is 7,000 people on average in every single electorate around this country. Already more than half a million people are eligible for higher Medicare rebates thanks to the Howard government's brand new Medicare safety net. That is, on average, 3,000 people in every electorate around this country who are benefiting now thanks to the Howard government's safety net. They would lose that benefit—it would be ripped off them—if members opposite ever got into government.</para></talk.start><para>Let me give you some examples of real people who are enjoying benefits under the Howard government's safety net that would be ripped off them if there were a change of government. One patient with terminal bone cancer has received an additional $520 thanks to the Howard government's safety net. That would be gone under Labor. Another patient with chronic diabetes received an additional $385 thanks to the Howard government's safety net. That would be gone under Labor. A patient with a heart condition, who has a pacemaker, has received an extra $330 thanks to the Howard government's safety net. That would be gone under Labor. </para><para>The Howard government's safety net is good policy. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition of something that he said in this House when he was mere member for Werriwa. He said:</para><quote><para>The methodology of good health reform is to get effective public safety net provisions in place ...</para></quote><para>That is what he said when he was a thinker and not just a political brawler. It is precisely what the Howard government has done. It is precisely what the Leader of the Opposition has forgotten because he needed to do a deal with the Left to assume the leadership. Let me make it very clear: the only political party in this parliament and the only political party in Australia which is promising to cut any health program is the Australian Labor Party. What that proves is that, when it comes to health, you can't trust Labor. The message from this side of the House to the other side of the House is: do whatever you want, but one thing don't do—don't mess with Medicare.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Intelligence: Weapons of Mass Destruction</title><page.no>32552</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>32552</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

I have made my views very clear and I have dealt quite explicitly with the merits of the arguments that have been advanced by the 43 people. The 43 people comprise a mixture of people who have over the years been, in some cases, regular critics of this government. They include one person who accused the Royal Australian Navy and the Australian Federal Police of complicity in the drowning of 353 refugees. To expect for a moment that I am going to treat that person with the sort of reverence that is asked of me by the Leader of the Opposition—as far as I am concerned I have dealt with the merits of their arguments and, as far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned, let me repeat: he is the last person in this building who has any moral authority to demand apologies in relation to personal insults.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Economy: Performance</title><page.no>32552</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>32552</page.no><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name><name.id>HK6</name.id><electorate>Herbert</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Treasurer.

Today the National Australia Bank released its business survey for the month of July, showing business confidence increased for the third consecutive month. According to the bank's chief executive, Alan Oster:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... the Australian economy started the second half of 2004 on a strong note. Indeed, the survey confirms that the recent re-acceleration of growth seems to have continued into July—with a positive spillover on business confidence.</para></quote><para>That is good news for the Australian economy. Business is confident, consumers are confident, interest rates are low, inflation is low and consumer confidence is driving great gains in employment. None of this happens by accident or by chance. Over the last eight years, the government has put in place a number of economic measures—which were opposed by the Australian Labor Party—which have built strength and resilience in our economy. The Australian Labor Party opposed the balancing of the budget. The Australian Labor Party opposed the pay-down of Australia's debt. It opposed our new monetary policy agreement. It opposed taxation reform. It opposed industrial relations reform. It opposed our privatisation. It opposed us on competition. If the Australian Labor Party had had its way, all of those things would have been at risk. </para><para>I am asked what risks there are to the economic outlook in Australia. The biggest risk to the economic outlook in Australia would be the election of a Latham government. This is a Leader of the Opposition who has form, because the last time he got in control of an organ of government he engaged in unfunded spending, he drove up council rates, he left the budget in deficit, he engaged in developments which eventually sent the Liverpool City Council into bankruptcy, and he walked away.</para><para>I reminded the House yesterday that the average interest rate under the Labor Party was 12 per cent. Interest rates are going up around the world at the moment. The United States lifted them in June. It may well lift them again overnight. The Bank of England lifted them a couple of weeks ago. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand lifted them a couple of weeks ago. There is a rising interest rate climate around the world and the last thing that Australia needs as its economic manager is the failed mayor of the Liverpool council. If Mr Latham were elected as Prime Minister, all Australian home buyers would wake up the next morning with a Liverpool kiss—the kiss of the management of the Liverpool council! Home buyers in Australia cannot afford another Liverpool kiss from another Liverpool mayor; they need good economic management and they need the return of a coalition government.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>32553</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>32553</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I inform the House that we have present in the distinguished visitors gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from Ireland.

He raises a very important aspect of the free trade agreement—that is, improved market access for dairy products into that incredibly valuable American market. I am sure he is aware that just recently the Australian Dairy Farmers announced that they wanted to see the free trade agreement pass through the parliament as quickly as possible so they could prepare for that increased market access and get tooled up in terms of exporting there. In their press release they said: </para></talk.start><quote><para>Until this legislation passes through the Parliament there will continue to be uncertainty about the 3-fold increase in dairy product access to the USA.</para></quote><para>They are concerned about the uncertainty that still exists here, notwithstanding that the agreement has passed all the legislative processes in the Congress in the United States. They went on to say in their release:</para><quote><para>The industry has estimated the trade will be worth between $2,000 and $3,000 per farmer in the first year but this will only be realized if dairy companies can start now to develop the relationships they need to maximize the value of the new quota access to the US market.</para></quote><para>Mr Speaker, we have continually said that this deal is a good deal for Australia's agricultural producers, particularly the dairy farmers across Australia, who so badly need this extra access and that extra income per farm per year to help their circumstances.</para><para>For the information of the member for Eden-Monaro, Bega Cheese, a company in his electorate, in 1996 employed around 100 people. Today it employs over 500 people, with an increasing focus on exports. The FTA will support that and give the company opportunities to expand and generate more jobs in that regional part of the member's electorate.</para><para>As we have continued to say, the free trade agreement provides the opportunity to generate 30,000 new jobs in the Australian economy and add $6 billion to the GDP of this country after 10 years. That is certainly worth pursuing. The government have pursued it because we believe that it is in the national interest. The FTA will deepen our trade and investment relationship with the largest economy in the world. The US is the world's largest market. It has a GDP of almost $US11 trillion. It is the world's largest importer. It is the world's largest investor and the world's largest purchaser of goods and services.</para><para>For the first time, this agreement gives Australian industry access to the $200 billion US federal government procurement market but also to a further $200 billion state government procurement market. In recent weeks, two more states of the United States, Michigan and Illinois, have signed on to the government procurement chapter—very important markets for Australian manufacturing industries.</para><para>Two-thirds of US tariffs on agricultural products will be eliminated on day one and after four years 75 per cent of agricultural tariffs will be eliminated. That will provide the much needed market access that I spoke about for the dairy industry, which will also accrue to other industries like lamb, beef and tuna. Over 97 per cent of US tariffs on Australia's manufacturing exports will be eliminated on day one, with the automotive, metals, minerals, seafood, paper and chemical sectors receiving an immediate boost and new opportunities for new business.</para><para>Most importantly, as our services sector grows in terms of its value to the Australian economy, as of 1 January next year under the US free trade agreement the United States will not be able to discriminate against Australian service providers competing in their market in favour of their service providers. We will be provided with national treatment in that market. That is the growth sector of our exporting industries and it is important that we know that.</para><para>It is little wonder the government unanimously support this agreement. In the last couple of weeks we have seen the Labor Party coming very, very slowly—almost being dragged to the box—to support this agreement. Then they put out their statement last week outlining why it is in the national interest.

No. It would depend on the circumstances and it would depend on the propriety of the minister. I have to say to the Leader of the Opposition that the adoption of an arbitrary time of 12 months is nothing more than what it is: an arbitrary period of time. If a former minister is a proper person, in my view there is no reason why that person cannot take up a position with a company, providing information that has come to the knowledge of that person is not disclosed.

This agreement is good for Australia because it links Australia more closely with the world's most dynamic economy. It will give us immediate duty-free access for over 97 per cent of our merchandise exports to the United States market. That is an enormous benefit for Australia. It eliminates nearly all United States tariffs on auto products, including the 25 per cent tariff on utes. Obviously General Motors Holden in Adelaide and Ford in Victoria are particularly pleased about that. The 50 per cent ship repair tariff will be eliminated as well. These are just examples of how industries in a number of our electorates and a number of our states will be specifically very much better off. </para></talk.start><para>Almost two-thirds of agricultural tariffs erected against, amongst others, Australian imports into the United States will go immediately and an additional nine per cent will go four years after the free trade agreement comes into force. That means, for example, tariffs on lamb and tuna exports will go altogether. That will give our farmers and our seafood industry very much better access to the American market. Obviously it means jobs; it means investment; and it means prosperity for those communities.</para><para>It gives open access for Australian companies to the $200 billion market for United States federal government procurement. We do not have access to that market now, but we will have access to a market worth $200 billion. That obviously is an enormous benefit. I think about 30 states have also agreed to enter into this arrangement. The fact is that the benefits to Australia of this free trade agreement are simply enormous. I note other countries are desperately trying to negotiate a similar agreement with the United States. A handful have succeeded: obviously, Canada and Mexico; Chile has succeeded; and there are one or two other countries. But there are many on the waiting list. One of the arguments that perhaps those opposite, so many of whom oppose the free trade agreement with United States, have not reflected on is that those countries which do have free trade agreements with the United States have preferential access compared to Australia. If we knock this back, that means that the Chileans, the Canadians, the Mexicans and so on, in the same industry sectors, will have an advantage over Australian exporters. If the free trade agreement with the Americas comes into force then the whole of Latin America will have a better access arrangement to the US market than Australia, if we in the end do not support the free trade agreement.</para><para>I was asked whether there are any alternative views on this issue. It is quite interesting. There was a question earlier about Liberal candidates. Labor candidates, interestingly enough, are running around the country telling people that they are opposed to the free trade agreement. I do not read the <inline font-style="italic">Blue Mountains Gazette</inline> every day or every week, whereas I am sure the member for Macquarie, the Chief Government Whip, does. In the <inline font-style="italic">Blue Mountains Gazette</inline> of Wednesday, 4 August, the Labor candidate for the seat of Macquarie made a desperate bid for populism. He was following on the lead, of course, of the Leader of the Opposition himself, who said on 9 February this year that he would oppose the free trade agreement—that was when he used to oppose the free trade agreement. The Labor candidate for Macquarie has come out and said that not only will he oppose the free trade agreement now and continue to campaign on the basis of being opposed to it but, in the event that he gets elected to parliament—frankly, if the excellent representation that Macquarie currently has is downgraded, and I do not believe this will happen—he will continue to campaign against the free trade agreement in parliament. This is what you have with the Labor Party: a leader who on 9 February set the tone—part of his old anti-American cry—saying that his gut reaction was to oppose the free trade agreement. That was his first position. He has had four positions on the free trade agreement since then, coupled, by the way, with his nine positions on troops out by Christmas— </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name></talker><para>—His Kamasutra!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name></talker><para>—I will come back later in the day to some of his other positions, but the Leader of the Opposition has a lot of positions.

Labor should disendorse their candidate in Macquarie, if they believe so passionately in the free trade agreement. This is a big issue on which there is to be a vote in the Senate later this week. All I can say is that the confusion in the opposition on this issue is as a result of the tone set by their leader.

He does an excellent job up there in the Northern Territory, and he is a strong believer in the government's border security policies. The government ratified the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime and its Protocol Against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air on 27 May, and once the new anti-trafficking offences have been enacted the government will ratify the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. What these treaties do is build on the international framework that we are contributing to the development of to combat the transnational crime of people-smuggling and to facilitate greater regional cooperation in this area. What we have done through the Bali process, cohosted by Australia and Indonesia, has been frankly extraordinary in terms of taking steps to address people-smuggling.</para></talk.start><para>We as a government have also taken steps to strengthen our aerial security capability. The Prime Minister announced last month, very recently, a $135 million package to do that and a week or so earlier a $102 million package on maritime security. The fact is that the government's policy of improved border security, deterrence and regional cooperation has worked. Not a single boat with illegal migrants has arrived in Australia since March 2004 and only three have come to Australia since December 2001. Some of these policies have been tough and some of them have been controversial, but the point is that they have been extraordinarily successful and I think the public recognise that.</para><para>Are there any alternative approaches? Yes, the Labor Party have several alternative approaches. The first of their approaches is to take the Navy off the job. The Navy have been doing an excellent job, and the Labor Party's policy is to take the Navy off the job and to create something which is euphemistically called a coastguard. We know what the coastguard really is: the coastguard is Labor's coast guide. It is called a coast guide because they do not want to stop anyone coming to Australia; they want to meet them and bring them into Australia. That is the plan. A coastguard is to stop; a coast guide is to welcome, and that is what the Labor Party have in mind. It would be all very well if the Labor Party had just one policy on this issue, but under the frankly erratic and unpredictable leadership of the Leader of the Opposition—phrases I think you will hear a little more of over the next few weeks—they have had nine policies on troops out by Christmas, five policies on the US free trade agreement but so far only three policies on the coast guide, on the so-called protection of Australia, through the scrapping of the Navy's role in guarding our borders. </para><para>Policy No. 1, which was announced by the Labor Party in November 2002, was to buy three motorboats, call them a coastguard and have them replace the Navy's role. Then they decided that was not good enough, so back in March this year the member for Barton—and he will remember all of this—had policy No. 2, which was to add to the three motorboats 10 other boats without additional funding. Honourable members may recall that these boats were to be so small we dubbed them the water taxis. The strength of these boats was that they were to have helicopters and that in the helicopters were to be snipers, and the snipers were going to shoot the engines of the people smugglers' boats and stop those boats so that the water taxis could then go, pick the people up and take them off the boats. That was policy No. 2. By the way, on 30 June—the last day of the financial year—this policy was scrapped and a new policy was developed. Two hundred million dollars was to be saved in the new policy. Labor introduced their new cut-price coast guide policy, where they would cut the number of boats down to eight and just rent some boats. They are going to rent a few boats and—surprise, surprise!—the Labor Party have abandoned the armed snipers. There are to be no armed snipers.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Government members interjecting</inline><inline font-style="italic">—</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name></talker><para>—I know; it would have been great for cartoons, it would have been great for our constituents.

Now we have a heap of little motorboats buzzing around in order to guide people in, but there are not as many as before; we have gone down to eight rented boats. There is to be no Navy, just eight rented boats patrolling 37,000 kilometres of coastline. You scrap the Navy's role, and that is called doubling. If I may say so, Labor's cut-price coast guide policy will be a failed policy.

Minister, isn't it a fact that there is no new evidence to justify a reconsideration of this recommendation? Will the minister now admit that requiring ATAGI to reconsider the matter is part of a strategy to force ATAGI to withdraw the recommendation for the new injectable polio vaccine and spare the government its continuing political embarrassment about not matching Labor's plan to fund the vaccine?</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Lalor will resume her seat.

The government set about bringing about flexibility and choice in the workplace, which has resulted in 1.3 million extra jobs and higher real wages for Australians. This means greater security for Australians and their families. Part of the government's record on award simplification includes setting aside some 1,480 awards and seeing 1,220 awards being simplified since 1997. Indeed, the number of employees who rely primarily on awards has fallen from 67.6 per cent in May 1990 to just over 20 per cent in May 2002.</para></talk.start><para>The member for Cowper asked me about proposals to reregulate the system in Australia.

I am asking him to stand up today and take responsibility for the fact that his government delayed, and delayed for too long, in funding the pneumococcal vaccine and that this has caused suffering. It was, after all, in September 2002 that the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation first recommended that all Australian children should be vaccinated against the deadly pneumococcal disease and should also have the chickenpox vaccine and the new form of the polio vaccine. It was as long ago as September 2003 that the National Health and Medical Research Council echoed ATAGI's findings and said that all Australian children should have access to these vaccines.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the months leading up to the budget in May, the minister at the table was frequently heard at public meetings giving a bit of a wink and a nod that perhaps the government would finally see its way clear to funding the pneumococcal vaccine, but we know from what is on the public record that something went dreadfully wrong in the preparation of the budget. What went dreadfully wrong was not an error, not a lost sheet of paper, not a late submission and not confusion but that the highest budget decision-making body of the Howard government—the Expenditure Review Committee—considered funding the pneumococcal vaccine and deliberately and knowingly rejected the recommendation to do so. This was no error; this was a calculated, considered political decision of the Howard government. They produced what they then spruiked as a family-friendly budget, without the most basic thing that families need, and that is of course to know that their new infants are properly vaccinated.</para><para>It is a matter of history now that the Labor Party, two days after the May budget, committed to funding the pneumococcal vaccine, the chickenpox vaccine and the new polio vaccine, and that that very visible public campaign finally stung the minister for health, the Howard government's political fixer, into action. He finally needed to do something and he announced, after months and months of campaigning, that he would fund the pneumococcal vaccine from 1 January next year and that a catch-up program would be available from 1 January next year.</para><para>In light of those facts, which cannot be contested—the minister at the table cannot contest those facts; they are a matter of public record—I am asking the minister at the table to do something that no-one in the Howard government ever does. We did not see the Prime Minister do it today. I want the minister to stand up here today and say, `I am a member of the Howard government and I understand that, in delaying funding the pneumococcal vaccine, that in not immediately acting on ATAGI's recommendation, I have caused harm and suffering.' I want this government to take the political responsibility, the personal responsibility, for what their decision has caused. They are never there when things go wrong; they never take responsibility—it is always someone else's fault. It is time the minister for health stood at this table and said, `The announcement to fund the pneumococcal vaccine was late. The making of the vaccine available from 1 January next year is late, and people have been hurt in the meantime.'  </para><para>I know that even if the government had done the right thing on the very first day in September 2003 baby Neisje would not have been vaccinated, because she was too young. Babies first have the vaccine at two months of age. But if Australia had started vaccinating then, when the experts said that we should, it is certainly true to say that there are families in Australia who would not have seen their young children suffer with pneumococcal disease. Tragically, some of them have died and for them there is no catch-up program, Minister. For them, there can never be a catch-up. If we had started vaccinating then, less of the disease would have been circulating in our community. If we had started vaccinating then, we would not have families still making the agonising choice about whether or not they can fund a vaccine. </para><para>Parents of babies that were born in the summer that has just gone are now being advised to pay up to $500 for vaccinations to protect their babies, because the risk of infection is greatest in the winter months. A recent story in the <inline font-style="italic">Illawarra</inline><inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> highlighted how one family with five children had handed over more than a week's wages to pay for their new son's vaccinations. Minister, you need to take responsibility for that too, because that would not be happening if the government had announced the funding of the vaccine when it should have.

Is that because this is something that is going to be reconsidered after an election, if the Howard government are re-elected, and the pneumococcal vaccine funding was really in the way of a pre-election stunt—something that they were prepared to fund before the election but which, after two years, they will make sure is taken away?

This is following an all too familiar pattern of behaviour for this government. The government finally is forced into a political corner on the funding of the pneumococcal vaccine, after months of community campaigning, months of Labor's campaigning and Labor's leadership on the question. But he still has not funded the recommendations of the experts—ATAGI and the National Health and Medical Research Council—on the other two vaccines, the new chickenpox vaccine and the new polio vaccine.  </para><para>So what is the minister going to do? He knows that this is going to be an issue in the lead-up to the election. He knows that Labor is committed to funding these vaccines and his government is not. He needs a strategy. He needs a plan.

So this government does what it always does when it needs something fixed: it starts putting pressure on the people around it, whether they be public servants, whether they be eminent Australians—as we have seen in the last 48 hours—or whether, in this case, it be Australia's immunisation experts. It starts putting pressure on people to deliver a fix, and that is exactly what has happened with the chickenpox and the oral polio vaccines.

The truth, as you know, Minister, is that there is no new evidence on chickenpox that stands up to scientific scrutiny. When ATAGI first considered chickenpox it considered the question of whether or not vaccinating children could result in an unexpected shingles outbreak in older members of the community, and it specifically rejected that argument. Have a look at the immunisation handbook where ATAGI specifically rejects that argument from its first consideration of the chickenpox vaccine. It talks there about zoster, which is the formal name for shingles, and says that shingles is uncommon before the age of 12 years—one per cent of cases. It says that most cases—81 per cent—occur over the age of 40 years. It further says that vaccination results in a lower rate of zoster—2.6 per cent per 100,000—compared to natural infection rates of 68 per cent per 100,000. So ATAGI had already considered this spurious argument that vaccinating children against chickenpox causes an outbreak of shingles. But that is the only thing that you have got to try to justify ATAGI's reconsideration of chickenpox.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As to the new polio vaccine, you do not even have that feather to fly with.

It is safer for the people who deliver it. It means fewer injections for babies. There is not one new piece of information about it, but the minister needs a fix. He needs this fix before the election. So what does he do? He says to ATAGI, `Can you reconsider these two vaccines?' Then his adviser goes to the ATAGI meeting—and somehow the minister did not know whether or not his adviser had attended the meeting in question time today but he knew what was said.

In fact, probably the greatest single achievement of my distinguished predecessor but one in the health portfolio, Dr Michael Wooldridge, was Australia's reborn immunisation program. Throughout the eighties and early nineties, immunisation levels in Australia collapsed to Third World levels. We were 67th or thereabouts in the world when it came to our childhood immunisation rates. But, thanks to the outstanding work of my distinguished predecessor but one, we are now the best of the best in the world when it comes to immunisation. Back in 1996 we spent just $13 million a year, as a federal government, on vaccines. This year we will be spending $143 million on vaccines, and next year, thanks to the pneumococcal vaccination program put in place by this government, the spending will be $254 million. That is something like a twentyfold increase in vaccination programs, thanks to this government. I can only assume that the tone of the member for Lalor's address—that tone of moral outrage which she managed to provide—is motivated by sheer embarrassment and even guilt at the pathetic record of her own party when it comes to vaccination. </para><para>ATAGI did recommend, back in November 2002, in addition to a universal pneumococcal vaccination program, a chickenpox vaccination program and a new polio vaccination program—a move from oral polio vaccine to what is called inactivated polio vaccine. These were recommendations made by ATAGI in good faith on the basis of the evidence that it had at the time, but the government believes, on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer, that there is other evidence that ATAGI failed to take into account and should have taken into account in making recommendations. That is why, on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer, I wrote to ATAGI seeking a reconsideration of those recommendations. Thanks to that letter of mine, a program of work was devised at the July meeting of ATAGI, and ATAGI is confident that a new recommendation can be made before the end of the year.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83L</name.id><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EZ5</name.id><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name></talker><para>—The member for Lalor asks what the new evidence on polio is.

We will move eventually from oral polio vaccine to inactivated polio vaccine, but we will do it when the risk posed by wild strains of polio is reduced from that which we are advised it is currently. This is precisely the issue that ATAGI will be considering prior to a recommendation to me before the end of the year. </para><para>On the question of chickenpox, the issue is: would a universal chickenpox vaccination program for children increase, at least in the short and medium term, the risk of much more serious cases of chickenpox and shingles in adults? That is the issue, the potential problem, with a universal chickenpox vaccination for children. Again, the United Kingdom do not recommend a universal chickenpox vaccination for children, precisely because they are concerned that the benefits of a universal chickenpox vaccination for children might be outweighed by the risk of much more serious cases of chickenpox developing in adults and the risk of debilitating shingles occurring more frequently in adults. Let me quote again from departmental advice:</para><quote><para>Chickenpox is a much more severe disease in older children and adults, with adults having a 25 times greater chance of dying from chickenpox than children. Also, there are some studies that indicate there may be an increase in the number of cases of shingles in the first decade of a chickenpox immunisation program because the virus is no longer circulating through the community and naturally boosting the immune systems of adults against the disease.</para></quote><para>The member for Lalor has asked for the evidence, and I have provided the evidence.

They are told: `There's no pressure. You don't have to do it.' But we all remember Mick Keelty not being put under any pressure either. So what a piece of work this minister is. Health, but only on his terms.</para></talk.start><para>When it comes to health, there ought to be no shortcuts. There ought to be no compromises. We should not allow political philosophy to get in the way of ensuring that every Australian has access to full and proper medical attention which should be available at any time and wherever Australians may live and work. Australia has been down this path before. We have been here before. We rightly believed that we had won these arguments, that we had won the fight about the need for universal access to health care. The people of this country demanded and voted for a universal health scheme—one which assured access to treatment in a public hospital at no cost and one which they believed would enable them to be bulk-billed by a general practitioner if they sought it. </para><para>This government has sat back blissfully and watched while bulk-billing rates in my electorate have fallen from around 71.4 per cent, when the Prime Minister first came into office, to an appalling level of 41.5 per cent, on the last quarterly figures with which we have been provided. The minister was in Tasmania not that long ago and, when he was questioned about these figures, he laughed them off. He thinks: `Everything is fine with bulk-billing. It's not a worry at all.' The declining access to bulk-billing is the same in many other parts of the country, although not of course in the Prime Minister's own backyard in Bennelong, which seems to be a dot on the electoral map where curiously things are not quite so bad—bulk-billing there is at 80 per cent.</para><para>I conducted a survey in my electorate earlier this year, seeking the views of constituents and asking them to put forward the things that concerned them most. Access to a bulk-billing doctor was clearly at the top of the list, when it came to the responses. In Launceston and George Town, a fully bulk-billing doctor is sighted almost as often as a Tasmanian tiger! Not surprisingly, perhaps, the public can no longer access the quarterly reports of bulk-billing rates across the country. It is the mantra of this government: `If we don't like the information, we simply won't give it to you.' The slide, particularly in rural and regional Australia, was becoming so dramatic and bad that the government clearly took the view that it was something that should be hidden from the view of the public. It was something that should not be acceptable to public scrutiny. It is a sad but descriptive reflection on this government's approach to obligations and obligations to honesty with the Australian people.</para><para>The reality for the people of Bass is that they do not need the figures from this duplicitous government to tell them the truth, because they know that they cannot get access to a bulk-billing doctor. As a result, the pressure on the casualty and out-patient departments in our hospitals has become intolerable. Patients who cannot see doctors get sicker and end up at casualty in hospital. Sometimes all they really need is just to see a GP, but sometimes it is much worse than that.</para><para>My constituents also know that they cannot access the vaccines that they want for their children. The Commonwealth ought to ensure that every parent can obtain all recommended childhood vaccines for their sons and daughters. Every Australian child should be protected against diseases. The cost of vaccinating our children is more than offset by the lives saved, the disabilities prevented and the reductions in hospital and ancillary health care costs. I, along with my colleagues on this side of the House, have been strident in my view that every Australian newborn should be protected against pneumococcal disease. The bacteria causes serious illnesses, including pneumonia, meningitis and septicaemia. But there is a vaccine that protects even very young babies—those who are most at risk against this deadly foe. The evidence suggests that it is best to vaccinate at two, four and six months.</para><para>The Treasurer recently urged a number of Australians—it was a particularly frightening thought—to have a child for the mother, a child for the father and a child for the nation. That was the easy bit for him. It proved a much harder task to get him to realise that, once born, each one of those children needs every chance to survive in their early years. Placing all the responsibility on Australian parents is unfair and an abrogation of duty by this government. It is far from fair to expect parents to have to choose whether or not to spend $500 to vaccinate their child against a deadly disease. On the other hand, this should not have been a very hard task for the government. If it had its priorities right, if it listened to the experts that it had appointed to advise it, it would have allocated money to save children's lives. One such life story—a sadly too short life story—was told in this House today. Instead the government chose to delay, to hide behind excuses about worldwide shortages—we heard that again today—and then to allocate the funds that could have been available for the purpose to a patchwork quilt of proposals designed to make it look as though it was doing something about the mess in health care that it has overseen. </para><para>The government's mix of inaction and dithering may have left its budget intact, but sadly it has also left parents very confused. It sent a bad message about its confidence in these recommendations of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. What were parents supposed to think? Were they supposed to think that the budget bottom line was more important than protecting our children? Or perhaps they were supposed to think that the government advice was wrong, that the experts do not know what they are talking about—that the information being sent out to the community was wrong.</para><para>Children who survive a pneumococcal infection can be left with brain problems, blindness, deafness, spinal problems and other side effects. Lately it seems that we have managed to cajole those opposite into agreeing with us and funding this vaccine—next year. Whilst it is a role we accept, it ought not to have been the case. This is yet another area where a responsible and caring government would have had acted of its own volition. It is another sad indictment—just like the unacceptable decline in bulk-billing—of the approach of those on the benches opposite; those who would have chosen to do nothing but for the persistence of families and of members of the opposition.</para><para>The health of our citizens is not an optional extra for governments to consider. The provision of basic health services is a `must supply' item, but it seems that only a change of government will deliver this for all Australians. Space in the budget must be found for all vaccines recommended for the protection of our children. In this instance there is a simple solution: the redirection of expenditure allocated under the government's flawed programs, hastily drawn up to deal with the nation's health crisis. This government does nothing in health delivery unless it is dragged into it, kicking and screaming. And more often than not it is a piecemeal policy, aimed at patching up a health system it has allowed to deteriorate on its watch.</para><para>I will now turn to one example of how a health issue can engulf a society. When it comes to the fear which our communities quite naturally have about infectious diseases, it is understandable that citizens become concerned and sometimes even a little irrational. This is especially the case with those diseases which can have fatal consequences. Unfortunately we have just experienced this in northern Tasmania over the past few weeks. Despite the pleas of the state's senior medical officers and other key public servants, the community have become overcautious. You cannot blame them; they are very scared. They have noted first-hand within their own community the speed at which a disease can take hold in an individual case. It is a tragedy when a vibrant young life is taken within days of contracting an infection like meningococcal. Sadly, two Tasmanians—a 16-year-old from Burnie in the electorate of Braddon and a Hobart man in his sixties—have lost their lives to the disease in the past three weeks. There have been 15 reported Tasmanian cases of infection this year. </para><para>I want to refer specifically to one town in my electorate: Scottsdale—a lovely town and a lovely community. They have done it pretty tough over the past few weeks as a result of three of their citizens contracting the illness. The leadership within the community—particularly that displayed by the principal of Scottsdale High School, Bev Hanlon—in addressing the situation has been outstanding. Wise counsel has also been forthcoming from state departmental officers. Nonetheless, there has been significant community fallout. Last weekend a major junior netball carnival planned for the town was cancelled because visitors were unable to field teams due to parents' concern. Whilst there have been clear statements that the disease could not be spread by contact during sporting events, it was nonetheless apparent that parents were not prepared to take that risk. As I mentioned, this is understandable.</para><para>As always, there are lessons which can be learned from this. From the experience we have had, meningococcal is a disease which occurs randomly. In Tasmania, as I mentioned, there have only been 15 cases this year. It is a little bit better than some of our previous years. Most cases appear to have no connection with each other, although the last seven all occurred within one week of each other. However, as we have sadly learned once again, the disease can and does have almost immediate fatal consequences.</para><para>In the case of the meningococcal vaccination, government at both state and federal level has responded, making vaccines more readily available to `at risk' age groupings. But even here we still have to address the issues of greater universality and further education about the risks of disease. The ongoing experience with meningococcal is one of which we must all take heed. It is one from which we should learn and, accordingly, take the advice of experts.</para><para>We on this side of the House have listened to both the community and the experts. We have listened to them about vaccinations. We have observed what has happened with other diseases, like pneumococcal. As in so many other areas of importance to this nation, it is Labor that is doing the thinking, it is Labor that is responding to the concerns of the Australian people and it is Labor which is driving the agenda on health, particularly in protecting our children against disease. It is time for this government, having lost any connectivity it ever had with the Australian people, having lost any sense of the right balance between budget savings and our children's health, to be moved aside for a government that has both.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>32577</page.no><name role="metadata">Worth, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Ms WORTH</name><name.id>8V5</name.id><electorate>Adelaide</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I agree with the Minister for Health and Ageing in expressing my sorrow at the death of any child. I also agree with him that the Australian government wants the very best for every person in this country and, in particular, for our children. Having said that, I think that this is one of the lowest performances I have seen in this House—and I have been here for more than 11 years now—because of the defaming of our Chief Medical Officer. The minister can stand up here and defend himself, but for somebody who wants to be the minister for health to stand on the opposition side of this chamber and defame the Chief Medical Officer—who is a good man, a capable man and a strong man and who is not in a position to defend himself—is very low. We have talked earlier today about who should be apologising to whom. I invite the shadow minister to come back into this chamber when I finish speaking and fully apologise to Professor John Horvath. </para></talk.start><para>We know of course that the Howard government are delivering a world-class health system when the opposition's only attack point against the government is on the issue of immunisation—a health issue on which the opposition has a very shameful record. In 1996, when we came to government, the immunisation rate amongst Australian children was 53 per cent, and that was well below that of China, Algeria and Vietnam. It was in fact lower than the rate in some of the Indigenous communities of our own country, and it was a national disgrace which Michael Wooldridge, my former colleague, did a lot to address. It was this government that took prompt and substantive action to address this appalling threat to the health of the nation's children—not just one, not just a few, but nearly 50 per cent of them. The Howard government launched the Immunise Australia Program in 1997, and as a result of our investment in this plan we now have immunisation coverage rates of over 90 per cent in children at 12 months of age.</para><para>Not only was the record of the opposition on immunisation coverage rates poor but so too was their record on immunisation funding, which makes today's feeble attack by the opposition even more laughable. In 1996 the Australian government expenditure on vaccines was just $13 million a year; today it is $143 million a year—that is an 11-fold increase on Labor's expenditure. The two new multimillion-dollar pneumococcal vaccination programs will result in vaccine expenses for this financial year being more than $250 million.</para><para>Today's low tactics by the opposition on immunisation are just another example of their pathetic attempt to play politics with health policy. Labor are not a party who have a genuine interest in immunisation. They just think it is a good issue on which to frighten Australian parents. Their rush to play politics on the pneumococcal vaccine saw them do a potential quick deal with a pharmaceutical company with an open cheque book, but, as we have already heard from the minister, not only were there issues of price; there were also issues of supply.</para><para>Not only in this place and in these types of debates but in letters sent out to women of childbearing age across Australia claims were made on the supposed number of children likely to die or become infected across Australia. There was no mention of the fact that we were already funding and immunising the higher risk groups: all children under two years of age living in Central Australia; all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children under two years of age; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Central Australia and any region likely to have a similar high incidence of pneumococcal infection in children under five years of age; and all children under five years of age with a whole range of medical risk factors and diseases where there may have been some renal failure or relapsing or persistent infections—all infants, for instance, born at less than 28 weeks gestation. None of this, of course, have we heard from the shadow minister.</para><para>On one side of the chamber we have a government with a proud record of sound economic management, and on the other we have an opposition whose shocking financial management left the Australian nation with a $96 billion government debt, high inflation, high interest rates and high unemployment. I make this point because we do not have the capacity to double the expenditure on health—which is exactly what we have done in the time that we have been in government—if we cannot manage the economy and manage the country. And if their recent negotiations on vaccine prices are any indication of what they will do in the future, things certainly have not changed in the Australian Labor Party. </para><para>It should be of concern to the mums and dads of Australia that the opposition think it is okay to play politics with immunisation issues, that they cannot even do a decent deal on vaccine funding and that they cannot ensure that there is in fact a proper supply of product. But it should be of greater concern to all Australians that for political expediency the opposition want to rush in to fund more vaccines when there are still some very valid questions to be asked about their safety. Australia's Chief Medical Officer—whom I admire and respect, unlike the opposition—has advised the government that there are concerns that the chickenpox vaccination for children might lead to higher rates of chickenpox and shingles for adults in future years. This is a far more serious disease in adults than in children—very dangerous, in fact, for the elderly—and can in some cases cause blindness. As a responsible minister as part of a responsible government, the Minister for Health and Ageing has sought further advice from the experts before making any further decisions. This is what good government is all about: making sure that the right decisions are made for the people of this country and not just rushing out, coming up with a line and saying, `That's policy.'</para><para>But then the Latham Labor opposition is getting quite a track record for making decisions on the run without knowing or caring about all the facts or all the consequences. The initial opposition to the US FTA, the troops withdrawal from Iraq—`home by Christmas', although somebody said they did not know which Christmas—and last week's evergreening issue are just a few examples of the erratic nature of policy development by those who would seek to govern this country. They have had a change of heart over funding to the PBS and costs and charges to consumers. Having defended their own stand on that for over two years, all of a sudden, because they need to make some books add up in other areas of policy, there has been a change there.</para><para>I have sat and listened to question time over the last couple of days and I have been reminding myself that in 1997-98 I had responsibility for the implementation of the therapeutic group premium measures that were about reducing the cost of the PBS by placing pressure on companies to reduce the price of their medications to a benchmark price. This was a very good policy and it delivered great savings to the Australian taxpayers. But guess what? At the time, who came out, without being briefed or asking for advice, and opposed it? It was the Labor opposition. They condemned it, whether through ignorance or, more likely, through intended deception. They went public, claiming that just because these drugs were going to be cheaper they would be inferior and less safe. It is now ironic that the opposition are arguing for cheaper drugs. How quickly they forget their previous lines of public deception! But now, of course, cheaper drugs will no longer be inferior.</para><para>Malcolm Farr summed up some of this deception very well indeed on the ABC's <inline font-style="italic">Insiders</inline> program on Sunday when he described Labor's stance on the PBS as `one of the greatest porkies of the Latham campaign'. As Malcolm Farr quite rightly went on to point out, consumers will pay the same amount for their medicines regardless of what they cost to produce, because their cost is subsidised and the price to consumers is fixed. That is what the PBS is about. I could go on about how Labor has neglected this country. We were the ones that had to bring in the safety net whereby one million Australians will receive higher Medicare rebates—the sicker people in this country that require more medical attention and rely more on Medicare. We do not need, as the Treasurer has said today, the failed mayor of Liverpool. I add that we do not need a shadow Labor health minister who is more interested in abuse and political game playing than the good health care for the people of this country. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

But the unintended consequences, as he calls them, just keep popping up. It is now nine months since the Independents in the Senate caved in and gave us the Howard government's extremely unfair universities package.</para></talk.start><para>This time we are tidying up some more mistakes, which include: allowing universities to continue to offer summer schools on a full fee basis for HECS students seeking to catch up on units or accelerate their degrees; clarifying the status of students enrolled at one institution but taking subjects at another; clarifying the access of Open Learning Australia students to loans under FEE-HELP; defining which students have access to loans to study overseas under OS-HELP, such as those studying at an overseas campus of an Australian university; and a number of other technical and definitional issues. It certainly looks like the minister was rushing things through last year. </para><para>The significant policy issue that is included in this bill is the addition of Melbourne University Private as a university eligible to receive public funding. It is proposed in this bill that Melbourne University Private be listed on what is called `table B', which will give it access to research funding and FEE-HELP loans for its full fee-paying students. The addition of Melbourne University Private raises a number of important policy questions which need resolution and, unfortunately, have yet to be addressed by the minister. I hope the minister in his summing-up on this bill provides some explanation at least of this change that he is proposing.</para><para>We certainly did not see in either the minister's second reading speech or in the explanatory memorandum to the bill any case made for the inclusion of Melbourne University Private as a table B provider. Adding a higher education provider to either the Higher Education Support Act or the Higher Education Funding Act is in fact quite a rare occurrence. Providing public funding to higher education providers should not be undertaken lightly, and I must say that in this case the minister has taken the parliament for granted by failing to provide any explanation whatsoever of the rationale for his proposal. It is particularly strange given that the unprecedented powers granted to the minister under section 16-25 of the act mean that he could have added them without amending the act and without, therefore, giving them access to these funds in perpetuity.  </para><para>The inclusion of Melbourne University Private as a listed provider would be exceptional. Every one of the 42 institutions currently listed on table A or table B of the legislation is established under its own act in the Commonwealth, state or territory parliaments. These acts provide the authority to confer degrees in perpetuity. This includes the three bodies listed on table B, and at the moment they are: Bond University, University of Notre Dame and the Melbourne College of Divinity. They were established under acts of the Queensland parliament in 1987, the Western Australian parliament in 1989 and the Victorian parliament in 1910 respectively. By contrast, Melbourne University Private is not established under its own act; in fact, it has been accredited for five years only by the Victorian government, pointing to a number of reservations that that government has about granting this power in perpetuity. This raises the question of why the Commonwealth should provide indefinite access to public funding when the Victorian government has been unwilling to entrench its status as a higher education provider.</para><para>The minister certainly does need to explain what implications the inclusion of Melbourne University Private has for the MCEETYA protocols, which set out the characteristics of higher education providers. These protocols, the MCEETYA protocols as they are known, are a significant outcome of the cooperation between the states following the fiasco that was Greenwich University on Norfolk Island. I am sure the previous minister for education remembers that extremely well. He was in charge at the time of that fiasco. The MCEETYA protocols are essential to defending the domestic and international reputation of Australia's higher education sector, so we should be extremely careful not to undermine them. They set out the defining characteristics of our higher education sector and guard the excellent reputation that our universities have.</para><para>The absence of Melbourne University Private's research profile has been a particular sticking point for the Victorian government in its consideration of Melbourne University Private's accreditation. This raises the further question of why we are considering a bill that will spread finite public research funding more thinly to an institution that has no demonstrated research capacity. I also note that the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee very recently rejected Melbourne University Private's application for membership. This raises further concerns that demand an explanation by this minister. He has created an act that continues to require further amendments, and the bill that we are currently debating actually contains very serious policy issues. We are certainly yet to hear his answers to these very serious questions. If we do not get some serious answers from the minister in his response to this debate, we will certainly be seeking to have this issue debated further in the Senate.</para><para>We do not generally get a lot of serious efforts by this minister, other than those necessary for political expediency, to explain what he is up to. There have been very few times that the minister has gone on radio, let alone on television, to describe, defend or advocate a policy that he has put in place. But there was quite an extraordinary exception very recently on ABC radio in Melbourne. This interview followed some revelations published in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper from a piece of research by Professor Bruce Chapman, who is said to be the architect of HECS. The journalist Jon Faine on the ABC asked the minister whether he agreed with Professor Chapman that the government's higher education changes favoured the rich and meant that `unless you have got rich and generous parents you are in trouble'. The minister, in quite an extraordinary admission, said: </para><quote><para>Well in fact Professor Chapman is right ...</para></quote><para>The minister clearly acknowledged that Professor Chapman was right, that unless you were from a rich and generous family the likelihood of being able to afford a full fee paying place was very low. The minister went on, and I think this is also quite extraordinary, to tell us how many courses were going to cost over $100,000. The interview continued:</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Nelson</inline>: ... we have got about 16 of those courses that have fees of around $100,000 or more, needless to say veterinary science, dentistry and so on.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Faine</inline>: Medicine?</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Nelson</inline>: Well Medicine not yet, but that's coming in, and we know that Notre Dame will be about $125,000 and we have heard that Melbourne will be about $200,000.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Faine</inline>: Now there is no way that an ordinary Australian family can afford to put a kid through one of those courses is there?</para></quote><para>The minister, in an extraordinary outburst of honesty, said:</para><quote><para>Well in fact you are right ...</para></quote><para>The minister knows full well that an ordinary Australian family will not be able to put one of their kids through a course that costs $100,000, let alone $200,000. The interview went on:</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Faine</inline>: Well let's look at some of the fundamental principles Dr Nelson. Did you come from a rich family?</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Nelson</inline>: Arr, no I certainly didn't.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Faine</inline>: You got a medical degree?</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Nelson</inline>: Yes, I did medicine at a time when there was no HECS, there were no full fee paying places for Australians, there was nothing like that.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Faine</inline>: Well don't you think it's fair that anyone from any family no matter what their capacity to pay but just on their sheer ability should have an equal chance?</para></quote><para>The minister, in another extraordinary outburst of honesty, said:</para><quote><para>Well the situation in theory, you are right.</para></quote><para>You wonder which minister was talking, because it was certainly not the minister who has put in place these outrageous changes to higher education that are going to lead to more and more students having to pay $100,000—or, in the case of medicine, $210,000—for a degree. We have a minister for education who has a medical degree, who paid absolutely nothing for it, and who is now saying that he will be responsible for overseeing the introduction for the first time ever of medical degrees that will cost $210,000 at Melbourne university. Strangely enough, a transcript of this interview has yet to appear on the minister's web site. We have been watching for it, wondering when he will put out these extraordinary revelations—such as that he thinks children in poorer families will not be able to pay these fees and that buying a place is not fair. I find this exchange between the minister and the interviewer quite extraordinary. The minister had a discussion about why he was introducing full fee paying places. The interview continued:</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Faine</inline>: And someone else ... can just write out a cheque ...</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Nelson</inline>: Exactly!</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Faine</inline>: ... because Daddy has got the money in the bank ... </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Nelson</inline>: Exactly!</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Faine</inline>: ... buys that place and that is not fair.</para></quote><para>The minister, once again in an outburst of extraordinary honesty, said:</para><quote><para>You are absolutely right Jon.</para></quote><para>I think the minister just likes to be agreeable. I think that must be it. He must just want to make sure that he is having an agreeable conversation with the interviewer. One thing is for sure: the policy that he has introduced and is seeking to see implemented in Australian universities will be the one that makes students pay $100,000 at the moment for, on his own reckoning, 16 different courses at Australian universities and over $200,000 if this government is re-elected. That is how much it will cost to do medicine at Melbourne university next year. I want to make it very plain that Labor will be abolishing these full fee paying degrees. Unlike the Prime Minister, we actually mean it. Just yesterday I asked the Prime Minister why he had broken his 1999 election promise regarding university fees. He said in the parliament on 14 October 1999:</para><quote><para>There will be no $100,000 university fees under this government.</para></quote><para>He went on to repeat the promise the next day on radio. He could not have been more clear than he was when he said:</para><quote><para>... I can guarantee we're not going to have $100,000 university degree courses.</para></quote><para>Yesterday the Prime Minister bluffed and blustered. Forty-three eminent Australians have made the claim that we have a real problem with truth in government with this Prime Minister. Yesterday was another example of how we do not have any truth in government when it comes to education policy and this Prime Minister. As I said, the education minister confirmed just last week in his infamous radio interview that there are 16 courses that already cost more than $100,000. That will go even higher if the Howard government is re-elected.</para><para>If Labor is elected at the forthcoming election no Australian undergraduate will face those sorts of fees. Labor does not believe that it is right that Australians with lower marks can buy their way into a university place, ahead of students who are better qualified, by paying fees of up to $100,000 or even more. We do not think that it is right for students to be able to jump the queue and buy a place at university. Imagine what it would be like if your son or daughter just missed out on a HECS place at university because their marks were not quite up to it and a student with even lower marks was able to buy a place costing $100,000 just because they had the money and you did not. That is not the way that Labor thinks we should decide who gets a university place. Labor's approach will be to significantly increase the number of university places that are fully funded so that students who want to go to university will in fact be able to.</para><para>What I say to anybody listening today, and what we will be saying over and over again before the election, is that the Howard government has to be stopped and these university changes have to be stopped before it is too late. If this government is re-elected, we will see a boom in university degrees which only the wealthy can afford. That is what this government has in mind. That is exactly what it wants to do. There is only one way that it will be stopped. We tried very hard to stop the legislation last year; the Independent senators decided to vote for it. The only way that this will be stopped now is if a Latham Labor government is elected and we make sure that our universities are properly funded. I move the second reading amendment circulated in my name:</para><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: </para><para>(1)	increasing the debt burden on Australian students by nearly doubling the average HECS fee since 1996, resulting in student debt increasing from less than $4 billion to more than $10 billion;</para><para>(2)	allowing Australians with lower marks to buy an undergraduate university place ahead of better qualified students by paying full fees of up to $100,000 or more;</para><para>(3)	cutting $5 billion in public investment from Australian universities;</para><para>(4)	allowing student to teaching staff ratios to blow out by more than a third;</para><para>(5)	failing to provide enough HECS places in Australian universities, resulting in around 20,000 qualified Australians being turned away every year; and</para><para>(6)	allowing universities to increase HECS by a further 25 per cent from next year and increasing the number of full fee paying undergraduate Australian students to more than a third”.</para><para>The amendment condemns the Howard government's record on higher education. First and foremost, I want to highlight the things that are in the second reading amendment. Every student in Australia who has gone to university since this government was elected knows what it has meant for their HECS debt. The HECS debt for Australian university students has almost doubled, on average, since 1996. There has been a massive blow-out in student debt. Just look at the numbers: the debt has increased from less than $4 billion when this government was elected to more than $10 billion today. That is the reality for Australian students that comes from this government being in power for the last eight years.</para><para>Labor wants to see an end to the escalating HECS debt, but the Howard government does not. The Howard government's approach is to allow universities to increase their HECS fees by another 25 per cent. We have seen HECS fees almost double already, and the government wants to send them up by another 25 per cent. A basic science degree, say, at the University of Sydney or the University of Melbourne—which have decided to put their fees up by the full 25 per cent—will cost about $20,000. An Australian student getting a basic three-year science degree will have a debt of $20,000. It will be because of the Howard government that those young people will be starting their working lives with such a massive level of debt.</para><para>A Latham Labor government will do something about this as well. We intend to reverse this decision. It will be one of the first things that we do to make sure that students in this country are not saddled with massive levels of debt. The minister, when he was talking about this legislation when it was originally introduced, said, `We are going to have this brave new world where university fees will vary markedly across the country.' In fact, that is not the case at all. The universities are so desperate for funding that the vast majority of them have decided to put their fees up by the full 25 per cent. In the city of Brisbane, where my colleague at the table, the member for Rankin, comes from, each of the universities has decided to put its fees up by the full 25 per cent. In Adelaide all of the universities have decided to put their fees up by the full 25 per cent. And so it goes on around the country. Labor will reverse that decision because we do not want to see our students paying more and more to get a basic tertiary education.</para><para>The other thing this government has failed to do is to create enough university places. According to the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, there are about 20,000 students who are qualified and want to go to university but who cannot get a place at any Australian university because there are just not enough HECS funded places. You can just see it, can't you? The government does not create enough HECS funded places and it allows the universities to increase the number of full fee paying places, effectively forcing those students who cannot get into university to pay full fees. </para><para>Labor will do what has never been done in this country before. We will make sure that students who want to go to university and who are qualified will be able to get there. We will create an extra 20,000 fully funded places in our universities to make sure that if students are qualified and want to go on with their education they will be able to do so. But this government are not on about that. They are not on about making sure that students' aspirations are met. What they want to do is basically to force students into full fee paying places because there just are not enough HECS funded places.</para><para>You might wonder how the universities are coping as a result of this government. Australian universities have had about $5 billion cut from their funding as a result of the Howard government. So is it any wonder that most universities have decided that the only way they can go is to put up their fees by the full 25 per cent? The responsibility for this fee rise lies entirely at the door of the Howard government, because of these funding cuts. It is because of these funding cuts that we are seeing the burden of funding our universities shifting more and more onto Australian students.</para><para>And what are the implications of students having to increase their debts in this way? What are the implications of these massive levels of HECS debt for young people who are in their 20s and are starting out in their new jobs, in their new careers? We are already seeing evidence that young graduates are delaying having a family and delaying buying a home because of the extraordinary increases in HECS debt. That is only going to get worse if this government is re-elected. That is why, for the young people of Australia who are in their 20s and are doing these very important things—starting their families, trying to buy a home—it is going to be that much harder for them if John Howard has his way and the government has the universities putting their fees up by another massive 25 per cent.</para><para>To the young people of Australia in particular, I say: you have a very real choice at the coming election. You have a choice between a Latham Labor government and the Howard government, which wants to increase the level of your HECS debt by another 25 per cent to make it harder for you to buy a home and to start a family. If the Howard government is re-elected, there will not be enough university places for those students who are qualified and want to continue their education. Most importantly, if the Howard government is re-elected, the existence of degrees that cost $100,000 or $200,000 will become even more likely. The choice is there for Australians, especially for young Australians and their parents.</para><para>A Latham Labor government will have a very different outlook if we win the coming election. We will not allow universities to increase their HECS fees by a further 25 per cent. We will create 20,000 extra university places to make sure that students can get into university and continue their education, and we will abolish full fee paying places for Australian undergraduates at our universities.</para><para>We will also make sure that our universities are properly funded. One of the things that this government has done, in addition to massively cutting the funding going to universities, is not properly index the universities' grants. In practice, that means that the universities get further behind each year. Instead of the grants from Canberra keeping up with costs, over the last eight years the universities have continued to go backwards, as their costs have increased and the grants from the Howard government have not kept up with the costs of running a university. </para><para>Labor have announced that we will properly index university funding. This has been the No. 1 demand from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. There is only one major political party that is guaranteeing that universities will be funded properly into the future, and that is a Latham Labor government. If Mr Howard and the Howard government are re-elected, we know that they will have no intention of introducing indexation. They bought the Independents off with the promise that they would have a review into indexation, but when do you think that is? Not until next year.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr Emerson</name></talker><para>—After the election.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>PG6</name.id><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name></talker><para>—Yes, after the election. They certainly have not made any commitment to proper indexation. I have not seen any allocation of funding for the universities to deliver proper indexation. It is only Labor that has made the financial decision to make sure that our universities are properly funded.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So at the coming election we have a very real choice between a Latham Labor government and the Howard government, which has run our universities down, has massively increased costs to students and has allowed some wealthy students to buy their way into university, to jump the queue and to take a place at university that is not available to students from families that are not so well off. So there is a very real choice, and I say to the Australian people: as you cast your vote in the forthcoming election, look very hard at the very real differences that exist between the two major political parties.</para><para>Labor takes the view that we need a substantial increase in public funding for our universities. It is desperately needed. Our universities are so important not only in providing opportunities to students to further their education; they are also good for the country and the economy. The more people that we have with a higher standard of education, the higher our economic growth will be. So Labor's policy is good for the country and it is certainly good for students and their families. I say to the Australian people: if Labor is successful at the coming election, you will get an enormous amount of support from Labor to make sure that your young people get the chance to have an affordable education.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Is the amendment seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr Emerson</name></talker><para>—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>32588</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHNSON</name><name.id>00AMX</name.id><electorate>Ryan</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to speak on the <inline ref="R2127">Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2004</inline> and to lend my full personal support for it and also my full support for it as the federal member for Ryan. I have in my electorate the University of Queensland, one of this country's finest institutions for young people to receive an education. They become empowered through the skills and qualifications that they receive at the university's various campuses, qualifications that will take them on in their lives to better circumstances and better opportunities, not only in this country but throughout the world.</para></talk.start><para>It was very interesting to listen to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for education speak about the government's vision for education in this country. Of course, all Australians know that education is one of the top priorities of the Howard government. Indeed, fortuitously, we have in the Minister for Education, Science and Training someone who, of any member of parliament, would certainly appreciate fully the importance of education. As the minister said, he did not come from a family of high economic status. Therefore, he would be the best placed in this parliament to appreciate the importance and power of education. </para><para>The Howard government in 2002 conducted a review of Australia's higher education system. As we all know, that review has been very widely publicised. The review began with the <inline font-style="italic">Higher education at the crossroads </inline>paper in April 2002, which really tried to set out and explain the challenges facing this country in the education sector. This bill is part of an ongoing legislation program to continue to progress and advance education reform in this country. Coinciding with the release of that paper the minister established a reference group that comprised representatives from across the higher education sector, business and the community. I want to totally repudiate the shadow minister's comment that the education minister failed to consult and engage with the public or discuss these important reforms in education. That is precisely what he did not do. He did not, as the shadow minister suggested, do this on his own. He in fact consulted very widely and fully. I think that is why the government's outcomes have been positive. Indeed, that is why the Independent senators in the Senate have passed these bills. We all know the difficulty that the government has in receiving support in the other chamber, so when we do receive support there must be something to it. There must in fact be merit in the government's legislation for Independent senators to pass the government's bills.</para><para>This bill seeks to introduce a number of policy initiatives. A lot of the elements are of a technical or minor nature. There are a couple of significant ones that I want to focus on in particular in this address, such as OS-HELP, which was announced under Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future. This assists eligible undergraduate students in Commonwealth supported places to study abroad. As a student I studied abroad and it is a wonderful experience. I want to comment on that in a moment.</para><para>The bill makes amendments to the HESA to further smooth the implementation of the higher education reforms in 2004. These amendments allow students more time to submit their requests for Commonwealth assistance by providing that such requests are not required until the census date. Also, they will allow students to continue to undertake studies on a cross-institutional basis as Commonwealth supported students. This flexibility is going to be very important and helpful. Also, the amendments extend and clarify entitlements to the OS-HELP assistance provisions, as I have just touched on, and explicitly provide that an amount of advance payment that is in excess of what becomes payable is a debt to the Commonwealth.</para><para>The bill also amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to provide for transitional arrangements for the repayment of special purpose grants under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. The other important point that I would like to highlight is that the bill amends the Australian Research Council Act 2001 to update annual funding caps to reflect revised forward estimates. On a related point, the University of Queensland in my electorate is one of the leading universities for receiving Australian Research Council grants. Indeed, I am delighted that it has been awarded three of the new ARC centres.</para><para>Let me make a couple of other points on matters that were touched on by the shadow minister. In relation to Melbourne University Private, every other Australian university is listed in either table A or table B of the HESA, including private universities. Melbourne University Private remains unlisted. It is important that it also gets onto the list. Members of its academic staff are unable to apply for or hold ARC grants and MUP cannot access funding under the research training scheme or the institutional grants scheme, so it does make a significant difference in that respect. Being listed on table B will also mean that MUP students may access FEE-HELP loans. MUP may also apply to the Commonwealth for places in areas of national priority on the same basis as other private universities. </para><para>There is also an important provision about fee-paying summer schools. This amendment will allow higher education providers to continue to operate their full-fee summer schools as they do now. Universities currently offer units of study in summer semesters on a fee-paying basis to allow students to fast-track their courses or make up for a failed unit of study. This amendment will enable universities to continue to do this. The bill will also amend the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to enable students who are enrolled in units of study on a cross-institutional basis to be Commonwealth supported and have access to HECS-HELP and FEE-HELP assistance for those units. So these cross-institutional studies do give students a lot of flexibility and choice. It also helps the institutions concerned to take up more opportunities to specialise in their areas of expertise and strength.</para><para>As I said, I want to focus in particular on the OS-HELP scheme that was announced under Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future. This assists eligible undergraduate students in Commonwealth supported places to study abroad for one or two study periods of their degree program. It will offer student loans of up to $5,000 for every six-month period to finance their overseas study. OS-HELP will assist students with travel and living expenses while overseas as the majority of students who take formal exchange programs are exempt from tuition fees.</para><para>When I was a young Australian at university I had the opportunity of studying overseas in the UK and I certainly would have appreciated such strong support as that offered in this provision. I was privileged to receive a couple of scholarships to study in the UK and I want to encourage all the students who may consider studying abroad—whether it is in the US, the UK, Europe, the Americas or, indeed, even in Asia—to take up the opportunity because it will certainly enlighten them and open their eyes to a whole new way of living, studying and interacting with another culture and other peoples. This provision in the amendment bill plays a strong part in encouraging students to be as advantageously placed as they can be.</para><para>The amendments in the bill will allow students who have undertaken an equivalent full-time year of study that comprises study prior to 2005 to be eligible for OS-HELP. This will ensure that all Commonwealth supported students—in particular, students who may have previously been in receipt of a Commonwealth merit based equity scholarship—will be eligible to apply. It will also allow students to receive OS-HELP for study undertaken at an overseas campus of an Australian higher education provider, as well as at an overseas institution. So, again, it gives students choice. We have seen a development in Australia where local universities have a very strong partnership with universities overseas and have also established campuses in other countries. Singapore comes to mind as one country with which universities in Australia very clearly have a strong relationship, whether that is through links with the National University of Singapore or by having a campus in Singapore, as the University of Queensland does.</para><para>Another provision in this amendment bill refers to the definition of undergraduate and postgraduate courses of study. The amendment bill will define what undergraduate and postgraduate courses of study actually are. This is important because it ensures that there is no ambiguity or confusion, for either education providers or students, about the application of the 20 per cent loan fee for FEE-HELP, which applies only to undergraduate courses of study. This is a very important piece of legislation by the government. It continues to reflect the government's ongoing thinking about how to address some of the issues facing education in this country, from the very big picture stuff to some of the smaller related issues, such as the definition of undergraduate and postgraduate courses. There are also very useful provisions, such as OS-HELP for study abroad. </para><para>The shadow spokesman, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, spoke very strongly in defence of the Labor record and about what the Latham Labor government might do if it were elected to run our country after the next election. I certainly hope that that does not prevail because, in the interests of this country's future, not only in education but across all policy areas, that would be a very backward step indeed. It is interesting that the deputy leader talked about providing 20,000 additional places in the university sector but fails to ever mention what the Latham government might do if it were elected.</para><para>In this chamber or in this parliament the opposition's position and policies in relation to TAFE are hardly spoken of. TAFEs, of course, are run by the state governments. It should be pointed out to the Australian people that it was, indeed, the Labor Party, when they were in government, that introduced HECS. I should say that again, because they seem to run away from that. They have no interest in very strongly promoting the fact that the very motive for the Labor Party, when they were in government, to introduce HECS was to enable more students to go to universities and to enable universities to try to provide a better quality of education delivery to students. That is exactly the motive behind the Howard government's reforms in education.</para><para>It is important for the Australian people to know the thinking and the rationale behind the Howard government's reforms in education, because at the heart of it is the strong desire to provide the young people of this country with greater choice in education, great quality of teaching and a greater number of courses. Of course, all Australians will know that this only comes about through the funding of those places. Unless the shadow spokesmen, the deputy leader, and the Labor Party are going to talk about increasing taxes very substantially to fund these 20,000 extra places then, for the life of me, I do not know how these 20,000 extra places are going to be provided for. Indeed, if we had an unlimited pot of money, why only 20,000? Why not 25,000, 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000 extra places? Because, at the end of the day, each place at a university or each place at a higher institution has a financial value on it, and it is the taxpayers of this country who have to pay. The biggest challenge for government is to strike a balance between providing the services for the people of this country and funding those services. Unless the Australian people wish to pay 40, 50 or 60 per cent taxes then the important thing is to strike the right balance.</para><para>It is also about the young people of Australia making a contribution to their education. It is about the young people of Australia saying, `This is an investment in my future. This is an investment in my ability and my opportunities to receive the best qualifications possible. For me to place a value on them, I will make a contribution.' Interestingly enough, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition failed to mention that not one single dollar has to be paid up front. That is a point that the opposition always seems to fail to mention; that only when you receive a certain income, when you are employed, do you have to start making a contribution back to the cost of your degree studies. </para><para>I think the taxpayers of Australia, certainly the taxpayers of my electorate in Ryan, would say it is entirely appropriate for people to make a contribution to their education. They are not being asked to pay 100 per cent of their university studies; they are being asked to make a contribution, firstly, so that they value their degree and, secondly, so that more young fellow Australians can take places at these universities. That is what extra funding from these fees will do. </para><para>John Hay, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland, which is located in St Lucia in the Ryan electorate, talks about the extra fees that will be charged; that is probably the only point that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition stated correctly—that the University of Queensland is taking up the opportunity of increasing its fees. The Vice-Chancellor says:</para><quote><para>Every single dollar will be invested back into the university. It is going to provide facilities, it is going to provide greater quality of teaching, and it is going to be something which enhances the status of the university. </para></quote><para>This is something that is going to be very well received. It is going to improve learning activities at the University of Queensland. The other important point that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition failed to mention is the number of scholarships that will be provided to students, especially those from low socioeconomic backgrounds. It is important for the full context of the matter to be stated. As usual when the Labor Party speaks, it never speaks fully in context; it never gives the full details; it selectively makes its point. </para><para>I am very pleased to speak in support of this amendment bill and I encourage all members to support it very strongly, because it is something that is in the best interests of this country. It will make a difference to the young people of this country. I commend it very strongly. I conclude by talking about the $100,000 and $200,000 degrees in medicine. As usual, the shadow spokesperson for education verballed the minister and no doubt took the minister's responses in the interview out of context. It is absolutely ludicrous for the shadow spokesman to suggest that there will be $100,000 or $200,000 degrees in medicine in this country. I think that is a reflection of the division the opposition is trying to promote. </para><para>In talking about private and public sector degrees, schools and universities, I do not think there is a place in this country for this sort of class division and for trying to put a wedge between those who go to private schools and those who go to public schools. What is important is the quality of the education. This is an investment in the future of young people. I think taxpayers are not asking too much when they ask for students to make a contribution to their education. I certainly know that the residents of Ryan, the hardworking men and women of the Ryan electorate, are very strongly sympathetic to the government's position and its policies. They do not want every student in this country to pay entirely for their degrees. Equally, they do not think it is too much to ask students to make an investment in their own future. I commend the bill to the House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>32592</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2127">Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2004</inline> is essentially technical in nature.

I do support very strongly the second reading amendment and will take this opportunity immediately to respond to claims just made by the member for Ryan that the Minister for Education, Science and Training was verballed by the opposition stating that there might be $200,000 university fees. I have a transcript of an interview by Jon Faine with the minister—I do not think there are too many Dr Brendan Nelsons around—on 4 August. The conversation goes something like this:  </para></talk.start><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Nelson</inline>: Well in fact we have got 784 courses in Australian unis which charge or offer full fee paying places to Australians, we have got about 16 of those courses that have fees of around $100,000 or more, needless to say veterinary science, dentistry and so on. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Faine</inline>: Medicine? </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Nelson</inline>: Well Medicine not yet, but that's coming in, and we know that Notre Dame will be about $125,000 and we have heard that Melbourne will be about $200,000. </para></quote><para>Goodness gracious me! That was said by the minister for education. Yet we have the member for Ryan saying that Labor verballed him. Did we verbal him and pressure him to say `and we have heard that Melbourne will be around $200,000'? That is from the minister's own mouth. Let's not have any of this defensive rhetoric on the part of members of the government saying that the minister never said it and that he was verballed by Labor. The fact is that he said it in an interview with Jon Faine in Melbourne on 4 August.</para><para>This particular piece of legislation does involve some minor backing off, in one respect only, in applying the government's mad ideology—that is, its prescriptive regulatory approach to workplace relations in universities. We have seen over the last 8½ years a deeply disturbing trend where the government has sought all around Australia to impose its ideology on Australia's institutions. That has occurred in respect of our universities with the government's insistence that Australian workplace agreements must be offered as part of its promotion of AWAs, which still—after 8½ years of vigorous advocacy and promotion by the Howard government—cover less than three per cent of the work force. Elsewhere we see the permeation of the government's ideology in our institutions in the Public Service. Labor released its public service policy just yesterday, where we would achieve a return to an independent Public Service—capable of giving fearless and frank advice—and away from the government's intimidation of the Public Service. Most recently, today and yesterday we saw the government's belittling of 43 eminent Australians who have effectively accused the government of behaving less than honestly in its conduct of public affairs, most especially in relation to the war in Iraq.</para><para>The permeation and promotion of the government's ideology have extended to charities, where they would get funding only if they agree not to criticise government policy. It has extended to construction companies, where they can bid for projects involving Commonwealth funding only if they agree to implement the government's anti-union agenda. We know, from the bitter experience of the last 8½ years, that the government's ideology in relation to universities is the ideology of the pre-Whitlam era, where privilege—not talent and hard work—determined whether a young Australian could get access to a university education.</para><para>The Prime Minister of this country yearns for the pre-Whitlam era. He yearns for the time when privilege, not talent, was the determinant of whether a young person would have decent opportunities in this country. Every day he is seeking to implement a policy to entrench privilege and to rip away opportunities for the sons and daughters of working men and women in this country who do not have the wealth and privilege to be able to access the sorts of opportunities that are available to the more wealthy and fortunate in our community. </para><para>We have been debating inside this parliament and outside, especially over the last 48 hours, the whole question of truth in government. We have seen 43 eminent Australians who were so concerned about this government's total disregard for the truth that they signed a statement—only to be belittled by the goons who have gone out onto the doorsteps, at the Prime Minister's behest, and belittled these 43 eminent Australians.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Gambaro</name></talker><para>—On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.

Obviously there are $100,000 university fees. No doubt we will hear from the Prime Minister that he has kept his promise, because there are not $100,000 fees; there are $144,000 university fees, and now the minister is admitting that there will be $200,000 university fees. I refer to the transcript of an interview that the Minister for Education, Science and Training had with Jon Faine on ABC Radio Melbourne.</para><para>This conversation followed a statement by the architect of the HECS arrangements, Professor Bruce Chapman, who told Monash University on 3 August that he estimated that one in 10 Australian students will be paying fees as high as $210,000 by 2008. He said, `Unless you've got rich and generous parents, you are in trouble.' Here is the architect of HECS condemning the Howard government for locking out young people in this country from a decent education, a university education, because they are not fortunate enough to be able to afford university fees of $100,000, $144,000, $200,000 and even $210,000. Someone must have slipped a bit of truth serum into the minister's cocktail that night. The minister had a refreshing dose of the truth when he was interviewed on 4 August by Jon Faine. Jon Faine said:</para><quote><para>The man responsible for introducing student loans says the way the system is evolving and where you are taking it is only going to help rich students, students from rich families, is he right?</para></quote><para>And Minister Nelson replied:</para><quote><para>Well in fact Professor Chapman is right ...</para></quote><para>The minister seems to be pretty proud of this. The minister went on to say:</para><quote><para>Well in fact we have got 784 courses in Australian unis which offer full fee paying places to Australians, we have got about 16 of those courses that have fees of around $100,000 or more, needless to say veterinary science, dentistry and so on.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Faine</inline>: Medicine?</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Nelson</inline>: Well Medicine not yet, but that's coming in, and we know that Notre Dame will be about $125,000 and we have heard that Melbourne will be about $200,000.</para></quote><para>Here is the minister obviously conceding that 16 courses have fees of around $100,000 or more. I go back to the Prime Minister's solemn promise in this parliament on 14 October 1999, when he said, `There will be no $100,000 university fees under this government.' This is from the man who said, before he became Prime Minister, `Truth is absolute, truth is supreme, truth is never disposable in national political life.' Give us a break. The Prime Minister has forgotten how to tell the truth. He and the truth have become complete strangers. In the radio interview—after they were talking about $200,000 university fees and $100,000 university fees—Jon Faine asked: </para><quote><para>Now there is no way that an ordinary Australian family can afford to put a kid through one of those courses is there?</para></quote><para>The minister replied:</para><quote><para>Well in fact you are right.</para></quote><para>Here is the minister admitting that there is no way that the sons and daughters of working Australians will be able to go to university under the policies that he has developed—in consultation and cooperation with the prime minister of this country—that are locking them out of a university education. It is unbelievable. Faine continued:</para><quote><para>Well let's look at some of the fundamental principles Dr Nelson.

Jon Faine was right, and here we have the minister admitting that, under his policies, fairness does not apply.</para><para>Talking about students with wealthy parents, Faine goes on to say:</para><quote><para>And someone else who can just write out a cheque ...</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Nelson</inline>: Exactly!</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Faine</inline>: ... because Daddy has got the money in the bank ...</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Nelson: Exactly!</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Faine</inline>: ... buys that place and that is not fair.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Nelson</inline>: You are absolutely right Jon.</para></quote><para>You are absolutely right, Jon, it is not fair, but it is just that the Howard government is doing it. In Jon Faine's words, the Howard government is allowing people, `because Daddy has got the money in the bank to buy a place' and the minister replies, `You are absolutely right, Jon.' From the Minister for Education, Science and Training we hear that it is not fair, but it is government policy. What has happened to a fair Australia, when the Minister for Education, Science and Training is boasting that his policy is not fair? What unbelievable arrogance! The minister says, `It is not fair, and that is our policy.' Every Australian knows it is not fair, and every Australian will make that judgment at the forthcoming election.</para><para>It is absolutely obscene that wealthy students in Australia can buy a place ahead of less-privileged students who achieve higher marks at school. They can get to the front of the queue by buying their place ahead of students from working-class families who study hard and who have talent. Young people from wealthy families can jump to the front of the queue because, as Jon Faine says, `Daddy has the money in the bank.' And Nelson says: `Exactly.' They buy that place—and that is not fair. You are absolutely right, Jon. But, of course, that is exactly what happens under this government's notion of a modern Australia. It is not a fair Australia; it is an unfair Australia.</para><para>Like many members of the Labor caucus, I am a child of the Whitlam era. I did not have the financial capacity to go to university. It was because of the Whitlam government that I was able to go to university, work hard to develop the bit of ability or capacity I might have had and get elected into this parliament to try and make a difference. And what a difference we will have to make. If we do not make this difference at the forthcoming election, we will have lost forever the notion of a fair Australia. When the Minister for Education, Science and Training boasts that his system is unfair, we have lost the notion of a fair Australia. The unbelievable arrogance! It is completely un-Australian. </para><para>It is just like Medicare. Labor constructed Medicare, firstly in the form of Medibank. Then, under the Fraser coalition government, there were seven different health policies in seven years, all of them involving the destruction of Medibank—which the coalition did destroy. They had seven different health policies in seven years. It then required Labor to come in and rebuild Medibank in the form of Medicare. This government has been trying to tear Medicare to pieces ever since because it hates the idea of a fair health system.</para><para>What is common between the health system and the education system under this government? It is the capacity to buy your way to the front of the queue. That is the absolute yardstick by which this government makes any decision. If you have the money, you can buy your way to the front of the queue for a GP's services and for a place at university, shutting out young people who have worked hard and who have talent. It is an absolute disgrace that we should have to deal with such unfair legislation in the Australian parliament when we need more young people from working-class backgrounds who have talent and ability and work hard to be able to get into university and not to be shut out of university by a Prime Minister who yearns for the white picket fence of the 1950s, when privilege, not talent, determined whether you got into university. That is his idea of Australia's future.</para><para>This election will determine the very character of Australia. This election will determine whether we return to the great Aussie notion of a fair go for all or whether we hurtle headlong back to the pre-Whitlam era—as we are headed—when privilege, not talent, determined whether young people got into university. The Australian people will have a very clear choice. It is not simply about the appalling judgment and deficiencies of this government when it comes to the notion of a fair go for all; it is about what Labor is proposing, in a fully-funded way, as an alternative. The fact is that HECS debts have almost doubled under this government. The government is allowing a further 25 per cent HECS fee increase. Universities that are cash-strapped because they have been starved of funds by this government are taking the opportunity to increase their HECS fees by that 25 per cent. Brisbane universities have all already increased their HECS fees by 25 per cent, as allowed by this government. A Latham Labor government will reverse—cancel—the 25 per cent HECS fee increases. There is a choice for the young people of Australia: face a 25 per cent HECS increase or the cancellation of that HECS increase by a Latham Labor government.</para><para>As my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for education has pointed out, Labor will create an extra 20,000 university places so that the sons and daughters of the working men and women of this country are not shut out of a university education by high fees and by the unfairness of the Howard government's policies. A Latham Labor government will abolish full fee paying places for Australian undergraduates, which will stop the queue-jumping that this government has orchestrated. This government has allowed wealthy young people, without having done the hard work and without having achieved the high marks, to buy their way to the front of the queue and shunt to the back of the queue and out of a university education people from a working-class background who have worked hard at school, who have got the marks and who are determined to get into university but have the door shut in their face by the Howard government. Of course, a Latham Labor government will properly index university funding so that the universities know they have a reliable source of funding and do not have to resort to these sorts of policies in the future. </para><para>It is very noteworthy that the coalition has refused to make this commitment to index the funding. There are the choices for the Australian people. They are the choices for the mothers and fathers in Australia who yearn for their children to be able to express and develop their talents at a university. The choice is this: under the Howard government, if you do not have the financial capacity to get into university then you will not get in but, under a Latham Labor government, if you do have the talent and have done the hard work to get in but you do not have the financial capacity to, you will still be able to get in—you will still be able to climb the ladder of opportunity. The choice is between whether we continue hurtling headlong down the road to an unfair Australia or whether we have a fair, decent and compassionate society, a fair country under a Latham Labor government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>32597</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARTLETT</name><name.id>0K6</name.id><electorate>Macquarie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have just heard a very colourful presentation from the member for Rankin, full of rhetoric about university funding but very short on substance and very short on facts. I point out to the member for Rankin that he does not have a monopoly on those from working class families who managed to find their way to university. Indeed, it was not the Whitlam reforms that made that possible. I was from an equally working class family and I was able to go to university because of the policies of the Menzies government that allowed students from poorer families to access university through a system of support.</para></talk.start><para>I also remind the member for Rankin that, despite his tirade against the HECS fee system, it was a Labor government in the mid-1980s that introduced a HECS system of funding for universities. So when we hear from the other side that the Labor Party somehow have a monopoly on concerns for the underprivileged and that they are the only ones concerned with providing opportunities for those from poorer, underprivileged working-class backgrounds, that is nonsense. The coalition has been committed to this from the 1950s and is still committed to providing opportunities for all to participate in the education system of our country.</para><para>The other point that I make in response to the member for Rankin is that the bleating we hear from the other side that the coalition's approach is somehow going to be providing opportunities for the dumb but rich to get to university is equally wrong. It is wrong for a number of reasons. The coalition is committed to funding a substantially increased number of fully funded university places over the next few years. Any fee paying places are in addition to those allocated HECS funded places. The nonsense that we have just heard from the member for Rankin that fee paying students will somehow be able to jump the queue is a total distortion and misrepresentation of the situation. The fact is that these places will be available only after the HECS funded places are made available and are filled and they will be available only to those within a very small pre-determined and announced tolerance of marks required to get into those courses. So, firstly, there is no queue jumping and, secondly, they will not be—in the derogatory terms of those opposite—the dumb but rich students; they will be students who only just miss out on a HECS funded place. </para><para>The point about the Labor Party's policy and the hypocrisy of the Labor Party's position on this that particularly disturbs me is that they would provide fully funded places for students from overseas who cannot access university but will not allow those same opportunities for Australian students. So if, for instance, to get into a university course in economics there might be a UAI of, say, 92, the Labor Party would say: `We'll allow students from Hong Kong, Singapore, Chicago and New York to come to Australia and to pay. They haven't gone through the Australian high school system. They can come to Australia. They can pay to go to university and they can access a full fee paying place in an Australian university.' It is okay for a student from Hong Kong. It is okay for a student from Singapore. It is okay for a student from New York or Chicago but, no, it is not okay for a student from Australia who has just missed out on a HECS funded place. It is okay for an overseas student, but not for an Australian student.</para><para>Let us be clear: the Australian Labor Party's policy with regard to accessing full fee paying places is to favour overseas students at the expense of Australian students—that is, to discriminate against Australian students so that they do not have access to the same opportunities that overseas students have. The point is that the Labor Party is totally hypocritical and inconsistent on this. The policy of allowing Australian students access to these places is more than fair and, if it is fair for overseas students—as the Labor Party would propose—then it is fair for Australian students. This government will substantially increase funding over the next few years for university places and will substantially increase the number of new HECS funded places available over the next few years. It is in addition to that, not in place of that, that these extra opportunities for accessing fully funded places will be made available. These reforms proposed by this government have been supported fully by the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee because they know that the reforms are necessary in order to allow Australian universities to escape the straightjacket of mediocrity, to go forward, to be internationally competitive and to provide quality education for our young people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>32598</page.no><name role="metadata">Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Dr NELSON</name><name.id>RW5</name.id><electorate>Bradfield</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Education, Science and Training</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank all of the members who spoke on the <inline ref="R2127">Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2004</inline>. Naturally, I do not agree with all of the comments that have been made, and I will comment on some of those in a moment. Firstly I would like to address a number of issues raised by the member for Jagajaga. She spoke specifically about the amendment in this bill that would include Melbourne University Private on table B of the Higher Education Support Act. </para></talk.start><para>The first issue raised about Melbourne University Private is the rationale for its inclusion in the legislation. Currently Melbourne University Private is the only Australian university not recognised in one of the tables in the Higher Education Support Act. Being listed on table B will provide Melbourne University Private with access to research funding, and that will mean also that Melbourne University Private students may access FEE-HELP loans. The amendment will provide MUP with the same access currently granted to other private universities. As I understand it, under the Australian Labor Party, should it win in the forthcoming election, loans to support private students, whether in public or private universities, will be abolished completely.</para><para>The member for Jagajaga also mentioned the structure of Melbourne University Private and the MCEETYA protocols. It is important to understand some of the history of this university. It was established in July 1998 under a ministerial order of the then minister for education in Victoria. The order gave the new institution the right to operate as a university over an initial establishment period of five years. At the end of that period, the university applied to the current minister, the Hon. Lynne Kosky, for continued approval to operate as a university. It made a case before an expert panel appointed by the minister that it did in fact satisfy the nationally agreed principles of the national protocols for higher education approval processes, as the member for Jagajaga has mentioned. These protocols were approved in 2000 by the joint Commonwealth-state Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. In July last year, on the basis of the expert panel's advice, Minister Kosky granted the university approval to continue to operate for a further five years under a new ministerial order. The ministerial order put Melbourne University Private firmly on the higher education landscape as the 10th university, and the first private university, to be established in the state of Victoria. I have no doubt that the Victorian minister for education considered very carefully the MCEETYA protocols in granting this new order. </para><para>The member for Jagajaga also mentioned research and what she described as the absence of a research profile at the institution. The Victorian government approved the operation of the university, subject to it making ongoing improvements in its research profile. It should be remembered that while Melbourne University Private remains unlisted members of its academic staff are unable to apply for—or, indeed, to hold—grants from the Australian Research Council. The university cannot access funding under the Research Training Scheme or the Institutional Grants Scheme. If the member for Jagajaga is concerned to further boost the institution's research profile, she should pass the legislation.</para><para>Finally, the member for Jagajaga also mentioned the Australian Vice Chancellors Committee and Melbourne University Private's application for membership. It is not my place to speak on behalf of the AVCC on this matter, but I can say that the AVCC wrote to me today indicating its support for the legislation in its entirety. I understand that the AVCC has also made its position on this clear to all members of the Senate. Amendments contained in this bill will enable universities to continue to operate their summer school programs as they do now. This is a very important issue for the sector.</para><para>A number of other issues were raised during the course of the debate. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> made the observation early this year that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition probably needs to get a new speech. I have heard it so many times now I could almost present it myself and at least do so with more interest and theatre. We heard from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Jajajaga—again—a well-worn record. We were told that the world is going to end because in the reforms to higher education the universities, for the first time, will be free—and are free now—to set their own HECS charges, from zero to a level no more than 25 per cent above what it currently is. That is a part of a $2.6 billion, five-year additional investment by this government in Australian universities.</para><para>This means, amongst many other things, that next year for the first time, as a result of these reforms alone, 3,000 students will go to a Victorian university without a single dollar of HECS to pay back once they are working. It also means that, for the first time, the universities' governing councils—which have also been reformed— must sit down and seriously think about the value of a university education to prospective students and the pricing as compared to other universities. And, of course, every last dollar of HECS will actually go to the university to benefit the education of the students who attend that university. </para><para>Overall, for every dollar that students pay—and they do not pay it as students; under HECS, they pay it back only when they are working and, under these reforms, when they are earning more than $35,000 a year this year and $36,000 next year—for every dollar that students contribute to their education as graduates through the tax system when they are working, the average taxpayer contributes $3. If you are a truck driver, a chippie, a tiler, a shop assistant, a retailer, a gas fitter, a welder or a clerk in the Australian parliament and you happen to be listening to this, you need to understand that three-quarters of the cost of university education is funded by you, the everyday Australian taxpayer.</para><para>The average, everyday Australian taxpayer knows that universities are very important to Australia's economic and social development and I think that in the vast majority of cases Australians do not resent making that investment. But HECS, when it was introduced in 1989—to the great credit of the Labor Party—recognised that people who actually go to university derive a benefit from it. Those who get a university education earn on average 50 per cent more throughout their lifetimes than those who have not been to university. They have 92 per cent employment within four months of graduation. Their lifetime unemployment rate is one-quarter that of a person who has not been to university. Average graduate starting salaries this year—that is, in the first year out—were 83 per cent of average weekly earnings.</para><para>The member for Jagajaga expressed outrage and condemnation because, if the university chose to increase HECS by the maximum 25 per cent, a three-year science degree would cost $20,000. If you almost drove your truck off the side of the road listening to that, what was not said to you as an average, everyday Australian taxpayer was that if there is no change at all—none whatsoever—today, for a three-year science degree, a student would pay back through the tax system, over a lifetime, $16,100. If it goes up 25 per cent, once the student has graduated and is working and earning more than $35,000 a year, they would pay back $20,400. So the world is apparently going to end because you pay back an extra $4,000 over a lifetime. For every dollar that is paid back, the taxpayer has already put in $3—and every single dollar of that HECS actually goes to the university to employ more staff, to have bigger lecture theatres, to offer more choices and to improve the quality of the higher education that is being offered. What Labor is proposing is to put more sardines into the same tin.</para><para>The issue of fee paying students is extremely important. In Australian universities there are currently 535,000 undergraduates—more than half a million. Of those, 11,000 are Australian citizens who are paying their own way through Australian universities. In fact, those 11,000 students last year paid $80 million in fees. They missed out on the HECS cut-off for the course of their choice but still had very high academic scores. The price they paid for missing out on the HECS cut-off is that they have forgone a public subsidy and they have to pay their own way. Those students are contributing, as I said, just over $80 million currently to Australian universities. They are students who would otherwise get a HECS place in another course in a university they do not want to be at, but instead have been offered a full fee paying place at the university they want to be at. </para><para>Take, for example, Sydney University. Sydney University law this year had a cut-off of 99.7 for HECS places. So if you got 99.6 and you wanted to study law at Sydney University, you would not have achieved a HECS place. But if you are an Australian the university, which welcomes several thousand foreign students who pay full fees, says: `You've got 99.6. We don't think you're dumb or stupid.' In fact, no human being should be described in those terms, in language that is often used by the Labor Party to describe and demean these Australians. The university says, `We will accept you into Sydney University law if you have a tertiary entrance score of 96.7 or above.' It is rather interesting that the HECS cut-off for law at the Australian National University, which is a world-class university, is 95. So, in other words, students are going to Sydney University and paying full fees to do a law degree at Sydney University—forgoing any public subsidy—when they could have easily acquired a HECS place at the ANU.</para><para>The Labor Party has a position that says that it welcomes the 136,000 foreign students. The ANU is a good example—it has 4,000 foreign students on campus. We welcome them. They are the basis of our economic, cultural and geopolitical relationships with the rest of the world. We welcome these international students. But what is the logic of saying to Australian citizens, `Americans, Thais, Indonesians, Chinese and people from Europe have the right to pay their own way in Australian universities but you don't if you come from Australia'? The Labor Party is proposing to ban Australians from paying full fees in their own universities.</para><para>In the debate, the member for Jagajaga said that the Labor Party would fund more places. I would like to know whether the Labor Party is going to fund as many places as are demanded in law. I have travelled the length and breadth of Australia, and I have yet to meet an Australian who has said, `Dr Nelson, please can you possibly do anything you can to train more lawyers?' If you are working as a tiler, a chippie, a brickie, a boilermaker or a shop assistant, just think about what the Labor Party is saying. The Labor Party is saying that it is going to roll back HECS changes, ban Australians from paying full fees in their own universities—these are extra places, above and beyond expanded HECS places—and you as an average Australian are going to have to pay more taxes so that people training to be lawyers, dentists, doctors and vets do not have to pay back an extra 25 per cent through the tax system over a lifetime.</para><para>There is all this hysteria about HECS. The average HECS debt in Australia today is $9,000. There are 1.89 million Australians who carry a HECS debt. Of those, 90 per cent owe less than $18,000; 80 per cent owe less than $14,000; in the entire country, there are 13,316 people who owe more than $30,000; there are 199 who owe more than $50,000; and we cannot find anybody who owes $60,000. Under the changes that have been brought in by this government, if you study medicine—and this government is expanding medical places by 1,436 over the next four years in total—the maximum possible HECS debt that you are going to leave university with is $48,000. That is paid back over a lifetime, interest free, and you pay it back only when you are earning more than $35,000 a year. Your average graduate starting salary is $47,000 and you will expect to earn somewhere between $6 million and $8 million.</para><para>And so far as the fee-paying medical students are concerned, these are students who missed out on the HECS place—they got 98½—so, instead of taking up a HECS place in science or in biomechanical engineering or something else, they should have the right to pay their own way. We have 1,600 foreigners who come and pay their own way; why shouldn't an Australian? If the government was cutting HECS places and saying to students, `Now you must go and pay your own way,' it would be outrageous. It would be despicable and unthinkable. But in fact the government is expanding HECS places by 37,000 over four years, which will support 50,000 extra students into the system, and saying, `And if you're academically smart enough and you want to pay your own way, you can. Oh, and by the way: for the very first time the Australian taxpayer is going to lend you the money.' We are going to lend these fee-paying students the money, and they do not have to actually pay it back until they are working. </para><para>On the misrepresentation by the member for Jagajaga, Professor Bruce Chapman must be seeking legal advice at the moment. The Labor Party wants to ban fee-paying Australians and ban the loans that support fee-paying students. Professor Chapman's argument is that the loan level, instead of $50,000, should be higher for these high demand courses. The Labor Party is proposing to roll back the HECS changes and to ban Australian citizens from paying fees in their own universities and to say to them, `If you want to pay fees in your own unis, go offshore and sell your Australian citizenship and come back as a foreigner.' Can someone explain to me the logic of that?</para><para>What that means in plain dollars is that over the next four years the universities will lose $840 million in HECS. That is going to be rolled back. It cannot be rolled back until the Senate changes, by the way, halfway through next year, so someone out in the community is being misled. Secondly, they are going to ban these fee-paying Australians, which means a minimum $340 million lost over the next four years. So the unis lose $1.2 billion at least if Labor comes to government. Labor has a higher education package of $2.34 billion. If you take away $1.2 billion, that brings it back to $1.1 billion or thereabouts over the next four years. That is the net gain for the university sector. Under this government the net gain over five years is $2.6 billion; over four years it is $1.8 billion. So over four years it is $1.8 billion, plus $1.2 billion in HECS changes and in revenue from domestic fee-paying students.

It follows and tidies up some technicalities of legislation previously dealt with in the House. The original legislation was very controversial. It contained a number of measures, which the opposition vehemently opposed, relating to restrictions on access to the electoral roll. Although this bill is consequential on that, it is not controversial. It merely gives effect to the parliament's intention as reflected in that previous bill about which some technicalities and concerns have been raised by the Electoral Commission—technicalities and concerns which all sides of politics realise have to be cleared up so that elections can be conducted in accordance with the requirements and desire of the Australian Electoral Commission. The bill contains measures designed to sort out a number of unintended consequences following the passage of that recent legislation.</para></talk.start><para>Before the recent amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, a prisoner serving a sentence of five years or longer could not enrol, stay enrolled or vote in a federal election. In the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>, which is the controversial bill I spoke of previously on which there was a very heated debate in the House and a major debate in the Senate which led to major amendments, the government proposed to stop all prisoners from voting irrespective of their sentence. The opposition were totally opposed to that measure. We considered it totally unjust. All sorts of people would have been excluded who should not have been.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Corcoran, Ann (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Ms Corcoran)</inline>—Order!

We opposed that measure because it was not only unjust but also unworkable. During debate on the enrolment integrity bill in the Senate on 25 June 2004, a longstanding series of amendments that the ALP had had on the table for more than five years relating to prisoner voting was carried. When I say `longstanding', I am referring to the fact, as I said, that our amendments had been on the table for more than five years. We moved the amendments initially in 1999, when a similar proposal to that in the enrolment integrity bill was put forward by the government. So it is since 1999 that we have held to the proposition that provides that a prisoner whose sentence commenced on or before the return of the writs for an election and whose sentence continued until after the issue of the writs for any succeeding election would not be entitled to be enrolled. Those amendments were passed and that is, in our view, correct articulation of the principle.</para></talk.start></continue><para>However, according to the Australian Electoral Commission, the detail of this approach as outlined in the amendments passed may not achieve the intended outcome. I have to say that this came as a particular surprise to us because the amendments had been around for more than five years and noone previously had raised any concern about them. Nevertheless, the Electoral Commission has flagged the problem and we are duty bound to address it. </para><para>The Commonwealth Electoral Act, as amended in June 2004, allows for the removal of prisoners from the roll only by an objection being lodged. As a prisoner would be ineligible for enrolment only on the issue of the writs, objection action could not commence until after that time. We have been advised that objection action takes at least 20 days, which could be after the close of the roll, possibly having the unintended effect of all prisoners remaining enrolled to vote. Given that this was not the parliament's intention, we now have the prisoner voting bill before the House to conform to the intention of the original legislation but to clear up the technicalities. </para><para>This bill requires that the controllers-general of prisons, or however they are designated in the various states and territories, provide the Electoral Commission, on a monthly basis, with information on prisoners who are serving a sentence of imprisonment of three years or more. The divisional returning officers will then use that information to undertake the objection action and remove these prisoners from the roll on that regular basis. The provisions will not apply to anyone serving sentences of periodic detention or serving a non-custodial sentence.</para><para>Upon completion of their sentences, prisoners will be eligible to re-enrol. Prisoners released on parole will also be eligible to re-enrol. The government has, in effect, adopted Labor's approach; it is proposing a simpler model for excluding prisoners from voting, based on Labor's threeyear time frame. Accordingly, the opposition will be supporting this measure. We also support the other minor tidying up amendments relating to the closure of the roll and the review of new voter identification procedures.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>32606</page.no><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name><name.id>PK6</name.id><electorate>Canning</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2130">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Prisoner Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline> now also goes to a further amendment involving the issue of a prisoner's right to vote. Also, as the member for Fraser has said previously, there are some other technical amendments. As he has just said, most of this bill has been agreed to in a bipartisan way, because that is how this place operates—it is what is achievable. We would have gone further with some of our amendments to the original bill; however, we know you might get everything you want in this House but the Labor Party, in conjunction with its other faction, the Greens, and with the support of the Democrats, seem to get their own way in the Senate when they wish. As a result, we have had to agree to compromise measures which I am sure we can all live with, and that is what this amendment is about this evening. </para></talk.start><para>I speak to this bill because I have some interest in issues relating to prisoners voting. In my electorate of Canning is a very large prison called Hakea Prison, formerly known as Canning Vale, and also Karnet Prison Farm, where minimum security prisoners are generally housed either after having done long periods of time or when they are working towards parole or release et cetera. Incidentally, Karnet Prison Farm is where Alan Bond did his final amount of time. It is an interesting little area in my electorate as we house a major prison and a prison farm, which does its job rather well. I have had representations from families with people in prison about some of the issues they have had. As a good member, I have endeavoured to assist them. They are largely state issues we assist with. People often do not differentiate between what is a state issue and what is a federal issue.</para><para>As described by the member for Fraser, this bill proposes to prevent all prisoners serving sentences of three years or longer from voting. I think it is pretty obvious why prisoners do not have the right to vote. It was previously five years or longer but the proposal now is for sentences that are three years or longer. We are talking about people who have probably abrogated many of their civil sensibilities and rights. These are people who were involved in aggravated bashings, burglaries, crimes against people and crimes against institutions, such as embezzlement. They are generally people who have had their rights taken away from them because they have offended against society in such a vicious sort of way. If they are doing time for more than three years it is generally in a medium to maximum security prison. I do not think that proposal is very controversial.</para><para>This proposal has been described in the exposure draft. It will not apply, if passed, to those released on parole or in other forms of non-custodial sentences, such as periodic detention. For example, well-known periodic detainee Mr Rivkin would still be able to vote. These provisions are obviously quite sensible for people on work release et cetera. We have bipartisan support as we head towards an ultimate conclusion on these matters.</para><para>One of the interesting proposals is that prisoners will not be eligible for postal voting. We know that they do have a very good system of communication in prison, and we would hate to see lots of postal and provisional votes come through the day after the election, particularly in a marginal seat. It would not be very savoury to see people saying they were residents of a certain Warton Road in Canning Vale claiming that they needed to vote. Interestingly, this then begs the question: if they have served a sentence of three years or less—and I have not found this out—where is their electoral enrolment address? Is it at the house where they previously resided, or is it care of Hakea Prison or Karnet prison? That is something that I have not been able to establish but—given the large prison population in a seat like Canning, where there is a margin of 0.4 per cent—I would be very interested in knowing if many of these prisoners were in a position to vote. There are several thousand people in those prisons. At the last election, we sent out people to the mobile booth there. Interestingly, I understand that there were only three people there who were entitled to vote in the electorate of Canning. These are just questions—I am not sure of the answers, but I am sure somebody will clarify them when they speak to the bill later on. </para><para>It is coincidental that I speak to this bill this evening, which is essentially an amendment to the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>, because in yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper, in a column written by one Peter Dowding, I was attacked for my contribution to that bill in a story which made many partisan and dishonest allegations and inferences. Before examining Mr Dowding's specific claims, members will need to be reminded that Mr Peter Dowding was a former Premier of Western Australia who was unceremoniously dumped in a coup largely engineered by the member for Perth, Mr Stephen Smith. In this coup Mr Dowding was replaced by the controversial Carmen Lawrence, now the member for Fremantle. Obviously, Mr Dowding was a former Labor Premier. Mr Dowding was removed for many reasons, not the least being that he could not shake off the label of being tarnished by WA Inc. At one time Mr Dowding was reportedly being sued by the Bond Corporation for his role in the petrochemical plant in Kwinana which cost Western Australian tax payers more than half a billion dollars. He was also being sued by a Mr Leon Musca for defamation.</para><para>In addition to this information Mr Dowding as Premier was accused of keeping an unauthorised `leaders account' used for siphoning off covert donations to Labor candidates and mates. Stephen Smith, as Labor state secretary, tried to bring him to heel over this account, but to no avail. Naturally, Mr Dowding turned on his previous supporter and strategist, Mr Smith, the member for Perth, and began to circulate rumours that the member for Perth was resigning his safe federal seat to run for the leadership of the Labor Party in Western Australia. Mr Smith denied such a move.</para><para>I raise this by way of background, as Mr Dowding is now transferring from his `dog in the manger' role in the Labor Party to the same role in his media and legal roles. It paints a cameo picture about his integrity and his ability to be a credible and honest commentator.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Corcoran, Ann (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Ms Corcoran)</inline>—Order!

Mr Dowding takes issue with the measures to ensure that minority groups, such as Aboriginal communities, are not manipulated and therefore disenfranchised in their desire to be on the electoral roll and vote. It is severely patronising of him to imply that modern day Indigenous Australians are not capable of filling out a ballot paper and that it is somehow racist to ask these people to provide identification for them to be on the combined electoral roll. All Australians have several forms of identification which they can use for such purposes—for example, driver's licence, Medicare card and bank account details; the list goes on. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Corcoran, Ann (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I interrupt the member for Canning.

I am speaking to that bill; it is a subset of that first bill. What this commentator, Mr Dowding, fails to declare is that he is a former Aboriginal legal services lawyer who made a living and benefited from the uninformed and illiterate state of Aboriginal people in years gone by. The government I represent has made large investments to address this basic right of all Australians, including Indigenous Australians, to a better education and better literacy. For example—and this relates to the bill, Madam Deputy Speaker; it is about people's entitlement to vote—in Western Australia, in certain Aboriginal communities, it is amazing that 100 per cent of those people, particularly in remote areas, vote Labor. Not even in the polling booths in the electorate of Canning do people get it 100 per cent right, without any informal votes and not one vote cast the other way. I make it clear that issues about the integrity of the roll, something we are talking about with this bill, need to be exposed. That is why this bill is in this House—to try to tidy up some of those issues I have mentioned in asides.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the same column, Mr Dowding suggested that closing the electoral roll—and this is in this bill, Madam Deputy Speaker—as soon as the election is called and changing the time for transfer of enrolment from seven to three days will disenfranchise many Australians, mostly young people. It is also patronising, ignorant and misleading of the facts to say that. All Australians, including young people, from my broad experience and information, are quite capable of knowing that an election is imminent and taking measures to enrol and to transfer. Whilst doorknocking, I meet many 17- and 18-year-olds who often, when asked about voting for the first time, proudly tell me that they have already enrolled.</para><para>There are also measures such as those used by the Murdoch University guild of students, which actually educates young students in how and when to enrol. I have that information from the Murdoch guild here. It says:</para><quote><para>ENROL TO VOTE - NOW!</para><para>Are you enrolled to vote??? If you have not already noticed, Australia is going to have a federal election—</para></quote><para>et cetera. For Mr Dowding to say this disenfranchises young people is quite bizarre. As I said, they are quite proud to be first-time voters who have already enrolled. In addition, the Australian Electoral Commission has widespread education campaigns throughout the Australian community for young people who are first-time voters about getting onto the roll and for other new enrolees, such as new citizens et cetera. Mr Dowding's comments should be seen for what they are: spurious, ill-informed and politically motivated. </para><para>Why is it that the Labor Party and their commentators do not want new enrollees providing some evidence of who they are? As has been said in this place before on these matters, the local suburban library or the video shop requires more identification than when people go to vote. Why doesn't the Australian Labor Party want to do the same? The answer, quite correctly, is: because they want to manipulate the roll in marginal seats to their advantage. You can understand why I would be sensitive about that. They want to maintain the mantra of `vote early and vote often'. Mr Dowding and his like are the masters and beneficiaries of a corrupted enrolment process and, therefore, there is the potential for an inaccurate electoral roll.</para><para>As an example, I was informed recently by a constituent in Kelmscott in my electorate that she had two people enrolled at her address for three years. She had binned all their mail after informing the post office and other authorities, but they were maintained on the electoral roll. Eventually, I contacted Danny Wallace of the Canning Australian electoral division, and he quite rightly removed them, altering this case of multiple names at this one address.</para><para>Mr Dowding employs, obviously, the ALP's tried and proven strategy of lampooning and discrediting the government by in his column referring to unrelated information. For example, he referred to the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> and `children overboard' in support of his most recent column. I will read to the House a fax sent to me by an ex-constituent who was incensed by Dowding's latest column. It sums up public feelings about him and his methods rather well. I will only read the parts that relate to this:</para><quote><para>I lived in Fitzroy Crossing in mid-1979, while Nookenbah was in full swing. Bob Hawke had his stooge, son Steven, ensconced in the Aboriginal community. Steve was very active in signing up locals to vote Labor. It was well known by the locals that Labor went all around the north-west, smooth-talking the Aboriginals into voting Labor. Steve was also the main figure in the Nookenbah disputes, stirring up most of the protests et cetera. He used to come to town most days to phone home to dad, and no doubt to report and to get fresh instructions. The phone system in those days was operator assisted. The operator said that when Steve made a call to Bob he always told the operator never to interrupt him and never to ask if he wanted an extension or call on his time on this reverse-charge call; they just had to wait until he hung up. No doubt no-one could listen to his conversations. Most of the calls went for 20 minutes or longer, so they weren't just a friendly `hi, how are you' type of call.</para><para>I don't think Peter Dowding can call anyone a liar and a manipulator. Look at his narrow escape from the WA Inc. charges and the way he managed to conveniently duck out of office and escape the wrath to come. Dowding has predicted you won't get back in at the next election. I hope you will, even if it is to spite him.</para></quote><para>I received another email today, which reads:</para><quote><para>I was talking over Labor in the Kimberleys with my husband, who spent more time than I did up there. He reminded me that it was 1980, not 1979, when Nookenbah was in full swing. Sorry for the error. He also recalled the free t-shirts handed out to the extremely gullible local Aboriginals. These shirts were emblazoned with the words `I vote Labor'. Somehow I don't think they were a gift from the Liberal Party.</para></quote><para>That was from Mrs Brown.

I support this bill because it goes a long way to dealing with the issues that we spoke about earlier—that is, the integrity of the roll and making sure that prisoners are allowed to vote in a time properly agreed by both Houses. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>32610</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R2130">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Prisoner Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>. This bill amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act of 1918, the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act of 1984 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Act 2004. In effect this bill addresses the operational problems identified with amendments to the enrolment integrity bill of 2004, which was passed by this parliament on 25 June this year. But it creates a whole new set of problems and leaves others untouched. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The provisions in this bill will ensure that the legislation gives effect to the intention of the parliament by amending several provisions in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Act 2004 that will not otherwise achieve the objectives of the parliament.</para></quote><para>Specifically, due to changes in the law under that act, prisoners serving sentences of imprisonment that commenced on or before the return of the writs for an election and that continue after the issue of the writs for any succeeding election are not entitled to be enrolled to vote. As I understand it, this bill has been introduced in order to escape the unworkable nature of the last bill, which was caused by prisoners only being able to be removed from the electoral roll by the existing objection process, which takes too long.</para><para>Under the current arrangements, the Australian Electoral Commission would need to ascertain at the time of the issue of the writs of an election which prisoners came within the specified category and then complete the objection process in the seven-day period between the issue of the writs and the close of the roll. To rectify this, the bill proposes to prevent from voting all prisoners serving a sentence of three years or longer, which is a reduction from the five-year sentence of the recent past. That is where we are now in considering this bill and that is where we come unstuck yet again, because this bill contains additional problems.</para><para>For example, some prisoners will be disenfranchised by this legislation and others will not. Some will be disenfranchised according to when the election is held whilst others will be disenfranchised according to where they serve their sentences, such as in prison or at home. So this bill does not satisfy its own objectives. Furthermore, it lacks clarity and consistency. More importantly, the Greens find the reduction in prisoners' citizenship rights totally unacceptable. We will therefore have no part in supporting this iniquitous legislation, objective faults or not, and we will not make it easy for this government to disenfranchise so many thousands of Australians.</para><para>The Greens consider this legislation unacceptable, repressive and regressive. We see providing prisoners with the opportunity to vote for their representatives as only proper, civilised and appropriate. This is a view supported by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and by the courts in Canada and Europe and referred to by our own High Court. It is a view which should be supported by this parliament as well—after all, we are a democracy, are we not? It might be helpful to refer members to the Macquarie Dictionary definition of democracy, which says: </para><quote><para>... government by the people; a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system.</para></quote><para>That is right—a free electoral system. That lies at the core of our Australian democracy, and we should not forget that in this debate. The Greens strongly oppose reducing the right of prisoners to vote. We opposed it when it last came before this House in June and, unsurprisingly, we still do today.</para><para>This is an issue which goes to the core of our standing as a free and open democracy. We believe that the incarceration of a person is the punishment for the crime. Incarceration is harsh, as it involves the deprivation of liberty, the removal of freedom—that is the punishment. Freedom is something we all value and we all cherish. The additional denial of the right to vote to any prisoner is wholly inappropriate, just as it is inappropriate to torture or otherwise abuse people in prisons. We should not have to say that in this place; we know that. As a nation we have moved beyond the days of flogging prisoners and putting them to death, or putting them on the treadmill as was common in Australia during the first decades of white settlement, when European civilisation introduced the aforementioned barbarities to the Aboriginal people of this nation. We have, hopefully, come a long way since the time of the First Fleet in 1788, although the introduction of bills such as the one before us by this government would suggest otherwise.</para><para>It is telling that in the same week that we are debating this bill we are informed by the High Court of Australia that the government has a legal right to imprison refugees and asylum seekers forever—indefinitely. I grieve over the inhumanity and lack of compassion of our country under the Howard coalition government, and this legislation adds to that grief. Democracy is about freedom of speech, the right to vote and the freedom to hold individual religious beliefs and other views. It is about working for a just and humane society. The Greens believe that preventing crime by addressing its causes and rehabilitating criminals is a much more worthy policy objective than marginalising people for short- or long-term political gain.</para><para>Why should a prisoner be deprived of the right to vote? This move by the government to discriminate against prisoners is nothing more than an attempt to cast them as second-class citizens. It goes against our core beliefs in equality before the law and equality before each other. That is what it means to be Australian—not that someone is better or worse than anyone else. Prisoners convicted of crimes, however heinous, however repugnant to our way of life and however chilling, must be able to vote in elections for their parliamentary representatives. A simple principle supports this simple contention; that people affected by the actions of elected representatives must be able to influence who those representatives will be. Otherwise, it is clear that the laws that are approved by these representatives—by people such as ourselves—lack legitimacy and the application of them is forever tainted.</para><para>The Greens believe that, whatever crime has been committed, a prison sentence should not involve the removal of basic citizenship rights. It should not and must not involve the removal of basic human rights. An overriding goal of incarceration should be rehabilitation, not disenfranchisement and alienation. Prisons cannot simply be about punishment. As a civilised society we are meant to have gone beyond that. The removal of voting rights for prisoners is likely to further alienate prisoners from Australia's democratic traditions and institutions. This is not something any of us want, nor is it desirable. These measures will make the chances of rehabilitation more unlikely, in the same vein as they make the alienation of prisoners more complete. I would like to remind the House of Canadian Chief Justice McLachlin's comments in the judgment of Sauve and the Attorney-General of Canada (No. 2). He said:  </para><quote><para>The legitimacy of the law and the obligation to obey the law flow directly from the right of every citizen to vote. </para><para>To deny prisoners the right to vote is to lose an important means of teaching them democratic values and social responsibility. </para><para>The government's novel political theory that would permit elected representatives to disenfranchise a segment of the population finds no place in a democracy built upon principles of inclusiveness, equality, and citizen participation. </para></quote><para>I could not agree more. We are fortunate in Australia to have a compulsory voting system, but to go down the path of disenfranchising sections of the community threatens this very system. Where will it lead? Perhaps back to the bad old days prior to 1967, when the white people of this country deemed it acceptable to deny the vote to Indigenous Australians; or perhaps to before the turn of last century, when women were denied the vote; or to more recent times where, for example, this government has attempted to disenfranchise the homeless. This legislation before us is in itself discriminatory against Indigenous Australians by the fact that they comprise an inordinately high percentage of the prison population in this country. I understand that their incarceration rate is 16 times that of the non-indigenous average. </para><para>The government is messing with our core values here. Prisoner voting is referable to the Australian Constitution. Section 7 and section 24 both require that the members of the two houses of parliament are to be `directly chosen by the people'. It seems that being able to choose government is an element of representative government. As the High Court's Chief Justice Mason said in Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v. the Commonwealth (1992): </para><quote><para>The very concept of representative government and representative democracy signifies government by the people through their representatives. </para></quote><para>Likewise, Justices Deane and Toohey, in the 1992 case of Nationwide News Pty Ltd v. Wills, said: </para><quote><para>The powers of government belong to and are derived from the governed, that is to say, the people of the Commonwealth. </para></quote><para>We need to look no further than Justice Kirby, who, in his 2001 <inline font-style="italic">Australian Bar Review</inline> article entitled `Upholding the franchise—contrasting decisions in the Philippines, United States and Australia' wrote that: </para><quote><para>... in Australia there may be a basic right to vote implied in the text of the Constitution itself ... </para></quote><para>Justice Gaudron has expressed the view that:</para><quote><para>Notwithstanding the limited nature of the franchise in 1901, present circumstances would not, in my view, permit senators and members of the House of Representatives to be described as `chosen by the people' within the meaning of those words in sections 7 and 24 of the Constitution if the franchise were to be denied to women or to members of a racial minority or to be made subject to a property or educational qualification. </para></quote><para>So why not prisoners as well? Do we want to deny the vote to some 17,000 Australians? Do we want to subject prisoners to a double penalty? Apparently this government does. Frankly, once again we see the government totally out of touch with the electorate and with community values in 2004. We only need to look at the 1993 federal election, where the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters adopted the recommendations of its predecessor to the effect that all prisoners, except those convicted of treason, be granted the right to vote. The reasons that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters found persuasive were:  </para><quote><para>An offender once punished under the law should not incur the additional penalty of loss of the franchise. </para><para>We also note that a principal aim of the modern criminal law is to rehabilitate offenders and orient them positively towards the society they will re-enter on their release. </para><para>We consider that this process is assisted by a policy of encouraging offenders to observe their civil and political obligations. </para></quote><para>The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report on the 1998 election noted that the majority of the committee supported the previous recommendation, but it stopped short of making a recommendation to that effect on the basis that public support was lacking. Yet those supporting the removal of all restrictions on prisoner voting rights include the International Commission of Jurists, the Criminal Law and Penal Methods Reform Committee of South Australia, the Seventh International Congress of Criminal Law and the 1978 report of the royal commission into New South Wales prisons, the Nagle report. In the latter, Justice Nagle expressed the view that:</para><quote><para>A citizen's right to vote should depend only on his ability to make a rational choice. </para><para>Loss of voting rights is an archaic leftover from the concepts of `attainder' and `civiliter mortuus' and has no place within a penal system whose reform policies aim to encourage the prisoner's identification with, rather than his alienation from, the community at large. </para><para>All prisoners should be entitled to vote at State and Federal elections. </para><para>Necessary facilities should be provided for them to exercise their franchise. </para></quote><para>The Greens agree with these sentiments. We believe that all Australians of voting age should have the right to vote. Members should also consider how this bill would work in practice. The fact is that the bill will discriminate against all those who just so happen to be in prison or serving a sentence at the time of a federal election. And as we know, the time of an election is at the whim of a Prime Minister.</para><para>This legislation is unfair and discriminatory. In addition to that, just what does the phrase `serving a sentence' in this bill mean? In the Northern Territory it may mean being on parole, because section 14 of the Northern Territory's Parole of Prisoners Act states:</para><quote><para>(1) Where a parole order is made in relation to a person—</para></quote><para>(a)	he shall be deemed to be still under sentence of imprisonment, and not to have served the part of the term of imprisonment that remained to be served at the commencement of the parole period, until the parole period expires without the parole order being revoked or cancelled or until he is otherwise discharged from that imprisonment.</para><para>How long will parole last—one year, two years, five years, 10 years? Will the person be unable to vote for this extensive period?</para><para>In summary, this legislation is a disgrace. There is no definition of the term `serving a sentence' in the bill, so the courts will be forced to consider the explanatory memorandum to obtain some sort of legislative guidance. This bill seems to go down the path of saying: `Let people rot in prison. Let's deny them all their rights.' It does not go down the path of trying to rehabilitate people or making sure that, when they do serve their sentence and come back out into society, they are not worse off. This is something that this government seems to have completely neglected. This bill is unworkable, clumsy and punitive. It is discriminatory and objectionable. It is unnecessary and undemocratic. I therefore condemn it, and I condemn the government's disgraceful attempts to disenfranchise so many Australian citizens. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>32614</page.no><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TUCKEY</name><name.id>SJ4</name.id><electorate>O'Connor</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Much has been said about the purpose of the <inline ref="R2130">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Prisoner Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>.

The member for Canning has already drawn attention to a column in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper yesterday, to which I have written a correction. I am prepared to lay odds that it will not be published, and it is the third occasion in recent times that I have read blatant untruths in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> on a variety of matters—some that greatly affect the viability of primary producers in my electorate. If you write in to have something corrected, because it is simply wrong, they do not want to know about it. On one of those occasions, they published a letter from an individual who said that government made a lot of money out of parity pricing policy—which was abandoned in 1988. And yet they have not published a correction. They are prepared to publish an article by an ex-premier of Western Australia, who is a practising legal professional, that says, `The case uncovered Liberal Party branch “roll cleansing”, where country branches scoured electoral rolls to identify people unlikely to promptly respond to a formal letter from the electoral department, betting that there not be a prompt response and these people would be struck off the roll.' </para><para>The reality is that it is not the electoral department: it is the Electoral Commission—and there is a very substantial difference. The Electoral Commission is an independent statutory authority, not subject to the influence of government. A department is something entirely different. Why would an ex-premier of WA want to use the word `department'? Some people could have that misunderstanding, but not an ex-premier. His inference is that you can just ring up the Electoral Commission and they will write a letter to someone—who might be away from home for a week or two—and when they do not reply they are struck off the roll. Again, what are the rules, principles and laws that an ex-premier of WA should know? They do not get one letter; they get three letters—and it is only in the third letter that they are advised that, if there is no response, they will be struck off the roll. Furthermore, if they have been struck off they still have the right to renominate if they can prove they are there. The simple fact is that the people are not there. Usually the reason it has been drawn to the attention of the Electoral Commissioner is that somebody else, maybe a member of parliament, has written a letter and it has been returned marked `Not resident at this address'.</para><para>Of course, it goes a bit further. This is only the start of it. I have raised this issue in the House before in terms of the current attitude that there should be a seven-day enrolment period after the announcement of an election. Ex-premier of WA, Peter Dowding, stands up and says:</para><quote><para>Closing rolls as soon as the election is called has been estimated to disfranchise about 80,000 new enrolees ... It was also estimated by the commission that the Bill's proposal that people wanting to transfer their enrolment should have only three days, instead of the traditional seven days, to change their address would disenfranchise another 200,000 voters.</para></quote><para>I make an interesting point whenever people stand up and make this argument. Section 101 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 refers to compulsory enrolment and transfer. It says that if you are eligible, under a variety of sections, you shall `forthwith fill in and sign a claim and send or deliver the claim to any Divisional Returning Officer or Australian Electoral Officer'. Under the electoral legislation, which we are debating here today, the time given for that is 21 days. The argument promoted by an ex-premier of Western Australia is that, when an election is called, within that 21-day time frame 200,000 people are in the process of shifting house and 80,000 kids are turning 18. That is his argument, and it is promoted by the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> without question. Of course, it is not so: these people are only disenfranchised because they have broken the law. Furthermore, 17-year-olds are permitted by this legislation to register preparatory to attaining the age of eligibility, 18—which is just another reason to argue. </para><para>I have seen people crying crocodile tears in this place. They are not helping many people at all. This section has remained unchanged, but I think it should at least be restricted to people who are prepared to certify that they have transferred their residence or turned 18 within the 21 days—and that would be 14 days before the calling of an election. I have put a question on notice to the minister, wanting to know how often the Electoral Commission prosecutes these matters. Those 200,000 people cause considerable problems in the appropriate management of recording persons to vote. We do not want them all turning up at the last minute. It is expensive to the taxpayer, it creates confusion and it opens opportunities for fraudulent activity because it is clearly much more difficult to check on the bona fides of the applicant—and they are supposed to be fined. Clearly, the largest proportion of those who make these last-minute applications have been in breach of the law. We have a premier and legal practitioner in WA putting a case for people to break the law, and we have had people speak in this House in a similar vein. I find it outrageous.</para><para>Another piece of unfinished business in this legislation is getting probable coverage of provisional voting practices. Provisional voting practices are when people attend a polling booth and find they are not on the roll. They get plenty of encouragement to check the roll, but when they find they are not on the roll they are entitled to fill out a statutory declaration that they are resident at a particular location—and I do not object to that. But there should be a process—certainly a random process, at least—whereby a call is made before those votes are called to account, as they are, of course, in closely contested outcomes. I think the Electoral Commission should be obliged to visit, say, a random 70 per cent or more of such people and that there should be very substantial fines when they are found not to be resident where they have claimed on election day. This was drawn closely to my attention because of the number of provisional votes cast in WA. In 1998, 841 provisional votes were cast in the electorate of Brand, a pretty safe Labor seat—as things are today. It is notable that a large number, 847, were cast in Perth. The electorate of Forrest, a Liberal held seat, is up in that category, at 898. I might add that in my seat, a very far-flung seat, only 647 people chose to make that application.</para><para>It was drawn to my attention that, in a seat which I think was held by The Nationals by 60-odd votes at the last election, they were able to knock out 300 votes cast because they had evidence by the return of mail that the persons so claiming did not reside there any more. Isn't it interesting? In 1996, the electorate of Brand was held by the then sitting member with a majority of 387 votes. The figure of 841 provisional votes on that occasion grew to 1,091. Notwithstanding that the other voting of all particular types was neck and neck, when they opened up the provisional votes, there were 655 for the Labor Party and 381 for the Liberal Party. It was an absolute reversal of voting trends to the ratio of two to one. If you took that 274 majority away from the final majority, you would be down to about 100. But, if you took the 200 extra souls that turned up from somewhere compared to the typical 800-odd that is cast, the sitting member would have lost the seat.</para><para>That is an example that requires attention, and I would like to think that that matter is going to be resolved sometime in the future. It is simply the same as people providing some identification as to who they are when they apply for the right to vote. That is not an imposition on privacy and it should always be accepted as the barest of minimum requirements that somebody identifies themselves. There was a requirement that you had to go around and find a policeman or something like that. I think that might have been excessive, but to require that you produce your driver's licence, which now has a photograph on it in every state, and/or some other evidence like a passport if you have one—and, again, many young people do in this day and age—is certainly not unreasonable. People cannot get into a nightclub or get a video without proving who they are. How can there be any argument otherwise? </para><para>The other comment in this particular article is some complaint about the rights of people living in remote areas. I support the government's policy in this area because I have seen polling in remote areas and know a bit about it. I have seen the situation in remote area polling booths time and time again where there were 100 per cent formal votes. The people of the wealthiest and most educated suburbs, for whatever reason, cannot achieve 100 per cent formal votes in any box. There are always some informals. How can that happen, especially when 100 per cent of the votes are all for one political party? That defies statistics and suggests that there is a problem. To suggest that when certain political parties consequently sent out some lawyers to supervise the management of polling booths that was somehow an imposition on the voters is something I cannot accept.</para><para>We are entitled to have confidence in our electoral processes, and everyone is entitled to only one vote. Another issue is when people go from one polling booth to another, when they are legally enrolled at both, and cast two votes and, if contacted, say: `It wasn't me. Someone else must have voted for me,' when in fact they did not. That comes down to the old argument about voting early and voting often, and we should have processes that make sure it does not happen. In this age of computers, I am astounded that we still use a book when that sort of procedure would cease immediately if people, having cast a vote, were automatically ruled out on the computer and therefore at all other polling booths. It is not beyond modern-day technology to do that.</para><para>I must say that this piece of legislation is timely. It is a bit like a couple of others we have had. It proves that the amendment that was put up in the Senate that we accepted to get a reasonable outcome has proven to be unworkable. The bill had to be brought back, and I welcome the fact that the Labor Party are giving it support and, more particularly, that they understand that, when you go to jail in Australia—considering the fairly lenient attitude of our judiciary—you have done something pretty serious. Unfortunately, it is frequently for those forms of crimes such as home invasion, dangerous driving causing death and manslaughter. It is tragic. My recollection as a young man in Perth was that there was about one murder a year. Now it seems that they are almost daily. The argument from the Greens is that, notwithstanding that those crimes may have been violent and premeditated, the offender should continue to participate in the political process and maybe in a marginal seat have some influence over how the parliament deals with them.</para><para>In closing, the member for Cunningham made a point about the judicial system and a recent decision of the High Court. One judge—I think it was Justice McHugh—to his own credit said that he could only assess an issue on the rights of parliament and that he did not agree with the philosophy or the morality but he would give a judgment based on the law and of course, more importantly, the power of parliament to set the rules and the responsibility of the judiciary to analyse them. Let me say that we certainly need some help from the media. They should not publish articles that are so blatantly wrong, irrespective of their opinions, as occurred yesterday in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper.

This is unworkable due to the fact that there is not enough time between when the writs for the next election are issued and when the rolls close for the processing to determine which prisoners are affected and when they are to be removed from the roll, thus enforcing their ineligibility. The bill before the House will repeal this process and insert the provision that prisoners serving sentences of three years or more will be excluded from voting. The original electoral act banned prisoners serving five years or more, so after all the debate we have a two-year reduction, from five years to three, which to my mind seems to be completely arbitrary, unfair and counterproductive.</para><para>It is a pity the member for O'Connor did not stay to listen to some of the reasoning that I want to put on the public record. I think these changes are more designed to create, inadvertently, recidivism in our prisoner population than the member for O'Connor realises, given his quite ridiculous opening remarks that belong back in the fifties—where, perhaps, if that is his attitude and if he is not prepared to listen to the debate around this, his sense of justice belongs.</para><para>In December 1998 and in May this year there was legislation which was intended to take away the right of prisoners to vote. I said then, and I said again in May this year, that the right to vote—to have a say in who governs the country and even, at a state level, who runs the prisons—is a basic human right. As a right, it is not something that should be taken away by politicians. Just a decade ago a joint standing committee of this parliament adopted the recommendation of its predecessor that all prisoners, except those convicted of treason, be granted the right to vote.</para><para>It is interesting to note that, amongst all of those massive communist countries that still exist out there in the free world, there is a country by the name of Canada, where the chief justice has ruled, under that country's charter of rights and freedoms, that the right to vote lies at the heart of Canadian democracy and that the core democratic rights of Canadians do not fall within a range of acceptable alternatives among which parliament may pick and choose at its discretion. That basically says that all people have a right to vote and that it is only under the most extreme conditions that you should take away that right. As that parliamentary committee pointed out a decade ago—in perhaps a more enlightened decade, might I say—all prisoners, except those convicted of treason, should be granted the right to vote. </para><para>To suggest that anybody who may argue otherwise belongs to some extreme ideology is an absolute nonsense. Some people commit crime and are not jailed but retain the right to vote. Some are jailed and later found to be innocent. I suggest from my experience in my electorate of Calare that, unless we particularly pay attention to the rehabilitation of prisoners and offer them rights which they can appreciate as rights, we will only further cement behaviour which will continue to be antisocial, which will continue to exacerbate the repetition of crime in our community and which will certainly have a more negative outcome in the long run than would otherwise be the case.</para><para>I particularly want to mention the situation with regard to our Aboriginal prison population. Aboriginal inmates represent up to a quarter of our young people in jail at any one time. Most of these people are in and out of incarceration. As I said in May, they are harassed by the law in many cases—and quite rightly so, it can be argued. But in looking at the reaction to the crime we do not look enough at the demons, most notably drugs and alcohol, that are great contributing factors to these people being in jail in the first place.</para><para>I have four prisons within my electorate. I have spent some time visiting those jails for various functions, and I have spoken to Koori prisoners. Bathurst and to a lesser degree Lithgow largely house parents, aunts and uncles and other relatives of Koori prisoners who gather there so they can be close to their loved ones while they are incarcerated. I have had reasonably regular communication with Koori prisoners wanting to contact their loved ones. In some cases they argue quite lucidly about some of the things they have seen on radio and television. There is nothing like prison to focus one's attention on improving oneself—and they do, through the craft programs that are run at Bathurst jail. They do magnificent Aboriginal artworks and craft works, which they sell, and they do business courses. Yet, having offered those worthwhile encouragements to rehabilitate, in this legislation we take away a basic human right of these people which, if offered, I firmly believe would aid in their appreciation of their situation and give them some encouragement to contact and play a part in those processes which otherwise they would treat with disdain. They know about the political issues and, largely, they are a part of the processes. They know all about them.</para><para>At the moment I am talking only about Koori prisoners We have an absolutely disgraceful incarceration rate—two per cent of the population and 25 per cent of our young prison population. When the state government decided to relocate a prison in Wellington, there was a mad scramble for the economic benefits that that jail might deliver to the non-Aboriginal community. The relocation was designed to get these prisoners closer to their loved ones so that their people would not have to travel so far. Here we have the jail treated as an economic boost to a region—which, no doubt, it is—and yet the major portion of the population is Aboriginal.</para><para>Why should we deny, except in the most extreme cases—and surely we could perhaps work out what they might be—this basic human right to these people when, I am sure, we would all want them, once they leave prison, to be able to take a path that is productive and contributory and has all the elements of a person playing a positive role in society? There is no way in the world that I can just accept this arbitrary three years. Where did it come from? Why three years? Why not leave it at five? Why have five anyway? Why do those in for fewer than three years, for whatever circumstances, get the vote and those beyond do not? It is arbitrary; it is unfair; and, as I hope I have pointed out, it is counterproductive. </para><para>Another aspect of this bill is the clean-up of the early closure provisions. The enrolment integrity bill initially attempted to introduce early closure of the rolls, but that, as it should have been, was rolled. Now, for a referendum, the closure of the rolls would happen three days after the writs are issued instead of seven days. Again, I wonder why the same rules do not apply here as apply for a normal election. In the debate on the enrolment integrity bill, the majority of amendments relating to the early closure of the rolls were removed from the bill and are not included in the resulting act. However, two items, 107 and 108, relating to the early closure of the rolls for referenda were overlooked. The prisoner voting bill, or the <inline ref="R2130">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Prisoner Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>, will remove these items and achieve consistency. No-one should have any real problems with that.</para><para>The bill also clarifies name and address evidentiary requirements and makes sure the requirements for proof of name and address for enrolment—the inclusion of a driver's licence number or signature of two witnesses—come into effect on the same date. Again, I have no problem with that. But, for the reasons I have outlined, I certainly cannot support the prisoner provisions of this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>32620</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—On behalf of the government, I would like to thank those honourable members who have contributed to the very interesting debate on this important item of legislation, the <inline ref="R2130">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Prisoner Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>. This bill is a demonstration of the Howard government's commitment to ensuring the integrity of the electoral system.</para></talk.start><para>When it passed the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>, it was the intention of the parliament that people who commit offences against society sufficient to warrant a full-time prison term for an electoral cycle or longer should not have any entitlement to vote and elect the leaders of this society and would be deprived of this entitlement while serving that prison sentence. This legislation will give effect to that intention by preventing all prisoners who are serving a full-time sentence of three years or more, including those whose sentences began before the commencement of the legislation, from enrolling to vote or being enrolled to vote and therefore being eligible to vote.</para><para>I was very surprised at the comments made by the member for Calare. No doubt he very strongly believes in what he said in his speech. However, I think most reasonable Australians would believe that people who are incarcerated for the period I mentioned ought to be deprived of the opportunity of playing a part in determining the leaders of our society. It is one of those sanctions which I think is entirely appropriate. When they do emerge into society after having served their term of imprisonment, they are of course welcome to have full involvement in our national life. But to me it is bizarre that people who are in jail, as these people are, should be able to vote—as some of them have been able to vote in the past.</para><para>The bill also removes from the enrolment integrity act items relating to the early close of rolls for referenda that were overlooked during debate of the legislation in the Senate. This will ensure consistency with the removal of all other early closure of roll provisions of that act and will maintain the current seven-day time limit for the close of rolls after the writs are issued for an election or a referendum. </para><para>The bill will also clarify that all provisions relating to proof of name and address requirements for enrolment commence at the same time. Amendments made by the other place to the enrolment integrity act contained different commencement dates, which made the commencement of the scheme unclear. These amendments will remove any uncertainty about the operation of these requirements.</para><para>Before I conclude, I would like to briefly remark on some of the comments made by those honourable members who contributed to the debate. The member for Fraser quite correctly pointed out that the bill corrects technical errors and stated that he supports the bill. On behalf of the government, I welcome the opposition's support for this particular legislation. However, the member for Fraser referred to what he said was a longstanding ALP amendment, but I am informed that the government was not shown the text of the amendment until the day it was debated in the Senate. So no fault with respect to this matter can be laid at the feet of the government.</para><para>The member for Canning pointed out that the bill enjoys bipartisan support. He pointed out it was a compromise solution. He asked for some clarification of a number of matters, including the address a prisoner is enrolled at and eligibility to lodge postal votes. With respect to the questions posed by the member for Canning, I am happy to advise him that prisoners serving a sentence of three years or more will not be able to cast a postal vote and other prisoners will be eligible to do so. The member for Canning also asked about a prisoner's enrolled address. The Australian Electoral Commission has advised that a prisoner's enrolled address is the place where he or she lived before entering jail.</para><para>The member for O'Connor, in I suppose a typically exciting speech, questioned what the Greens stand for and raised a certain number of matters. He referred to provisional voting practices and mentioned that there should be more checks, and also welcomed the bill and pointed out that the bill will certainly fix up some problems. In relation to the honourable member's comments about provisional voting, the government did propose that proof of name and address should be provided by people casting a provisional vote. This supported a recommendation by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The measure was in the enrolment integrity bill 2004. However, given what I suppose you would call the contrariness of the Senate on that particular occasion—as on so many occasions—the Senate did not agree and consequently that particular measure did not remain. We do, however, welcome the support of the member for O'Connor for the legislation.</para><para>The member for Cunningham claimed that the bill creates problems. He does not support the bill. I want to point out to him that the bill ensures that the intention of the parliament that certain prisoners should not be entitled to vote can be implemented to achieve the parliament's aim. The purpose of this bill is to achieve the aim the parliament seeks to achieve.</para><para>This is an important piece of legislation. The Howard government place a very great level of importance on integrity in the electoral system. It is a matter of regret that certain other measures that we sought to bring about and incorporate into the law were not accepted by the Senate, but you have to accept the reality of numbers in this place. This is a compromise measure. It is the best that can be achieved. I am very pleased to commend this bill to the House. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>32622</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr SLIPPER (Fisher—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration) (7.10 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2004 </title><type>Bills</type><page.no>32622</page.no><id.no>R2094</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>32622</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 23 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Nelson</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>32622</page.no><name role="metadata">Livermore, Kirsten, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LIVERMORE</name><name.id>83A</name.id><electorate>Capricornia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2094">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 </inline>provides for an appropriation which will give effect to the fall-back deal reached between the Minister for Education, Science and Training and the state and territory governments earlier this year following the failure by the federal government to offer adequate growth funding for ANTA in negotiations for the new ANTA agreement.</para></talk.start><para>Since 1992 the Australian National Training Authority, or ANTA, has been the means by which the Commonwealth government has allocated its funding to the states and territories to support them in their role as the providers and administrators of vocational education and training. The Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992 provides for the maximum amount of vocational education and training funding for distribution by the Australian National Training Authority to the states and territories for capital and recurrent purposes and for national projects.</para><para>The bill we are debating this evening amends the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act to reduce the appropriated limit of total funds for vocational education and training to be provided to ANTA for distribution to the states and territories for 2004 from $1.136 billion to $1.129 billion to reflect the outcome of the ANTA negotiations. It will also appropriate funds for vocational education and training to be provided to ANTA for distribution to the states and territories for the year 2005 up to a limit of $1.148 billion.</para><para>This is the latest episode in the long running saga that is the new ANTA agreement. It is a saga that seems strangely out of place in a country that has been grappling with the problem of skills shortages across a range of trades and industries for some years. It is a saga that seems to ignore the scale of unmet demand for TAFE places in Australia. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures from December 2002, an estimated 40,000 people nationally, including 15,000 school leavers, had missed out on a TAFE place. That figure has continued to grow each year.</para><para>Once again, the Howard government has approached the negotiations over the ANTA agreement not as an opportunity to work with the states and territories to address the serious and growing issues facing vocational education and training but as yet another chance to play politics and duck responsibility in this very important policy area. How could the government be serious about vocational education and training and the vital role it plays in creating a skilled work force and a competitive nation when the government went to the states and territories last year and kicked off negotiations for the new ANTA agreement with not one cent of growth funding on the table for the life of the 2004-06 agreement? As the shadow minister pointed out in the debate over last year's VET Funding Amendment Bill, at a time when the ANTA agreement was similarly stalled over the minister's denial of growth funding: </para><quote><para>... the Howard government has not given one extra cent for TAFE in six out of the nine years it has been negotiating ANTA agreements, despite the record growth.</para></quote><para>We have seen the results of this government's longterm neglect and underfunding of vocational education and training in this country. As I said before, anywhere from 40,000 to 50,000 people have been shut out of TAFE each year, with places not keeping pace with demand. This country has a youth unemployment rate stuck at over 20 per cent, and we have growing skill shortages that threaten our nation's productivity and competitive advantage. With such a track record, imagine our surprise in the Labor Party when we thought the government had finally grasped the importance of training and skills development. On 6 April this year, we thought that there was going to be a historic movement. We thought the minister was going to announce a policy that we could wholeheartedly endorse. The minister's opening remarks started off well:</para><quote><para>Today I am announcing a National Skills Shortages Strategy to address skills shortages in critical industries throughout Australia and also a `one-stop shop' web based site for students, parents and industry on skill shortage careers ...</para><para>The new Strategy will take an industry approach to skill needs and tackle many of the significant disincentives which can turn young people away from choosing trades as a career.</para></quote><para>I am sure we would all agree they were great words, but unfortunately what followed was just more words. It turns out that the minister was not promising a real program of investment in the critical area of skill shortages; it was merely a bunch of words that he strung together and was bravely calling a strategy.</para><para>There are many times in this place when politics override good policies, but surely in black-and-white cases such as this one, where we are talking about providing opportunities for young Australians to get skills which enable them to get a job, we in this House should all be united. Yet here we are, for the second time in as many years, having to move an amendment to the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act, because for another year the Howard government has again refused to do the right thing and invest in Australia's future. It is for that reason that I move:</para><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:</para><para>(1)	failing to finalise the ANTA agreement;</para><para>(2)	failing to adequately index funding for Vocational Education and Training to reflect real increases;</para><para>(3)	failing to meet skill shortages, in critical industry areas;</para><para>(4)	failing to guarantee young Australians a secure future; and</para><para>(5)	failing to assist older workers upgrade or retrain”.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phil (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Barresi)</inline>—Is the amendment seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WU5</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Gavan O'Connor</name></talker><para>—I second the amendment.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83A</name.id><name role="metadata">Livermore, Kirsten, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LIVERMORE</name></talker><para>—I move this amendment because I believe it is important that these issues are addressed as a core function of government. Vocational education and training is crucial to Australian society and the economy. Everyone seems to know this bar the minister for education and training. Every year, more than one in 10 Australians aged over 15 years study in the vocational education and training system. There were 1.7 million students enrolled in vocational education and training in 2002, including over 1.3 million in the public TAFE system. </para></talk.start></continue><para>TAFE not only provides entry level vocational education and training for young people and further education and training for older workers but also provides second chance and recurrent education for socially and economically disadvantaged Australians. Yet under the Howard government TAFE has been savaged. In 1996 and 1997, the Howard government cut the TAFE budgets, then between 1998 and 2000 the Commonwealth government froze funding from this reduced base. There was a modest increase between 2001 and 2003, but that turned out to be the only touch of sunshine, because the Commonwealth has provided no additional growth funds for TAFE in 2004. This means that more than 50,000 people will miss out on a TAFE place this year. At the same time, many Australian industries are facing serious skill shortages, especially in the traditional trades.</para><para>The problem of skill shortages was the subject of an inquiry last year by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education. That committee received 103 submissions and held hearings across the country, including in most capital cities and regional centres—from Gladstone to Newcastle, Cairns, Launceston and Port Augusta just to name a few. It is clear that the issue of skill shortages is a concern for everyone, and it seems that everyone is speaking out about it. For example, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry state:</para><quote><para>Australian firms are greatly concerned at their (in)capacity to recruit employees with appropriate levels of skills, and retaining skilled employees, with such pressures being particularly acute in regional and rural Australia.</para></quote><para>The Australian Industry Group say that over half of Australian businesses surveyed currently face skill shortages. Regional businesses in New South Wales say that 60 per cent of them currently face skill shortages. They are the most acutely impacted, followed by businesses in regional Victoria, where 48 per cent of them show skill shortages, and Queensland, where the number is 41 per cent. Heather Ridout, the chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, spelled out the scale of the problem when she said:</para><quote><para>Over the next 5 years, 175,000 workers are expected to leave the traditional trades with only 70,000 going to enter.</para></quote><para>The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's survey of investor confidence for July 2004 sounded the warning. It said:</para><quote><para>For only the second time in the history of the survey <inline font-style="italic">Business Taxes and Charges</inline> ... has been removed from its position as the foremost constraint on investment. Taking number one position for the first time is the <inline font-style="italic">Availability of Suitably Qualified Employees</inline> ... A much tighter labour market for skilled workers has seen this constraint rise from fifth highest just a year ago to second position in January and April, then finally to first in the current quarter.</para></quote><para>I would like to add one more quote to this list—and it tells a much more damning story of the government's failure in the area of vocational education and training. It comes from a young man from Mount Isa who, earlier this year, was given a historic opportunity to be the first non-party member to address the Labor Party's national conference. He was given the opportunity because his message is so vital. His message clearly states why Australia needs a Labor government that is dedicated to providing opportunity for all. This is what he told the ALP national conference:</para><quote><para>While industry is still the lifeblood of Mt Isa, there seems to be little interest in youth training. Throughout Australia, industry screams for qualified tradespeople, but they don't ensure their on-going future by training their own pool of qualified staff. Our local newspaper recently ran a front-page story about bringing tradesmen from Russia to fill the local shortage, yet this year's MIM apprentice intake was just 23 with only seven of these being school-leavers. The other 16 were adult apprentices. As these numbers are considerably higher than in the past few years, perhaps taking on twenty-three can be seen as an achievement, but when I look at how few of my friends have something positive to look forward to, I can't understand why we're not questioning what's gone wrong ... </para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>Many of my friends aren't high achievers academically, but they're great with their hands and would make excellent tradesmen, but they're becoming increasingly dispirited, believing they're never going to get a start.</para></quote><para>The Minister for Education, Science and Training has great aspirations for himself—we can all see those in question time on most days—but what a shame he does not support aspiration in others. I know there are still claims in the community that both major political parties are the same and that politics is no longer a clash of ideas, but you just need to look at the budget and the budget reply to see just how vastly different we are.</para><para>During his budget reply the Leader of the Opposition announced Labor's youth guarantee `learn or earn'. This initiative represents Labor's initial enhancement to Australia's employment services system and will target early school leavers aged 15 to 18. Labor's youth guarantee is a preventative program which aims to ensure that no 15- to 18yearolds leave school early and move onto unemployment benefits. To accomplish this goal, the youth guarantee will provide additional in-school support for at-risk young people. Labor will abolish TAFE fees for VET in Schools. We will expand outside school opportunities through having more TAFE places and apprenticeships and a jobs gateway, which will allow young people to gain accredited training while working for a regular employer for up to two years. Whichever option a young person decides on, they will receive one-on-one support, advice and encouragement from a training mentor to ensure that they stick with it. This intensive level of support is what distinguishes the youth guarantee from current programs.</para><para>To assist today's teenage job seekers the youth guarantee will also enhance the Job Network in areas with very high unemployment. The labour market disadvantage confronting early school leavers cannot be overstated. Research reveals that, seven years after leaving school, only seven per cent of all year 12 leavers are unemployed. By comparison, 21 per cent of young men who left school early are unemployed and for young women the unemployment rate hovers around 60 per cent. To date, the government's critique of the youth guarantee has varied. Some in the government have complained that it has not been introduced soon enough, while others deny that there is, in fact, a youth unemployment problem. For the benefit of those government members who are in the chamber this evening, I would remind them of some of the more uninformed assertions coming from some government ministers. The best one came from the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Larry Anthony, who claimed on 14 May that Labor was merely manufacturing a youth crisis. It is beyond me how he can substantiate that claim when each year 45,000 young people leave school without going into work or training.</para><para>We now come to what was in the government's budget. There was no guarantee for young people and not one penny more to assist them in the challenges they face as they seek pathways into careers and training, nor was there a plan to alleviate Australia's growing shortage of skilled workers—a problem that, if not addressed, threatens the country's future economic development. According to Group Training Australia, an organisation that has made a significant contribution to skilling Australia, there are currently national skill shortages in all key trades including all the engineering trades, all the vehicle trades, all the construction trades, all the food trades as well as in electrical, electronics, printing, wood, hairdressing and furniture upholstering. The Australian Industry Group, in its submission to the skills inquiry of the Senate, reported that over half of the businesses surveyed face skill shortages. Unfortunately the plight of these employers is only likely to worsen. As we heard earlier from the chief executive of the AiG, over the next five years 175,000 workers are expected to leave the traditional trades, with only 70,000 expected to enter. That is a huge challenge for this country and one that must be addressed by the government. </para><para>It is absurd that, at a time when more than one in five teenagers is looking for full-time work, we have businesses crying out for skilled workers. The New Apprenticeships system is not addressing effectively acute skill shortages in the economy and providing young Australians with the qualifications that will improve their longterm career prospects. While the Minister for Education, Science and Training regularly boasts that under his government the number of people undertaking apprenticeships and traineeships has doubled, he fails to point out that most of this growth has occurred in industries such as retail and fast food. At the same time as much of the growth in new apprenticeship numbers has occurred in these service industries, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations has identified skill shortages across a range of traditional trade occupations including carpentry, plumbing, cabinet making, panel beating and metal fabrication.</para><para>At a time when many communities in this country are experiencing high levels of unemployment, we have businesses crying out for skilled workers. This situation is nothing short of irrational, and it is a direct result of government policy and neglect. This emerging skills crisis has been caused by the financial incentive structure put in place by the Commonwealth government. This budget does nothing to rebalance these incentives towards the traditional trades and other areas of skill shortages. Labor recognises the importance of skills formation for manufacturing. This is why a Latham Labor government will focus the work of ANTA on offering quality apprenticeships that lead to real skills and real jobs. Currently, only a fraction of apprenticeships are in the traditional trades. A key element of the Latham Labor government economic strategy will be in this important area of skills development.</para><para>If the truth is that Australia cannot compete with nations like China and India by driving down our wages, we have to drive up our skills. We have to invest in our people and their capacities for the future. In the modern economy, fewer jobs are based on machine and muscle power. It is brain power that is the resource of a new economy. We have to ensure that as industries become less resource intensive and more knowledge intensive we invest in the knowledge skills of the future. Labor has outlined a plan for lifelong learning. This is not just about TAFE and research, it is not just about the skills that come in the post-secondary years; it has to be a comprehensive program of lifelong learning in all parts of the country.</para><para>Labor have outlined our plans for early childhood development: investing early to build the skills base for literacy and the reading capacity for children even before they get to school and then, when they get to school, to ensure there is needs based school funding. We must ensure that we are getting the resources to schools that need the funding the most, to get away from the inequities of the Howard government's funding plan and back to the needs based resourcing of our schools. But a Labor government's support will not end there. As I have already outlined, our Youth Guarantee will kick in at the age of 15 to assist young people on to the various pathways to a career, ensuring that all young people will have a chance to learn or earn. In addition, Labor will create 20,000 extra university places plus reverse the government's 25 per cent increase in HECS. We will create an extra 20,000 TAFE places and our Youth Guarantee will provide 45,000 new opportunities for our young people. This is the great neglect of the Howard government, and it was the issue we focused on last year when the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill was before the House. </para><para>As I said earlier, every year in Australia 45,000 young people drop out of school early. They do not go on to full-time work or training and they have not got the opportunities available by which they can do something useful and constructive in their lives. We are going to provide those extra 45,000 opportunities and then demand that young people take responsibility and get stuck in and make good use of the TAFE places, the apprenticeships, the training opportunities and the subsidised jobs to ensure we can bring down those crippling unemployment and youth unemployment rates in many parts of the country.</para><para>Labor has a comprehensive program of investing in our people and investing in skills. It is the smartest thing we can do as a nation, it is the smartest thing for economic and social reasons and it is the key to a brighter future for all of us. Labor will invest in the skills and opportunities, repairing the damage caused by eight years of Howard government cutbacks in training and education. Labor will also help the jobless back into work. More than 370,000 Australians are now long-term unemployed, meaning that they have been on the dole for more than 12 months. Many of those people are mature age workers who have been made unemployed or redundant. But, more than ever, Australia needs the talents and experience of mature age workers.</para><para>In recent years we have seen too many mature age Australians falling into unemployment and becoming dependent on income support or drifting out of the labour force entirely. A third of Australians aged between 50 and 64 years are on income support, and nearly one in two Australians aged between 55 and 64 years are not in the labour force. Too many Australians are finding that if they lose their job later in life they never regain employment. With an ageing population and growing skills shortages in key industries, wasting the skills and experience of mature age Australians is not an option. Our package, `Greater Security, More Opportunities for Mature Age Australians' will help more Australians over 45 years of age get the skills and support they need to stay in the work force.</para><para>A Latham Labor government will establish mature age career centres to assist mature age Australians get back to work; provide a rapid assistance service for workers who are displaced or about to be displaced due to large scale or regional retrenchment—something we are familiar with in my electorate after the closure of Lakes Creek Meatworks a couple of years ago; establish a training partnerships fund to encourage employers to retrain and reskill mature age employees; earmark 2,500 new TAFE places each year for Australians over 45 years old; develop new procedures for formally recognising the skills and experience of mature age Australians when they attain new qualifications; fund an additional 500 places in the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, earmarked for mature age job seekers who do not receive income support; provide a $2,000 learning bonus to mature age job seekers who take up an apprenticeship or traineeship in an area of skill shortage; deploy 125 mature age workplace trainers in key industries to develop and implement workplace training plans; implement community programs to improve adult literacy levels; support mature age workers to undertake nationally accredited training in information technology; and establish Job Network providers that specialise in assisting mature age job seekers. That package—`Greater Security, More Opportunities for Mature Age Australians'—is a fully costed and funded $212.4 million investment in Australia's mature age work force and will help address the challenges of an ageing population. </para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker, you can see from these initiatives I have just outlined that the area of vocational education and training is yet another example of the Labor opposition doing the government's work for it. We are the ones who have identified the problems, which are the legacy of eight years of the Howard government. I have already mentioned them in detail: persistent high levels of long-term unemployment; shameful levels of youth unemployment; too many young people dropping out of school without going on to a job or further education; unmet demand for TAFE places; thousands of mature age workers who have found themselves unemployed, while their skills and experience go to waste; and skills shortages that threaten our productivity now and our capacity to compete in the high-skill knowledge economy that is just around the corner.</para><para>The current situation represents too many wasted lives and too many wasted opportunities for this country. We can no longer afford complacency in the face of these problems. Labor have once again shown that we are the party that will accept the challenges facing Australia, we are the party with a vision for this country's future and we are the party with policies like the Youth Guarantee, the plan for getting the over-45s retrained and back to work, and the plan for boosting resources for the TAFE system—policies that place vocational education and training right at the centre of our vision for a prosperous and competitive country where every citizen can realise their potential and where our standard of living is secured into the future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>32628</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARTLETT</name><name.id>0K6</name.id><electorate>Macquarie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2094">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 </inline>is largely about funding—that is, the appropriation of some $1.148 billion as the government's contribution to the national delivery of vocational education and training. This is administered, of course, through ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority. Funding under the current agreement will expire in December this year, so this legislation ensures funding for 2005. The government is determined, despite a lack of cooperation from the Labor state and territory governments, to fulfil its responsibilities to ensure a strong national system of vocational education and training.</para></talk.start><para>I have no cause to doubt the sincerity of the previous speaker, the member for Capricornia, and I certainly agree with her on the existence of the problem—that is, there are skills shortages in Australia, and sadly those skills shortages do exist side by side with pockets of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. However, I disagree with her on her evaluation of the reasons for that problem and the proposed strategies to address it.</para><para>Listening to her contribution, three or four things came to mind. Firstly, there is the typical pattern of half-truths about and misrepresentations of the situation and what the reasons for it might be. Secondly, there is a severe case of amnesia about Labor's record. We hear these grandiose and great-sounding ideas about what Labor would do, but there is no admission of the fact that when they were in office apprenticeships and traineeships fell to a 30-year low. There is no recognition that when they were in office we had the highest level of unemployment and the highest level of youth unemployment since the Great Depression. I guess the moral is that it is one thing to listen to what Labor say in opposition, but it is a very different thing to look at their record in government. </para><para>Thirdly, there is their deafening silence on state Labor government policies that are really undermining the whole vocational education and training system. It is great to make these claims, but Labor are condemned, I am afraid, by their silence on this issue. Why have we not heard one Labor speaker opposite criticise the New South Wales Carr Labor government for the appalling rise in TAFE fees—a rise of 250 to 300 per cent in the cost of doing TAFE courses? If there were genuine concern opposite about these issues, we would have heard some condemnation of the New South Wales Labor government. So while, as I say, I respect the sincerity of the member for Capricornia, I do have to wonder about the Labor Party's silence on state Labor policies, and their confusion and amnesia in terms of their own record and their own policy position.</para><para>I turn to the facts—firstly, the background to this bill and the funding arrangements. The background is simply that this government held extensive negotiations with the states in a genuine attempt over a period of time to get some sort of agreement with the state and territory governments on vocational education and training funding. This required a reasonable level of contribution from them, a level of contribution that they were unwilling to commit to. The offer then had to be altered. That offer was funding of $3.6 billion over the next three years, an average annual increase of 2.5 per cent above inflation—that is, growth funding above inflation. The previous speaker, the member for Capricornia, said there was no growth funding.</para><para>The intention was to provide this growth funding of 2½ per cent a year over and above inflation—delivering a total sum of $3.6 billion over three years. Sadly, as I said, the state and territory governments refused to agree to this offer and commit themselves to this arrangement. For this reason, the government had to introduce just a one-year rollover with indexation on the base funding, not growth funding, to carry funding through for the vocational education and training sector for this year. The funding that was not taken up by the states and territories—again, they dug their heels in for whatever reason and refused to be part of it—would have left their state or territory short of funding.</para><para>So the Australian government, in an effort to keep good faith and deliver on its commitment to vocational education and training, decided to use that money to purchase some seven and a half thousand training places via an open tender process, to make sure that the opportunities were there for our young people to undertake vocational training. The focus was on priority groups—that is, older workers, people with a disability and people returning to work—those who really needed to be able to access vocational education and training. The point is that this government has fully maintained its level of commitment to support vocational education and training, despite the lack of support and cooperation from the state and territory governments.</para><para>While this bill is primarily about funding, it provides an opportunity to make some other observations about vocational education and training and about the government's commitment to supporting and strengthening the national VET system. The first point I will make is that in recent years we have seen a very strong growth in VET—that is, vocational education and training—especially in schools. Under this government, since 1996 the number of students undertaking VET courses in schools has trebled from 60,000 to 185,000—a massive increase. We have had an even more rapid increase in school based new apprenticeships, with the number up from 1,500 just six years ago to 14,000 this year. So there has been a very real and positive growth in vocational education and training at the school level and in school based new apprenticeships. </para><para>The other point that needs to be made is that the increase in the focus on vocational education and training is long overdue. It is well and truly time that we focus on the needs of the 70 per cent of young people who do not go to university and who, under previous governments, were almost sidelined in the education process. The focus was very much on academic achievement, on aspiring to university entrance. Sadly, the message was given to many young people that, if they failed to reach university, they were somehow second rate, they were failures. This, unfortunately, left many young people leaving high school frustrated, disillusioned and inadequately prepared for their post-school options.</para><para>This government's determination and efforts to reinvigorate the VET system, particularly VET in Schools, has over the past few years greatly assisted students by broadening their awareness of a range of post-school options and by helping them develop knowledge and skills to help them to make a successful transition from school to work. It is worth pointing out, however, that more work needs to be done in this area, particularly in vocational education and training in schools and at the post school level. We need to continue to focus on raising the status of VET, to again arouse interest in the traditional trades and to correct the perception that they are dirty, dangerous and demeaning—that they are somehow second-rate options.</para><para>The member for Capricornia referred to the issue of skills shortages. The reason for skills shortages is not, as she pointed out, entirely due to the fact that there is not enough money for training or that the government does not want to support people in those skills. One of the problems has been the issue of perception and status. Many young people have been reluctant to pursue traditional trades perhaps because they have not been seen as being fashionable; they have been seen as being dirty, demeaning and dangerous.</para><para>Part of the challenge for any government is to again arouse interest in VET courses and in some of the traditional trades. This government has been committed to trying to raise interest in these areas, because they provide very valuable and worthwhile career opportunities for young people while at the same time helping to meet the skills shortages that we all agree exist. This government has been committed—through, for instance, the National Industry Skills Initiative, the Business Education Partnership Advocates program and the industry project officer program—to developing in young people while they are at school an interest in pursuing traditional trades.</para><para>Another key to arousing this interest is to improve the quality of careers education in this country. If young people are to make considered and appropriate career choices and to take the paths that best suit their skills, their abilities and their interests, they need to have access to the right sort of guidance—guidance that will make them aware of the options that are available and help them choose subjects at school that will give them a start in pursuing those options. In other words, they need sound, appropriate and timely guidance while they are at school. The problem is that the quality of careers education in Australia varies greatly. Some states, particularly New South Wales, have a very professional, structured system with a designated full-time careers adviser in every school and a mandated and well-defined careers education program. Unfortunately, careers advice in many other states is not nearly as well structured or as appropriate to the needs of young people. </para><para>It is important that we improve the quality and the consistency of careers education around this country. While this is largely in the hands of the respective state and territory governments, as they administer their own education systems, the Howard government is also taking steps to try to strengthen careers advice around this country. In February this year, for instance, the Minister for Education, Science and Training announced a professional development package for careers advisers. This includes a best practice resource for all secondary careers teachers, an accredited online course to enhance the skills of those careers teachers and the introduction of an elective career education course as part of bachelor of education undergraduate degree courses for training teachers.</para><para>The minister also announced recently the careers education Lighthouse Schools Program. This is an initiative that will assist schools which have effective careers programs to promote these as models of best practice to other schools so that they can see what is happening and what is working well and take that up as well. The minister has also announced a prize to the value of $2,000 for students undertaking school based apprenticeships or VET in Schools courses. This is again aimed at raising the profile and status of VET in Schools to attract more young people to those areas of study.</para><para>As well, $14 million has been spent this year to support local community partnerships. These partnerships are very important in forming those essential links between schools and the workplace, in providing work placements for students undertaking VET in Schools courses, not only to give them the structured workplace learning experiences and to improve their skill levels but also to make those connections which often will lead to jobs post school. The point is this: this government is strongly committed to supporting and strengthening the vocational education and training system in Australia, both in school and post school. Under this act, funding next year will be close to $1.2 billion, up from $778 million in 1995. That is an increase of around 50 per cent since this government has been in office. </para><para>This government's commitment, in terms of both initiatives and funding, is working. Since coming to office, the number of people in training has grown by 35 per cent, up from 1.27 million to 1.72 million. The number in new apprenticeships has grown by 195 per cent. It is worth pointing out that we now have 416,800 people in traineeships and apprenticeships in this country—treble what it was under Labor—up from 141,400 in 1995. As I said before, under Labor apprenticeships in this country had fallen to a 30-year low. This government has reversed that decline not gradually but dramatically. We now have treble that number in apprenticeships and traineeships. The number of women in VET courses in Australia has increased by 30 per cent. The number of Indigenous students in VET courses has risen dramatically. We now have 95 per cent of Australian schools offering vocational education and training courses.  </para><para>For too long in Australia the focus of education really had ignored the needs of less academic students. For too long we had high school graduates dissatisfied with their school experiences and inadequately prepared for post-school options. For too long we had undertrained young people existing side by side with serious skills shortages, side by side with employers unable to find appropriately qualified and experienced staff. The new initiatives of this government and the increased funding that we have already seen and are committed to will help address these vital issues. I commend this bill to the House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>32632</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In speaking on the <inline ref="R2094">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004</inline>, I support the amendment moved by the member for Capricornia, which I will come to later in my speech. I will comment on some of the remarks by the member for Macquarie. He did acknowledge that there is a skills shortage and that there is some unemployment of mature age workers and young people. I think that the federal Liberal government have to accept some responsibility for that, because they have been in office for eight years now. I do not think it is good enough to simply go back all the time and try to blame the previous Labor government for the problems that they have now. I think that most of those problems have come about because of the current government. </para></talk.start><para>The member for Macquarie also mentioned that the careers adviser structure in New South Wales was good. I was pleased to hear him say that. He is very light on praise for the New South Wales government, so the fact that that system is working well, in his words, is very good. I agree with him that the need for careers advisers at the school level is extremely important, and I am very pleased to see that it is acknowledged that that system is working well in New South Wales. I will take the bait and comment on TAFE fees and simply say that I agree that it is just not acceptable if fees are being increased beyond the reach of the average working person or young person. There is no disagreement there. If there is criticism to be directed at the state government for increases in TAFE fees, then I am one of those who will do that. I think we have to keep TAFE courses within the reach of ordinary people. </para><para>On the legislation itself, last year the states and territories unanimously rejected a Commonwealth proposal for a new ANTA agreement for the years 2004-06. The parties agreed to roll over the current agreement for 12 months while negotiations continued. While the Commonwealth agreed to the rollover, it also decided to impose what I would say are penalties, withholding some $29 million from the states for 2004. That is what this bill is: it is really a penalty for not agreeing with the Howard government, and the states and territories are the ones that are being penalised, along with the people who train in the VET system in those states. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> states that the purpose of this bill is to:</para><para>	... reduce—</para><para>I think `reduce' is an extraordinary word to have in a piece of education legislation; it is not a good look—</para><quote><para>the appropriated limit of total funds for vocational education and training (VET) to be provided to the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) for distribution to the States and Territories for 2004, from $1,136,822,000 to $1,129,418,000 ... </para></quote><para>It further states:</para><para>	appropriate funds for VET to be provided to ANTA for distribution to the States and Territories for the year 2005 up to a limit of $1,148,059,000. </para><para>Let me say again that the purpose of this bill is to cut funding to vocational education and training and that is simply not good enough, particularly taking into account what the member for Macquarie has said—that we do have a skills shortage. I will be expanding on that a bit later on. That sums up the past eight years of the Howard government. After eight years in office they are still cutting education funding. I can only say that this is a disgrace. The failure of the of the Howard government to reach agreement with the states has meant some delay in providing funding to training programs for the more needy groups such as mature age workers and people with disabilities. </para><para>The states' rejection of the Howard government's funding offer of $3.6 billion over three years was outlined in a campus review in January this year. To paraphrase, the review said that negotiations had broken down over a funding shortfall of about $230 million. The states are asking for the Commonwealth package to be increased by at least $348 million to meet the challenges facing the VET sector and to fund the growth that will be required to position our economy into the future.</para><para>Over the last weeks we have been speaking a lot about the free trade agreement with the United States. It is going to require a lot of skill by the Australian work force to benefit from that agreement. At this stage, if we are going to cut funding, I think we are going to find ourselves in a lot of difficulty and unable to maximise the advantages that might flow from that agreement. The states and territories have put the figure for unmet demand at about 57,000 places per year and claim that the government's offer will create only 18,000 places over the three-year life of the agreement. The states are also unhappy, according to the campus review article, because:</para><quote><para>The Commonwealth managed to find some $200 million to help secure passage of its contentious legislation to bring in its Backing Australia's Ability package for universities but could not find extra funds for VET.</para></quote><para>That is the important point: the Commonwealth could not find extra funds for VET. This debate allows the parliament to look at a number of issues relating to VET in Australia and to ask ourselves the question that I will continue to ask during my contribution: why cut funding to this vital sector? Areas that need close examination include the unmet demand, skills shortages and mature age training. The Australian Labor Party intends to address the issue of unmet demand in the area of youth employment and training.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa, stated in his budget reply speech that Labor would abolish fees for secondary school students doing TAFE courses, which would benefit some 7,500 extra students taking up TAFE places. In that speech, the Leader of the Opposition said that every year the skills of more than 45,000 young people who leave school early and do not go into full-time work or study are wasted. That is an important point to remember: 45,000 young people who could be making a contribution to the economy of this country are unable to do so because they have not got the appropriate training. That is one side of it—the economy is suffering—but what about the young people themselves? In many cases they could end up unemployed or in dead-end jobs. This is one of the most important reasons why we need extra funding for vocational education and training. We need it to take up the slack as far as these young people are concerned. Under Labor's plan, an estimated 15,000 extra students will stay at school or take up TAFE courses, thereby placing extra demand on TAFE.</para><para>On the issue of skills shortages, the ACTU advises that the shortage of apprentices in industry is becoming critical and could cost Australia up to $9 billion in lost output over the next decade. I should say at this point that it is not only the ACTU, representing the Australian trade union movement, that is saying this; industry is also saying it. So we have the two major groups in industry—the unions and the employers—both saying the same thing as far as the lack of skills is concerned. The ACTU predicts that 170,000 skilled tradespeople will leave industry over the next decade and that only 40,000 will enter the work force. </para><para>This issue was highlighted in an editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> on 29 July this year. The editorial drew attention to the difficulties of persuading young people to take up apprenticeships—in part because of the initial low wages and also because of the short supply of employers to train them. The editorial was also critical of the Howard government for debasing traditional apprenticeships against modern and, in some cases, low calibre traineeships. I would have to challenge the member for Macquarie on this point, if he suggests that the government is doing well in this area of providing extra apprenticeships. The minister has continually claimed that one of the achievements of the Howard government is that they have concentrated on encouraging young people to take on apprenticeships. He says that the status of apprenticeships must be increased and we should not have to rely totally on people going to universities, because there are good careers for people who serve apprenticeships, become tradespeople and then go on to higher positions in industry.</para><para>I do not think that the government have done enough in this area. I will be referring to what the ACTU has said in its research, and I think that will prove the point that I am making. The ACTU has said that the industry work force is not only ageing—as we all know—but there are also too few traditional apprenticeships coming through in the training system, with the training rate of traditional apprentices declining by 15 per cent since 1987. The ACTU, in documents that I have before me, makes the further point that the federal government are spending a huge amount of money in saying what a good job they are doing, when in fact that does not appear to be the case. I quote from the document, where it states:</para><quote><para>The Federal Government spent $2.3 million in the first 6 months of this year claiming success with its New Apprenticeships program. But traditional trades apprenticeships account for just under one third of New Apprenticeships places and numbers are failing to keep pace with a looming skills shortage in the traditional trades.</para><para>As at 31 March 2004 there were 416,800 apprentices and trainees in training but only 32% of these are traditional trades apprentices. The number of traditional trades apprentices was 133,376.</para></quote><para>This is a major problem: we appear to be pushing traineeships through, almost like a sausage machine, and ignoring real training, which, I would say, is a four- to five-year apprenticeship and the appropriate on-the-job training and vocational education and training to go with it. That is what produces proper tradesmen and skilled people for this country. I would like to quote again from the ACTU document:</para><quote><para>A major problem with the New Apprenticeships program is that the financial incentives paid to employers by the Federal Government are biased against traditional trades apprentices.</para><para>Under the New Apprentices program the same payments are paid to both apprentices and trainees—$1375 for a commencement and $2750 for a completion, or a total of $4125.</para><para>But some traineeships can be completed in one year, compared to a four year term of a metal, electrical, or construction apprenticeship.</para></quote><para>The suggestion there is that employers are going for short-term traineeships because of the extra money involved and ignoring traditional four- to five-year apprenticeships. Dr Phillip Toner, who I believe is from the University of Western Sydney, is quoted in this ACTU document. He said: </para><quote><para>The payments do not recognise the much greater investment of time and effort on the part of an apprentice employer. In theory, an employer could get four cycles of commencement and completion payments for trainees in the same time it takes an employer of an apprentice to get one cycle.</para></quote><para>That is the point I am making. The ACTU document continues:</para><quote><para>Dr Toner also points out that the additional $1100 incentives for employers in areas where there are skill shortages are limited to only those employers in non-metropolitan regions. But in NSW, for example, around 75% of all apprentices are located in metropolitan areas.</para></quote><para>While it is good to give employers in regional areas an incentive to take on apprentices, to some extent it is rather a waste because the demand is not there—the industry is not there in the regional areas and, in many cases, the young people are not there. The young people are in the cities, and industry is in the cities. So for that incentive to be of any value it should also apply to industries in the metropolitan areas. The ACTU document continues:</para><quote><para>On a broader level, Dr Toner argues that industrial relations changes that have reduced the scope of awards and promoted individual agreements have also contributed to the decline in the training of apprentices.</para></quote><para>I believe that is another indication of where the government's industrial relations policies are retarding the number of people being trained in industry. The ACTU calls on the federal government to:</para><para>	Commit to directly employing more apprentices and ensuring Government tenders require contractors to also create additional structured training places;</para><para>	Provide mentoring support for young apprentices;</para><para>	Establish partnership initiatives within enterprises to encourage and support the uptake of structured industry training including additional apprentice pathways for young people and mature aged workers in skill shortage areas and to supplement and increase apprentice wages for both young people and assured workers; and</para><para>	Supplement and increase apprentice wages or both young people and mature aged workers.</para><para>I would like to return to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> editorial I was referring to prior to quoting from the ACTU document. It calls for a 50 per cent increase in funding for all forms of training, and it concludes by saying—and this is rather a powerful statement:</para><quote><para>A government able to offer cash bribes to voters for having children will be swindling just those children if it is not putting down money now to see that they get the education they will need as young adults.</para></quote><para>I think that is a very true statement. The need for a highly skilled work force is further emphasised in an article in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 13 July entitled `Australia in the technology vanguard', which refers to the enthusiastic use of technology by Australian businesses. But the article makes the point that there is an urgent need for highly skilled workers to drive this technology: it is no good having technology if you do not have the skilled workers to drive it.</para><para>The other area I want to refer to is the increased demand on TAFE to retrain mature-age workers who seek to re-enter the work force or move to new positions with their existing employer. Labor has committed $212 million to help older Australians in the work force. Part of Labor's plan is to set up career centres and deploy workplace trainers in key industries. It is reported that a third of Australians aged between 50 and 64 are on income support, and nearly half are not in the work force at all. So this is another area of demand for vocational education and training. This is clearly an economic loss to the Australian economy and will require a greater vocational education role to rectify the problem. Instead, what do we get from this government? This bill, which actually cuts funding in the next year. As I have said, this is a disgrace. In urging an agreement on ANTA funding, the predictions are for continued job growth and greater diversity in the use of technology by Australian industry, resulting in the need for increased VET resources to meet this demand. I think the amendment moved by the member for Capricornia should be supported, because the five points there really cover the arguments that I have put to the House tonight. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>32636</page.no><name role="metadata">Ticehurst, Kenneth, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TICEHURST</name><name.id>00ANF</name.id><electorate>Dobell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In speaking for the <inline ref="R2094">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004</inline>, I draw the attention of members to a hallmark feature of Australia's highly successful vocational education and training system—that is, the growth of new apprenticeships and their diffusion throughout the work force. The member for Greenway talked about long apprenticeships. Going way back, I was apprenticed as an electrical fitter for four years but in those days, rather than having to do the trade course, I did an electrical engineering certificate at tech. Now employers are talking to us about having reduced apprenticeship terms and learning specific trades for their industry.</para></talk.start><para>The industry is much broader now than it was back in the sixties and seventies. Also, apprenticeships are not really restricted to the cities; regional areas have them. In my area of Dobell, we have many firms that are involved in apprenticeships, manufacturing and service industries. The modern and flexible new apprenticeships system is a vital part of the government's strategy for meeting the skill needs of Australia's industry. This bill provides ongoing funds for vocational education and training, including for the training of new apprentices. The Minister for Education, Science and Training, in introducing the bill, spoke of the 195 per cent increase in numbers of new apprenticeships since 1995. It now stands at over 416,800 in training at the end of March 2004. In fact, new apprentices accounted for around 15 per cent of the total number participating nationally in vocational education and training in 2003.</para><para>This growth is in direct response to industry's needs for skilled workers. It is not just absolute numbers that the program is achieving; employers are embracing higher skill levels, with 85 per cent of all new apprentices in training participating at the certificate III level or higher. People in regional areas have increased significantly their participation in new apprenticeships to more than 98,000 places for people in rural and remote areas, compared with fewer than 40,000 in 1995. It is notable too that, while new apprenticeships have increased for all age groups, proportionate growth has been strongest for people aged 40 years and over, where numbers have increased almost sevenfold in the six years to March 2004. This is an important achievement.</para><para>The reskilling of mature aged workers, including through new apprenticeships, helps in positioning industry to address the labour force changes of the future. Local training organisations, such as the Central Coast Community College, Uniting Church and Wyong Workwise, have been doing a great job providing older workers with training in information technology under the government's BITS program. The number of Indigenous people participating in new apprenticeships has experienced a dramatic increase, with nearly 8,500 in training at present compared to 1,380 in 1995. Today, new apprenticeships are available in more than 500 occupations, covering emerging technologies, such as electro-technology and information technology as well as traditional trades. </para><para>In my electorate of Dobell, vocational education and training is of paramount importance. More than 70 per cent of school leavers in Dobell choose not to go to university. We need to provide them with opportunities to gain the skills and trades that lay a foundation for their future. Last year, there were 2,300 new apprenticeships in Dobell. This compares to 650 new apprentices in Dobell in 1995, when Labor was last in government. Central Coast Group Training is doing a fantastic job promoting group training as an option for business in my electorate. That especially applies to small business and increasingly the number of new apprentices in group training.</para><para>Group training is a uniquely Australian concept whereby an organisation employs a new apprentice under a training contract and places them with host employers. Today, there are more than 37,500 new apprentices in training with group training organisations across Australia. The group training industry is the single largest employer of apprentices and trainees. Central Coast Group Training are doing a great job at improving the quality and breadth of training available to new apprentices, particularly in small- and medium-sized businesses, and I commend them for their efforts.</para><para>It is great to see my local schools also getting involved in providing VET opportunities for their students. Over 80 students in year 11 at Wadalba high school are involved in group training. Also, McKillop catholic school at Warnervale has many school students involved in VET programs. The Central Coast campus—which provides a unique learning centre in that it contains a university, a TAFE and a community college as well as some operational small businesses—has also been working hard to expand the educational and VET training opportunities for its students. Our local work force reaps the benefit of having school leavers who are ready for duties. In fact, the number of school students undertaking training has grown by 97 per cent since 1997, reflecting the huge success of vocational education in schools programs. This is now available in more than 95 per cent of Australian secondary schools.</para><para>Across Australia, new apprenticeships have more than doubled since Labor was in office. In June 2003, 396,000 were in training compared to only 135,000 in 1995. We do not need to go back to that. Funding under the VET Funding Act in 1995 was $777.9 million. For 2005, under this bill, it will be $1.48 billion, which is a huge increase. Despite the successes achieved by the program so far, which are in stark contrast to the poor VET results of Labor, the Australian Labor Party still has the nerve to criticise our vocational education and training system even though it continues to go from strength to strength.</para><para>An example of the Australian government's steadfast commitment to VET is its funding of a major new apprenticeships advertising campaign in 2003 and 2004 to continue to address potential skill shortages. Early indications are that the campaign has been highly successful, with a record number of calls to the new apprenticeships information 1800 number and record hits to the new apprenticeships web site. Most importantly, the success of the campaign was evident by the number of new apprenticeship commencements in trade and related occupations. Commencements in the March 2004 quarter were up by 43 per cent over the same period in the previous year. It just goes to show the power of positive advertising. New apprenticeships are vital to ensure the future economic prosperity of my local region and of our nation, and continuing financial support for the training of new apprentices is provided in the bill presently before the House. </para><para>In conclusion, since 1996 the coalition government has reinvigorated vocational education and training, with record numbers in training, record numbers in new apprenticeships and significant progress made toward developing a high-quality, truly national system. This year the Australian government will spend a record $2.1 billion on vocational education and training, underpinning the nation's strong economic growth and low unemployment. Since coming to power, this government has revived Australia's vocational education and training system. The numbers in training have grown from 1.27 million in 1995 to over 1.7 million, an increase of 35 per cent. The numbers in new apprenticeships have grown by 195 per cent. There are 416,800 new apprentices in training in more than 500 different occupations. This is up from 141,400 in 1995—a most creditable achievement. Since 1996, the number of women in VET has grown by 30 per cent, to 812,900. The number of Indigenous students has grown by 85 per cent over the same period, while 43 per cent of VET clients are now in rural and regional Australia.</para><para>As a result of the coalition government's investment in training and direct assistance to employers of new apprentices, Australian employers are spending more on training their apprentices than ever before. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, employers are expending 52 per cent more on training than they were in 1996. Vocational education and training, along with increased training opportunities for Australians, is the key to strengthening our competitiveness and bringing about improved performance and better opportunities for employers and employees. It also assists industries in providing the skills and the training that they need and is crucial to economic development and job creation. The Australian government has played a leadership role, and will continue to play a leadership role, in the overall direction and strategies needed to develop a skilled Australian work force. I commend this bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>32638</page.no><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name><name.id>JH5</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2094">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 </inline>amends the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Act that we debated in this chamber last year. Under that amendment act, the minister made appropriations in anticipation of the states and territories agreeing to the new ANTA agreement. I was surprised by the minister's level of optimism, for when the details of the new ANTA agreement for 2004-06 were released the state ministers were highly critical, pledging that they would fight collectively for a much fairer deal for the vocational education and training system in this country. They argued, quite rightly, that the offer put on the table by the minister was inadequate, particularly in the context of a nation facing severe skill shortages and the legacy of unmet demand. Interestingly enough, the TAFE directors had estimated that they needed an additional $345 million a year to cope with unmet demand in the system, but at the time they were being offered a meagre $100 million a year. That came on top of years when the TAFE system and the VET system were trying to cope with the pressure of unmet demand and at a time when funds for enrolment growth were frozen. If not frozen, then for several years growth had to be met through what were termed `efficiency savings'.</para></talk.start><para>It seemed to me at the time that there was little chance of the new agreement being accepted, precisely because the government had failed to deliver a proper level of funding to cope with enrolment growth in the system. Not surprisingly, the states and territories formally rejected the Commonwealth's offer in December last year, and we are now told that negotiations will resume in October this year in anticipation that they might reach agreement on the ANTA agreement for the next several years. I find it amazing that the government totally underestimated the strength of the view that was being expressed by the states and territories about this very important area of training and education. This is an important area to our economy. Also, as we know, the VET system is very important in terms of the opportunities it can deliver to young people, particularly those who are unemployed. </para><para>Tonight we are facing a situation where we now have a formal rejection by the states and territories. It is absolutely appalling that a government that professes commitment to this important sector could allow this to occur. It occurs at a time when we know that 15,000 young Australians miss out on a TAFE place each year even though they satisfy entry requirements. It occurs at a time when Australia is facing a severe skill shortage in key trades and industries—and that is comprehensively backed up by the data and research that are presented by the government's own department. And it occurs at a time when everybody in the community knows that unemployment among workers without a post secondary school qualification is three times higher than for those with such a qualification.</para><para>It just does not make sense. We have high unemployment, particularly in regional areas, among young people; we have a growing and acute skill shortage, which is going to get worse; and we have a situation where everybody knows that, the more post school qualifications one can get access to, the better one's life chances will be. The government's own national skill shortage list reports, year after year, that the economy is facing acute shortages across a range of traditional trade occupations. These occupations include metal fabricators, motor mechanics, auto-electricians, panel beaters, electricians, bricklayers, plumbers, chefs, cabinet-makers and hairdressers. This is not just advice that this side of the House gives to the government; the government's own department produces these skill shortage lists. But it seems the government takes no notice of them.</para><para>There has to be something seriously wrong for the government to be fiddling around while Rome burns. You need only look at the recommendations of a comprehensive inquiry conducted by the Senate and the report that it presented, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Brid</inline><inline font-style="italic">ging the skills divide</inline>, to understand the seriousness of the situation facing the nation. If not adequately addressed, the current and projected skill shortages threaten Australia's future economic development. Let me repeat that it is absurd that, at a time when more than one in five teenagers are looking for full-time work—and in my region that ratio is even higher, where we have unemployment rates for young people looking for full-time work at around the 30 per cent mark—and we have in this country almost 400,000 job seekers who have been on unemployment benefits for more than 12 months and we have businesses screaming out for skilled workers, the government is, as I said, fiddling while Rome burns.</para><para>The advice that has been given to the government by its own department is echoed in sentiments expressed by employer organisations. Employer organisations made submissions to the Senate inquiry, and I will quote a few of them. The Australian Industry Group, in its submission to the Senate inquiry, said that `over half of the businesses surveyed faced skills shortages'. Another employer organisation, ACCI, said: </para><quote><para>Australian firms are greatly concerned at their incapacity to recruit employees with appropriate levels of skills and retaining skilled employees, with such pressures being particularly acute in regional and rural Australia.</para></quote><para>Recent research by the Australian Council of Trade Unions estimates that the growing shortage of skilled workers in the traditional trades will cost the Australian economy up to $9 billion in lost output over the next 10 years. These sentiments highlight a very severe failure on the part of this government to address one of the great crises facing the economy and our nation. The amendment moved by the member for Capricornia rightly points to the failures of government policy on a number of fronts.</para><para>I want to make some comments about the way I see the government's failure manifesting itself. First, the minister comes into this place quite often and berates the Labor Party for allegedly professing no concern about the issue of apprenticeships. I heard tonight the member for Dobell reiterate the spurious claims that are made by the government. The government constantly argues that the number of people undertaking apprenticeships and traineeships has doubled. But what the minister does not say and what the member for Dobell did not say was that the growth has predominantly been in traineeships and in areas where there are no skills shortages, such as in the retail fast food sector and in private security.</para><para>It is a totally different picture when you look at the traditional trades. I know from data that I was able to access that, in New South Wales, between 2000 and 2002, 6,654 new traineeships were created. That was an increase of about 22 per cent. But in exactly the same period in New South Wales, traditional apprenticeships in the trades declined by eight per cent—down by some 1,187 traditional trade apprenticeships. These figures from New South Wales reflect the trend in the Illawarra and, I dare say, in many regional areas, where the problem is even more acute. In my area, traditional trade apprenticeships declined in that period by 10 per cent, while traineeships grew by 11 per cent. So all this hype about doubling the number of people in the new apprenticeship system really masks the reality that the growth has been in the traineeship area in those occupations where the country is facing no skill shortages while, at the same time, we are facing a very severe crisis due to the decline in the number of young people in the traditional trades.</para><para>In my view, the second failure in government policy is that the national training dollar has not been targeted at addressing acute skill shortages. Despite what the minister says, the reality shows a totally different picture. In the first six months of this year, this government spent $2.3 million claiming success with its New Apprenticeships program. But traditional trade apprenticeships account for just under one-third of all new apprenticeship places and the numbers are failing to keep pace with existing—let alone looming—shortages. As at 31 March this year, there were 416,800 apprentices and trainees in training. That looks a good outcome but, when you look behind these figures, you see that only 32 per cent of these are in traditional trade apprenticeships. The number of traditional trade apprentices in training was 133,376 out of the 416,800 people in the new apprenticeship system.</para><para>So let us make it quite clear in this debate that all the self-congratulation about the wonders of the new apprenticeship system really masks the reality that the huge growth is in traineeships in areas where there are no skills shortages but we are going backwards at an almighty rate in areas where government intervention is sorely needed. </para><para>In October last year in a grievance debate on the issue of youth unemployment I made reference to research undertaken by Dr Toner from the University of Western Sydney. It is a very important study, but a study that it seems the minister has made no particular effort to get on top of. Its findings point to the seriousness of the skill shortage problem that this nation faces. I want to raise a couple of findings from that study. The Toner study shows that there was a decline of about 16 per cent in the apprentice training rate in the decade from 1993 onwards. By `training rate' he means the number of apprentices in training compared with employed tradespersons—that is, the ratio of those in training to the number of people out there working in the trades.</para><para>Dr Toner's analysis shows that the major declines were in metal trades and in electrical and electronic trades—a 19 per cent decline in metals and close to a 25 per cent decline in electrical and electronics. His study shows that the number of apprentices in training also declined from 1993 onwards by an average of 15 per cent. He argues—and this is self-evident—that these declining training rates have reduced a source of full-time job opportunities offering good career paths for young people. What was interesting about Dr Toner's analysis was his argument that, if the training rate for each of the trade occupations for the period up to 1992 had been maintained in 2001, there would have been an additional 21,700 apprentices in training in 2001. The decline in those opportunities has meant the loss of about 21,700 apprentices in training. And that was back in 2001, so no doubt the figure is now much higher.</para><para>Of those positions, the analysis goes on to argue, 80 per cent of those positions that have been lost would have been filled by young people under the age of 25. That means that nearly 19,000 additional apprenticeship opportunities would have been available for young people between 15 and 24 had the training rate been maintained at earlier levels. His paper goes on to rightly argue that a broad range of solutions are required to redress the problem, including lifting the level of employer investment in training, adjusting incentive and subsidy arrangements and ensuring better entry level steps on the supply side.</para><para>So it seems to me that this current minister is absolutely missing the point. There is no point arguing the wonders and the virtues of the new apprenticeship system at a time when we are facing an absolute national crisis in the numbers of apprentices in training in the traditional trade areas that are so important to Australia's future economic progress. With the loss of around 22,000 apprentices in training as far back as 2001, is it any wonder that the nation is in this terrible predicament?</para><para>In a recent article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 22 July this year, it was noted that in a recent skilled vacancy index prepared by the minister's own department the following outcomes were revealed: that job vacancies for tradespeople had reached a 15-year high and that trade vacancies had risen 20 per cent in the past year to their highest level since September 1989. Something is going drastically wrong, and no amount of money and no amount of glossy advertising on TV can mask the fundamental problem that this government has failed to grasp: that this nation is in the grip of a serious and severe skill shortage that is even worse in rural and regional Australia.</para><para>What we need to understand is that the age profile of workers with traditional trade skills is changing sharply, with a far higher proportion of older workers and without the pool of younger people coming in to replace them when they retire. You have to ask: where are the new apprentices to fill the gap? The Toner study shows that the numbers in training have severely eroded over the period covered by his study. What impact will all of this have on business investment? I know that in Western Australia, for example, there are a number of substantial construction projects that are due to occur. But even the government there is saying that they have severe reservations about the capacity to fulfil this investment because of the absence of skilled people to take on that work. According to a recent ACTU study that I looked at the other day, the skill shortage in traditional trades is set to cost our economy up to $735 million a year in lost output and almost $9 billion in estimates over the next 10 years. </para><para>In concluding, I want to make some comments about my own region. We have been battling in the Illawarra to try and address the crisis of a high rate of youth unemployment—which hovers around the 30 per cent mark—at a time when all our local businesses tell us that currently there are emerging skills shortages that are foreshadowed to be even worse. Yet this is a region that has relied historically on a strong and viable manufacturing base. In cooperation with the unions, the employer organisations, the group training companies and a whole raft of interested people who want to address this problem, we sought from the minister a commitment to some funding to provide incentives to businesses in our area to take on a young apprentice. The minister has no problem spending millions of dollars promoting the new apprenticeship system and masking the truth from people. But when it came to actually funding a real project in an area with real needs we got no response from the minister.</para><para>The only response we have had from this government to date has been a commitment from the then Minister for Employment Services to provide $100,000 from the government's innovation fund. I think we are doing wonderful things with $100,000, but imagine how much more we could do if the minister and the government stopped putting money into promoting their so-called doubling of new apprenticeship places and actually funded local regions that have their own solutions to their own problems. It is an indictment of this government that when constructive solutions have been put forward to them they have met with such a paltry response. In conclusion, I support the amendment moved by my colleague the member for Capricornia condemning the government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>32642</page.no><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name><name.id>00AKI</name.id><electorate>Dickson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to offer my support for the <inline ref="R2094">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 </inline>currently before the House. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992 to, firstly, provide funds for vocational education and training in 2005 under the Australian National Training Authority agreement and, secondly, update the current funding limits for 2004 to reflect the outcome of earlier negotiations on a new ANTA agreement. The government are committed to vocational education and training, as demonstrated by the following initiatives. We are building effective pathways from school to employment for the 70 per cent of school leavers who do not go directly to university from school; we are providing an industry training framework which meets the needs of Australian business to become world competitive; we are ensuring that New Apprentices—apprentices and trainees—receive nationally recognised qualifications; and we are expanding the number of training opportunities for young people.</para></talk.start><para>It is all very well and good to talk about initiatives—even the Labor Party can manage that—but the real test is providing results for such initiatives, and we all know that this is something the Labor Party just cannot do. Real results for vocational education and training under this Howard government include the following. In 2002, one in nine working age Australians did training leading to a nationally recognised qualification. There are more than twice as many people doing vocational education and training as there are university students. In 2002, a total of 1.7 million people were undertaking vocational education and training—a staggering 138 per cent increase since the Labor Party ended its term of government in 1996. In December 2003, there were 406,900 New Apprentices in training—an increase of 10 per cent from the previous December and almost three times the number under the Labor government of 1996. In 2002, over 185,500 students were participating in VET in Schools. </para><para>These initiatives are in stark contrast to the case when Labor was in government. Apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the working age population declined in Labor's last two years to the lowest level for at least two decades. When the Labor Party was last in office, New Apprenticeships were less than half what they are today. There were 135,000 places in 1995 compared to over 406,900 in training in December 2003. Labor has failed to put forward any comprehensive policy on vocational education and training. In its Aim Higher policy document released in July 2003, Labor promised to create 20,000 TAFE places over four years at a total cost of $88½ million. Not surprisingly, analysis by the Department of Education, Science and Training suggests that this costing carries a shortfall of $11½ million.</para><para>However, it has to be said that it is not just the federal Labor Party that is noncommittal to providing vocational education and training. When the Howard government offered a new threeyear ANTA agreement to the states and territories in May last year, it was rejected by all the states and territories in December.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name></talker><para>—Shame!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AKI</name.id><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name></talker><para>—It is a shame. By refusing this agreement, the state and territory governments rejected an additional $220 million of funding and effectively said they were not interested in providing the 71,000 new training places the offer would have created.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, I would like to draw your attention to this government's continual efforts in tackling skill shortages. The Howard government play a leadership role in determining the overall direction and strategies to develop a skilled Australian work force. Skill shortages are an ongoing concern to industry, particularly in the traditional trades like engineering, electrotechnology and building and construction but now also in emerging technologies such as photonics and nanotechnology. That said, skill shortages exist at most stages of the business cycle in skilled occupations, and they are also a sign of a thriving and open economy. Skill gaps arise, for example, in new innovative industries and sectors of more traditional industries that are changing rapidly to meet new consumer and technological demands and to develop new products and services in a highly competitive international market. The causes of skill shortages are complex, hence the solutions are not easy, but the government are committed to high quality, nationally consistent education and training and to working closely with industry to find solutions.</para><para>Industry is increasingly recognising that an investment in skills is critical to its bottom line, and I am pleased to say that employer expenditure on training rose by more than 50 per cent over the six years from 1996 to 2002. Over that same period, the proportion of businesses providing some training for their employees rose from 61 per cent to over 80 per cent. Over the last three years, the Howard government have contributed over $11 million to the National Industry Skills Initiative—an industry led process which identifies the steps that industry, government and the partnership of the two can take to redress industry skills shortages. So far, 11 industry sectors have examined their needs and developed detailed action plans which address issues as diverse as the retention of skilled workers, career pathways and attracting young people into New Apprenticeships. </para><para>The government have spent over $3 million on innovative careers materials in a variety of skill shortage areas, such as rural and regional industries, manufacturing, automotive, building and construction, cookery, aviation and aerospace. In April this year, the Howard government launched the National Skills Shortages Strategy. This strategy sets out a new approach to tackling skill shortages, building on the previous work but also going beyond this to incorporate new strategies and address skills more widely needed.</para><para>Working closely with industry, education providers and local communities, the government will establish a New Apprentices roundtable to get feedback on what encourages or discourages those who consider taking careers in the trades. It will allow greater flexibility in traditional trades training. New approaches to New Apprenticeships in key skill shortage industries will be tested, such as shorter apprenticeships in the building and construction and automotive retail service and repair industries, and specialised apprenticeship pathways in the housing sector of the building and construction industry. </para><para>Skill shortages on a regional basis will be addressed. Industries will be encouraged and assisted to `adopt a school'—regularly meeting with school students, their careers advisers and their teachers to broaden their understanding of trade industries. Through fast tracked training programs involving people with relevant existing skills, mature-age workers, parents returning to work and people looking for a career change will be especially targeted towards New Apprenticeships. The government will also promote science and emerging technologies careers to highlight the diverse range of science related career options that are on offer to VET and higher education students. It will also establish a national taskforce to undertake labour market projections, helping industry to better plan for the future.</para><para>In conclusion, since 1996 the Howard coalition government has reinvigorated vocational education and training, with record numbers in training, record numbers in new apprenticeships and with significant progress being made toward developing a high-quality truly national system. This year the Howard government will spend a record $2.1 billion on vocational education and training, underpinning the nation's strong economic growth and low unemployment. In 1995 funding under the VET Funding Act was almost $778 million; for 2005 under this bill it will be a staggering $1.148 billion.</para><para>Vocational education and training provides opportunities for the 70 per cent of young people who do not enter university straight from school. Today 12 per cent of Australia's working age population is in VET training. Since coming to power, this government has reinvigorated the vocational education and training system. The numbers in training have grown from 1.27 million in 1995 to over 1.72 million, an increase of 35 per cent. The numbers in new apprenticeships have grown by 195 per cent, with 416,800 new apprentices in training in more than 500 different occupations—up from 141,400 places in 1995. </para><para>It needs to be said as part of the debate today that, since 1996, the number of women in VET training has grown by 30 per cent to 812,900, the number of Indigenous students has grown by 85 per cent over the same period and 43 per cent of VET clients are now in rural and regional Australia. The number of school students undertaking training has grown by an incredible 97 per cent since 1997. This reflects the huge success of vocational education in school programs, which are now available in more than 95 per cent of Australian secondary schools. As a result of the coalition government's involvement and investment in training and direct assistance to employers of new apprentices, employers are spending more on training their employees than ever before. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, employers are spending 52 per cent more on training than they were in 1996.</para><para>This portfolio, ably run by the Minister for Education, Science and Training, has seen a seismic shift in culture in the attitude taken by people towards students exiting schools and going on to universities. This government has been very much about saying to students, `You have options available to you.' The option is not just that they go to university or be seen as a failure; the opportunities extend far beyond that. If somebody wants to go into a school based apprenticeship or to become involved in any of these programs that I have spoken about tonight, the opportunities exist for them to choose to develop whatever program might be best to serve them in their longterm employment interests. This government, which I have been very proud to be a part of over the last three years, has been about providing these options to young Australians. In my view, for far too long in this country young Australians have been told that if they left school—and certainly this was the case when I left school in the late eighties—and did not go on to a university education, they were somehow a failure to their family, their local community and their country.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name></talker><para>—Rubbish.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AKI</name.id><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name></talker><para>—It was, as the member for Morton says, rubbish.

I am very proud of that fact, because there are some difficult regions within the electorate of Dickson; some areas are economically disadvantaged and some are socially disadvantaged.

It is a quality school that gives the students who attend it a rounded education. Floraville is a school that believes in instilling values in the children that attend it. It instils in all students a love of the environment, of sport, of learning and of Australia. On Friday, 23 July, I attended Floraville school's National Tree Day activities. It was a culmination of several years of wishing, planning, consulting and collaborating with the community and the students. More than 600 volunteers planted over 600 plants, including nearly 500 grasses and 135 trees. Over 500 students, their teachers, parents, grandparents—and, yes, me too—were all involved in this project. I was given special permission to plant three trees as all the other trees were planted by the students.</para></talk.start><para>The focal point of the area that was being restored was the frog pond, because it is a frog pond reserve. It is a habitat area that was previously a waste area. It had been overgrown with kikuyu, bitou bush and lantana. I would like to pay special credit to Rose Chesterfield, who has instilled a love of the environment in all the students at Floraville Public School. It is little wonder that Floraville Public School is involved in Waterwatch and that the school has won the Lake Macquarie schools environment award and the New South Wales Gould League award for media and research for seven years.</para><para>Floraville Public School also teaches its students to love Australia. That is why the school decided to erect a flagpole to proudly fly the Australian flag. The school was delighted to learn that the Howard government had promised to pay for all schools to have a flagpole erected. But this delight turned to dismay as Floraville Public School tried to make the minister deliver on his promise. It is a rather interesting saga. The school contacted my office and we duly contacted the Minister for Education, Science and Training's office. We were fobbed off, but were eventually given an email address. Unfortunately, that email address was the wrong address. Then the school tried contacting the minister's office, emailing the office something like eight or nine times. There was no response from the minister.</para><para>By this stage the school was becoming very distressed because they had been so excited that the government had promised that it would deliver flagpoles to schools. I thought, `This just can't be right.' The Minister's office told the school to get into contact with the Department of Education and Training in Sydney. I believe that at one time the minister's office advised the school that it was a state government responsibility. This was quite contrary to what the minister had told this House and led the school to believe. On 27 July, a school representative visited my office yet again to tell me what had been happening and about the school's concern. I was told that the school was not going to give in; it was going to fight to get a flagpole for Floraville Public School. The school's determination paid off. Eventually, on 29 July, the school was given an application form to apply for funding.</para><para>The saga does not end there, because the school had to agree to all the accompanying conditions. They had to report the funding and installation of the pole, install a plaque saying that the Australian government had funded it and that it was a gift from the Australian government and invite Senator Tierney to attend a flag raising ceremony. As a secondary thought, they had to provide a tax invoice and a copy of the receipt. Floraville's flagpole was erected last weekend, and the Australian flag finally flew for the first time yesterday. But what a farce. This epitomises the Howard government's approach to education: politics, first; schools and education, second. Congratulations, Floraville, on your persistence. It paid dividends. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Paterson Electorate: Health Services</title><page.no>32647</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>32647</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On 4 August I raised the issue of the after-hours general practitioner services which operate at hospitals in the Hunter. I also raised concerns that, whilst they were funded through to the end of June 2005, there was, as part of the contract negotiations, an evaluation process that was to be undertaken. With the delays in the evaluation, it would have meant that the after-hours GP service would have been wound up in March 2005 so that they could make the financial allowances for redundancy and termination pays. This is an excellent example of serving the community, and I fully support the after-hours GP service.</para></talk.start><para>In fact, as I stated in my speech in this House, since October 1999 almost 85,000 people have been seen as in-patients, some 67,000 people have obtained medical advice from the hotline and 800 home visits have been made by doctors. This is an outstanding service. To give you an idea of the benefits of supporting after-hours GP services based at hospitals, we have seen a reduction in triage categories 4 and 5 patients during clinic hours at emergency departments co-located with the new GPs after-hours clinics over the 12 months of service operation. That is not in my electorate. There was a 38.9 per cent reduction at Belmont Hospital and an 18.4 per cent reduction at the John Hunter Hospital, where people in my electorate go. No figures were provided for the Maitland Hospital. This arrangement provides high-quality care. As an example, some 47 per cent of patients were seen at or before their scheduled appointment times from Monday to Friday, 44 per cent on Saturdays and 37 per cent on Sundays. Some 92 per cent of all patients are seen within 30 minutes of their scheduled appointment time. There have been 213 commendations received during the first 12 months of service and, importantly, this service has always operated within its budget.</para><para>I appreciate the efforts of our Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, and the Prime Minister, who today signed off on extending the funding by 12 months, through to June 2006. We welcome this funding announcement because it means that the evaluation can continue without disrupting the service. I spoke today to Dr Chris Boyle, Chairman of the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice, and I said to him, as I said to Dr Arn Sprogis when this issue was first raised, that I would deliver, that the funding would be there and that the service would not have to shut down. It is a good day when we as representatives of our communities are able to achieve things on these projects.</para><para>Quality health care is important in my community, and I believe that quality research is also important to back up that health care. We have an outstanding facility in the Hunter called the Hunter Medical Research Institute. In a speech in support of the budget, I outlined that the federal government committed $5 million to help build the new Hunter Medical Research Institute. This is the only regionally based comprehensive health and medical research institute in Australia. It was established back in 1998 as a partnership between Hunter Health, the University of Newcastle and the Hunter community. It has more than 350 researchers, who work in the key areas of brain and mental health, cancer, cardiovascular health, health behaviour and public health, mothers and babies, vaccines, immunity, viruses and asthma. </para><para>Importantly, let us measure the institute's success. The institute is responsible for the discovery of a compound found in green leafy vegetables which stops cancer cell growth; the discovery of a placental clock that decides when a baby will be born; the establishment of a $12 million national centre of excellence in reproductive biotechnology; and the development of new vaccines for common infections.</para><para>A highlight in recent weeks was the efforts of Dr Darren Shafren. His amazing work is an example of what is happening in the Hunter region. He has been working on using the common cold virus as a treatment for melanoma. Lab results have shown success, with an injection of the virus destroying melanoma cells. The work is being described as a safe and effective treatment for malignant melanoma, breast and prostate cancers, and may have wider applications to ovarian, colorectal and lymphoid related cancers. It was announced last week that the University of Newcastle Research Associates, known as TUNRA, have signed a licensing agreement worth around $10 million with biotechnology company Psiron to develop anticancer treatments.</para><para>This is a new direction for the people of the Hunter; it is a new face, a new image. The problem is we have been waiting for the state Labor government in New South Wales to provide their $5 million in funding. I now call on that funding. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Western Highway</title><page.no>32648</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>32648</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this evening to speak on an issue that affects people in my electorate on a daily basis. Every morning and night, thousands of residents from Ballarat, Bacchus Marsh, Ballan and Gordon fight through the intersection at Deer Park on the Western Highway. Stuck with them in this bottleneck are millions of dollars worth of goods sitting on the backs of trucks waiting to be unloaded at their destinations in Melbourne or starting the long haul to Adelaide. This piece of road is not just some backstreet local road. This is a national highway between Adelaide and Melbourne, second only to the Hume Highway between Melbourne and Sydney for national haulage—and it is the Commonwealth government's responsibility to fund and maintain. It in one of the most dangerous pieces of road in Victoria, with over 139 accidents along the Western Highway between the Western Ring Road and Anthony's Cutting since July 2003.</para></talk.start><para>Commuters in my electorate have been waiting for years for this government to commit the full $294 million funding required for the construction of the Deer Park bypass. So on Monday, 7 June, when the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads unveiled the government's supposed nation-building AusLink, thousands of local commuters and I held our collective breaths for the announcement of full funding for the Deer Park bypass. But what did we get? We got $40 million for a $294 million project. On closer inspection, it was $40 million to start not next year but in 2007-08 and 2008-09, with no funding to finish the project. Like all announcements from this government, you need to look even closer and read the fine print. Buried in small writing was the fact that the government would seek further funding from the state government to complete the project. So on that Monday the Commonwealth government gave the Deer Park bypass $40 million to finish a $294 million project, with a request to the state government to help fund this national highway, a road that is the responsibility of the Commonwealth government to fund and maintain. </para><para>Quite rightly, the Victorian Minister for Transport said on the Wednesday that the state government could not assist the Commonwealth government to build a road that was 100 per cent a Commonwealth responsibility. In a backflip that would do any gymnast at the Athens Olympics proud, the minister for roads changed his mind yet again. By Friday he was saying that the Commonwealth would not seek funding from the state government for the Deer Park bypass but it would be subject to future Commonwealth budgets. So, between Monday and Friday, funding for the construction of the Deer Park bypass was a responsibility of the Commonwealth then of the Commonwealth and the states, and then, following an outcry on the Wednesday, responsibility was transferred back to the Commonwealth government, but with no commitment to fully fund it. Minister, you cannot start a project this size unless you know you have got the money to finish it.</para><para>During this period of uncertainty by the government we saw a display of complete arrogance from the Liberal Party. The previous member for Ballarat, Michael Ronaldson, now in the No. 1 spot on the Victorian Liberals Senate ticket—a position that guarantees his election to the Senate—labelled the reaction of the local Ballarat community to what was a disappointing announcement as `a dummy spit'. In a letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> on Wednesday, 9 June 2004 he accused those who were disappointed with the announcement of $40 million of having `a dummy spit' and said those who were objecting to the inadequate decision were `rank amateurs'. What an affront to the Western Highway Action Committee, who have been fighting for the Deer Park bypass for five years, to all of the local mayors who represent constituencies along that highway and to all the commuters from Ballarat, Bacchus Marsh, Gordon and Ballan.</para><para>There is only one party that will fully fund the Deer Park bypass—the $294 million required to complete this road—and that is the Labor Party. Only Labor recognise that this is a national highway, and as such we responded with a fully funded and costed commitment to build the Deer Park bypass, with construction to begin in the first year of a Latham Labor government. This is $294 million to build the whole project, with construction to begin in 2005-06. At this election, the choice will be clear. A vote for the Liberals will mean no Deer Park bypass, millions lost in the bottleneck and longer waits at the traffic lights. A vote for Labor means the Deer Park bypass will be built, with construction to start in 2005-06.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indi Electorate: Sport</title><page.no>32649</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>32649</page.no><name role="metadata">Panopoulos, Sophie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PANOPOULOS</name><name.id>00AMU</name.id><electorate>Indi</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is timely to be saying a few words this week on sport and sporting achievement. In three days' time the world's greatest sporting spectacle, the Olympics, will get underway in Athens. It is a time when we can become a bit parochial about our country as we reflect on the sacrifices and achievements of our sporting stars in doing their best for Australia on the sporting field. Worldwide sporting events provoke a certain patriotic fervour which is healthy for society and healthy for sport. Who can forget US swimmer Gary Hall Junior claiming that the USA team would smash the Australian team like guitars in a reference to the 4 x 100 metre freestyle event in Sydney? How sweet was the victory when the Australian team set a world record at the Sydney games to take the sprint relay crown off the Americans for the first time?</para></talk.start><para>At a local level, the Indi electorate has close links with the Olympic dream. Visitors to Wangaratta are greeted with a sign on the Ovens River highlighting our home-grown gold medallists Dean Woods in 1984 and Nick Morris in 1996; silver medallists Dean Woods in 1988 and Jamie Hoggan in 1984; and bronze medallist Dean Woods in 1988 and again in 1996. Beechworth's Emma George built up the profile of pole vaulting in Australia and remains a local hero. Benalla's Baden Cooke, recently in France, has arrived in Athens, and we wait with interest for the individual pursuit rounds that he will be competing in on 20 August. We wish him all the best. </para><para>However, in the north-east we do not have to wait for the Olympics to embrace sport. We have a very proud history of sporting achievement at a local level. Sporting activity has come to be a great unifier of local communities, be it through local football and netball clubs, soccer clubs, AusKick or, right across the electorate on a Sunday morning, through the thriving bicycle users groups or Wangaratta's Out and About walking and bike riding club. It is also a great symbol of volunteers and the hours that they put in, not only to raise funds but to organise events. The success and popularity of local sport in north-east Victoria owes a great deal to volunteers and the hundreds of hours they put in.</para><para>This sense of community is very special, particularly in country Australia and in north-east Victoria. All you need to do is go to a regular training session at the Wangaratta Rovers Oval or have a beer at the local pub with some of the players on a Saturday night after a win on the field to see the camaraderie, the mateship and the community links that our sporting teams foster. That is one of the great things about living in the north-east. This Saturday night I am heading to the Wangaratta Rovers' clubrooms for the annual club members' night where there will be a very special tribute to two of Rovers' favourite sons, Tony Pasquali and Matt Allen, along with further inductions to the club's hall of fame. Next week I will be participating in the Moyhu Primary School walking school bus to encourage our youngsters to be more physically active and to highlight the importance of physical activity. These types of events ensure that the notion of teamwork and sporting activity go hand in hand and arouse community involvement in the workings of our local school communities and recreational clubs. These are the sorts of events that bind us together.</para><para>This brings me to the Australian government's fight against childhood obesity. Building a Healthy, Active Australia is not just a catchy slogan for the government's program; it is a passionate call to arms for the whole community to get involved in a very serious problem. We should welcome the mandated levels of physical activity that will be entrenched in school curricula thanks to this government's reforms. These developments are a step in the right direction towards building healthier lives for our youngsters and stronger communities in which they will develop.</para><para>As we watch the successes of our Olympians in Athens, on the other side of the world, I hope there will be a renewed interest in sporting activity right across Australia. I know that in the local communities and hamlets of Indi not only our young children in primary and secondary schools but also adults are very engaged and involved in active participation in sport as well as in volunteering the hundreds of hours that are required to support local sporting events. My electorate has benefited from the community spirit, camaraderie and commitment to local events and it is an example for many other parts of Australia to follow. Hopefully, through the initiatives of this government to reduce childhood obesity, we will see many more of these activities fostered and developed in other parts of Australia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Point Nepean: Commercial Development</title><page.no>32651</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>32651</page.no><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name><name.id>UK6</name.id><electorate>Wills</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the forthcoming election there are many people living in Portsea and other parts of the Mornington Peninsula who will vote for the first, and perhaps only, time in their lives for the Labor candidate Simon Napthine. One of the reasons for that is this government's outrageous handling of the disposal of Point Nepean and, in particular, the intimidation and the `born to rule' attitude shown by the present member for Flinders and other members of the Liberal party who have been actively promoting commercial development for parts of Point Nepean. That `born to rule' mentality has included not one, not two, not three but four separate abusive phone calls from the member for Flinders to different members of the Mornington Peninsula community who have had the temerity to disagree with him about the future of Point Nepean. Bob Stewart of the Southern Peninsular Rescue Squad received a phone call from the member for Flinders, which is described in an article by Keith Platt in the <inline font-style="italic">Mail </inline>in July. It says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>“... he accused me of being a traitor to the cause”.</para><para>“He told me I should have consulted him. Even after we pulled out—</para></quote><para>of the syndicate involved in the future of Point Nepean—</para><quote><para>...he went on (over the phone) with one of these tantrums”.</para></quote><para>Mr Stewart is quoted as saying the member for Flinders `needs to grow up a bit'. In the same article a former Liberal party branch president related a phone call that `showed the acid side of Greg Hunt', the member for Flinders. The article says:</para><quote><para>“He is a verbal bully on the phone” said the man.</para><para>“I was not surprised he called but I felt as though I'd been bullied. You could hardly say he'd read “How to win Friends and Influence People”.</para><para>The man said Mr Hunt had wanted him to write to newspapers criticising the state government's plan to sell land at Devilbend reservoir, Moorooduc.</para><para>“But I saw that as diverting attention away from Point Nepean which is a much more significant piece of land” ...</para></quote><para>That was clearly a blatant attempt at manipulation by the member for Flinders. The article goes on to say:</para><quote><para>John Mickle, whose visionary plan for Point Nepean was initially praised by Mr Hunt says he, too has been subjected to accusatory phone calls from Mr Hunt.</para><para>“He accused me of having no integrity or honour and how dare I turn my back on his vision for Point Nepean”</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>Will Baillieu ... said Mr Hunt had used “pretty rich language” during a phone call 18 months or two years ago.</para><para>“He was aggressive and rude and told me that he expected to hear comments I had been making from “someone who is extremely rich”.</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>“It was quite an extraordinary phone call and I was quite stunned as I walked around the garden.</para><para>“I had not made a personal attack but Greg was trying to bully me”.</para></quote><para>It is not just the bullying phone calls; it is also the threat of litigation. Vicki Sullivan, an artist whose relatives were among the early settlers of Point Nepean, was shocked when she received a written demand for an apology from Mr David Stewart, a member of the consortium there. She was threatened and in fear of being forced to sell her house and pay court costs. She apologised. She also received a demand for an apology from the Point Nepean Trust chairman, Mr McKeon. Bob Stewart also received threat of a libel action. These threats of legal action are a classic way of attempting to stifle free speech and an unfortunate measure—a yardstick—of how the Liberal Party operates on the Mornington Peninsula. </para><para>The voters of Flinders deserve a member who will stand up for them, who will fight for them—not one who fights, bullies, browbeats and intimidates them. I am sure that many people on the Mornington Peninsula will be keen to support Simon Napthine, the Labor candidate. They know that the deed of arrangement which the government has recently announced concerning Point Nepean does not indicate that Point Nepean will be handed over as national park. Indeed, it suggests that their trust will require a 75 per cent vote from the trust in order that the land be handed over as national park. A Labor government will hand Point Nepean over to the Victorian government to be a national park for all Victorians for all time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Kingsford Smith Electorate: Port Botany Expansion</title><page.no>32652</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>32652</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As the House may be aware, there is a potential environmental catastrophe facing the electorate of Kingsford Smith in southern Sydney through the New South Wales Labor government's plan to redevelop the Port Botany facility. Mr Garrett, your beds are burning. At the same time that locals in the seat of Kingsford Smith are fighting airport and container terminal expansions, ballooning traffic problems, carcinogenic and heavy metal poisoning and the biggest environmental threat to Botany Bay in its history, Mr Garrett is happily toeing the Labor Party line and keeping his real views to himself.</para></talk.start><para>What has been fascinating to watch since Mr Garrett's imposed candidacy for the safe Labor seat of Kingsford Smith has been his complete and utter silence on any issue regarding Kingsford Smith and Port Botany. It might interest the House to note that the Port Botany stevedoring facility is located in the heart of the erstwhile environmental activist turned Labor's star candidate's electorate, but it is left to the Liberal member from an adjoining seat to stand up for the environment—namely, me. Mr Garrett, do you serve the boys of Sussex Street or do you aspire to serve the people of Kingsford Smith? It is not that Mr Garrett is unaware of the massive problems with the port expansion. When President of the Australian Conservation Foundation, he was among the most vocal critics of the expansion plans.</para><para>That is not to say that Mr Garrett has been idle—far from it. Last Wednesday's article in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> sheds some light as to where Mr Garrett has been fighting the good fight; titled `Garrett fighting on the wrong home front', it would appear that the soon to be member for Kingsford Smith has been fighting to stop the development of 600 public housing homes in Mittagong, which unfortunately would ruin the vista from his $2.5 million home in the Southern Highlands. It is time Mr Garrett came clean. Either he believes in protecting the environment or he does not. If he does, it is time for him to follow his own advice, time for Mr Garrett to say fair's fair, to pay the rent, to pay his share. Perhaps more fittingly, it is fine for Mr Garrett to think globally but, in the view of the residents of Kingsford Smith, it is well past the time for him to act locally.</para><para>The New South Wales Labor government has proposed, through the Sydney Ports Corporation, to expand the Port Botany container facility, tripling the number of containers handled per year from one million to three million. The proposal is estimated to cost New South Wales residents $580 million. The ramifications of the proposal to expand the Port Botany facility has given southern Sydney residents real cause for concern. It has the potential to significantly damage and further degrade the fragile marine environment of Botany Bay, choke the already stressed roads and rail transport corridors and add to the vulnerability of Port Botany as a potential terror target. I understand the port expansion as proposed by the New South Wales government will involve the reclamation of 60 hectares of the bay, which will make way for six additional shipping berths. This will result in more than 7.5 million cubic metres of sand being dredged from the floor of Botany Bay. </para><para>The northern side of Botany Bay around the container terminus has long been used as a site for heavy industry and commercial uses. This has meant that the ground waters beneath the bay and adjacent to the site of the proposed expansion have become heavily contaminated with pollutants. The ground water beneath the bay is also heavily contaminated with heavy metals and other particulate pollution. The dredging of the bay floor and reclamation of the equivalent of 120 football fields of the bay for the new terminal will release a toxic plume of heavy metals and pollutants. Computer and wave modelling shows that this toxic plume would travel south across the bay and endanger the Towra Point Nature Reserve, an area that is of such environmental worth that it was listed for protection under Ramsar treaty in the 1980s. It will completely encircle and irretrievably damage the Penrhyn Estuary, which was the last wading habitat on the northern side of the bay. Towra Point is home to over 95 per cent of the remaining salt marshes and more than 50 per cent of the remaining mangrove communities in the Sydney basin.</para><para>What we are saying is that the New South Wales government needs to look at alternatives. Both Newcastle and Port Kembla have indicated they would be more than happy to accommodate the additional port facilities, bringing as they would much-needed employment opportunities into these communities. Under the government's Auslink white paper the New South Wales government would be able to apply for a share of $1.8 billion to build the rail infrastructure that would be required to service these ports. We are concerned about those seats that adjoin Botany Bay and we are calling on Peter Garrett, the star Labor candidate, to stand up for his environmental credentials and condemn this proposal for Botany Bay. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!
