While Labor will support all these measures, the provision of a tax exemption for sugar industry exit grants in certain circumstances does provide an opportunity to highlight the failings of this government with regard to the sugar industry. Labor will move a second reading amendment condemning the government's treatment of the sugar industry and its failure to provide effective adjustment assistance.</para></talk.start><para>Schedule 1 provides a GST exemption for certain lifesaving and first aid courses. Currently, all education courses must be certified by a state government body to be eligible for a GST exemption. However, many lifesaving and first aid courses are not certified by the state government but by lifesaving and first aid organisations. This amendment will ensure that such courses are no longer subject to the GST. Consistent with the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations, all states and territories have agreed to this amendment. However, I understand that the government will also be moving another amendment which will give it the power to make regulations setting out which organisations will have the right to assess these courses as qualifying for the GST exemption and that the government has not, under the terms of the intergovernmental agreement on the GST, obtained the states' assent to that amendment and that regulating power. The opposition will not oppose that amendment in the House, but we will consult with the state treasurers before coming to a decision about how we will deal with it in the Senate.</para><para>Schedule 2 provides transitional relief from the new value shifting regime, which is an important integrity measure that will prevent companies manipulating the tax laws by shifting value between associated entities that are not part of the same consolidated group. Value shifts occur when a business—the losing business—provides goods or services to another business—the gaining business—in the same group of companies and the price paid for those goods or services is not the true market value. The effect of these transactions is to shift value between companies that are owned or controlled by the same entity. This is usually done for tax minimisation purposes. The new value shifting regime ensures that these value shifts cannot be used to minimise tax. However, the new consolidation regime effectively delivers the same outcome by treating groups of companies as one for tax purposes. As such, the new value shifting regime will not apply to consolidated groups.</para><para>Making groups of companies comply with the new value shifting regime during the transitional period for consolidation would impose an unfair and unnecessary compliance cost on groups that have entered consolidation. The amendments contained in schedule 2 will ensure that this does not occur, by excluding most indirect value shifts from the value shifting regime where value shifts occur before the beginning of the 2003-04 income year for the business providing the services or if the income year for the business providing the services ends before 30 June 2003—the beginning of the 2004-05 income year. These dates ensure that companies that have consolidated some time in the first year of consolidation—2002-03—do not have to comply with the new value shifting regime.</para><para>Schedule 3 amends the alienation of personal services income provisions. The schedule aims to ensure that, where a deduction is not allowed for a business related expense due to the personal services income provisions, fringe benefits tax is not applied. Currently, a personal services business would not be allowed a deduction for providing a car to an employee, but would have to pay fringe benefits tax on the provision of that car, effectively double taxing the provision of the car. In addition, the schedule ensures that, consistent with the treatment of individual taxpayers, tax losses can be used by the individual whose personal efforts or skill generated the income.</para><para>Schedule 4 provides an income tax exemption for payments made under the sugar industry reform program to taxpayers who agree to leave the agricultural industry altogether. While supporting this amendment, Labor considers that a more transparent way to provide additional compensation for this group of farmers would have been to increase the exit grant and to have it remain taxable. If that was the case it would not only be more transparent but also be consistent with the tax treatment of other grants that might otherwise be applied to business purposes which are deductible, effectively increasing the value of the concession that is being provided to them.</para><para>The sugar industry reform package is the third rescue package for the sugar industry introduced by this government—all have failed. The latest package, announced in September 2002, promised $120 million in assistance, but so far only $20 million has been spent. I wonder how much the sugar levy has raised over this time? It would be good if the parliamentary secretary to the Treasurer, who I expect to be handling this bill, could give us an estimate of that when he sums up in this debate. I can only wonder because the government will not tell the public how much it is getting from this tax. It is yet another example of the secrecy with which the Howard government veils its budget figures—so much for the transparency that was promised before Mr Howard's election eight years ago.</para><para>To add insult to injury over the government's claim that it cares about the sugar industry, we have seen the sugar industry abandoned by this government in the recent trade agreement with the United States. I draw the House's attention to an article by Christine Wallace that appeared on page two of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on Wednesday of last week. The article `Lobbyists, negotiators stunned by Bush rebuff', states:</para><quote><para>JOHN Howard's last-minute free trade deal plea to US President George W.

This article was followed up in a line of questioning to the trade minister at a doorstop interview two days ago. A journalist asked:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Mr Vaile, how hard of a sell is the FTA going to be, given that it's now emerging that in the final week, your technical advisers, your trade negotiators were telling you that you should walk away from the deal?</para></quote><para>The trade minister answered, `I don't recall such advice.' He certainly did not say that no such advice was given. He did not deny that such advice was given. He seems to have perhaps had a short attack of amnesia. He then sidestepped the question and said:</para><quote><para>I read stories in the media that were generated out of the Senate Estimates questioning, but on the ground in Washington at the time I don't recall getting any of that sort of advice from officials. Obviously the government had to assess the balance of what had been achieved, against the balance of what we were expected to defend, in terms of Australia's interests—</para></quote><para>So obviously there are some things in this trade deal that we can all feel uncomfortable about and which, in the trade minister's own words, we need to need to examine in the light of the benefits. He went on to say—</para><quote><para>and then make a decision. Whether we take that deal or whether we put it to one side and maybe wait for another 20 or 25 years to have an opportunity. We decided to go ahead with it because we believed the benefits that were on offer overwhelmingly balanced up the issues that we had to protect. And when you read the text you'll see that very clear guidance given by the Australian people in a couple of sensitive areas has certainly been delivered on.</para></quote><para>This seems to me to obfuscate rather neatly. It is pretty clear that the professional trade negotiators—at least those with a particular interest in agriculture—did not think that it was such an overwhelmingly good deal.

I move:</para></talk.start></continue><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>“the House:</para><para>(1)	notes that the tax exemption for certain sugar industry exit grants is one aspect of a $120m package announced in September 2002, yet:</para><para>(a)	so far only $20m has been spent although the industry is in deep crisis, having been hit by adverse weather conditions, destructive pests and diseas-es, a rising dollar, rising interest rates and a declining world price for sugar;</para><para>(b)	the small hope offered by the FTA has been dashed when the Government failed to deliver increased access to the US market, and </para><para>accordingly, the House condemns the government for failing to:</para><para>(c)	provide effective adjustment assistance to the industry in any of its three sugar industry packages; and</para><para>(d)	secure any additional access for the sugar industry in the FTA with the United States; and</para><para>(2)	also condemns the Government for failing to:</para><para>(a)	deal with tax issues surrounding per-sonal services income; and</para><para>(b)	provide effective incentives for private investment in research and develop-ment”.</para><para>So, in the context of providing a tax exemption for sugar industry exit grants, dealing with the government's other failures in relation to the sugar industry is certainly a relevant consideration.</para><para>As I said, the journalist had asked the trade minister:</para><quote><para>Is it true that the chief negotiator considered resignation in the final stages of negotiation?</para></quote><para>Mr Vaile answered:</para><quote><para>I'm certainly not aware of that.</para></quote><para>Again, not a denial or a rejection, just `I'm not aware'—a convenient absence of knowledge I think I would call it.

And it certainly wasn't apparent in the hours and hours and hours that we all put in to achieve this outcome in Washington, so I just don't know where this story's coming from.</para></quote><para>Obviously the chief negotiator was a bit disappointed and was not overwhelmed by the political benefits that the government wished to derive from the trade agreement which seem to have entered into its considerations in accepting this deal.</para><para>The third question on the subject that was asked of the trade minister at this particular doorstop was:</para><quote><para>Is it true that twice in the last week in Washington Australia's trade negotiators, the technical people told you that you would damage Australia's long-term agriculture objectives, damage Australia's long-term stand in the WTO and your leadership of the Cairns Group?</para></quote><para>Mr Vaile answered:</para><quote><para>Oh, look, we had a whole range of discussions on a daily basis right throughout the fortnight that we were negotiating in Washington and, Graeme, I don't need to be told exactly the ramifications of some of the decisions that we take in Government.</para></quote><para>Clearly, the trade minister was not interested in the advice of the expert officials. He went on to say:</para><quote><para>I mean, that's a matter for the Government. But I certainly took the view that, given the global circumstances; given the way the multilateral system was operating, given the number of bilateral free-trade agreement negotiations that had been concluded—not just by WTO members but in fact by 14 out of the 17 Cairns Group members or members that were pursuing bilateral negotiations, in those discussions—and I'll be quite honest, we had a range of discussions on what are the implications of making this decision or that decision.</para></quote><para>So he admits that there are implications. He went on:</para><quote><para>We took the view that the way we have structured this agreement we were not going to damage our reputation as the leader of the Cairns Group or as a lead advocate in agricultural trade liberalisation across the world.</para></quote><para>These of course are the minister's views, not the professional trade negotiators' views. The minister also said:</para><quote><para>And I've just come back at the end of last week from the Cairns Group meeting in Costa Rica. And my view was certainly reflected in a number of the conversations I had with my ministerial colleagues at that meeting, who were obviously interested in the outcome of the negotiations, interested in the disposition of the United States vis-a-vis the multilateral negotiations on agri-culture. And certainly there was not any anxiety or animosity as far as being generated towards Australia's leadership of the Cairns Group. In fact, if you look at the transcript of some of the interviews that were done afterwards, most ministers said that this was one of the best meetings that they had attended, that there was absolute commitment to our pursuit of the three pillars on agriculture in the WTO.</para></quote><para>Of course, you would hope that members of the Cairns Group would continue to pursue multilateral liberalisation of access to agriculture. He went on to say:</para><quote><para>We agreed to lock in next year's meeting in Cartagena in Columbia, and in 2006 ... I've flagged our intention to hold the 2006 meeting, the twentieth anniversary of the Cairns Group, back in Cairns in North Queensland.</para></quote><para>How appropriate, when it is the sugar industry's future that is at stake.</para><para>We know that it is not a completely free trade agreement—it is just a trade agreement—and that many barriers remain for Australian businesses wanting access to American markets. Despite pleadings from the Prime Minister to President Bush for any concession on sugar at all, not one extra grain of sugar will reach the shores of the United States from Australia. In fact, judging by the way things seem to have proceeded, we are probably pretty lucky that Qantas has not been required to stock up on sugar sachets when it is in the US using US sugar.</para><para>In addition, we have degraded our standing in respect of the WTO. It is multilateral free trade agreements that will deliver real benefits to the Australian economy. I think this agreement is going to turn out to be one of the big disappointments. There will be a lot of debate when people finally get to see the full text and can start to make more rigorous assessments about what the benefits are and—as the trade minister said in his doorstop—what the costs have been, what the things that we had to defend were and what the disbenefits are for Australian business. My uncomfortable feeling is that when we finally get to see the detail of that deal we are going to come to the conclusion that the trade deal is more of a disappointment and a lost opportunity than the triumph that the Prime Minister, the trade minister, the foreign minister and the Treasurer have been trying to put to the Australian community over the last 10 days.</para><para>Returning to this bill, schedule 5 will ensure that foreign resident withholding rules apply to alienated personal services payments. Schedule 6 will ensure that mutual friendly societies that are life insurance companies are subject to the same taxation framework that applies to other mutual life insurance companies if they demutualise. This will give mutual friendly societies that are life insurance companies the following tax advantages: any capital gain or loss arising from members giving up their membership rights and receiving shares in the new demutualised company will be waived, no capital gains tax liability will arise until a subsequent event happens to the demutualisation shares, and members will receive an enhanced cost base for the demutualisation shares for capital gains tax purposes that broadly reflects the market value of the shares. These amendments will encourage mutual friendly societies that are insurance companies to demutualise without suffering any tax disadvantage.</para><para>Schedule 7 amends the simplified tax system provisions to provide, under certain conditions, optional rollover relief for partnerships similar to that provided under the unified capital allowance regime. The simplified taxation system was a recommendation of the Ralph Review of Business Taxation and allows small businesses to opt out of some of the more complex taxation rules and opt into simpler streamlined rules. For example, businesses can opt out of the UCA regime and opt into a simpler depreciation regime. However, the simpler depreciation regime does not currently provide the rollover relief that exists in the UCA regime. Therefore, when a partnership changes hands under the STS, a capital gains tax event occurs. This is acting as a deterrent to some taxpayers entering into the simplified tax system, as it reduces their flexibility.</para><para>Schedule 8 makes amendments to the consolidation regime. The consolidation regime allows groups of wholly owned companies to be treated as one for taxation purposes. Under the new regime, businesses must make irrevocable decisions which affect the tax costs of assets or the ability to deduct losses. The amendments will allow companies to alter their choices up to 1 July 2005, providing greater flexibility and allowing time for companies to assess the impact of the consolidation regime. In addition, schedule 8 will ensure that where a company joins or leaves a consolidated group part of the way through an income year the R&amp;D tax offset applies appropriately. Labor will support the bill.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Is the amendment seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83T</name.id><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Rudd</name></talker><para>—I second the amendment.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>25704</page.no><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name><name.id>00AN0</name.id><electorate>Moncrieff</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The member for Kingston has gone through in detail the various schedules to the <inline ref="R1943">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 9) 2003</inline>. I do not intend to address each and every one of them in my response to the bill before the chamber. However, I would like to focus on several aspects of the bill. In particular, I am very interested in, and happy about, the fact that we are providing an extension of the GST exemption for lifesaving courses. As the member for Moncrieff and a resident of the Gold Coast, I can certainly say that the exemption provided by this bill and the extension of the exemption to the various entities that are registered for GST so that any lifesaving courses they provide to the public at large are GST exempt is something to be encouraged.</para></talk.start><para>This government made a commitment at the outset to ensuring that there was a GST exemption on lifesaving courses. The original legislation as it was passed missed the fact that there were number of registered entities that also provided the courses which fell outside of the exemption. As a consequence, the amendment that comes before the House today ensures that the net is cast wide to include all of those service providers that provide lifesaving courses so that those courses are GST exempt.</para><para>One of the primary service entities in this particular market is, of course, the Australian surf-lifesaving movement. I am very pleased that on the Gold Coast there is very strong community support for the surf-lifesaving movement. I am pleased, although they were captured by the primary piece of legislation, that this amendment will ensure that those other service providers in that same market will have the exemption. Having said that, we need to encourage as much as possible people to be fully aware of and fully trained to deal with the kinds of emergencies that can arise. The surf-lifesaving movement—and indeed many other service providers—provides a very important role in the community in ensuring that all Australians, and particularly young Australians, are best equipped when it comes to lifesaving, particularly with respect to water. In that regard, I am very pleased that this bill will see that there is no disincentive arising through the imposition of the GST on such courses.</para><para>The lifesaving movement does more than simply provide instruction on lifesaving. It also encourages an ethos in life that promotes the benefits that flow from being involved in the beach culture, and certainly that is something that I am very keen to promote on the Gold Coast. I know as a member of a surf-lifesaving club that there are many benefits that flow from being an active participant in surf-lifesaving. From my perspective I know for a fact that the more young people that are encouraged and involved in surf-lifesaving the better the chance that they will be able to respond appropriately and adequately in a situation where someone's life may be at risk, particularly when it comes to the risk of drowning.</para><para>Another aspect of the bill which I would now like to turn to deals with the amendment that was moved by the member for Kingston. I notice that, when it comes to the sugar industry exit grants, the member for Kingston's amendment contains a number of fairly outrageous and hypocritical positions that the Labor Party has put forward in the House today. The reality is that the free trade agreement that this government struck with the United States is a positive benefit to the Australian economy. This free trade agreement is one that could only have been brokered by this government and not one that could have been brokered by the opposition. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WU5</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Gavan O'Connor</name></talker><para>—It'd be a different one if we did—we wouldn't be on our knees!</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

The entire focus of the opposition is on the fact that there was not enough additional access provided under the FTA for the sugar industry. I notice that when the Labor Party come into this chamber they do not talk about all the other industries in the economy; they do not talk about all the other service providers in the economy and the fact that each and every one of these will be better off as a consequence of the FTA—no. In an attempt to be politically opportunistic, they come in and focus just on the sugar cane industry.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It has been lamented on this side of the chamber—we have regretted the fact—that we were unable to secure additional market access for our sugar cane farmers. It would have been an ideal world; it would have been much better to have been able to obtain additional market access. But the United States democracy is subject to the same types of political pressures as the Australian democracy. We see it on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. The reality—and I certainly recognise it—is that it would have been a nigh impossible task, had sugar been included, for the United States Congress to pass the FTA. I know, and certainly I have read some comments that a number of congressmen in the United States have made with respect to sugar, that had sugar been incorporated into the FTA the whole package would have gone down.</para><para>The choice this government had was a simple one: it was the choice between scuttling the whole deal off the back of the inability to obtain increased market access for sugar, and recognising that, whilst we would have liked to obtain additional market access, we are unable to. Nonetheless, there are significant benefits that will flow to the other 97 per cent of the Australian economy that will benefit as a consequence of the free trade agreement. Recognising the benefits that will flow to the Australian marketplace, because we now have virtually unfettered access to a market of some 300 million people, this government took the correct decision when it decided to push ahead with the FTA even though we were unable to secure additional market access for the sugar cane industry.</para><para>I know that there are a number of seats in which the sugar cane industry is a very potent political lobby group—likewise in the United States. I fundamentally believe, and I know from speaking with other members on this side of the chamber, that when we speak with participants in the sugar cane industry and explain the decision that this government had to make, there is a recognition that, yes, whilst it would have been nice to obtain additional market access, it would not have been possible. This government, as the Prime Minister has indicated, has already moved to ensure that we will provide additional assistance to members of the sugar cane industry who would like to exit the industry to be able to exit in a way that does not leave them worse off. In certain respects this bill and those aspects of it that deal with tax exemption for certain sugar industry exit grants are just another way that this government is demonstrating a real commitment to assisting those sugar cane growers who would like to exit the industry. Providing an income tax exemption, as outlined in this bill, is a very genuine way that we are doing that. </para><para>The opportunism of the Labor Party in this chamber reeks. The amendment moved by the opposition is a very clear example of why the Australian people know that the Labor Party lack credibility when it comes to the free trade agreement. What do we know at this stage? We know that the Labor Party are opposed to the free trade agreement. Senator Conroy and the Leader of the Opposition have both said that they would not support the free trade agreement when it comes before parliament. We now see a bit of movement away from that position: we have heard certain comments and certain phrases that the Labor Party would like to resile from the position that they took. They know that the original position the Labor Party took was unsustainable. The Labor Party know that, if they were out there talking to the Australian public trying to sell the fact that the free trade agreement is detrimental to the Australian economy, they would be pushing it uphill. They know that they had a losing hand when they adopted a half-cocked position at the very outset of the launch of the free trade agreement in Australia.</para><para>It is the Howard government, through its close and continuing relationship with the United States, that is able to secure an agreement like this. It is the Howard government that has been able to obtain virtually unfettered access to a market of some 300 million people through the free trade agreement—market access that will be of direct benefit to 97 per cent of the Australian economy. But it is the Labor Party that would like to scuttle the whole thing because they say that the other three per cent is so important that we should forget about the 97 per cent that will benefit. It is the Labor Party that are out there trying to sell the idea that this free trade agreement is so detrimental to the Australian economy that it ought to be scuttled. It is an absolute joke and it highlights the fact that the Labor Party are so concerned with being politically opportunistic that they will jump at each and every chance to score some cheap points, in particular with respect to the sugar cane industry. But the Australian people and the residents of the Gold Coast know the benefits that will flow from this free trade agreement, and I am very pleased that we were able to secure the kind of agreement that we did. Yes, it would have been better to obtain additional market access for sugar cane, but unfortunately it was not possible.</para><para>The decision that the people of Australia will need to make in the coming months is whether or not they are willing to listen to and adopt what the Labor Party put forward as their policy position when it comes to the free trade agreement. They will have a choice between what the Howard government has been able to deliver and what the opposition are proposing to put forward should they be elected to government. Let us deal with that for a moment.</para><para>If the Labor Party were to come to government, I would be very intrigued to see how they would deal with the free trade agreement in particular. We know that the Labor Party leader, Mark Latham, has made the comment in the past that President Bush is the most dangerous president in history. We know that the Labor Party and in particular the member for Werriwa have made absolutely scathing comments about the very strong relationship that Australia has and that the Howard government has fostered with the United States. Despite this past rhetoric, on the day that the opposition leader was elected opposition leader, he wrapped himself in the US flag, suddenly trying to win back some of that support that he had eroded in the past.</para><para>We see the Labor Party on the one hand desperate to attempt to be friends with the United States and, on the other hand, when they believe that there is some politically opportunistic point scoring to be done, attempt to put distance between this country and the United States. People out there are not fools; they see the hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party. They recognise the hypocrisy of a leader of the Australian Labor Party who in one instance says that President Bush's regime is the most dangerous that the United States has ever seen, yet a matter of months later is standing in front of the United States flag attempting to portray himself and the Australian Labor Party as some kind of political alternative in this country—a political alternative that will be able to deliver the kind of agreement we have got in this free trade agreement.</para><para>The Labor Party will never be able to deliver the kinds of benefits we have under the free trade agreement, because they lack the credibility to deal with foreign governments, particularly a Republican-led United States. The reality is that Republicans in the United States would never trust the Australian Labor Party, because whatever position they might have on Monday, Wednesday and Friday is a different position from what they might have on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. The Australian people know the position of the Labor Party when it comes to these types of matters.</para><para>The bill before the House, the <inline ref="R1943">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 9) 2003</inline>, is a fairly mechanical bill that makes a number of adjustments. The amendment put forward by the Labor Party is laughable and certainly ought not to be supported. It is in fact nothing more than a politically opportunistic course of action by the Australian Labor Party. The bill in the main, though, is a good bill that encourages Australians of all persuasions—in particular, I hope it encourages young Australians—to become active in, for example, the surf-lifesaving movement, by removing any tax disincentives that might apply to lifesaving courses. I commend the bill to the House but I certainly reject the amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>25708</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition will be supporting the legislation before the parliament today, and I rise to support the second reading amendment moved by the member for Kingston. Before I address the substance of the amendment, let me make some comments on the contribution to the debate just made by the member for Moncrieff. We now know that the member for Moncrieff has joined the conga line! He is dancing around like his leader and his deputy leader. He is dancing his way through the debates in this House, like many members of the backbench opposite—lemmings about to go to the electoral slaughter—and of course they have the temerity to get up and criticise the Australian Labor Party for moving a second reading amendment to the <inline ref="R1943">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 9) 2003</inline> that we are debating here in the House.</para></talk.start><para>For the honourable member's—how do I put this?—education, let me outline some of the things that we now know about the trade agreement with the United States. It is not a free trade agreement. That was acknowledged by the National Farmers Federation, which has had something to say about the sugar industry being dropped off the table by the Prime Minister at the last minute. The Prime Minister is now known as the Judas of the sugar industry. He is now trawling his way through the sugar seats with his 30 pieces of silver, hoping he can claw back some electoral support. He is out there like an old drunken sailor, throwing money about and hoping that he can buy back some electoral support.</para><para>The whole Australian nation knows about this so-called free trade agreement, which the National Farmers Federation now refuses to talk about as a `free trade' agreement. It is not a free trade agreement, because it has significant exclusions. Of course, it has a major exclusion which is very important to the state of Queensland, whence the honourable member for Moncrieff comes. We know certain things about this so-called free trade agreement; for instance, we know that the government has not quantified the costs or benefits. The last time it did that was in 2002, and the gains are quite dubious indeed according to that analysis. When we quizzed the government on the floor of this parliament about the free trade agreement—and, indeed, about why sugar was left out, which is the subject of our second reading amendment—the government indicated to this House that it had no current assessment of whether the benefits in fact outweighed the costs in this particular agreement.</para><para>We all know—the Australian people know—why the sugar industry was excluded from the deal. It is not in Australia's national interest, I would submit to the House, to exclude a major rural industry, an industry that is important to regional Queensland and northern New South Wales. It just defies logic to argue that the free trade agreement is a comprehensive agreement when you have left out of the equation Australia's fourth largest rural export. But we know why the deal was done: it was not done in the national interest of Australia; it was done in the political interest of the American President. The Florida lobby—the sugar producers—blocked this, and the Prime Minister, in a wonderful gesture to his mate in the United States of America, dropped the sugar industry off.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Anthony</name></talker><para>—Oh, wrap yourself in the Australian flag!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WU5</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name></talker><para>—I will tell you what, Minister: we would never negotiate on our knees like you lot have. We would not negotiate on our knees. Why don't you stand up when you negotiate? Do not negotiate a deal on your knees that drops off the table an industry that is important to the seat of Richmond and all the sugar seats in Queensland.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me tell you, we are not going to let this slide. The member for Moncrieff wants to talk about rank opportunism. I saw it in the phone call on Sunday that stitched a deal up between the Prime Minister of Australia and the President of the United States. If that was not rank opportunism, I do not know what is. I will be circulating that speech by the citycentric Howard government, with its lawyers and merchant bankers who want to do the investment deals under this particular free trade agreement. We will make sure that that speech is circulated in the sugar seats so that the sugar growers of this country, and their families, understand where they stand in the priorities of the coalition government.</para><para>Today I want to address one aspect of this bill, and that is the arrangements that it will put in place to assist struggling cane farmers to exit the industry. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, announced on 29 October 2002 that farmers agreeing to leave the industry would be given an exit grant of up to $45,000. As a condition of the grant, the recipient must agree to either not become an owner or operator of any agricultural enterprise or not become an owner or operator of a sugar industry enterprise within five years.</para><para>The amendments we are considering tonight will exempt from income tax sugar industry exit grants that are paid to recipients who agree to leave the agricultural sector for five years. These amendments will include non-assessable income grants paid to recipients who agree to leave the sugar industry but not the agricultural sector.</para><para>These exit grants are just one part of what can reasonably be described as a failed industry package. Barely $20 million of a $120 million package has been spent. The reason for this is a very simple one, and it is a common thread in this government: the government and the agricultural minister in particular would rather pick a fight with the states than work cooperatively with them to achieve an outcome for this very important industry. The Howard government usually picks a fight over money. In relation to this particular package, it chose to pick a fight over the detail of much-needed regulatory reform. The loser, as always, was the very industry the federal government claims it is now seeking to help.</para><para>The sugar industry has been in decline for some years. Industry earnings have dropped from $1.84 billion in 1994 to an estimated income of around $975 million this year. These reduced earnings have been impacting not only on cane growers but on mill owners and the thousands of workers who have been employed in those mills. That means that whole communities in cane-growing areas have really suffered. Since 1993, the industry's share of world trade in raw sugar has slipped from 22 per cent to just 15 per cent in 2001. At various periods over the past five years the industry has also suffered from drought, cyclones and floods and the ravages of disease and pests.</para><para>The Howard government has put in place three sugar assistance packages since 1998, and now we have a fourth. The 1998 package consisted of additional funds for research and development, funding to help the New South Wales industry develop an export focus, the development of a national export plan, the preservation of single desk marketing arrangements and the strengthening of anti-dumping measures. Mr Anderson claimed this package would save the industry.</para><para>The 2000 package was introduced in September of that year to assist the industry to deal with low world prices, low sugar content, disease and rat plagues and a series of bad seasons climatically. The package consisted of income support, interest rate relief and financial counselling and had a budget of $83 million. Only $60 million was spent, with most of the funds going to the income support component of the package. The minister, Mr Truss, claimed that the package would help ensure that there was an economically viable and efficient industry in the longer term. Despite two rescue packages in two years, conditions in the industry continued to decline.</para><para>The minister was again forced to seek more assistance for the industry but only gained cabinet support for that assistance after agreeing to fund the package through a tax on sugar: the infamous Howard government sugar tax. He also commissioned Clive Hildebrand to review the state of the sugar industry in February 2002. Mr Hildebrand, who was the Chair of the Sugar Research and Development Corporation, was asked to examine the industry with particular reference to its economic, social and environmental drivers.</para><para>The report made a number of key recommendations, including rationalising the industry into larger holdings and adopting a mill area or mill region approach, as these represent the profit centres for the industry; implementing a systems approach to all operations, particularly the transporting and harvesting sectors; and encouraging product diversification and improving the business management skills of the industry at the local level.</para><para>The 2002 package that flowed from Hildebrand was built on income support, interest subsidies and a regional assistance package aimed at facilitating change and help for farmers wanting to leave the industry. The package was underpinned by a memorandum of understanding between the Commonwealth and the Queensland governments which went to the issue of regulatory reform. As I said, the package was funded by a sugar tax imposed by the Howard government on the food-processing sector to raise the $120 million, and there was also a contribution of $30 million from the Queensland government. As I noted earlier, negotiations on the nature and extent of reform to the regulatory regime for the industry have bogged down and, as a result, less than $20 million of a package worth $150 million has been spent.</para><para>The centrepiece of the third package was to be the $60 million regional adjustment plan to be driven by local communities and an overarching industry guidance group. None of these funds have been spent, and that is the reason we have moved this second reading amendment today: to give us the opportunity to highlight the policy shortcomings of the government in the three packages that we have had for this industry since 1998. The evidence for the failures can be found in figures from Centrelink that identify the number of cane farm families on income support. These figures also identify the number of farming families likely to be encouraged by the Howard government to exit the sugar industry. The figures show that 455 farm families in the Townsville region were forced to apply for financial help, and 556 families in the Mackay area and 166 families in Cairns were also in receipt of income support. The total number of recipients of income support is 1,465. This was the third assistance package provided by the federal government since 1998, and now the Prime Minister has announced the first instalment of package No. 4.</para><para>These numbers make it clear that the government has not delivered the reforms needed by the industry, and the number of farmers at risk has increased since the first Howard package was announced. The government's failure to gain any increase in access to the United States market through the so-called free trade agreement compounds the problem. Putting the Australian sugar industry on a long-term sustainable path is a major test which the Howard government has now failed on three occasions. Cane farmers and farming communities simply cannot afford failure No. 4.</para><para>There is, however, some light at the end of the tunnel—but not as a result of the efforts of this government. The recent agreement to a package of important regulatory reforms, between the Queensland government, cane growers and the Australian Sugar Milling Council, is most welcome. These regulatory changes, while not the entire answer to the industry's problems, are an important step forward, and the industry and the Queensland government should be commended. I commend Henry Palaszczuk, the Minister for Primary Industries and Fisheries, for his untiring efforts, along with Premier Beattie, for getting sensible reform on the ground in Queensland. It is reform that has been opposed by the National Party and by the Howard government every step of the way. It is now up to the federal government to put in place a package of assistance that addresses inefficiencies throughout the whole production process, including the milling sector. Efficiencies in transport infrastructure should also be pursued.</para><para>There is a need for a cooperative approach across all tiers of government in areas such as the facilitation of grower exits and the consolidation of blocks into large, more economic holdings. It is important that the House supports the second reading amendment moved by the member for Kingston. In that amendment, we have noted the Howard government's failure to secure access for sugar farmers to the market of the United States of America. The industry has faced very tough times in recent years. It has experienced a series of very difficult weather events, it has faced an appreciating local currency, it now faces rising local interest rates, it has faced a very low world price for sugar, and it has been forced to battle with Brazil on world markets—with the Brazilian currency having been devalued against the US dollar by around 40 per cent. But the industry also faces a minister who has failed to deliver the reforms which are required to put this key rural employer and major exporter on a sustainable footing. </para><para>The Prime Minister can fix this problem with the stroke of a pen—but not a pen that throws 30 pieces of silver at the industry to mitigate the deep sense of betrayal the industry feels over the government's actions in dropping it off the table in the so-called free trade negotiations with the United States. It must be a pen that asks for the resignation of the minister who has presided over this deepening crisis in the industry. I do not hold the minister responsible for the actions of Brazil or for drought, and I do not hold him responsible for cyclones, pests and diseases. But this parliament and the sugar industry hold the minister and the Howard government responsible for the abysmal failure of policy in responding to these issues. The government is responsible for the failure of its own policy response since 1998. It is responsible for dropping this industry off the so-called FTA negotiating table. It is responsible for its failure to cooperate with the Queensland state government in reforms it now acknowledges—and the industry acknowledges—are necessary for the long-term survival of this industry. And it stands condemned for playing politics in those sugar seats since 1998 to suit its own political purposes. In doing so, it has betrayed the interests of sugar producers and their families.</para><para>There is no greater betrayal for farmers and their families than to know that the national government of the day sold them out. It sold out their interests. It would not get off its knees and negotiate in an upright position with the United States, and it caved in to the sugar lobby in the United States—the sugar lobby that was so vociferous in its support for George Bush in the critical state of Florida at the last presidential election, the state that won George Bush the presidency of the United States. It is little wonder that in the sugar seats they call the Prime Minister `Bonsai John'. They call him `the little Bush'. Each and every sugar producer and their families feel that deep sense of betrayal. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>25712</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is my pleasure to sum up what has been a spirited, at times informative, at times entertaining and, regrettably, at times malicious debate on the <inline ref="R1943">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 9) 2003</inline>. The previous speaker, the member for Corio, is basically a very good bloke, but he has a capacity to let himself down in these moments of debate. I will address in the first instance the reasons why the government will be opposing the member for Kingston's amendment in relation to the sugar industry.</para></talk.start><para>People ask me from time to time how I think the Leader of the Opposition is going. The factors in my mind are not what I regard as the peripheral or incidental ones. People may form judgments about his previous language or his apparent capacity to hold different positions at the same time, but it is the big issues that concern me—in particular, the free trade agreement, which is the subject of the opposition's amendment. There are big moments—for example, deciding whether or not we join the US in a coalition of the willing and whether or not we enter a negotiation with the US over a free trade agreement—that affect the direction of the nation. They go to the architecture of the Australian economy and of Australia's strategic relations and defence arrangements. At these moments, I think it is clear that the Leader of the Opposition has been found wanting. Often it is against his best instincts, but his party suffers, in this case, from a fundamental ambivalence about the United States, which I believe makes them unsuitable to govern Australia.</para><para>When we talk about the attack the member for Corio has made on the government for executing this historic agreement, we ought to bear in mind that this agreement gives Australia access to 300 million of the most prosperous individuals in the world. Whatever anyone thinks about the equity of the situation, the United States economy accounts for over 25 per cent of global consumption. The United States economy has provided over 80 per cent of all the growth in the world economy over the last decade. The United States economy accounts for almost 50 per cent of the world's equity markets. Here we have an opportunity for Australia, representing less than two per cent of the world economy, to negotiate privileged access to the largest and most prosperous economy in the world, and the opposition are ambivalent about it. The opposition cannot decide whether they are for it or against it. The opposition are somewhat embarrassed by their initial reaction of total opposition. On the basis that we did not get a perfect outcome for the sugar industry, they said we ought to trash the whole deal and rip up this once in a lifetime opportunity.</para><para>I think there is one thing about which we can be certain: if the Australian Labor Party had been on the Treasury benches over these last few years, we would not have this free trade agreement with the United States. We would not have the extraordinary opportunities for increased income for Australian exporters, increased profits for Australian industries with imported inputs and reduced prices for Australian consumers. That is the bottom line as far as this free trade agreement in concerned. Labor simply could not have executed it.</para><para>The government is committed to working in partnership with the sugar industry to facilitate a sustainable future. Yesterday the Prime Minister announced that the government will help those in most genuine need with immediate income support. As a first step to help ease their financial situation, up to $21 million in income support will be available to eligible sugar cane growers and harvesters. The government will be considering further assistance measures after we have further discussions with industry on the way ahead. This support is in addition to the $80 million in assistance provided over the past four years to thousands of cane farmers and harvesters and their families. Since October 2002 the Sugar Industry Reform Program has delivered over $20 million in assistance to over 2,500 people involved in the sugar industry. The Australian government will now undertake further discussions with the sugar industry about further assistance, and we have indicated we are prepared to go beyond the previously announced package to help position the industry for the future.</para><para>I have to ask: what has the Beattie government done to help its own sugar cane growers? In the last 18 months the Beattie government has spent virtually nothing on assistance to the industry. Earlier this week Premier Beattie reached agreement with the sugar industry on a model for regulatory reform, and I commend him for that. But it is now up to the Queensland government to commence delivery of its long promised, much anticipated but slow to arrive $30 million in industry assistance. The Australian government remains committed to working in partnership with industry to facilitate a viable future.</para><para>In terms of prices, sugar is essentially the most corrupt commodity market in the world. Sugar growers in Australia today and into the future will have virtually no control over the prices they are offered for their product. They face huge competition from other countries in the world, particularly from developing countries like Brazil, and massive subsidies from governments around the world who are determined to prop up the industry whatever its fundamental economics look like. </para><para>While the government has accepted its responsibility to help in this transition to viability, it is also incumbent on the industry to have a look at itself, be prepared to make changes, and accept the fact—I am speaking as the federal member for Parramatta rather than as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer—that there are many individuals around Australia who face risks and uncertainties in their business environments and do not have control over all their variables. In some instances, individuals have to be prepared to look at other alternatives, such as moving capital into other sectors of the Australian economy, if they cannot secure the economic fundamentals of their business or industry.</para><para>The <inline ref="R1943">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 9) 2003</inline> gives effect to several wider taxation measures. Each of these measures will refine the operation of the current law, improving the fairness and equity of the system. Schedule 1 to the bill will ensure that a GST registered supplier of an eligible first aid or lifesaving course is able to treat the supply as GST free.</para><para>I foreshadow that the government intends to move an amendment to add greater flexibility to this exemption. The amendment to the bill will provide the necessary legislative flexibility to allow qualifying suppliers of a first aid or lifesaving course to be prescribed in the regulations. This will allow the government to recognise relevant training qualifications as and when appropriate. </para><para>Schedule 2 to the bill modifies the general value-shifting regime so that, as a transitional measure, the consequences arising from operating under the regime do not apply to most direct value shifts involving services. This measure will help to reduce compliance costs for businesses during the transition to consolidation. The consolidation measure is an important business tax reform initiative that allows wholly-owned corporate groups to elect to be treated as single entities for income tax purposes. The consolidation regime will promote business efficiency, improve the integrity of the Australian tax system and reduce ongoing income tax compliance costs for those wholly-owned groups that choose to consolidate.</para><para>The general value-shifting regime is an important integrity measure, designed to prevent the manipulation of tax rules by shifting value between assets by closely held entities that are not part of the same consolidated group. This new regime is complementary to the consolidation regime and reproduces the structural value-shifting integrity achieved by the consolidation regime to those groups outside consolidation.</para><para>The measures in this bill ensure that groups that consolidate during a transitional period do not incur compliance costs associated with setting up systems to identify service related indirect value shifts, when those systems will not be needed after consolidation. The measure will reduce compliance costs for business during the transition. The measure will allow groups that do not consolidate extra time to establish systems to track service related indirect value shifts that may require adjustments under the general value-shifting regime.</para><para>Schedule 3 will improve the operation of the alienation of personal services income provisions. The fringe benefits tax law will be amended to remove the potential for effective double taxation of payments that are made non-deductible by the personal service income provisions, and which may also be subject to fringe benefits tax. It was never intended that such double taxation would apply. This schedule will also make further amendments to the tax law to allow an individual working through a personal services entity to deduct a net personal services income loss. This change is consistent with the intent of the rules generally, which is to put the individual earning personal services income through an entity in the same situation, had the individual been deriving the income as an employee. These amendments were sought by tax professionals and will align the operation of the law with the original policy intent.</para><para>The amendments in schedule 4 will amend the income tax law to specify the taxation treatment of sugar industry exit grants made under the sugar industry reform program. One component of the sugar industry reform program is Commonwealth government assistance for cane growers who wish to leave the sugar industry. The assistance consists of a one-off payment, a sugar industry exit grant, of up to $45,000. Sugar industry exit grants that are paid to taxpayers who leave the agricultural industry altogether will be exempt from income tax. Grants that are paid to taxpayers who leave the sugar industry but continue to carry on another agricultural enterprise will be included in assessable income.</para><para>Schedule 5 will ensure that foreign resident withholding rules will apply where an alienated personal services payment is of a kind to be covered by the foreign resident withholding rules. This will facilitate the efficient collection of tax on the payments. The foreign resident withholding rules broadly require an entity to withhold an amount from a payment of a kind prescribed by regulations. The government has not yet prescribed any payments. An alienated personal services payment is a payment received by an entity that relates to an amount that is included in the assessable income of an individual. These payments may also be of a kind to be prescribed by the foreign resident withholding rules. </para><para>Under the existing law, where an entity receiving a payment of this kind is a foreign resident, the withholding rules will not apply and the entity may be liable to pay an amount under the alienation of personal services income rules. In these circumstances the tax relating to the payment may not be paid by the entity that is outside Australia. Recovery of the tax debt may then be difficult. The amendments will ensure the appropriate operation of the foreign resident withholding rules so that tax is collected on those payments before they leave Australia.</para><para>The amendments in schedule 6 will ensure that mutual friendly societies that are life insurance companies and that restructure by demutualising can benefit from the taxation framework that applies to other mutual life insurance companies that restructure by demutualising. Some friendly societies that qualify as life insurance companies have restructured by demutualising. However, due to technicalities in the existing law, the taxation framework that applies to other mutual life insurance companies that demutualise does not apply to those friendly societies. The amendments will remove this inconsistency.</para><para>Schedule 7 will amend the simplified tax system to provide an optional rollover relief when there are partial changes in the ownership of a partnership. This rollover relief will ensure that a taxable gain or loss will only arise when a partnership ultimately disposes of its depreciating assets. These amendments will remove a barrier that may be deterring some small businesses from entering the simplified tax regime.</para><para>Schedule 8 amends the consolidation regime under which wholly owned corporate groups are treated as a single entity for income tax purposes. The amendments will provide additional flexibility in the transition to consolidation by allowing certain choices made by a head company to be revoked or amended before 1 January 2005. The amendments in this schedule also ensure that the rules governing eligibility for the research and development tax offset apply appropriately in cases where companies join or leave a consolidated group part way through an income year.

Instructors with the required qualifications would then be able to conduct lifesaving courses that are treated as GST-free supplies. Prior to this amendment, it was proposed that the supply of a lifesaving course was to be GST-free only if the course was conducted by an instructor that held a training qualification issued by Austswim, Royal Life Saving Society Australia or Surf Life Saving Australia. After the bill was introduced into the parliament, it was recognised that a number of other qualifications may be relevant to the conduct of lifesaving courses. The parliamentary amendment provides the necessary flexibility in the law to enable additional qualifications to be recognised as and when appropriate.

Let me say from the outset that the bill itself is sensible and grounded in compassion, but the circumstances creating the need for the bill are scandalous and one of the most outrageous indictments of Western society in recent history. The International Transfer of Prisoners Act sets up a regime for the transfer of convicted prisoners to their home country to serve out any sentence. It is based on an international convention allowing a country to transfer a prisoner following a conviction by a court or tribunal. This bill is necessary in order to ensure that a conviction by a military commission against a person held in Guantanamo Bay can still activate the beneficial provisions of this regime.</para></talk.start><para>The need for this bill comes about because a military commission is not a court or tribunal and Guantanamo Bay does not fit easily within the definition of a foreign country. The fact that we need this bill highlights the legal no-man's-land for prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, and it highlights the shameful fact that they will not be tried through any ordinary court process. Despite Labor's uneasiness about the circumstances in which this bill has become necessary, we intend to support it because of its humanitarian impact. Noone could argue that, if Mr Habib or Mr Hicks are convicted, they should stay in Cuba to serve out any sentence. Because of our commitment to support this beneficial legislation and also our longstanding objection to the process that is being proposed to try these men, I move the second reading amendment that has been circulated in my name. It reads:</para><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>“whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:</para><para>(1)	acquiescing in the use of US military commissions to try Australian citizens; and</para><para>(2)	failing to explore all options for the two Australians currently being detained by US authorities in Guantanamo Bay, to be tried in Australia”.</para><para>Before dealing critically with the scandalous situation of Mr Hicks and Mr Habib, let me deal briefly with the transfer regime involved in the act and the proposed changes to it. Currently, as I have mentioned, the act allows for the transfer of convicted prisoners to Australia from a foreign country which is party to a multilateral convention, which includes the United States, or with whom Australia has a bilateral agreement for the transfer of prisoners, which currently includes countries such as Thailand. The current definition of `countries' is being amend-ed by this bill to acknowledge regions whose status might not clearly be one of a country.</para><para>This amendment will cover the situation in Guantanamo Bay, where the land is part of the sovereign territory of Cuba but which is `a region under the jurisdiction or control' of the US pursuant to a lease. New subsection 8(5)(d) ensures that a convicted prisoner held in these circumstances could still be the subject of a transfer back home. It is worth noting as an aside that, although those in Cuba are clearly in our sights now, it is possible that in the future this extended definition might apply to those convicted in Hong Kong or perhaps Taiwan or other countries or regions with unusual or irregular status—perhaps even in countries under the temporary administration of other countries like Iraq and perhaps in the foreseeable future Haiti. </para><para>The bill also extends the definition of `court or tribunal' to include a military commission of the United States of America for the purposes of this act. If it were not for the fact that this legislation is being introduced purely to ensure that convicted Australians can be returned to Australia to serve out their sentences, Labor might have very serious reservations about changing this definition. If the government were seeking to change the definition of a court or tribunal generally or for any other purpose, we would not be supporting this bill.</para><para>Labor does not support the US government's use of a military commission process to try our citizens. This process is not independent and it is not fair, and any decisions in any other context should not be given equal status to that of a court or tribunal. But Labor does accept that these definitions and amendments to the overall act are only on the basis that the bill is beneficial—and beneficial to those two citizens who might most immediately be affected. It is possible that this legislation is entirely premature and may be unnecessary, as no charges have yet been laid, let alone there having been any conviction against these two Australian citizens, but it is important that the mechanism be in place. We accept that the process, even though it has moved incredibly slowly so far, may move more quickly if and when charges are laid, and we would not want to stand in the way of supporting these beneficial provisions.</para><para>Certainly if prisoners convicted overseas are able to serve out their sentences here in Australia, it will be of great benefit not only to those individuals but particularly to their families and support networks that they would then be near. For Mr Hicks and Mr Habib, if they are convicted and returned to Australia under these new provisions, it could end what has been more than two years of isolation and disconnection from their families back here in Australia. In this context it would clearly be wrong for us to refuse to support the bill. </para><para>It should be noted, however, that this legislation on its own is not enough to secure the transfer of Mr Hicks and Mr Habib, if convicted, from Guantanamo Bay to Australia. I understand—and the broad scheme of the act makes this clear—that a separate agreement would still have to be entered into between the Australian and US governments to organise the final details, timing and conditions of any transfer and the terms of any ongoing sentence being served out in Australia. Any transfer under this act, if amended, still requires the consent of the prisoner, the transfer country and the receiving country—and, in Australia's case, the state or territory where the prisoner would be held to serve out their remaining sentence. We do not know whether the government has sought the consent of the US for such transfers in the event that either of these two men is convicted.</para><para>I have moved the second reading amendment in order to make two general points. One is that ongoing detention, without charge, of Australian citizens of a legally indeterminate nature is an outrageous position for this government to remain silent about. The Labor Party condemns the government for acquiescing in this process—for making no comments, for negotiating no improved conditions and for failing to explore all of the options for Mr Hicks and Mr Habib to be tried according to a fair process. Our amendment recognises the two fundamental aspects in which the government has failed its responsibilities in handling this matter. Neither the Prime Minister as the leader of this country nor the AttorneyGeneral as its first legal officer have taken any stand on this issue. Neither of them has challenged, queried or pushed the US government for holding two of our citizens in these legally questionable circumstances. Neither of them has effectively explored other options by which these two Australians could be tried in Australia. </para><para>Labor want to make it absolutely clear in this debate that we condemn the use of a military commission to try those detained in Guantanamo Bay. Labor has consistently argued that the US military commission process is seriously flawed and there are inadequate safeguards against an unfair trial. Our criticisms include the lack of independence of the commission from the US executive arm of government, the absence of any rules of evidence and the absence of an appeal mechanism to an ordinary court. Given that the Attorney is sitting here across the table, I might say that we are also extraordinarily concerned that the US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, has made the incredible comment in recent days that, even if people held in Guantanamo Bay are tried by a military commission and acquitted, the US may indeed continue to detain these people. That is an outrageous suggestion, and I would urge the Attorney to speak strongly to the US government to say that that would not be an adequate way of treating not just Australian citizens who might be part of this process but people of any other country who will be.</para><para>So while Labor is supporting this bill for the benefits that it brings primarily to the two people who are most likely to be immediately affected, we are doing this only on the grounds of the humanitarian impact. The obvious alternative—to leave them in the conditions in Guantanamo Bay—is one that cannot be justified. I would like to take this opportunity to also talk briefly about the current status of the people who are being held at Guantanamo Bay and, in particular, Mr Hicks and Mr Habib, as I think it is very much within the context of this legislation. The US has specified that the detainees will be tried by a military commission, the rules of which were set out in a military commission order on 21 March 2002. The first detainees—nationals from Yemen and the Sudan—were charged on 24 February 2004 and have been charged with conspiracy for having:</para><quote><para>... willfully and knowingly joined an enterprise of persons who shared a common criminal purpose ... to commit the following offenses ... attacking civilians; attacking civilian objects; murder by an unprivileged belligerent; destruction of property by an unprivileged belligerent; and terrorism, said conduct being in the context of and associated with armed conflict.</para></quote><para>Both Mr Hicks and Mr Habib are yet to be charged, although Mr Hicks has been declared eligible for trial since July 2003. We are coming close to a year since that announcement and comments by the Australian government that charges were to be laid imminently. Mr Hicks now has a military and civilian lawyer representing him, and we understand both Mr Hicks and Mr Habib now have some limited consular access. The US government maintains its view that the detainees are not subject to the ordinary protections of US law, yet they are also not entitled to the status of prisoner of war. They are classed as enemy combatants, leaving them with this indeterminate legal status—or in a twilight zone, as it has been described elsewhere. The precise nature of the detention of all those held by the US in Cuba is being tested currently in the US Supreme Court, and we expect that the government will pay close attention to the outcome of this case to see in fact whether they should have been arguing about the status of Australian citizens well before this.</para><para>The US is satisfied that its military commissions are appropriate and, as I have already referred to, its most recent comments indicate that the US may continue to detain people even if they are acquitted by the military commission. It has not provided any information publicly that confirms whether its intention is to charge Mr Hicks or Mr Habib under US law, international law or some other combination of known or unknown laws. The Australian government's comments on these cases has been very inconsistent and misleading. The government says it does not know what evidence the US has against these two Australians, yet in the same breath it continues to assert that it knows that they cannot be tried under any offences in Australia. The government also appears to have taken little action advocating to the US that charges be laid quickly and a fair process be used. In fact, the government has taken an entirely handsoff approach, allowing the US to proceed in any way it sees fit, and has expressed no concerns about the process to be used in the military commission.</para><para>I was staggered by a press conference that the Attorney gave in Washington on a recent visit, where after dealing with a number of other issues, such as his negotiations over air marshals and others, he said at the end to the gathered press corps, `I had better raise this issue with you, because it seems to be of interest to you'—that is, the media. This is our Attorney, raising the status, interest or process that is about to be applied to two Australian citizens being held by the US in these extraordinary circumstances only because the media has some interest in it, not because as the first law officer of the Commonwealth he might actually take some interest in whether a fair process is being used or whether he, like his colleagues from other countries, should be arguing for a better process to apply to the detainees.</para><para>That is in great contrast to what the British government has argued successfully—for the return of at least five of its citizens and for assurances about the process for those remaining. The British government made public and constant comment about the concerns that it had that British citizens were not going to receive a fair trial before the US military commission, and the British government was prepared to take some responsibility for the way its citizens were going to be treated at the hands of a foreign power—and not just any foreign power, but a close ally. Australia, although similarly established under the Westminster system of government and with a commitment to the separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary—all the sorts of things that the Attorney would be well aware of—seems to have felt no such requirement to advocate that its citizens should be brought before its own justice system. The Howard government seems to be willing to allow the US executive arm of government to act as prosecutor, judge and jury for these alleged terrorists, removing any pretence of a separation of powers and, in fact, consolidating the powers in the hands of the government not only to set the rules for the military trials but also to decide whether those people will even be released from detention if acquitted by the military commission.</para><para>The military order that sets up these military commissions that would sentence Mr Hicks and Mr Habib if they are found guilty of any offences they are charged with is obviously going to be an exercise of executive power, not US judicial power. This does raise a further question as to whether any continued detention, if they were transferred back to Australia following a conviction, would in fact be challenged under our Australian Constitution. As the Attorney would know, under our Constitution there is no authority for executive detention by the Commonwealth government, except where it is connected with a head of legislative power and is reasonably necessary for the purpose of its exercise. The government has declined to share with the opposition its legal advice on the constitutionality of this bill, but we believe that the obligation is fairly and squarely on the government to satisfy itself that these limitations can be overcome. We would like to raise, for the purposes of seeking further advice on this, whether the government is satisfied that it would be constitutionally valid to continue to detain people in Australia if they were transferred here under the amended bill following sentencing by a military commission with this extraordinary use of executive power.</para><para>In the time remaining, I will outline what the Australian Labor Party believes would be a much fairer and more just way of dealing with this situation in general, and these two Australian citizens in particular. Firstly, Labor believes that alleged terrorists must be dealt with quickly. Once caught and detained, they must be charged and brought to trial to face justice. It is the responsibility of any democratic government to ensure that the process that they face is fair and that they are not left in a legal no-man's-land. Labor wants to be convinced that all options for an Australian prosecution have properly been considered, based on the evidence available to Australia and the US. Labor will continue to demand that the government actively look at all options that are available, including the use of existing domestic or international laws, the option of applying international laws in Australia—even if new enabling legislation would be required—and any other options that would deliver a quick and fair process.</para><para>Labor will pursue options with legal experts—international, criminal and constitutional lawyers. The government does not appear to have aggressively pursued any of these options. Despite the government's assertions that it cannot take any of these options, it has not addressed numerous options that have been raised by others in the community and by experts in the legal world and that could be pursued.</para><para>The bottom line, Mr Attorney, is if Mr Hicks and Mr Habib cannot be tried in Australia, Australia must demand from the US a quick and fair process there. If they are eventually tried and acquitted in the US, they must not continue to be detained after acquittal. If they are tried and convicted, they should be able to serve their sentences in Australia.</para><para>It is a disgrace that the Howard government has had more than two years to deal with this situation and still cannot answer any of the following basic questions: what they will be charged with in the US? Will they be charged under US or international law? Is there any international law that could be used to try them in Australia? Has Australia been given a brief of evidence by the US or has it even asked for it?</para><para>The government has neglected its basic obligations to citizens detained by other countries. The government does not know if their detention is lawful. It has left them in a legal no-man's-land. It has expressed no concerns about the military commission process. It has not actively advocated to the US, unlike the Brits and others, for a return, for a better process or for a speedy prosecution of Australian citizens. Most inconsistently, Australian citizens charged in other countries with offences like murder, drug trafficking or other criminal matters, have got more attention from the government than the two people being held in Guantanamo Bay.</para><para>What Labor wants is that terrorists should be brought to justice. Charges should be laid quickly and trials should be fair. The Australian government should chase all options and pursue a trial here for Australians involved in alleged terrorist activities, if that is legally possible.</para><para>In any case, the Australian government must urge the US to charge detained Australians quickly, and prosecute those charges using a using a fair process, not a dodgy military commission. Australians cannot and should not be able to be indefinitely held without charge and, if they are charged and acquitted, they must not continue to be detained. </para><para>In summary, Labor supports the bill that is before the House because of the beneficial impact it would have to those that it affects. It is certainly a humane approach to allow people to serve in Australia any sentence that they may have received in any jurisdiction overseas so that they are closer to their family. We support that in principle, and we understand why the government wants to change the provisions of this act to be able to allow Mr Hicks and Mr Habib, if they are convicted by a military commission, to be able to serve out any sentence here in Australia. But we strongly disagree, and register our disagreement, with the approach that the Australian government has taken in this matter more generally, with its acquiescence to US demands and its approach to use a military commission that will not achieve a fair outcome. We disagree with the government's ongoing acquiescence and failure to push the US to charge and bring to trial the two people who have been held for over two years in detention in Guantanamo Bay.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Mossfield)</inline>—Is the amendment seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>JK6</name.id><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McClelland</name></talker><para>—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>25722</page.no><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name><name.id>00AKI</name.id><electorate>Dickson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It gives me a great deal of pleasure to rise today and support the <inline ref="R1987">International Transfer of Prisoners Amendment Bill 2004 </inline>before the House. It is always a pleasure to speak after the member for Gellibrand because it the highlights the definite divergence of views of the Labor Party to the strong position adopted by the coalition on these very important issues.</para></talk.start><para>If, later this year, people ask themselves what it is that Labor has to offer and what it is in stark contrast that the coalition has to offer, then they need to look at contributions by people like the member for Gellibrand. Rational thinkers in this debate view the member for Gellibrand as even loopier than the current Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa, who has a very confused contribution to make on this issue. It is not surprising when you look at some of his contributions made in various debates in past years.</para><para>The Labor Party cannot have the best of both worlds. Like many other issues, they have walked the centre of the road yet again. In one breath they said that they support the government in this bill but they put reservations and caveats on their support. Again, it is a demonstration to the Australian people that the Labor Party is weak on border protection and weak on national security issues, including terrorism.</para><para>This government has provided for certainty as best as possible for the Australian people. This government is about bringing terrorism under the best control that it possibly can, with all of the unknowns that are involved in the debate. It has been a government that has provided more definite legislation for strong and determined action to deal with the evil of terrorism we face. The Labor Party stands in stark contrast in this debate as it has in many of the debates on terrorism in this House over the last two years. It is something the people will take into consideration when they weigh their views about whom that they think will be able to lead this country prosperously and safely into the next decade.</para><para>This bill amends the International Transfer of Prisoners Act to facilitate the transfer to Australia of any Australian citizen detained at Guantanamo Bay who may subsequently be convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment by a military commission of the USA. It also applies the act to areas that may have an unusual status. Specifically, the bill amends the act to expand the definition of `transfer country' under subsection 4(1) to include a reference to `or a region'. It clarifies the meaning of a court or tribunal for the purposes of the act, particularly in terms of the definition of `sentence of imprisonment' contained in section 4(1) of the act. It also clarifies and expands the list of areas deemed part of a transfer country. In addition, it inserts a new subsection 8(6) to clarify that a region may be deemed a transfer country for the purposes of the act.</para><para>The amendments will increase the flexibility and application of the international transfer of prisoners scheme as it applies to Australia, allowing the scheme to apply to a broader range of areas. This will also allow the act to apply to a larger number of Australian citizens or persons with community links to Australia who are imprisoned in foreign countries. Conversely, the amendments will also allow for a larger number of foreign nationals imprisoned in Australia to return to their home countries, thereby providing an economic benefit to Australia.</para><para>The increased flexibility and application will also provide increased community benefits; reduce the impact on Australian families who have family members imprisoned in areas that the act currently does not apply to; and reduce the impact on Australian citizens imprisoned overseas who may suffer due to the cultural and language differences they experience in a foreign country. Returning such prisoners to Australia increases their chances of rehabilitation not only by enabling the prisoners to take part in prison programs and services that they may not have access to in a foreign country but also by enabling the prisoners to have more contact with their families. The amendments will result in the expansion of an established legislative scheme under which Mr David Hicks and Mr Habib could be transferred to Australia to serve a prison sentence imposed by a US military commission.</para><para>It is important as part of this debate to canvass some of the views that this government has more generally in relation to terrorism, and I alluded to some of those in my opening remarks. It is pertinent to put on the public record today that this government places a very high priority on combating the threat that terrorism poses to Australians and our interests not only at home but also abroad. We have made good progress, but we must not be complacent. The fight against terrorism will be long and difficult. There is no doubt about that.</para><para>Collectively, countries in the region have disrupted the Jemaah Islamiah network through the capture and detention of well over 200 JI members. The joint Australian-Indonesian investigation of the Bali bombings has resulted in 32 convictions to date and has yielded a great deal of useful intelligence about JI's operations in the region. But we have not disabled JI. Key operatives are still at large and the organisation remains highly resilient and committed to its cause.</para><para>Regrettably, South-East Asia remains a front line in the fight against terrorism. We assess that more attacks which threaten the safety and security of our citizens are inevitable. The Marriott Hotel bombing in Jakarta in August last year, the November 2003 bombings in Istanbul and the most recent horrific attacks in Karbala and Baghdad are tragic reminders that terrorist threats are not theoretical.</para><para>It is important to recognise the international nature of the threat. Terrorist groups are cooperating across regions, transiting borders and using one country to train in, another to raise funds in and another to seek refuge in. They are working together to maximise the impact of their activities. The government has been responding internationally. Australia has signed nine bilateral counter-terrorism MOUs with regional countries, supporting practical, operational level cooperation.</para><para>The Regional Ministerial Meeting on Counter-Terrorism that Mr Downer co-chaired with his Indonesian counterpart in Bali on 4 and 5 February identified ways of strengthening the region's counter-terrorism effort in the critical areas of law enforcement, information sharing and legal frameworks. At the Bali meeting, Australia and Indonesia also announced the establishment of the Indonesia Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation. The centre, which will have both a capacity-building and operational support mandate, will be developed as a resource for the entire region in the fight against transnational crime, with a focus on counter-terrorism.</para><para>The threat we are facing cannot be negotiated away and its defeat will require resolve and commitment over the long term. In this debate it is plain for the Australian people to see that the only government with the determination to meet this serious threat head on is this government. This government has a proven track record in the fight against terrorism. We have a proven track record in putting forward legislation that is needed to enable our intelligence and law enforcement bodies to deal with the real threat that is posed, now on a daily basis, in this new world to every Australian.</para><para>But, as I say, it is important for the Australian people to consider alternatives. When you look at the alternative that is provided by the Australian Labor Party, you see that it stands in stark contrast to the position the government has taken not only in relation to the legislation before the House today but also in previous debates in this House. I want to refer specifically to some of the positions—and I say `positions' plural—that were taken by the Leader of the Opposition in this debate when it was discussed in the media only a week ago. Firstly, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 21 February says:</para><quote><para>Labor leader Mark Latham says the Opposition would support retrospective counter-terrorism legislation to enable the Government to try Guantanamo Bay detainees David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib in Australia.</para></quote><para>That was the first report of what the member for Werriwa's actions would be. But we know that he has many positions on many issues, sometimes on the same day. We know that the Treasurer's assessment of the member for Werriwa is quite right—his mood can quite quickly change from <inline font-style="italic">Lateline </inline>to lunchtime. The member for Werriwa has this capacity to lead by Google search. He is the Google search leader. He has the Google style of leadership which sees new ideas discovered and rediscovered each day. The position that he takes on an issue on a particular day depends on the results of his Google search. An interesting article in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian </inline>on Saturday 21 February noted:</para><quote><para>MARK Latham was backing away last night from earlier suggestions that he would support retrospective legislation to have two Australians at Guantanamo Bay brought home for trial.</para><para>Yesterday morning, Mr Latham said terror suspects David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib should be tried in Australia and Labor would support any legislation to make it possible.</para><para>This would mean backdating legislation passed in 2002 to make terrorism an offence at the time the two men are alleged to have trained with al-Qa'ida in Afghanistan.</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>Mr Latham's office refused last night to confirm the Opposition would support backdating the legislation to allow the two men to face court in Australia.</para></quote><para>It went on to say:</para><quote><para>Left-wing Labor front-bencher and lawyer Daryl Melham told <inline font-style="italic">The Weekend Australian </inline>last month that retrospective legislation could be unconstitutional.</para></quote><para>There was a very interesting contribution in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier Mail </inline>on 23 February by Dennis Atkins, which said:</para><quote><para>MARK Latham blundered last Friday and it is telling on two levels.</para><para>The story of the day was that the British Government had negotiated the repatriation of five of its nationals held at Guantamo Bay camp ...</para></quote><para>It went on further to say:</para><quote><para>Latham was reported as saying he and Labor stood ready to back retrospective laws which would bring Hicks and Habib home.

It goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Latham's spokeswoman says Latham said no such thing, rather he offered to talk to the Government about laws which could assist the pair's return.</para><para>On the general question of whether the Opposition Leader supports retrospectivity for criminal offences, his office says “no”.</para><para>And now shadow attorney-general Nicola Roxon says retrospectivity could be considered even though it would be “definitely unusual”.</para></quote><para>The article went on to say:</para><quote><para>This confusion raises a question about Latham.

Federal politicians, especially leaders, allow basic accountability by releasing transcripts of media interviews—it always happened when Kim Beazley and Simon Crean led Labor.</para><para>But Latham is picking and choosing what is released. There are no transcripts available for last Friday, so we don't really know what the Opposition Leader was saying.</para><para>Apparently he criticised the Government for not having laws which could allow Hicks and Habib to be brought back to Australia, leaving the way open for his remarks to be interpreted as support for retrospective legislation.</para><para>The ABC, sensing a good story, sent a radio reporter out to quiz him further.</para><para>It is understood every question was framed in the context of retrospectivity and, while Latham did not use that word, he did not once repudiate the concept.</para></quote><para>This is the important part:</para><quote><para>Now that he's in hot water, his office is ducking and weaving. This is not new politics. It's just the same old song.</para></quote><para>I say not only to the people of Dickson but to all Australians that later this year they will face a very stark and distinct contrast. They will be faced with an opposition that is divided, weak and incapable of making decisions which are in the national interest in the long-term support of this country. On the other hand, they will be faced with a government that has a proven track record, not only in its ability to secure a safe and caring environment for Australians and to provide economic support for Australian families and small businesses, but also more generally in areas like protecting Australians from the very real terrorism threat that faces this country and, importantly, protecting our borders.</para><para>You only need to look at the Labor Party's track record and some of the hypocrites that sit on that front bench opposite to know what a Labor government would bring to this country. Make no mistake about it—the people in Dickson and right across this country face a very important decision. While some of the Labor Party's rhetoric and third-rate style may appeal to some people in our community, the reality is that when you look at the substance and the policies behind the rhetoric and the rubbish you soon realise that their promises are hollow and that a complete fraud is being delivered to the Australian people by the opposition leader and the Labor Party in general.</para><para>I take the opportunity today to commend this bill to the House. I commend the Attorney-General on his strong stance on behalf of this government in relation to terrorism legislation. I condemn not only the shadow Attorney-General but also the opposition leader for their perceived efforts to support the Australian people through their continually weak, pathetic, wishy-washy, flip-flop—however you want to describe it—stance on these bills. It is time to condemn the Australian Labor Party for their continually soft policy in relation to terrorism and border protection.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>25726</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That was an interesting contribution.

He decided to contribute to the debate, but he forgot to actually bring a copy of the bill that is being debated. The bill that we are discussing today, if I can remind the House, is about the capacity of the Commonwealth to transfer David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib back to Australia if convicted by a military tribunal of the United States.</para></talk.start><para>The member for Dickson should also understand that we support the International Transfer of Prisoners Amendment Bill 2004 but we move an amendment. We support the bill because it is beneficial, as the shadow Attorney-General indicated, but we also have to discuss the context in which we find this bill being introduced to the House. I will go to some of the specifics because they were absent from the last speaker's comments. The bill looks to provide the legal capacity to have two Australian citizens who are currently detained indefinitely without charge in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, returned to Australia if ultimately charged. Therefore there have had to be amendments made to the International Transfer of Prisoners Act 1997, and we certainly support the amendment to the 1997 act to ensure that those prisoners can be returned.</para><para>Currently the act allows for convicted prisoners to be transferred to Australia from countries that are either a party to the multilateral convention, which also includes the United States, or with whom Australia has a bilateral agreement for the transfer of prisoners, such as Thailand. The definition of `countries' is presently restricted to colonies, territories or protectorates of those countries, as well as territories for whose international relations those countries are responsible. To be eligible for transfer under the act currently, a prisoner must have been sentenced by a court or tribunal—not a military court but a court or a tribunal—in the foreign country. The act also requires dual criminality—that is, actions being criminal both here and in the overseas jurisdiction. However, the Attorney-General does have the discretion to exempt such a requirement, as would be the case in the instances to which we refer today. Any transfer must be consented to by the prisoner, the transferring country and the receiving country.</para><para>That is the act we have in place today, and the bill before us seeks to amend it to ensure that the definition of `country', given the unique nature of the region of Guantanamo Bay—the fact that it is under United States control although in a foreign land—will provide for a new paragraph D at section 4: `a foreign country exercises jurisdiction or control over the region'. In other words, the definition of `country' will be broadened to apply to Guantanamo Bay under the 1997 act. Further to that, the bill also provides that `a military commission of the United States of America' is taken to be a court or tribunal for the purposes of the act.</para><para>We support this bill because it potentially benefits two Australian citizens, but it is certainly not an easy bill to support in its construction, because we have had to accede to a military commission of the United States being seen to be a court or tribunal. That is not a preferred position for the Labor Party to take in relation to this matter. We do so because of the potential beneficial consequences to Australian citizens abroad who are detained indefinitely. However, it is unfortunate that it has come to this, because, as the shadow Attorney-General indicated, there has really been no effort by this government to pursue the options raised by international lawyers of great expertise in the areas of international and criminal law to find ways to ensure that detainees, like those of Denmark, Great Britain and Russia, who have been released from Guantanamo Bay, are charged and tried in their own country. There has been no effort by this government to properly pursue an option which would allow for two Australian citizens to be tried and, if convicted, imprisoned in Australia and, if not convicted, released. That is not something that has in any way been vigorously pursued by this government.</para><para>Like the free trade agreement, unfortunately, when it comes to negotiating with the United States, this government does it on its knees. It bargains on its knees because, in effect, it defers to the President of the United States. John Howard's great mate George Bush calls the shots when it comes to the sugar industry in Australia and clearly he also calls the shots when it comes to Australians detained without charge in Cuba. I think it is a sad case when we see other countries finding arrangements with the United States to have their prisoners released to them, while Australia—part of the so-called coalition of the willing, as the Prime Minister likes to boast—cannot even get two detainees out of what is arguably an unlawful prison. The fact is that there is an arguable case—a probable likelihood—that the detention of those prisoners is illegal under international law. Indeed, it is not just the Labor Party who question the legality of the detention; it is questioned by many. I would like to quote a person who said:</para><quote><para>David Hicks cannot get a fair trial under the commission rules and procedures that have been established currently to try the detainees down in Guantanamo Bay.</para></quote><para>Who was that said by? It was not said by a member of the Labor Party and it was not said by an international jurist; it was said by a military officer of the United States: Major Michael Mori, the officer who has been charged with the responsibility of representing David Hicks. Clearly he is not there only to represent the interests of David Hicks; he has, I think quite rightly, pointed to the fact that the military tribunal is unfair because it does not provide for the basic rights of natural justice to apply. </para><para>One would argue that it is more likely that Saddam Hussein will receive a fairer trial under the Geneva convention than will David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib. That is the reality. For all that the government like to attack the evil former Iraqi regime and its leader Saddam Hussein—and they are quite right to do so; Saddam Hussein did preside over an autocratic, violent, repressive regime—the leader of that regime will in fact be treated more fairly, more justly and no doubt more expeditiously—given the fact that there is an election in the United States in November, I am sure there will be a show trial soon for us to watch—with recourse to more legal rights than the two Australian citizens who have been detained for two years without charge in a prison in Cuba. That is the situation we find ourselves in, and this government have not lifted a finger to concern themselves with this matter.</para><para>I know some are concerned; in fact, the member for Dickson did say, `This is all about the fact that we are against terrorists and the Labor Party are weak on terrorism.' I remind the member for Dickson that, while terrorism is certainly a threat to our citizens, it is also a threat to our tenets of democracy and we have to protect both. We have to protect our democracy and our citizens. It is not enough to argue that we can throw democratic principles and natural justice out the window because we are in a world combating terrorism. It is not enough to argue on that ground, because once we do that we have surrendered already to those who do not wish us to have a democratic and free society. So we have to be vigilant in our protection of both our citizens and the lifestyle and laws that they enjoy—which is not going to be helped, I would contend, by the government's failure to see that the detention of David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib is not fair.</para><para>As I have indicated, we do support the bill, because it provides for the possible transfer of prisoners upon conviction; but we have some serious concerns. The amendment moved by the shadow Attorney-General condemns the government's failure to pursue real options in order to find a better way to have two Australian citizens tried. It condemns the government for failing to negotiate on behalf of this country a proper process for our citizens when, in contrast, other sovereign states have already had their citizens released.</para><para>If the relationship that the Prime Minister says he has with the President of the United States is so cosy then why is it only one way? It may well be cosy but it is one-way traffic when it comes to looking after the interests of the two nations. In every circumstance, the United States wins hands down—for example, in the free trade agreement. We concede that the free trade agreement is not a free trade agreement; indeed it potentially damages many of our industries. We have not yet seen the actual agreement, of course, but we are waiting to see it; one day we will get to see it. We know the concerns of the sugar industry were raised. I know it is off the subject of the bill but it is a comparable, parallel point. The point the sugar industry had about the government not pursuing its economic interests—or indeed our interests as a nation in terms of employment and ensuring that our industries prosper—is parallel to the fact that this government fails also to protect its citizens from being held in detention without charge.</para><para>I think most Australians are really questioning this process, when neither of the detainees have even been charged with an offence after two years of detention. Whilst it has been some time—I think it was mid last year—since it was clear they were capable of going to trial, no trial date has been set. And when that trial date is set—let us hope it is soon—it is to be before a military tribunal, not before a judge and jury. Indeed, there is no judge. I return to Major Michael Mori, the US military officer assigned to David Hicks. He was interviewed recently by Judge Andrew Napolitano and the interview was aired on Fox News two weeks ago. When Mori said that the trial would not be fair, the interviewer asked:</para><quote><para>Why not? What is wrong with the procedures that have been established?</para></quote><para>Major Michael Mori responded:</para><quote><para>What is wrong with the procedures is basically the procedures have gutted the recognised criminal justice system either in the civilian process or under the uniform code of military justice.</para></quote><para>The interviewer pursued his interviewee and said:</para><quote><para>Well, let's start with the judges. Are the judges independent, or do they work for Donald Rumsfeld?</para></quote><para>Major Mori's reply was:</para><quote><para>Sir, there is no judge. The judge—independent judge has been removed from the system and been placed in the role of what they call the presiding officer on the actual jury panel themselves, so there is no independent judge to rule on issues, to control the process, to be an unbiased controller of the process to see that both sides get a fair access and fair presentation of the evidence without biasing the jury.</para></quote><para>That is what was said about the process by an officer of the United States armed forces. And in America it is not only he who is raising these concerns: former United States prisoners of war have raised concerns about the detention of people at Guantanamo Bay. They say it sets an absolutely outrageous precedent. It could allow US combatants—if found to be in this spurious category invented by the United States—to be detained in the future, with the Guantanamo Bay precedent being used as the way justice is to be applied.</para><para>This is turning the Geneva convention on its head. Indeed, we have former US POWs raising concerns about this matter, along with international jurists and many others and along with the Labor Party here today. As the shadow Attorney-General has said, there has been no vigilant effort to pursue the options that may be available to provide for those citizens to be tried here. If indeed they are convicted of those charges they must serve their sentence. They must indeed be sentenced according to the charges if convicted. But so far there has been no charge, no conviction, just detention. That is all that has happened in relation to this matter. No charge, no conviction, just detention—indefinite detention.</para><para>It has to be said that while the bill we are debating today might provide some relief down the track for the families of these two citizens, if indeed they are ultimately charged or are found not guilty and released—provided there is a further enabling process between the Commonwealth of Australia and the United States to allow them to return here—this bill is too limited in its application, too unimaginative in terms of its efforts to apply decent laws to our citizens. It lacks courage. Worst of all, it is not really intended to concern itself with two Australian citizens who have been treated so unfairly.</para><para>I say in conclusion that I support the bill. The Labor Party support the bill. We have quite rightly moved amendments condemning the conduct of this government in relation to this matter, condemning them for failing to fully pursue those options that I referred to earlier. The bill is certainly flawed and therefore we would ask the House to support the amendments and support the amended bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>25729</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I welcome the opportunity to address the merits of the <inline ref="R1987">International Transfer of Prisoners Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. It is a bill I support but, as I will demonstrate, it should be renamed the `State Sponsored Kidnapping (Confirming Australian Government Indifference) Bill 2004' as that would at least be honest and accurate. According to the explanatory memorandum that accompanies the bill: </para></talk.start><quote><para>This Bill amends the <inline font-style="italic">International Transfer of Prisoners Act 1997 </inline>to facilitate the transfer back to Australia of Australian citizens detained at Guantanamo Bay who may subsequently be convicted, found guilty and sentenced to a term of imprisonment by a military commission of the United States of America.</para></quote><para>This is because the current structure that imprisons Australian citizens in Camp Delta in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba cannot be reflected adequately in the current act. As everyone knows, because of a combination of legal holograms and transnational denial, prisoners at Guantanamo Bay cannot seek or obtain access to American courts or rely upon the American constitution to provide them with rights, certainty or even minimum standards of justice—standards that the poorest accused in Texas, New York and California would receive. As we can see, though, that is the way Bush, Rumsfeld and our very own cabinet would like it to stay.</para><para>Likewise, any sentence that is provided by a United States military commission to the prisoners of Guantanamo Bay cannot readily be described in the act as it stands. This is because the military commissions that will sit and supposedly dispense justice to the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay cannot be described as courts or tribunals. The previous speaker, the member for Burke, has reflected on some of the inadequacies of these military commissions. They cannot be described as courts or tribunals, because to do so would import a legitimate expectation that procedural conventions and rules that would be observed in courts and tribunals would be observed in these commissions as well. This would include conventions and rules like a right of appeal, the right to hear all evidence and the right to private discussions with a lawyer—rights that people charged with mass murder can expect to have provided for them objectively by the state in Australia, America, Canada and anywhere else you care to look that considers itself to be a civilised place, except of course in Camp Delta, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The <inline font-style="italic">New York Times</inline> columnist William Safire recently summed it up rather concisely. Each military commission, he wrote, would have the authority to: </para><quote><para>... conceal evidence by citing national security, make up its own rules and find a defendant guilty even if a third of the officers disagree ...</para></quote><para>This is hardly the bulwark of liberty under anyone's measure. Despite these fundamental flaws, I draw this parliament's attention to section 45 of the existing International Transfer of Prisoners Act 1997, which reads as follows:</para><quote><para>On transfer of a prisoner to Australia under this Act no appeal or review lies in Australia against the sentence of imprisonment imposed by the court or tribunal of the transfer country or by the Tribunal.</para></quote><para>From that it seems clear that an Australian convicted of a crime by the Guantanamo Bay military commission will not be able to appeal the decision in their own country, despite the commission having lower standards of integrity than any Australian court. So anything more than a casual glance over this bill is cause for significant concern. The context surrounding this bill is plainly alarming and creates distress not just to many people in my electorate of Cunningham but also to people within the wider Australian community. And let us not forget the families of David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib, left to mourn the kidnapping of their family members by the United States government, because that is what Camp Delta is: an ongoing and unlawful deprivation of liberty. As I said, we have got to remember that these are Australian citizens. They have families. Mr Habib has a young son, a daughter and wife. Mr Hicks has his family as well. We really should be taking care of our Australian citizens. As well, the broader community is left to mourn the death of the Australian government's obligations to assist its citizens overseas when serious allegations are raised against them.</para><para>The wider concern though, as I see it, is just what Guantanamo Bay represents and just how safe a United States military commission conviction will be. To be blunt, I believe that Guantanamo Bay is an infection on the body of human rights law, which begins with the denial of habeas corpus writs and ends with the government's approval of indefinite detention without charge. Given that the chief lawyer at the Pentagon, General Counsel William J. Haynes II, said recently that the government of the United States might not even release people who are accused and then acquitted by a US military commission—that is right: those acquitted by the commission may never be released—this sore will get a whole lot bigger. Haynes said that indefinite detention of prisoners acquitted by a military tribunal might be necessary because the prisoners are `dangerous people' and because `When somebody's trying to kill you or your people, and you capture them, you can hold them.' If he meant that the Americans are entitled to hold prisoners captured in Afghanistan indefinitely without convicting them of any crime because they are prisoners of war, either he is wrong or human rights do not matter. If he meant to declare all the prisoners guilty of war crimes in advance, as Bush apparently did when he declared that the prisoners are `killers', then his remarks provide fresh reason to question the fairness and independence of the military tribunals that are so firmly under the Bush administration's control.</para><para>At the core of this issue is the fact that military commissions are, by their very nature and design, inherently unfair and, as a direct consequence of that, they are more likely to be responsible for a miscarriage of justice. First and foremost, they are likely to make mistakes because people will plead guilty under duress—the duress being that a prisoner in Camp Delta would be offered a plea of guilty on the one hand and the chilling spectre of indefinite detention on the other. What would your choice be to such an offer, Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield? After having already served two, three, four or more years in detention without charge or trial, would it be any wonder or any surprise that people may prefer the certainty of a sentence to the horror of indefinite detention, regardless of guilt? It is a `Sophie's choice' of freedom—but it is not fiction, and this government rejoices in it in the name of the war on terror.</para><para>Where is the terror, though? It is certainly in the scenario I have just outlined; it just comes in a different, administrative, form from the violence of September 11. So from that, just how safe will a conviction from the military commission be? The answer is, plainly, `not very'. Do not take my word for it, though, Mr Deputy Speaker; listen to the few lawyers who have been assigned, belatedly, to defend some of the victims of United States sponsored kidnapping who are languishing in Camp Delta. I note in particular that Mr Habib has not yet been appointed a lawyer at all. Major Michael Mori—who, when it comes to these matters, appears to have more intestinal fortitude than the entire cabinet of the Australian government—is David Hick's military appointed lawyer. Recently he said, `The military commissions will not provide a full and fair trial,' and, `The commission process has been created and controlled by those with a vested interest only in convictions.' Major Mori has also echoed calls by Australians, most notably Senator Bob Brown during George W. Bush's recent visit to this place, to have David Hicks tried in Australia. Major Mori said:</para><quote><para>In fairness, if David Hicks has violated a law, an international law, there is no reason why it would not apply in Australia. That's universal jurisdiction, and so he should be tried in his country.</para></quote><para>When Major Mori said that, he echoed the sentiments of a significant proportion of Australians, and many members of this House would agree with that, I am sure. However, this government prefers to ignore these reasoned, well-researched and compelling arguments, and then has the gall to expect this parliament to be a party to this fraud, citing humanitarian benefits, including concern for the families of Mr Hicks and Mr Habib. The government's crocodile tears are flowing today.</para><para>So here we have it. First, these people are kidnapped by the United States government and thrown into Camp Delta at Guantanamo Bay. Then, according to the United States government, they have no right to challenge the legality of their detention. Next, they are held there indefinitely with no date being fixed for their release or trial. Next, the Australian public is expected to believe that any plea of guilty arising before the military commissions is given with free and informed consent. Next, the commissions' lawyers argue that the commissions are unfair and biased towards obtaining a conviction at the expense of basic principles of justice. Then, on top of all that, this government expects the parliament to support the transfer of Australian citizens to spend their lives in Australian jails because of proceedings that are not fair and which cultivate miscarriages of justice, while the American government is fighting, tooth and nail, to avoid the jurisdiction of its own American courts to oversee the government's actions. What a disgrace. Then, to reach commanding new heights of ridiculousness, there is no guarantee that these prisoners at Camp Delta will even be released upon acquittal.</para><para>As I have said, this bill should be renamed the `State Sponsored Kidnapping (Confirming Australian Government Indifference) Bill 2004'—that would at least be accurate. This bill represents the latest instalment of this government's policy to ignore, override and destroy the protection of long-established legal norms and basic human rights. This bill overrides, ignores, and destroys human rights by endorsing the legitimacy of the legal holograph that is Guantanamo Bay prison and cheerfully approves the Star-Spangled Banner production of show trials that are the US military commissions. In this way, by supporting the wholesale reduction in minimum standards of conduct in the criminal law, this bill holds the central tenets of justice in contempt.</para><para>Some may ask, in the shadow of these monumental obstacles to justice, why I would support this bill at all—particularly if it is so patently offensive to international and national standards. The answer lies in the interests of David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib and their families. These two Australian citizens—as we all know but some would rather forget—are detained in Camp Delta without charge or trial, without so much as a peep of advocacy from the Australian government, unlike other governments around the world who are, at least, trying to defend their citizens and to have some of them brought back to their own countries. Because of these two men, who are Australian citizens, and only because the interests of these two men and their families, will I support this bill. Under these disgraceful circumstances, I do not want to delay, by even one day, their eventual return to Australia to be reunited with their families. Given that the government has not and will not assist these two men in any way, despite all reasonable requests to do so, it is appropriate for the parliament to pave the way for their return to Australia—and that is the only reason why this bill should be supported. Once home, I look to the courts and to the protests by the people of Australia to ensure that David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib are released from any sentence imposed by the facade of justice that is dealt out by a US military commission.</para><para>I know many members on the other side have no sympathy for Hicks and Habib. Those people have made up their minds. They are judge and jury—but based on what? Media stories and reports? Briefings by our security services? We know the problems there. In this country we believe in the rule of law and the presumption of innocence. These two men are innocent until proven guilty, and we all must support that. Therefore, while I support this bill and the member for Gellibrand's amendment, I would like to inform the House that I was seeking to amend the bill so that the parliament had the opportunity to adequately describe its opposition to the Howard coalition government's overriding of basic human rights and long-established legal principles it would prefer to ignore. Accordingly, I was seeking to move the following amendment:</para><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>“whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</para><para>(1) requests that the Government:</para><para>(a)	immediately seek to obtain the release and repatriation of the two Australian citizens who are currently detained against their will in Camp Delta Guantanamo Bay;</para><para>(b)	provide a report to the Parliament on the measures it has taken to achieve the release of the two detainees by 1 July 2004; and</para><para>(2) condemns:</para><para>(a)	the use of Military Commissions in place of Courts as being inherently flawed and designed to secure convictions at the expense of justice;</para><para>(b)	the United States Government's indefinite detention, without charge of over 600 people in Guantanamo Bay as an affront to human rights; and</para><para>(c)	the Australian Government's complete lack of support for Australian citizens detained in Guantanamo Bay as an appalling failure to provide for the welfare of its citizens”.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>25733</page.no><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GRIERSON</name><name.id>00AMP</name.id><electorate>Newcastle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1987">International Transfer of Prisoners Amendment Bill 2004</inline> is before the House for debate and, although I support it, I stand to highlight the reason this bill has been framed, the events leading up to this bill and the government's failure to protect the very doctrine of law that makes this a nation of which we should be proud. I also stand because I am not a constitutional lawyer. Although I have studied law, I have no particular expertise in that field. There are many legal experts in this place, and no doubt they have helped frame this legislation and influence our concern about it. But this is legislation that needs to be assessed not just through a legal brain but also through a thinking heart. What is our role here if it is not to test all our actions against the values and mores that should guide a civilised Australia?</para></talk.start><para>The legislation is the government's reaction to having two Australian citizens, David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib, incarcerated in Guantanamo Bay for the past two years. It amends the International Transfer of Prisoners Act 1997 to facilitate their return to serve in Australia any term of imprisonment they receive if convicted by a US military commission. The legislation also overcomes the problem with the legal status of a place like Guantanamo Bay, which is part of the sovereign territory of Cuba but is under jurisdiction or control of the US under a lease arrangement with Cuba. Apparently the US have their very own separate `lawless' place to exercise their will in any way they see fit—not a good international precedent by a great nation. The legislation also covers similar regions with unusual status, such as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Although US laws may not apply in Guantanamo Bay, fortunately the US have not been able to escape the scrutiny of the international community. It is a pity, though, that they seem to escape the scrutiny of this government in their dealings with Australian citizens. The legislation also provides that a military commission of the USA will constitute, for the purpose of this bill, a recognised court or tribunal.</para><para>The bill, once enacted and applied, would not be sufficient to ensure that Mr Hicks and Mr Habib would be returned to Australia on conviction to serve their sentence here. A separate, formal agreement between the United States and Australia, detailing the terms and conditions of the transfer and sentence to be imposed, would also be required. If the government's track record in negotiating agreements with the United States is any guide, then it could be anticipated that any separate transfer of prisoner agreement would come with some major concessions by the Australian government.</para><para>Putting aside the cases of Hicks and Habib temporarily, the legislation would also allow any Australians convicted overseas in countries where agreements exist to serve their sentences in Australia, close to family and support networks, in return for Australia shouldering the cost implied in this strategy. Other countries, too, could have their convicted citizens returned to serve imprisonment in their own native country. In that way, the legislation is beneficial, particularly on humanitarian grounds and gains.</para><para>This legislation, however, is not an extradition regime to facilitate bringing back detainees from any place, but particularly from Guantanamo Bay, for trial. That is not central to this debate. But that the Australian government has done nothing to explore the application of Australian criminal law or international law to have these Australian citizens extradited to Australia is cause for condemnation and outrage. There may very well be other legislative options that could assist the extradition of Mr Hicks and Mr Habib for trial in Australia, but although the Howard government has had two years to explore better ways of dealing with these cases we have had nothing put forward for us to consider, other than the legislation we are debating today.</para><para>The legislation is worthy of support on humanitarian grounds, as it allows Australians convicted overseas to be returned to serve their sentences here. But I also support the second reading amendment put forward by the member of Gellibrand, in which we condemn the government for acquiescing in the use of US military commissions to try Australian citizens and for their failure to explore all options for the two Australians currently detained.</para><para>The cases of Hicks and Habib are complex or unusual in many ways. They are allegedly involved in terrorist related activities in a new global terrorism that has not really been experienced in the world before. Their cases are also complex and unusual because their alleged actions do not really fit the normal laws of military conflict or the usual application of the laws in this country.</para><para>Before expanding on these cases it is important to state that the innocence or guilt of Habib and Hicks is also not central to this debate. If they are guilty of a crime under US law, Australian criminal law or international law, they deserve the application of the full extent of that law. The real problem is that, if the system in place in Guantanamo Bay is allowed to run its course, we will never be able to be assured that, whatever the final outcome, our Australian detainees gained a fair trial or that their sentence was appropriate to any crime they may or may not have committed.</para><para>We need to have confidence in the legal system being applied to Australian citizens. In the case of Hicks and Habib we have no such confidence. Their cases are unusual: they were not engaged in a formally declared war against the US or Australia, they were apprehended but were not charged with any crime and they did not directly harm any US or Australian serviceman or citizen; however, they are detained by the US on the assumption that they are `enemy combatants' in the war against terrorism. Even though they are not members of any official defence forces of any nation, they are to be trialled by a US military commission, by a process acknowledged by the international legal community as being legally flawed—having inadequate safeguards against an unfair trial, lacking independence from the US executive government and lacking rules of evidence and any independent appeal mechanisms.</para><para>Why now, after allowing these two individuals—two Australians—to be held for two years, uncharged with any crime and facing the jurisdiction of a military commission rather than a recognised judicial body, are we debating today legislation that applies only to convicted prisoners held overseas? Well, the government has come under further pressure, now that two other countries—Britain and Denmark, both civilised nations like Australia—have succeeded in having their detainees in Guantanamo Bay returned for trial in their own country, yet the best we can do is pass legislation that allows the transfer of Australian citizens back to serve their sentences after conviction by the US military commission. It begs the question to the Prime Minister and the Attorney General: just how hard did you try?</para><para>Denmark and Britain both stood shoulder to shoulder in Iraq as members of the coalition of the willing and have been able to gain the return of their citizens. Perhaps it would be just for the Australian public to ask, `Wasn't our effort in that coalition good enough for us to be listened to when we wanted our citizens returned here for our legal processes to be applied?' </para><para>Incidentally, I do not see either of those countries—Britain or Denmark—busting to sell off their multilateral trading partner status in free trade agreements with the US either. In fact, when I checked today with an expert on trade matters, I was told that free trade agreements are usually done between a modern developed country and a less developed economy. I was amused to apply this rationale to our current free trade agreement with the United States. Just which nation is the less developed one? I digress.</para><para>But the Australian people must be wondering just how much special influence we do have with our good ally, the United States of America. The other pressure on the government to put this legislation to the House is the impending US Supreme Court decision after challenges by US lawyers to the legality of imposing a military regime on the prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay. So, to be seen to be doing something, the government puts this legislation forward.</para><para>Although supporting the legislation, it is not without some additional potential problems. I must register concern at the constitutionality of this legislation. The opposition has received no advice from the government on this matter but some legal inconsistencies do exist. If prisoners have been convicted by a military commission, then they are convicted under executive powers and not judicial powers. So it is not clear if, under our Constitution, they can rightfully be detained here at all. Our Constitution does not authorise executive detention, except when connected to legislative power, such as in the case of immigration detention. A High Court challenge to this legislation could be possible and the detention power challenged. Potentially, anyone brought back under this legislation would be unable to be detained, no matter what their conviction status. This inconsistency should be clarified by the Attorney General.</para><para>As suggested by a previous speaker, are we just opposing the United States? No, we certainly are not. The United States is a great nation and a great ally. It is one that we rightly should expect better of in our dealings. It is to the credit of the United States that the lawyers assigned by the Pentagon to defend the Guantanamo Bay detainees have condemned as unjust the system of military tribunals that will try the accused. The very people who have freely joined the US defence forces to defend their country's laws and freedoms, who are loyal servants of the military, have chosen to speak out against their own employer, the US government, to defend much nobler principles. Thank goodness! What a shame it took so long for the Pentagon to appoint these good men.</para><para>The US Department of Defense lawyer representing David Hicks, Major Michael Mori, stated:</para><quote><para>When you use an unfair system, all you do is risk convicting the innocent and providing somebody who is truly guilty with a valid complaint to attack his conviction. It doesn't help anybody. </para></quote><para>Major Mori has also stated, as the appointed lawyer of David Hicks, that he would rather see him tried in Australia. So would we, but this government has done nothing to bring this about within our laws and Constitution. The amendment moved by the previous speaker, the member for Cunningham, seeking that outcome has the right spirit but the wrong process. This legislation cannot bring that about, so we must do all we can to maintain pressure on the government to defend the principles of law and justice that protect our civil liberties.</para><para>Major Mori also stated that the US would not tolerate these rules for Americans, yet apparently our government sets no such standard for Australians. He also criticised the Australian government for agreeing too soon to concessions that include an agreement for Hicks to serve any prison term in Australia. We are debating this legislation today because this was the best deal our government could do, unlike Denmark and Britain. The Attorney General says:</para><quote><para>The government has been in continuous dialogue with the US since David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib were detained.</para></quote><para>That is a long time, a lot of talk but apparently not a lot of action. I quote two other appointed lawyers defending other detainees in Guantanamo Bay. US Navy Lieutenant Commander Philip Sundel stated:</para><quote><para>We are concerned with virtually every aspect of the military commission process and the impact it will have an our client's chances of getting a fair trial.</para></quote><para>So should we be. Major Bridges stated:</para><quote><para>The bottom line is it—</para></quote><para>the military commission—</para><quote><para>is an outdated system that was pulled off the shelf and dusted off from the WW2 era. The law has advanced a lot since then. The checks and balances we expect from a system today to make sure the process is fair and is not subjected to improper influences by any of the participants don't exist in the military commission system.</para></quote><para>How true. All the US lawyers appointed as `friends of the court' to defend prisoners have called for all prisoners to have the option of an appeal to US civilian courts. That is a decision we await and would welcome in applying further pressure on this government to appear to be asserting for and on behalf of Australian citizens.</para><para>Military commissions are not acceptable to us. They are very different from regular courts: there are no independent judges, the rules of evidence do not apply and detainees are at the mercy of the military, who have the power to keep them incarcerated even if they are acquitted. In registering our concerns today, it is not about whether our Australians are guilty or innocent; it is really about making sure that, no matter how extreme the situation our country faces, we remain guided by values and principles that protect our civility and integrity as a nation and distinguish us from the terrorists and anarchists who would tear civilisation down. It is our role, as a true friend to the American people, to support them to overcome the threat of terrorism, which saw the tragedies of September 11 and Bali wreak such human loss and tragedy on our peoples. But, in doing so, we must not assist the USA to undermine the due processes that set them and us apart as civilised nations. That is what this government should have been doing.</para><para>In this country, we are fortunate to have established and credible judicial and penal systems, so we should have faith that adherence to individual civil liberties will always be part of any legal process. The separation of powers and the rule of law exist in this country to protect the innocent but to be feared by the guilty; they do distinguish us from less civilised nations. Our shadow attorney-general, the member for Gellibrand, has rightly expressed Labor's concern that the Australian government is ignoring its responsibilities and wiping its hands of Australian citizens who have no chance at all of a fair trial. I also take the opportunity to congratulate the Australian Law Society and the Australian Law Council in their efforts to protect our legal system and its application. </para><para>In the particular cases of Hicks and Habib, and in applying this legislation to their cases, we need to look closely at one other area—the concept of `enemy combatant'. If the United States can detain and try people under the category of `enemy combatant', which is not recognised by any international law, does that mean that other countries in conflict with Australia can apply that precedent against Australian defence personnel who have been apprehended, and thus escape the international laws of engagement and any UN conventions that give protection to our military personnel when they are engaged in lawful combat activities? Would it mean that our intelligence and security personnel engaged in fighting terrorism could also be subjected to incarceration as `enemy combatants'? Apparently even we in the civilised nations spy on each other as well.</para><para>Any failure to adhere to proper legal processes, or to established international systems to establish new legal principles and conventions to deal with changing world circumstances, does put the civil liberties of all Australians at risk. Therefore, in conclusion, I support Labor's position, as outlined by the member for Gellibrand. The opposition would assert that it is a disgrace that the Howard government has had two years to deal with this situation and still cannot answer very basic questions about the rights and situation of our detainees in Guantanamo Bay. Labor's position is that we do want terrorists to be brought to justice and we do want charges to be laid quickly and trials to be fair. We want the Australian government to chase all the options and to pursue a trial here in Australia when people are involved in terrorist activities, if that is at all legally possible. In supporting this legislation, we are disappointed that this is the best deal that the Australian government was able to negotiate for two Australian citizens who at this time have not been charged with any crime and remain incarcerated in a very uncertain situation with a very uncertain future before them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>25738</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the members for Gellibrand, Dickson, Cunningham, Burke and Newcastle for their contributions to this debate, and I thank the opposition for recognising the humanitarian nature and principal purpose of the <inline ref="R1987">International Transfer of Prisoners Amendment Bill 2004</inline> and for their support for its passage. The government has developed this bill so that Mr Hicks and Mr Habib may benefit from the international transfer of prisoners scheme. The government has always said that it takes an interest in the welfare of these two men, and this bill demonstrates the government's commitment to assist Australian citizens detained overseas, but within context. Contrary to the opposition's assertions, the government has not simply acquiesced to the detention and possible military commission trial of Mr Hicks and Mr Habib. The government has taken an active role in ensuring that any military commission process is fair and transparent, and has also, obviously, undertaken a range of regular visits to be satisfied as to the circumstances in which Mr Hicks and Mr Habib are being held.</para></talk.start><para>I think what becomes very clear in listening to this debate is that there are fundamental differences of view between the government and the opposition in relation to the way in which terrorism should be handled. In the other place, the opposition will today take off the agenda a security related issue—that is, the issue of the proscription of terrorist organisations—because they are looking down the barrel of an election. But, when it comes to the question of what should happen to Mr Hicks and Mr Habib, it is not until we have heard the speeches today that it has become clear that the opposition is of the view that there is no requirement, in terms of dealing with the threat we face from terrorism, to respond in a way which will provide to our community the most effective protection possible.</para><para>I mentioned the other day in a speech I made in this House the difficult situation that we are in regarding our expectations as to what should happen in a civilised society and the extent to which those who are engaged in terrorist activities are prepared to use our commitment to those principles to their advantage.

Irwin Cotler speaks very frankly about the fundamental human right that you never hear talked about: the expectation that citizens of a civilised society have that their government will be involved in and take all reasonable steps to secure their safety against terrorism. </para><para>That is the issue that we are dealing with here. We are dealing with an opposition that says that we are acquiescing in the use of US military commissions to try Australian citizens and that we are failing to explore all options to bring two Australians, currently being detained by US authorities in Guantanamo Bay, to Australia to be tried here. The United States has indicated already that it was prepared to free people who were marginally involved—those who may have made one casual visit to Afghanistan or Pakistan to engage in some training in conducting terrorist events and activities, participating in programs run by al-Qaeda or Lashkar-e-Taiba—because it had assessed that they would no longer pose a risk; in other words, they would not be likely to be engaged in continuing terrorist activity. That is an assessment that the United States has made. In fact, because we have received advice on these matters from the United States, we know that the charges that ultimately will be brought against these two people, where the allegations are clearly that they were not simply Taliban tourists, revolve around their training with al-Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Taiba and that their involvement with those organisations has been of a very significant order.</para><para>We all know that these organisations are vile and heinous in what they have been undertaking and the training that they are giving to people to engage in terrorist activities. We did undertake very extensive investigations here—let me make this very clear—to see whether or not it was possible to prosecute Mr Hicks and Mr Habib on the basis of the information that we have about their engagements abroad. We have legislated to create offences for people who train with terrorist organisations. Let me be very clear about this: we regard training with terrorist organisations and financing terrorist organisations to be of very real concern. We legislated in relation to those matters in 2002, but we did not legislate retrospectively. We looked at whether that was a desirable objective. We looked at all of the sorts of comments that you might expect people to make on these matters over time and we came to the view that, as heinous as training with organisations like this is, inevitably it would be highly problematic as to whether your laws would be successful. There are issues in relation to establishing mens rea for criminal offences and, when you are legislating retrospectively, it is very difficult to establish that as one of the elements. But you also have questions about the way in which the courts look at these matters—that, in strictly construing the laws, it is highly unlikely that they would survive challenge.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83K</name.id><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>—I will deal with the question of international law and with the question of existing laws. But the point I make is that in relation to these matters, on all the advice that we have received—and I have seen the views of footpath attorneys that there may be ways in which you could prosecute people in Australia; they have all been explored and they have all been looked at—we cannot prosecute Hicks and Habib in relation to Australia. I said initially that that was particularly in relation to their activities in Pakistan and Afghanistan. I have used those words advisedly, because we also wanted to look at what had happened in relation to Mr Hicks's training and activities when he was involved in Kosovo. There we wanted to look at whether or not the crimes (foreign incursions) legislation would apply, and the advice I have is that he could not be convicted under that act. I might say, if the honourable shadow attorney is interested in these matters, that is another area in terms of the adequacy of our Australian law where I have asked for work to be done to see why that law could not be used in relation to Mr Hicks's involvement in Kosovo and to ensure that that issue is addressed.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But the fact is that the clear advice to us is that the international law did not apply in relation to the particular offences that had been established under Australian law before 2002. International law does apply now, because the amendments to our Crimes Act were to implement international law, and that was implemented in 2002. But the important point to understand about international law is that it only applies in relation to our domestic legal regime if it has been specifically implemented in Australia.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83K</name.id><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>—I do not want to get out of turn, because I was going to come to this.

I want to make it very clear that the government has been very concerned to ensure that the issues in relation to Mr Habib and Mr Hicks are addressed in ways that will continue to protect their right to be tried, and tried fairly. That is why we have looked very closely at the commission arrangements. It is why we sought certain additional assurances from the United States in relation to those matters. It is why we sought an assurance from the United States that, if we legislated for the International Transfer of Prisoners Act to be amended, it might be possible for those who were found guilty and who do not pose a continuing security threat to be brought back to Australia to serve any sentence. That is the issue that is involved here, and it is the substantial question. The sorts of assurances that the United States gave us were that neither man would be subjected to a death penalty, that there would be access to Australian consultants, that they would be able to speak with their family members and that they would have two family members attend a trial. We have taken steps to ensure that we can continue to monitor the commission process, and to that end we insisted that government observers and an independent legal expert be allowed to attend the trials.</para><para>Let me just deal with the issue that the legal status of the detainees is questionable—an assertion that the shadow Attorney makes. This is not true. The United States has determined that the detainees are unlawful enemy combatants. The laws of war recognise that any combatants may be detained to prevent them from taking further part in armed conflict. The laws of war also recognise that a person may be prosecuted for his unlawful participation in an armed conflict. The member for Gellibrand has claimed that the status of the detainees is currently before the United States Supreme Court. In fact, the only current question before the Supreme Court is whether US courts have jurisdiction over persons detained at Guantanamo Bay. The member for Gellibrand suggested that the government should have made submissions to the Supreme Court. Given that Mr Hicks' defence team made a submission to the court, I do not think there was any requirement for the government to have done so. Mr Hicks' defence team is composed of an appointed military lawyer, an Australian legal consultant and a US civilian attorney with extensive experience in terrorism trials, and the team is certainly more than competent to adequately represent his interests.</para><para>However, I do welcome the opposition's support for this bill, despite its reservations about the Guantanamo Bay detainees. I welcome its support for extensive proscriptions, even though it has reservations about the lack of merits review. But what I would really welcome from the opposition is it taking security seriously and engaging in useful and productive discussions about initiatives that will work, such as the, I think, 100 initiatives introduced by the government since September 11.</para><para>This bill does provide a statutory basis for returning to Australia any Australian citizen detained at Guantanamo Bay who is convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment by a military commission, as well as expanding the application of the International Transfer of Prisoners Act 1997 to semiautonomous regions to enable such a region to be declared a transfer country with which Australia can enter into transfer agreements. In July, we did announce that as a result of our bilateral discussions we would work with the US in putting in place these arrangements for the purpose of prisoners serving any penal sentence in Australia in accordance with Australian and United States law. The government have developed this bill to meet this commitment. It is facilitative only. At this stage no Australian has been convicted. The bill is not specific to any person currently detained at Guantanamo Bay. It will allow for the transfer of any Australian citizen imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay who is convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment by a military commission. In addition, the bill will increase the flexibility and application of the international prisoner transfer scheme as it applies in Australia, allowing the scheme to apply to a broader range of areas. It will provide increased community benefits, and it will allow the act to apply to a greater number of Australian citizens or persons with community links to Australia who are imprisoned in foreign countries.</para><para>The amendments will also allow for a larger number of foreign nationals imprisoned in Australia to return to their home countries, thereby providing an economic benefit to Australia. It will reduce the impact on Australian families who have members imprisoned in areas to which the act does not currently apply. It will also reduce the impact on Australian citizens imprisoned overseas who may suffer due to cultural language differences they might experience. Returning such prisoners to Australia increases their chance of rehabilitation not only by enabling them to take part in prison programs and services that might not be accessible in a foreign country but also by enabling them to have more contact with their families.</para><para>I welcome the support for the passage of the bill. I do welcome the amendment to the extent that it drew our attention to the fundamental difference between the opposition and the government in relation to dealing with terrorist issues. It substantiates the view I have in these matters that the opposition wants to walk both sides of the street. It is quite clear that the opposition is far more concerned about the potential circumstances affecting those people whom it is alleged trained with al-Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Taiba and is far less concerned about the potential harm that could have been wreaked to civilian populations in Australia as a result of that training being used in this country.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83K</name.id><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>—If the shadow Attorney has further interest in these matters, she would be well served in reading the speeches of Irwin Cotler, a very distinguished Canadian lawyer, a human rights advocate of very substantial reputation and a former dean of law at McGill University in Canada, who has been a very substantial contributor to the debate on terrorism issues. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the words proposed to be omitted (<inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cox's</inline> amendment) stand part of the question.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>12:14:00</time.stamp><para>The House divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Deputy Speaker—Mr Lindsay)

I pay tribute to Senator Jan McLucas and the member for Hunter, in his capacity as shadow tourism minister, for the work that they have done in persuading the government that this issue needed to be addressed.</para></talk.start><para>Since 1993 a visitation charge has been applied to every visitor who travels to the Great Barrier Reef. This visitation charge—the environmental management charge, or EMC—is commonly referred to as the `reef tax'. It is probably fair to note that, right from the outset, tourism operators offered some strong opposition to this charge. Nevertheless, after its introduction, tourism operators agreed to collect the environmental management charge on behalf of the government. I think it was realised at the time, and after some protracted discussion, that if the government had had to collect the environmental management charge it would have had to be higher and that that was a messier arrangement organisationally. And so it was that the marine park tourism operators dutifully collected the environmental management charge and passed it on to the government.</para><para>The funds generated from the environmental management charge are remitted to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and are used for the management of the Great Barrier Reef. There is and always has been some concern that the funds raised by the environmental management charge are being used to replace rather than supplement revenue that should be provided through government appropriation. That is a bone of contention that will have to exist until we have a government willing to address the issue.</para><para>This collection and remittance process operated quite smoothly until the 1998 election, when there was quite a lot of discussion and no little confusion about whether or not the goods and services tax could or should apply to a tax already being charged by government. Simply put, the question was whether there was going to be a tax on a tax. The reef tax was used as a prime example in North Queensland. We will not forget those parading coalition candidates giving absolute assurances to the marine park tourism industry operators during the lead-up to that election that GST would not apply to the EMC—the reef tax. Those assurances turned out to be non-core promises.</para><para>The Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators wisely decided that it was unwise on their part to rely absolutely on assurances from coalition candidates. They went off to the Assistant Treasurer and sought an assurance that the GST would not be applied to the reef tax. In June 2000, the taxation adviser from the Assistant Treasurer's office wrote to the tourism operators and proclaimed:</para><quote><para>... the Government intends to include the Environment Management Charge (EMC) in the list of taxes and charges that do not constitute consideration for the purposes of the GST.</para></quote><para>This adviser went on to say:</para><quote><para>... the Treasurer has recently made a Determination that lists the taxes and other Government charges that will not be subject to the GST.</para></quote><para>Having received this response on 13 June 2000 in response to their letter of 23 February, the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators wrote in good faith to their members and said that they should not collect the GST on top of the environment management charge as the GST did not apply to it. So the members went about their business and collected the environment management charge for the government without adding the GST to the reef tax. You can imagine their surprise and horror when the tax office began auditing operators and handing down decisions that completely overruled the assurances that had been given by government candidates and members and the statement that they had received from the office of the Assistant Treasurer. Operators were handed bills by the tax office for various amounts, ranging from $15,000 in one case to potentially $60,000 in another. These were the accumulation of retrospective payments which the tax office had deemed necessary because, they said, the GST should have been applied to the EMC or reef tax.</para><para>The goalposts had shifted. The members of the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators had been left high and dry with bills to pay, which this government had assured them would not happen. Naturally, these operators contacted the government in a bid to find out what had happened to the government's assurances. During the initial lobbying process to get the government's assurances that a tax would not be charged on a tax, the member for Leichhardt wrote to the Treasurer, stating:</para><quote><para>In the run-up to the introduction of the GST the Marine Tourism Industry successfully lobbied the government to have EMC exempted from the GST. I was intimately involved in this lobbying and was personally assured by the then Assistant Treasurer that the EMC would be exempted from the GST. The basis of our argument was that it was stated government policy not to levy a tax (GST) on a tax (EMC).</para></quote><para>The tax office had ruled that the reef tax was not subject to GST when charged by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to the operator as per the Treasurer's determination. However, it was payable when the amount charged by the operator to its customer included the on-charge tax as part of the make-up of the price. What an appalling mess. What appalling confusion. The government assurances had been shown to be false.</para><para>What did the government do about it? It did nothing about it. It was only after Senator McLucas raised this issue with Senator Hill during environment estimates committee hearings last year and then followed it up with the tax office in finance estimates committee hearings that we started learning what an unreasonable situation those tourism operators were in and how the government was failing to honour its pre-election commitment that the GST would not be charged on the reef tax.</para><para>That confusion has been around since 2002. It is a very sad state of affairs when the government of the day first denies knowledge of a problem and then procrastinates and fails to take action to deal with it. It is now March 2004—over eight years since this government came to power—and the government is finally introducing the legislative change for which marine park tourist operators and the opposition have been calling for nearly two years. I suppose some people would say in relation to this that it is better late than never. Regrettably, this is just another example of a tired, lacklustre government finally responding to the very reasonable concerns of the community and the opposition after taking an excessively unreasonable amount of time to address the problem. Therefore, I move:</para><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>“whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:</para><para>(1)	its complete and utter mishandling of the application of the GST to the Environment Management Charge; and</para><para>(2)	its continued ignorance and disregard for the concerns of marine park tourist operators”.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Lindsay)</inline>—Is the amendment seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84H</name.id><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Zahra</name></talker><para>—I second the amendment.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name></talker><para>—When this issue was raised in the Senate by my colleague Senator McLucas, she asked the Assistant Treasurer to confirm that she had representations made to her on behalf of Adrenalin Dive in Townsville on 27 August and 10 September 2002, or some 10 months prior to this question, in relation to the application of GST on the reef tax. The Assistant Treasurer claimed that she was only recently advised of the problem, yet she had been advised of the problem by industry for over 10 months. The representations came as early as 27 August and 10 September 2002, yet 10 months later the minister was saying, `I've only just learned of the problem.' Indeed, it has taken until right into 2004 before we have seen any action to deal with it. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It is little wonder that the <inline font-style="italic">Cairns Post</inline> on 5 June last year was moved to say that this mess needed to be fixed up and that, given the government's commitment that GST would not be applicable, there was an easy solution: our politicians should pass the required laws before parliament rose for the winter recess and indeed postpone their annual jaunts to the north and keep parliament sitting while they amended the law. Unfortunately, the government took no notice of the <inline font-style="italic">Cairns Post</inline> and parliament did rise last year well before this legislation came to the House. We are only now seeing the legislation before the House and some effort being made to address what has been an unholy mess in relation to GST and the reef tax.</para><para>The amendment that I have moved condemns the government for `its continued ignorance and disregard for the concerns of marine park tourist operators'. Noting that, I want to draw to the attention of the House the ongoing concern of marine park tourist operators about the government's failure to adequately protect the Great Barrier Reef. A couple of weeks ago I was visited by Daniel Gschwind, who is the Chief Executive Officer of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council, in company with representatives of the Worldwide Fund for Nature. They outlined to me a report, which they have subsequently released, on the implications of climate change for Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The tourism operators were sufficiently concerned about the impacts of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef to commission this report.</para><para>The findings of the report are very revealing. They indicate that global warming is not disputed within credible scientific circles; that current estimates of global temperature change suggest that planetary temperatures are increasing at rates many times faster than those seen during the warming after the ice ages; that ocean temperatures are reaching higher and higher levels in many parts of the world; and that, during the 1990s, mass coral bleaching—when corals, which are the builders of the reef, get sick and die—increased in frequency and severity.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>FK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Kelly, De-Anne, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs De-Anne Kelly</name></talker><para>—They don't die.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name></talker><para>—In 1998, 16 per cent of all corals across the planet died. The member for Dawson really ought to know something about corals and the Great Barrier Reef, seeing that she represents an area in that part of the world. I feel an obligation to inform her that in 1998 mass coral bleaching led to the death of 16 per cent of all corals across the planet. Mass bleaching has been experienced on the Great Barrier Reef three times since the beginning of 1998, which was the worst coral bleaching event until 2002, when more corals were affected than ever before—around 60 per cent of all reefs within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Indeed, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the scientific community are concerned that we are now witnessing another potential bleaching event. I do not know whether the member for Dawson is concerned about that, but she ought to be. Queensland is reliant on the reef for sustainable tourism and fisheries, and they in turn depend on healthy coral communities. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The report asks the important question: what happens if climate change continues and coral becomes rare on the Great Barrier Reef? It explores the questions of the impact of this by projecting how the biology of the Great Barrier Reef is likely to change, and it analyses the economics of reef dependent industries in Australia and projects how these industries would go under the principal International Panel on Climate Change scenarios.</para><para>The world's oceans are heating and the measurements of this suggest that the conditions which presently apply in the Torres Strait will have moved to the bottom end of the Great Barrier Reef by 2030. Corals live close to their upper thermal maxima. That means that, if temperatures are one degree over the summer maxima for three weeks—just a one-degree increase in water temperature—that is enough to cause bleaching. Bleaching is the loss of zooxanthella. If it is severe enough, the corals will die. Mass bleaching has been increasing in severity and frequency over the past two decades. The Great Barrier Reef, having had three major events since 1998, may well be on the verge of another. The projections are that sea temperatures will rise above the known tolerances of reef-building corals and that the heat stress will rise above anything previously experienced and go beyond the quite catastrophic levels that were seen in 2002. </para><para>Reefs do have a capacity to recover, but they need enough time to recover. Experts suggest that a reasonable recovery time for reefs is of the order of 15 years. So, if the coral are killed and you then have another major mortality event within a shorter period—less than 15 years—the reef simply will not recover. According to the current estimates and projections in this report, by 2030 we are likely to have these major mortality events, the coral-bleaching events, every three years. So our current understanding of coral and the reefs that they build indicates that they simply cannot evolve at this rate; they cannot recover fast enough. Given that coral reef organisms are highly co-evolved, removal of coral will remove the majority of the biodiversity that typifies the reef that surely all of us in Australia want to protect.</para><para>Reef industry figures indicate that tourism in Queensland is highly reef focused. The report suggests that, for the Great Barrier Reef as a whole, $2.4 billion of a total expenditure of $3.4 billion was attributable to reef-interested tourism in 1999—that is 63 per cent. Indeed, visitors associate Australia with the Great Barrier Reef more than with any other Australian icon.</para><para>The WWF report sets out a very disturbing picture of the impact of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef. It tells us:</para><quote><para>Coral reefs have suffered some of the most dramatic impacts of climate change ... </para></quote><para>and that from 1979 onwards we have had worldwide coral-bleaching events as the thermal threshold of many of the world's coral populations was exceeded. The report goes on:</para><quote><para>Global cycles of coral bleaching and mortality have increased dramatically as sea temperatures have reached higher and higher values over the past 20 years. In the last five years the Great Barrier Reef ... experienced two of the worst bleaching events in its history.</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>When corals become stressed the brown algae are expelled turning the coral a brilliant white. In cases where the stress is mild, coral can recover. When stress is more intense, corals die, often across huge sectors of the world's oceans. </para></quote><para>Back in 1998, as I said before, 16 per cent of the world's coral died. According to the report:</para><quote><para>In some regions such as the Western Indian Ocean more than 48% of living coral was eliminated. The removal of these key organisms has huge implications for the ecosystems and for people who depend on these critically important coral reef resources.</para></quote><para>The report continues:</para><quote><para>Global climate change ... is not alone in causing the loss of coral reefs across the Earth. The stress to coral reefs across the world is being aggravated by ... coastal land practices, overfishing and marine based pollution.

This will affect millions of reef users and associated industries such as fisheries and tourism.</para></quote><para>If the temperatures of our seas increase—and the projections are anywhere between two degrees Celsius and six degrees Celsius in the course of this century—then thermal stress is inevitable for coral reefs like the Great Barrier Reef. According to the WWF report:</para><quote><para>... the flora and fauna of the ... reef will change dramatically as climate change gathers impetus ...

This will have further implications for the tourist industry as more degradation occurs, for commercial fisheries through changing fish community structure and abundance, and other activities such as recreational fishing, indigenous hunting and fishing, and coastal protection.</para></quote><para>In Queensland international and domestic tourism has been the major reef based industry, the sector that has been the main driver of regional growth. The report states:</para><quote><para>It is strongly oriented towards the Tropical North with smaller nodes elsewhere, especially the Whitsundays north of Mackay. Tropical North Queensland has experienced the strongest economic growth of about 6% per annum, driven by the growth in international tourism.</para><para>The WWF Australia and Queensland Tourism Industry Council ... developed a ... measure of the importance of `reef-interested' tourism for the five regions.</para></quote><para>It concluded:</para><quote><para>In terms of contribution to the regional economies, $AUD1.4 billion of a total $AUD2.1 billion represents the estimated reef-interested component (68%) ...</para></quote><para>On that basis, it was highest in Far North Queensland both `absolutely and relative to total tourism in the region'. I would acknowledge that the tourism industry has a well-known resilience and adaptability; nevertheless, it is clearly vulnerable to the deterioration of coral reefs.</para><para>What do we need to do about this? The Howard government is being absolutely deficient in sitting on its hands in relation to the climate change issues. If we understand that the most likely outlook for the Great Barrier Reef over coming decades is more frequent mass coral bleaching due to increased sea surface temperatures, what we can do is try to minimise the damage from these events. The report suggests we need to keep the global temperature rise due to human activities to no more than two degrees. The WWF are concerned that if global temperatures increase over the course of the next few decades by more than two degrees that will have catastrophic impacts on the reef. In order to do this, the report proposes that developed countries, like Australia, need to reduce their emissions by 80 per cent, based on 1990 levels, by the year 2050. Indeed, by 2100 they suggest we need to use technology to get our emissions profile down to close to zero. To achieve these kinds of major reductions we need to get to work. The report says, and I agree absolutely:</para><quote><para>The Kyoto Protocol should enter into force as soon as possible, with Australian ratification.</para></quote><para>It also says:</para><quote><para>The Australian Government should actively engage in discussion on how to achieve deeper cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.</para></quote><para>The report also proposes that the Australian government promote clean energy technologies that help to reduce national greenhouse gas levels, suggesting:</para><quote><para>... a national target for the uptake of co-generation of large industrial would provide an incentive for some of the biggest users of coal-fired electricity to install gas fired generators on site.</para></quote><para>The report concludes by saying:</para><quote><para>Even if global warming is constrained to 2-2.5C, coral reefs are likely to experience widespread and serious damage. To minimise the extent of damage to the Great Barrier Reef, local efforts to increase the ecological resilience of the Reef are vital.</para></quote><para>The report talks about the importance of a comprehensive network of no-take zones, getting serious about implementing the water quality protection plan for the reef and the ending of broad scale clearing of remnant native vegetation. They are a range of measures, all of which will help to protect the resilience of the reef and enable us to get the best possible outcomes, given the prospect that we already face: increasing sea water temperatures.</para><para>I regret the fact that this government has been sitting on its hands in relation to the climate change issues. The climate change issues, as this report makes clear, will severely impact on the Great Barrier Reef. They are already impacting on the Great Barrier Reef by way of coral bleaching events. In so doing, they jeopardise the tourism industry—particularly the tourism industry in North Queensland, which is such a source of economic prosperity to that region. They jeopardise what is one of the world's natural wonders. It would be absolutely outrageous if on our watch, knowing what we know and with the evidence we have about the impact of warmer water temperatures on coral bleaching, we did not take action to reduce this impact and we saw our coral reefs suffer and die in the way that other coral reefs around the world have been suffering and dying due to their inability to cope with a range of human actions and the impact that those actions have.</para><para>I have moved an amendment to the bill. I hope that the Howard government will take these issues into consideration rather more seriously than they have been doing over the past few years and that they will take the necessary actions to protect the Great Barrier Reef on behalf of the rest of the world, on behalf of future generations and on behalf of the people of North Queensland and the people who depend on that tourism industry.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>25749</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise in support of the <inline ref="R1981">Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill 2004</inline> today because it is a sensible, timely and appropriate response to an unexpected interpretation of some tax law. You would be forgiven for thinking otherwise after listening to the previous speaker, the member for Wills and the environment spokesman from the Labor Party. He, I might add, has an unenviable task. He is so uninterested in the environment that a humble backbencher such as me has actually inquired to a greater degree of the government about environmental issues than he has.</para></talk.start><para>I am not quite sure why there is this constant harping and whining around the government's environment agenda when the Howard government is the greenest government this nation has ever seen. It has done more to protect, enhance and nurture the health of our natural systems than any government the nation has ever seen. All that the Labor Party can say when good measures are introduced is, `That's a good start but you just haven't done enough,' without actually filling the void of what the Labor Party, if it were in government, would actually do. You have heard today another example from the member for Wills of how empty, insular and totally unconstructive the Labor Party is when it comes to the environment.</para><para>The bill today is actually remedying an interpretation by the Taxation Office of how the charge on visitors to the Great Barrier Reef would be treated and where the tax liability lies. That is what this about. The member for Wills leaves the chamber. Hopefully, he will get to read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and correct many of the statements that he made. The whole point of this bill is to amend the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act to ensure that, in relation to the environment management charge—a charge on operators, visitors and people with a right of entry to the Great Barrier Reef to enjoy the marvellous piece of creation that it is—people make a contribution of up to $4.50 per visitor. The bill actually follows some discussions that commenced in 2002 and is not, as the member for Wills would characterise it, some eleventh hour change that people knew about but that the government failed to act on. The conversations began back in 2002, when the tax office was advising some tourist operators in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Kelvin Thomson</name></talker><para>—So it has taken you two years!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name></talker><para>—I welcome the interjection—in a moment of passion and enthusiasm about the environment—from the member for Wills.

Thank you for that interjection, member for Wills. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Back in 2002, the tax office advised a number of tourism operators that, on its interpretation of the tax law, there is a requirement to pay GST on revenue received from ticket sales. In effect, the tour operators' task of collecting this tourism charge from visitors to the reef—the tour operators were acting as a collection agency and then passing those funds over to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority—was interpreted by the tax office as something that incurred a GST liability. As the member for Wills alluded to—probably mistakenly—that was not the intention of the charge, and the tax office's interpretation of the law was not exactly as it was understood to be by the government; and so a number of conversations commenced.</para><para>There was a recognition at the point when the tax office was in touch with tourism operators on the reef that the environmental management charge should be treated as part of the revenue stream to the operators, when the charge was designed to simply be collected by the operators as a cash till, effectively, and would then be passed over to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and so it did not matter too much whether the EMC was embedded in the tour operator's charges or identified separately. As I said, that was not the understanding and the interpretation that the government had developed on this subject, and therefore some remedies were required.</para><para>A meeting was held between the ATO and the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators in the middle of 2003. There were further discussions with the tax office. The tax office put its interpretation about how the GST would be applied to reef tourism services, and a fact sheet sought to amend any confusion and to address any misunderstandings that the operators may have had. The fact sheet said that, for future business activity statements, the tax office interpretation would apply. Quite responsibly, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Helen Coonan, put forward a proposal to bring the tax office interpretation into line with the policy goal. The law is not an end in itself. The law seeks to implement certain policy goals and choices that the government determines. In this case, the law as the tax office read it did not marry up with the policy goals. So, quite appropriately, after having the consultation and after the tax office had spent some time with the marine park tourism operators, the tax office said, `This is our reading of the law; here is how we think it should be,' and the Minister for Revenue, the local members and all those who are working on the policy and the purpose of this charge said, `That is not what was intended.' </para><para>The bill today simply brings the law into line with the policy. It was the government's understanding that the law already married up with the policy. Upon advice from the tax office, it did not. So what is the great mystery here? You would think, listening to the member for Wills, that there had been some incredible transformation in thinking and logic and some elements of inconsistency. No, there have not been. The tax office and the commissioner, acting independently—as is his brief—read the law a particular way and it did not marry up with the policy goals. So this bill is to remedy that and make sure that there is no confusion. In effect, it mirrors the air passenger levy that applies in the aviation industry, so the environmental management charge will operate in the same way as the air passenger levy—where the charge is on the tourist, not on the operator.</para><para>In October last year, the Hon. Warren Entsch, who is well known in the reef community and in Far North Queensland for his great passion for the wellbeing of the reef and its tour operators, announced that there would be some amending legislation introduced; and that is what we are talking about today. So there is no great mystery. It is simply re-emphasising, through the black-letter law, that the policy goal of the government is to have the tour operators act as a collection agent, and that is all; not to have the operators treat the charge as an expense that then needs to be carried through BAS and the like and to have the GST apply. That is what this bill seeks to do, and it is a perfectly responsible and reasonable step to take where there is some interpretation by the tax office that is inconsistent with the government's policies. That is what this bill is about. It is not that complicated. It is very straightforward, and I am surprised that the member for Wills would seek to represent it as something it is not. It is simply ensuring that the black-letter law marries up with what the policy goals have always been, and have always been said to be, and making sure that the detail in the tax laws marries up with that goal.</para><para>The reef is a remarkable place. It is an extraordinary place, and it needs the support, the protection and the resources that the environmental management charge brings to it to make sure that the natural systems of the reef remain healthy, viable and sustainable for the longer term. There is nothing worse, if you are a diver or a snorkeller, than to be sucking air through a pipe, hoping to see some fish, and there are not any. The point of the health of the reef as a virtuous environmental goal in its own right is strengthened and buttressed by the economic benefit that the reef brings to that part of our country. The reef is not only an international icon but also a crucial driver of economic activity, employment and living standards in the reef communities that adjoin this magnificent piece of our country. It is one of the world's greatest natural wonders.</para><para>We are the custodians of nearly 350,000 square kilometres of reef. The reef is the world's largest World Heritage area and the world's largest protected marine area. The reef itself is actually substantially larger than Ireland, Austria, Holland, Switzerland and Denmark put together. It is huge. In fact, it is the largest structure ever created by living organisms. It is remarkable. The reef has an 80,000-year history. It has been a breeding area for many rare and endangered species, and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park comprises about 99.25 per cent of the World Heritage area. The reef is home to 1,500 species of fish, 400 species of sponge, 4,000 species of mollusc, 500 species of seaweed, 215 species of bird, six species of sea turtle. It needs to be protected and managed with great care. That is why measures such as the environment management charge are making sure that the reef does not suffer from its own popularity, so that those visiting the reef are contributing to its ongoing care and management.</para><para>This bill seeks to make sure that that is done in such a way that it marries with the government's policy objectives. The member for Wills tried to suggest that the government is not doing all that needs to be done to look after the reef—what a remarkable statement. That is the sort of thing that frustrates me in public life: that the member for Wills, a decent person, would make such a reckless and inaccurate statement. Since 1996 the Howard government has done more than any other government to protect, preserve and enhance the sustainability of the reef—and, therefore, to underpin the vast economic activity that depends upon it. Nearly $150 million has been spent since 1997 protecting the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage area.</para><para>Since 1996, work has been carried out to improve the water quality of the reef itself, and a protection plan has been prepared, ensuring that there is robustness in the ecosystems of the Great Barrier Reef. There has been work going on in the Great Barrier Reef Coastal Wetlands Protection Program, which has received another $16 million. A further $15 million has been provided through the Natural Heritage Trust to look at Queensland's wetlands, including the wetlands of the Great Barrier Reef. Work has gone into targeting end-of-river pollution loads from the 26 river catchments that are adjacent to the reef—looking at what is happening on the land adjoining the reef area to see what activities are contributing silt, pollutants and other potentially unhelpful additions to the riparian environments of those catchments that may pose a threat to the reef; in other words, looking up the catchment, recognising that the reef, magnificent as it is, is part of a broader natural system and not an isolated piece of the environment. Work has gone into providing better control of the pollution caused by waste from land-based aquaculture and from other production activities. Work has gone into identifying crucial habitats. The prohibition on mining has been extended.</para><para>It cannot go without remark that at the stage-managed event called the ALP national conference the environment got very little attention. What it did attract were some statements relating to the new Labor Party environmental platform. What a great platform! There is nothing quite like undertaking to do something that is already happening. The Great Barrier Reef got a mention in the Labor Party's platform in terms of the need to protect the reef from mining and from oil exploration. That is an odd thing to commit to, given that that protection is already there. It is a pointless, flawed, redundant and superfluous statement from the Labor Party. It makes them look like they are interested in the environment. They are trying to develop some credentials through the Great Barrier Reef by promising to put in place something that is actually already in place. The 1995 Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act explicitly bans mining and mineral exploration in the park. What a novel commitment to make. Are they simply saying that they are not going to repeal the protection that is already in place? That is a pointless statement. It is hyperbole at its best, trying to develop some undeserved environmental credentials.</para><para>There was a second and equally obvious error. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act actually protects the park from activities, whether they be related to mining or exploration, outside the park to the limit of Australia's exclusive economic zone. So, if things are being proposed that may cause detriment to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, there are tools already in place through the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. So what are the Labor Party going on about? It is hard to work out what that part of the ALP's environment platform is aiming to achieve, because those outcomes are already locked in, secure and in place. It seems to infer, as the member for Wills did, that something is not quite right. By making the claim and hoping that nobody is aware of what is actually in place, they can put forward this falsity that there is some risk to the reef. That is blatantly incorrect, particularly with regard to those two points that managed to get mentioned in the Labor Party's platform.</para><para>But look further. A policy decision for the generations is the way I would characterise Minister Kemp's announcement that 331/3 per cent of the reef will be protected in green zones. What is the point of that? The point is that to sustain their species and their health those ecosystems in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area need to be protected from intrusion and damage. There is clearly a benefit there for tourism operators, to go back to my earlier point. Sucking air through a pipe and paying cash for it is not the visitor experience we are looking for. Having people enjoy the experience they have when they visit the Great Barrier Reef and see the great marvel that that living organism represents is worth paying for, and it is an important value for tourism up in the Great Barrier Reef area—but also for the commercial fishing industry.</para><para>The research is broad and it all consistently says the same thing: that where there are these no take green protected areas the fish stocks actually prosper. A worldwide phenomenon is `fishing the line'—that is the jargon for the situation where commercial fishing operators with their GPS systems go and park themselves right on the very edge of these green protected areas. Why? That is where the best fish are: that is where the largest stocks are and it is where the healthiest, largest and most substantial fish are. So increases in volume and in size are achieved through these measures that Minister Kemp has introduced, and that is not only good for the health of the reef—and that is a virtuous outcome in its own right—but also underwrites the value of the tourism industry in the area. It supports the activities of the tour operators and provides some assistance for people in the commercial fishing industry.</para><para>I have already mentioned the prohibition on mining, but 28 new coastal areas have also been established in the marine park, ship safety has improved and there has been a 300 per cent increase in the detection of illegal fishing—that matters, because there is no point in having these green zones and not enforcing them. All these things have been achieved under the Howard government's watch. Another important achievement has been the understanding that dugongs are important there and the consequent effort to balance traditional Indigenous hunting practices with the conservation of dugongs and turtles. As well, the Whitsundays' bareboat industry has been accredited. There have been reef protection programs and there are now 86 public moorings and 43 reef protection marker buoys installed in the Whitsundays, supporting in a sustainable way the activities of those commercial providers. In the revised zoning plan there has been a sixfold increase in the amount of protected areas, and that was done with wide consultation and was done cooperatively. There were 31,000 submissions received, and everybody who had a view—and then some—had a chance to influence that process. The outcome is outstanding.</para><para>When we come to the issue of bleaching, the work being done by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, with the encouragement and support of the Howard government, is developing international understanding of how bleaching events occur and what is needed to enable those reef areas to recover. The resilience of the reef goes hand in hand with a rapid recovery after a bleaching event, so all the things I have mentioned previously underline and reinforce the resilience of the reef ecosystem and enable it to bounce back after these coral bleaching events—coral bleaching events that have been with us for centuries.</para><para>There is a bleaching response program to guide management actions to make sure that early interventions after a bleaching event best support the recovery of the reef. Other management tools are being developed in conjunction with the US Coral Reef Task Force. GBRMPA also runs the BleachWatch program. These are all world class initiatives that are leading the way in showing others around the world how to manage reefs after a coral bleaching event without substantial loss to those coral reef ecosystems—and in the face of future global warming.</para><para>That brings me to the issue of global warming. The Labor Party is very quick to say, `Sign Kyoto,' yet the shadow minister gave up the ghost today. He referred to a report suggesting that there needed to be an 80 per cent reduction in the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. That is what the shadow minister in his report said was needed to redress climate change. Climate change is like a big doona around our globe. CO2 and other greenhouse gases are adding to the thickness of the doona and that is adding to the climate change which anthropogenic activity—man-introduced activity—is creating. There is no dispute about that. What is also clear, though, is that the doona will not thin overnight and that there is a need for about a 50 per cent reduction in current greenhouse gas emissions at a global level to bring about any discernible change in the climate. The Kyoto protocol, fully signed and fully implemented, will create an outcome of a reduction of less than half of one per cent in greenhouse gas emissions. It shows their nonsense, and it is time the opposition minister fessed up to what is really on the Labor agenda. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>25754</page.no><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name><name.id>HK6</name.id><electorate>Herbert</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The member for Dunkley articulated quite well the reasons for the <inline ref="R1981">Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill 2004</inline> in the parliament today and the orderly process that it has gone through and he exposed very effectively the flaws in the argument of the member for Wills. This legislation simply settles the GST issue on the environmental management charge. It puts it beyond doubt, once and for all, and implements the government's policy as articulated when the EMC was first introduced.</para></talk.start><para>I pay tribute to the member for the northern part of the reef, the Hon. Warren Entsch, the member for Leichhardt, who has done a great job in guiding this matter through the government. As the member for Herbert, which is based on Townsville, the Barrier Reef is very important to me, as it is to the member for Leichhardt, although I do have to say that sometimes I think that the reef off Cairns is perhaps a little better than the reef off Townsville—but I am not certain about that.</para><para>What does this bill actually achieve? It brings certainty for the operators, which is what is important. It brings certainty for the tax office as well. In bringing certainty for the operators, it allows them to levy the EMC separately on their customers, if they like—and it will not be subject to GST—or to include it in the overall charge to their customers for whatever the tourism experience might be. It is their choice. The bill also allows for guidance on procedures where an operator does not do the right thing—where the operator does not collect the GST—and there are procedural matters. The bill puts that beyond doubt as well.</para><para>I note that the EMC at about $4.50 is a charge that is much lower than the charges made on the terrestrial national parks. Terrestrial national park charges these days seem to range from, say, $7.50 a visit up to $19. So the EMC in the Great Barrier Reef is certainly very much value for money, but the dollars from it are well used and well spent by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, making sure that the health of the reef and the experience that users have are second to none. I also observe that AMPTO, the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators, are very happy with the outcome. The government worked with that group and the member for Leichhardt worked with that group and we have an outcome today which everyone is certainly happy with.</para><para>I want to pay tribute to those at the marine park authority and particularly to the board, first of all. It is a small board of four people, headed by Virginia Chadwick. It also includes Dr Leo Keliher, Ms Fay Barker and Ms Evelyn Scott. They are very fine Queenslanders and they have done a marvellous job in guiding the authority through many of the difficult issues that it has faced over the last decade. I would also like to pay tribute to the staff. They are of course led by Virginia Chadwick, but I would particularly like to pay tribute to John Tanzer and John Day, who have done the day-to-day hard work, led their teams and produced some fantastic outcomes under trying circumstances. It is a great organisation. Heading all of that is their minister, Dr David Kemp. David is Minister for the Environment and Heritage. I think he will certainly go down on the public record as being as good an environment minister as we have seen. David is a very thoughtful minister. He concentrates on policy and on outcomes for Australia and does the right thing by the environment.</para><para>There is no doubt that you wonder where the Australian Greens are on these sorts of issues. You wonder where the Australian Greens are in relation to the Howard government, which would normally be their sworn enemy, yet the Howard government, as the member for Dunkley quite rightly said, has done more to protect the environment and the Great Barrier Reef than any other government in the nation's history. The environmental credentials of the Howard government are second to none. They are second to none through the leadership initially of Senator Robert Hill and then, of course, of Dr David Kemp, and that is ongoing. I ask the Australian Greens to recognise, grudgingly perhaps, that the work that the government has done has been outstanding for the environment in this country.</para><para>The Natural Heritage Trust, which came up earlier in this government's mandate, has been very widely received across Australia, and it has been very effective across Australia. Just in the Great Barrier Reef region, we now have the very effective operation of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and we have a great outcome from the Representative Areas Program, with more than a third of the marine park now protected in green zones. In addition, the member for Dunkley correctly referred to the World Heritage area in the marine park and the work that has been done there. Of course, it is not only the marine park; it is Magnetic Island off Townsville, in the federal seat of Herbert, which I represent: Magnetic Island is World Heritage listed as well. In a week or so, we will be recognising that at a ceremony in Townsville.</para><para>All of these outcomes combine to make sure that one of the wonders of the world is appropriately protected. It is in everybody's interest, and people like the World Wildlife Fund for Nature very much applaud the Howard government for what it has been able to do. I congratulate WWF for standing up and publicly saying that they very much appreciate and congratulate the Howard government for what it has done in relation to protecting the Great Barrier Reef. They know, as the government does, that we have to have a healthy reef system. We have to think not only about today but about the years ahead, and we have to leave the reef in a better situation than it is in today. That means some pretty tough action sometimes, but a mark of this government has been that it has been prepared to take that kind of tough action.</para><para>When the Representative Areas Program was first announced, many of the fishermen thought that the end of the world had arrived. In fact, now that they have seen what GBRMPA under the able leadership of Virginia Chadwick has been able to achieve—and under the leadership of Dr David Kemp—they have realised that they are not going to be impacted upon but the reef is going to be looked after for centuries to come. That is the outcome. The green zones were always going to be very popular with the tourism industry. They are going to be places where you can look, swim and touch, but you just cannot take. They are also going to be very popular with fishermen. As the member for Dunkley again said, these areas produce significantly increased numbers of fish and they produce larger fish, and larger fish have more babies, and more babies mean more fish. So it actually works in the interests of fishermen to have significant green zone protection.</para><para>The objective now with the Great Barrier Reef is to make sure that we repair and restore water quality. Surely the Australian Greens can see what the government is doing in that regard. The Reef Water Quality Protection Plan is very important in its monitoring and auditing processes, and that is going to continue.</para><para>In relation to climate change, coral bleaching is a very significant issue. It is a disturbing issue when it occurs, as the water temperature rises. But I make this simple point: the reef recovers more quickly if it is in a healthy condition in the first place. The reef recovers from a bleaching event more quickly if it is a healthy reef system. That is the government's and the marine park authority's objective—to have A-1 water quality in the Barrier Reef lagoon. Of course, that means that there is going to need to be help from those on the land—those who have primary production causing run-off problems, suspended solids in the water and so on. People have to care for the land so that that results in care for the Barrier Reef.</para><para>Another issue for the marine park authority is the compliance issue. There is a level of illegal activity, and the marine park authority has to manage that. There is now a much bigger green zone area that the marine park authority has to make sure is protected, but there are very good linkages between other Australian government departments these days. I have been privileged to have flown with Coastwatch, for example, to see the work they do, the facilities they have and the very good tools they have to watch the reef. GBRMPA will work with a range of other government agencies—AFFA and so on—and its own people to make sure that compliance is enforced.</para><para>As part of his contribution, the member for Wills talked about a tax on a tax. I was quite surprised to hear that, because I immediately thought of what happens with the Queensland state Labor government. If anybody is good at putting a tax on a tax, it is Labor state governments. I refer the parliament to things like the stamp duty on insurance policies, which of course has a GST element. That is obnoxious, and it is a tax on a tax. It is double dipping, and it should not be allowed to continue. It is the same—and the member for Leichhardt will agree with me on this—with the ambulance levy on electricity bills. Not only is that a tax on your electricity bill but there is GST on top of that as well—and of course that all goes to the state government. The GST, although it is collected by the Commonwealth, is returned 100 per cent to the state governments. So there is no incentive for state governments to stop this tax on a tax business because they get the tax on the tax. The state governments really need to face up to that and be fair dinkum.</para><para>I note the amendment moved by the member for Wills. I was surprised that the member for Wills claimed that he wanted to condemn the government for `its continued ignorance and disregard for the concerns of marine park tourist operators'. Goodness gracious me! How wrong could that be! The government is the first to understand that if the reef is not pristine, if it is not 110 per cent, the marine park tourist operators do not have a business. That is why we have gone to great lengths to make sure that they have been consulted and that they have understood what we have been doing through the EPBC Act, RAP and the World Heritage listing—and we will continue to do that.</para><para>Looking ahead at emerging issues for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, it currently concerns me that the marine park covers only about 25 per cent of the area between the Australian coastline and the outer boundary of Australia's economic exclusion zone. I have said previously in the parliament, and I reinforce it today, that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park has been well researched—that is, the area within the park itself—but beyond its eastern boundaries little is known and there is little protection for what happens in that area. I think it is time that Australia looked at extending the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. I know that is a brave statement to make, because it has budgetary implications. There is no point extending the park unless we adequately resource the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to manage the extra area, but I think we need to be doing that now. I think that is the next step.</para><para>I was privileged to be able to go to CSIRO in Hobart and talk with the marine scientists down there. They have a very definite view that the sea within Australia's economic exclusion zone—and few people understand that it is twice the land mass of Australia—provides many opportunities for wealth. There are many opportunities for expanding the contribution to GDP that is made by our marine resources. In the context of protecting the Great Barrier Reef, we need to look at those opportunities. It is my view that we can do that best by considering an extension to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and then properly managing and understanding those new areas that currently have no protection or understanding. That is the challenge ahead. It will be a challenge for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, but they have not resiled from challenges previously and I am sure that they will not resile from this particular challenge. I indicate my support for the clarification that this bill brings to the application of GST to the environmental management charge. In doing so, I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>25757</page.no><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TUCKEY</name><name.id>SJ4</name.id><electorate>O'Connor</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The legislation before us today, the <inline ref="R1981">Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill 2004</inline>, is quite sensible. It addresses an anomaly where a GST requirement was virtually imposed when it was not the original intention of the government to do so. This legislation makes sure that that need not occur in the future. I am interested to know whether, for the saving of 40c per transaction, many operators with a licence will take the opportunity to separate these payments out. Hopefully, they will be able to program their computers to separate the two payments they have always received but now must treat differently to the way they did in the past. It is an issue that arises on all these occasions. I think it proves the argument for a universal consumer tax with no exemptions, as exists in New Zealand. People then have a very simple rule, and the revenue is determined by the rate of the tax. That is not, of course, the ground for today's debate; that is a debate lost long ago. I think a Labour government in New Zealand got it right, but that is not the issue today.</para></talk.start><para>It is notable to me, nevertheless, that in presenting this legislation, the minister chose to speak for probably 70 per cent of the second reading speech on matters relating to the environment—a word I often have some difficulty with; I am not really sure what it is meant to mean. For some, it is just an argument to do nothing—in other words, develop your economy. I have had some ministerial responsibilities very close to things that are part of the environment, including forestry and fisheries. When it comes to fisheries I am a major supporter of the precautionary principle. Fish are much harder to count than, say, trees and one must always be careful that the resource is not being overexploited. During my period as minister for fisheries, I found myself in Northern Queensland being quite forceful with fishermen in the Gulf of Carpentaria, ensuring that they undertook further conservation measures to ensure that the resource was sustained, but always on the principle that it created future harvesting opportunities.</para><para>I had a confrontation in Tasmania relating to southern bluefin tuna and the fact that the state government thought that they were beyond an international treaty—one that I am very proud of—which we have maintained with the Japanese, in particular, and which is regenerating the southern bluefin tuna stocks and the associated resource. In all my time associated with the forestry and fisheries portfolio, I constantly made the point that the ecology and the economy must travel forward in parallel. That is a very interesting point. There would be some conflicting arguments on the Great Barrier Reef, but, in international terms, one only has to go a short distance from Australia to find that national poverty is by far the greatest threat to the environment. People who have very little money have very little respect for the issues that other people, if they live in the luxury of Europe or even Australia, think are important.</para><para>It was quite interesting having representations at that time from the chairman of the international rainforest timber association, who pointed out to me that when environmental interests—green interests, if you like—went around and stopped hardware stores around the world from selling rainforest timber, the people in those countries cut down the trees and replanted them with palm oil trees. Everyone knows, even from their own backyard, that if you saw off a tree it will regrow from the original stump—it is called coppicing. If you dig out all the trees and replant with an exotic and almost feral species—in this case, palm trees—none of the rainforest grows back. But nobody parades in front of the major fast food places—McDonald's, Hungry Jack's and the rest—and complains about their use of palm oil. They seem quite happy about that circumstance, and yet that is total destruction of the forest and it arises from an economic demand from people. They have been denied by the wealthier countries the right to properly harvest their forests, saw the wood into timber and watch the trees regrow, so they destroy them completely.</para><para>In the case of the Great Barrier Reef, the minister, in his second reading speech—and, no doubt, other speakers today—highlighted the great economic value that tourism on the Great Barrier Reef can deliver. I think the second reading speech argued the case that that is the dominant economic benefit because in dollars it is probably the biggest. I happen to have the view that, if you have a $10 billion gross industry and you chase $6 billion out of it—there is $4 billion produced—that is a loss of $6 billion worth of enterprise. We may say that that the $6 billion enterprise was having a totally negative effect on the asset that was the attraction for the tourism—this is addressing purely the economic issues—but I feel that we frequently tend to try and address conservation by drawing lines on a map. The member for Herbert complained that 25 per cent reef protection is maybe not enough. I would agree with that, but the 25 per cent is a measurement of area by the process of drawing lines on a map. I do not care if it is a forest or an ocean—that is a very silly way of doing things. You should be able to have a protective protocol which would include, from time to time, certain no-go areas, and that might include tourists—they are not exactly absolutely beneficial to a pristine environment. You might then assess other areas on whether there could be limited access for certain economic purposes.</para><para>A prawn—or a shrimp, depending on where you live—lives for only a year and its contribution to the reef ceases at that point in time. Prawns go back into tidal creeks—typically on the mainland—to breed, and their young eventually float out to other areas. To my mind, it is therefore quite practical to be allowed to enter these areas inside the line on the map and harvest—working on an appropriate bottom so that you do not start hooking up on coral. I can tell you that the average fisherman or trawler does not want to be hooked up on coral; he would have to go back and repair his nets at great expense and loss of time.</para><para>I believe there is still an opportunity for controlled harvesting. The member for Herbert, a previous speaker, said, `What a great breeding ground we're going to have for fish, which will naturally swim out and get caught in other areas of the ocean.' I do not know whether that is established scientifically. It certainly does not work for prawns, because prawns breed in the creeks, so you are not saving them or creating a breeding habitat for prawns, which are the major fishery, I understand, to have suffered significantly. I hope the member for Herbert is right in what he says. My view is that confining them to smaller areas might in fact be very damaging environmentally, or from a conservation point of view, because you increase the effort.</para><para>There is a great debate about conservation and how best to protect fish stocks. The more popular theory is that you give people a quota, which is patently quite stupid. During my period as fisheries minister, there was a case—a bit away from the reef—in Bass Strait where a trawler man rang his boss on the sat phone and said: `Have I got good news for you! I have just caught 20 tonnes of fish and I am coming into the port.' When his boss heard what kind of fish they were he said: `Chuck them over the side. Those fish are too cheap this week. I don't want to let my quota go at that price. We'll wait for another day.' Everybody knows that when you trawl fish they die, so 20 tonnes of dead fish went over the side. There is a practice called high grading, where you catch some fish and then you catch some better ones so you chuck the little ones back—again, they are dead. That is the downside of a quota system. You can have huge catches going unrecorded. </para><para>In the Gulf of Carpentaria, where the entitlement to catch prawns is traded, they trade in a net unit. In other words, you are limited in the amount of net that you can put in the water. In my electorate, people are controlled by the number of pots they can drop to catch crayfish and lobster. In fact, the fishermen themselves campaigned some years ago to have the number of pots reduced by 25 per cent. A small minority complained about that, politics prevailed and the number was reduced by only 18 per cent. From my research, 80 or 90 per cent of the fishermen wanted to give back 25 per cent with no compensation, because, they said, the technological advances in the operating of these vessels are such that they were getting too smart at harvesting the resource.</para><para>We have got too simplistic in this legislation. We have drawn lines on the map. Twenty five per cent will no doubt become 30 per cent. Please remember that coral is a living thing that actually lays eggs. Those eggs are deposited even on bleached coral structures and they will revitalise them, just as trees drop seeds on the ground ready to replace ageing trees. Of course, we now have a policy that says you save the old trees and cut down the young ones, or you leave them all untouched until they all burn down and cause extensive damage. We are not very smart at looking at these issues in a positive way and asking ourselves where some exploitation may be acceptable. Remember that even in biblical history we humans caught fish.</para><para>The reality is that there is opportunity in an integrated process to address the conservation or environmental issues at exactly the same time as the economic issues. We certainly can recognise the value of the reef's structure for the tourism industry, and it is important to make sure that in that process we do not do damage to this living thing. But I am not sure that consequently barring any activity for kilometres each side of it, which might include areas with a purely sandy bottom, is necessarily a good idea unless there is absolute evidence that there is a measurable benefit. As I said, have the boundaries but have a process where economic activity can happen where it is not obviously doing damage. At the right limit, it will not do damage to prawn stocks. What is more, it will leave some for the reef fish, which, as far as I know, breed within the confines of the reef.</para><para>Today is a great opportunity for me to express again a view that I have often expressed before. In Queensland, not far from this reef, we have an issue with land clearing. It is quite strange because most of the trees that are now cleared in Queensland were not there a hundred years ago. If the EPBC Act is to be applied literally, we should be encouraging people to knock those trees down to re-establish the original biodiversity. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, who is at the table, would know, the original biodiversity was grass and the animals, insects and everything in that region were associated with that. But that was maintained by Aboriginal burning practices and, as such, the grass always remained. We came along, fenced it off and wanted the grass to be eaten in the off-season, and the trees were established and grew. They are now defined as remnant vegetation when, in fact, they have killed all the grass.</para><para>It is just another example of people thinking incorrectly whilst trying to do the right thing. I am very much in favour of doing the right thing. I am very much in favour of the government having a substantial role in protecting the reef. I have no objection to raising a levy from the people who enjoy it to aid in that effort. But I am not in favour of arbitrary decisions that mean a certain pencil line on a map differentiates between good conservation and unnecessary conservation. I do not think it works that way. I am encouraged that people are trying to look at the mainland in terms of the discharge of fertiliser remnant et cetera. I think that is well and truly worth looking at, but I am not totally convinced that, with the rates of dilution, it is a significant problem. But let us research it and understand what is going on.</para><para>Please let us remember my opening remarks: the greatest threat to the environment is poverty. If we follow the claims of many people, the WWF get a mention. They are a great environmental group! They were endorsing a green, ethical investment in Holland—and this is well recorded—at a commission of 700 guilders per policy. The investment was to go into a tree plantation of mahogany, I think, in South or Central America, whilst they held an expert's opinion that said that the trees would not grow where they were being planted. Yet they are seen as a sort of god in these issues. For the information of the shadow minister, the book that carries all that information is called <inline font-style="italic">Green Gold</inline><inline font-style="italic">: </inline><inline font-style="italic">On Variations of Truth in Plantation Forestry</inline>. He might like to have a look at it. It even contains a diskette in the back because the author could not include in print all of his sources. I think these people have to be known for what they are when they participate in activities of that nature. We do not want to be driven by them. We can certainly listen to them, but we should have the sense to look very carefully at where we are going and make sure that we achieve acceptable environmental outcomes—but not by following a `lock it up and throw away the key' principle.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>25761</page.no><name role="metadata">Entsch, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ENTSCH</name><name.id>7K6</name.id><electorate>Leichhardt</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to contribute to this debate on the <inline ref="R1981">Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. The bill seeks to amend the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 to restructure the environmental management charge, or EMC as it is known, to remove the payment of the GST from the EMC where the tour operator passes the cost of the EMC on to the visitor in the ticket price.</para></talk.start><para>I was involved some years ago—I think in 1996 or 1997—with the marine park tourism operators in working very closely with the then Minister for the Environment, Senator Robert Hill, in raising issues in relation to the impact of the EMC on the tourism industry. At the time there was a proposal for a significant increase in the EMC, a charge that was introduced in 1993. There was a proposal that that charge be increased to $5 or $6. That had a significant impact on the operators, none of whom had any problems with contributing to the management of the reef or to the management of the impacts that they have through their various tourism operations.</para><para>However, talking about the magnitude of the cost that was proposed, and the fact that a lot of lead time is required for these operators to promote their fares through their brochures et cetera, showed that it was a cost that they could not afford to absorb. At the time, some negotiations were carried out and there was an agreement that the cost would in fact be reduced. From memory, I think it was down to about $3.50. On the reduction of that cost, an agreement was entered into whereby the operators agreed to collect the EMC on behalf of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and to pass that revenue on to them. Prior to that there had been discussions about ways in which the marine park authority were going to look at collecting it. They were talking about ticket machines at the wharf and a whole range of other initiatives, none of which were practical. The cost of the actual implementation was going to be greater than the revenue that they were anticipating. The compromise whereby the operators very responsibly agreed to collect on behalf of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority was very practical. So that was what was implemented back in 1996 or 1997. It went very well for some years.</para><para>In 2002 the Australian Taxation Office gave further consideration to this charge. They advised the tourist operators that they were going to be liable. Previously, we got written advice from the tax office confirming that there would be no GST applied to the EMC charge. This was done in 1998, when the new tax system was proposed and there was some concern about the additional cost. We got a letter from the tax office confirming the advice that there would be no GST on the EMC, given the government policy at that time. So it came as something of a surprise in 2002 when the tax office decided to make a ruling whereby the operators would in fact be liable for a GST on the EMC, the environmental management charge. The implications of that were very serious. Some of the operators were facing costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars in GST for the charges that they had been collecting on behalf of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority over the period of time since it was implemented in 1998. You can understand the concerns. Those sorts of costs would have put those businesses out of business completely and sent them broke. There was no question about that.</para><para>It was on that basis that the issue was raised initially with Senator Coonan, who is responsible for the tax office. She was very receptive to the concerns. She certainly appreciated the issues that we were raising with her. We were directed then to the current Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr Kemp, who I see has just arrived in the chamber. I have to say full marks to the minister, because he took on board the concerns that were raised by the marine park operators. We worked on it for a time. It was a challenge. We were not quite sure how we were going to do it, given the way in which the GST legislation is structured and the requirements that we had in relation to getting cooperation from all of the states—which, quite frankly, we thought was not going to be forthcoming. The opposition was playing around with this and was certainly not offering any positive contributions to finding a solution.</para><para>So we referred back to the arrangement that we had originally intended. That original intention was for the cost to be carried by the end user, the visitor. As a consequence of the tremendous cooperation from the good minister sitting here, we were able to turn that around. We now have a situation where these businesses continue to flourish and contribute in their own special way to supporting the management of this wonderful icon, the Great Barrier Reef, without being at all impaired by the additional cost of the GST. I would particularly like to acknowledge David Windsor from AMPTO, who worked very closely with me and the minister in finding solutions to this. His very positive contribution in highlighting the issues certainly gave us an opportunity to find a solution.</para><para>I noticed the member for Wills came in here earlier and took a negative, bleating attitude about his concerns for the Barrier Reef. I wonder whether he has ever been there—unless he has seen it in one of those little snow domes that you can buy in one of those Melbourne convenience stores. It was obvious from his contribution that that is probably as close as he has been to the Barrier Reef. He has absolutely no idea about issues relating to the Barrier Reef, which is disappointing given that he is the shadow minister to our very capable minister here. He obviously has very little understanding in talking to the marine park operators themselves, but he is certainly very capable of playing the political side of things without offering any contribution at all.</para><para>Our achievements in the time that we have been in government in the protection of this magnificent icon through the improvement of the reef water quality protection plan, the Great Barrier Reef Coastal Wetlands Protection plan—which, again, looks after the water—the end of river pollution targets that have been set for all the 26 river catchments that flow onto the reef and the prohibition of mining are impressive. There is a whole range of positive things that we have done to contribute to this issue. I think it is very much a credit to the current minister. There is the new Representative Areas Program in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, where we have extended the no-take area within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park from 4.7 per cent, which is what it was prior to us coming into government, to over 33.3 per cent. A third of the entire area is now protected as a no-take zone. It shows that we do have a serious commitment to taking care of the reef.</para><para>The unsung heroes in the protection of the reef, in my view, are those tourism operators that over the years have contributed huge amounts of their own resources to the protection of the areas of their interest. A good example of that is the partnership that they enjoy with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in facing the crown-of-thorns menace. These operators use their own resources, their own staff and their own cash to get out there and remove huge numbers of these crown-of-thorns starfish from these areas. The biodiversity of the areas that are being protected by these operators is quite often much greater and better than that of the areas outside those zones of protection. Admittedly, the operators do focus on those areas, but they also see it as a commitment. The operators are true environmentalists. They see it as an area that they—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Entsch, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ENTSCH</name></talker><para>—Quite frankly, in most instances I have to say that they have been quite mute. They tend to talk in very broad terms, but when it actually comes down to on-the-ground support and practical work being done in these areas a lot tends to be left lacking. Nevertheless, we have some outstanding operators in our region—Quicksilver, Dive Down Under, Sun Lovers and a lot of smaller operators—all of whom contribute very significantly to the management of the reef. I think it is important—and we are starting to see it more and more now—that we accept that we, as a government or as a government bureaucracy, cannot do these things alone. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority cannot manage the area on its own. It needs the cooperation and support of those operators and the general public. It is great to see a culture starting to develop within that bureaucracy of including more and more of our operators in the management of those areas. If we continue to do that, we will ensure that over time there is an even greater improvement in the overall management of those areas.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We also have to acknowledge that the Barrier Reef is an area where, apart from the tourists, other commercial and recreational activities, such as fishing, take place. When we debate issues like this we need to talk about ecologically sustainable activities and to focus on making sure that these activities are sustainable. If they are, I think it is important for the economies of those regions that they be allowed to continue. In talking about the ecological sustainability of these resources, the people who access these areas contribute very significantly to their overall management because they protect the integrity of those areas to ensure their livelihoods can be continued. I congratulate the minister again for a magnificent job in listening to the concerns of marine park operators. I think we have achieved an excellent outcome.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

She visited Baghdad with me in May last year and has had an ongoing interest in, particularly, the human rights and humanitarian situation in Iraq, both before and since the war. In response to the atrocities that have been committed by terrorists in both Iraq and Pakistan, the government has one message: terrorists will not be allowed to win. We condemn the vicious attacks against Shiite worshippers on the holiest day in the Shiah calendar, attacks which occurred in both Iraq and Pakistan. Let me take this opportunity to extend our condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims. At this stage it is unclear who the perpetrators of these attacks were, but one thing is certain: these terrorists are as much an enemy of moderate Islam and Muslims as they are an enemy of the West and Western countries. It is very important that people understand that. Here is almost certainly another example of Islamic fundamentalist terrorists attacking Muslims on one of their holiest, most sacred days.</para></talk.start><para>The people and leaders of Iraq and Pakistan are going to have our full support in the efforts they make to wage war against terrorists. I met with General Musharraf, the President of Pakistan, in January in Davos, and I took the opportunity to reiterate the Australian government's view that we hope that he will continue to do all he can against terrorist organisations, particularly those operating along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. He told me at the time that Pakistan would be doing more to address that problem than had been the case, and he has been true to his word. The Iraqi foreign minister in January told me—and I think this is an important point for people to understand—that the ordinary Iraqi people were increasingly angered by foreign terrorist activities in Iraq. What has happened in Iraq over the last day will only consolidate the view of the Iraqi people that these terrorists have to be defeated. It is only appropriate that a country like Australia should join with our allies and our friends in fighting terrorism wherever we can and wherever it occurs, including in both Iraq and Pakistan.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>25765</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>25765</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It gives me particular pleasure to inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Rt Hon.

The first answer is that $36 billion would pay for a lot of reading aloud. The second answer is that the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition proceeds upon the erroneous basis that there are, in fact, no programs already in place addressing the challenges of early childhood. Almost four years ago I announced, along with the then Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Newman, a program of several hundred million dollars which was designed to strengthen families and communities—phrases that I know the Leader of the Opposition would want to identify himself with. Many of those programs involved the challenges of early childhood. They also involved the provision of additional support in areas where traditional methods of child care were not readily available, such as isolated regional and remote communities—areas of Australia that are persistently ignored and rejected by the Australian Labor Party.</para></talk.start><para>The Leader of the Opposition asked me about the office of information technology. Perhaps that is not the correct name but I think we are talking about the same thing. I would have thought that support for that branch of the Australian economy, which is one of the fastest growing, is of enormous long-term benefit. In the circumstances, I would have thought that criticism made by the Leader of the Opposition in relation to something that is very relevant to the long-term growth and strength of the Australian economy is something that ought to be supported rather than opposed.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Treasury: National Accounts</title><page.no>25766</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>25766</page.no><name role="metadata">Farmer, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FARMER</name><name.id>00AMO</name.id><electorate>Macarthur</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Treasurer.

In addition to that, the economy grew on an annualised basis through the year at four per cent which puts us again at the top of the table of the developed economies of the world as one of the fastest and strongest growing economies. Particularly pleasing was the fact that farm production rose 13.3 per cent in December, building on a 14 per cent increase in September. That is coming off a 100-year bad drought, so we are coming off a low base. It is particularly pleasing to see agricultural production rebuilding and it is being led by grain. The restocking of herds will take some time.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Household consumption was strong, reflecting recovery in tourism and the Rugby World Cup tourism effects in Australia during the quarter. Particularly pleasing was private investment, which grew strongly, and new engineering construction, which has increased over the year by 22½ per cent in Australia. I will give the House a list of some of the engineering projects which are leading big business investment in this country: the Bayu-Undan gasfield in the Northern Territory; the expansion of the North West Shelf LNG project—fourth train—$1.6 billion; the Western Sydney Orbital, $1.5 billion, linking Liverpool and Newcastle; the Gladstone Alumina Refinery, an investment of $1.5 billion; in Victoria the Queen Victoria redevelopment and the Spencer Street Station redevelopment; and in South Australia the Olympic Dam project. I know that the member for Solomon would want me to remind the House about the completion of the Alice Springs to Darwin rail line—one of the major new engineering projects that we have seen in Australia.</para><para>The other pleasing part of the national accounts is that profits were strong in the quarter. The profit share of total income in Australia, at 25.6 per cent, is the highest profit share ever recorded in Australian history. Business has never been more profitable than it was in the December quarter of 2003 as a share of a growing economy. This is not some accident. After eight years of economic management—we saw Asia go into a financial and economic crisis, we saw the United States, France and Germany go through a recession and Japan go through two recessions, we saw SARS, we had war in Iraq and we had the worst drought in 100 years—the Australian economy continued to grow because there was a purpose and a discipline to economic management.

We would have led faster if the Labor Party had supported decent reform.

We delivered surpluses of $1.2 billion in 1997, $4.3 billion in 1998, $13 billion in 1999, $5.97 billion in 2001 and $7.5 billion in 2002-03. The reality is that, when it comes to spending sprees, Labor governments leave everybody in their wake. When they have an opportunity to actually do something, they outspend the biggest spenders of all time. They also leave to future generations enormous budget deficits.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I warn the member for Braddon!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name></talker><para>—All the expenditure that this government has presided over has been directed towards strengthening the national security and defence of this country.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Crean</name></talker><para>—Where are the savings?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name></talker><para>—I wonder if the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Hotham think it was a bad thing to spend more money on national security.

This government believes that it is incumbent upon it to take appropriate steps to protect the Australian community. As I have said before—and particularly in the statement that I made in the week before last—Australians have a fundamental human right to live in safety and security, and governments have a fundamental obligation to provide that safety net for the Australian community as a whole. People should be able to live without fear of terrorist groups operating with impunity within our borders. We have always acted quickly and decisively to deal with these issues, and we believe that governments should always have the powers to do just that—for instance, to quickly and decisively list terrorist organisations that pose a threat to our national security. We need appropriate safety mechanisms that do not leave us reliant on other bodies such as the United Nations, or perhaps a court or a tribunal, to determine that it is appropriate for the government to make a decision in relation to those matters.</para></talk.start><para>I am pleased to say the opposition has indicated that it will now be supporting amendments to the terrorist crimes legislation that is before the Senate at this time. That will effectively allow for the proscription of a terrorist organisation by the government without necessarily having to have a notification by the United Nations and without the precondition that a court or tribunal consent to it before the government can act. I thank the opposition for the indication of its agreement in relation to that matter. But I might say that I am disappointed that it has taken some two years and a lot of negotiation to reach this point—because to get to a point where we have reasonable powers that enable the government to act quickly on this matter without having to recall this parliament and the Senate to pass a bill specifically case by case is only sensible. </para><para>We know that Labor initially would only support a listing if the United Nations Security Council had agreed to that listing. We know from the past that the United Nations lists many organisations but not all terrorist organisations—and there are reasons for that.

Then it was suggested that we should have the AAT do it; and then it was suggested that we should have the AAT provide an advisory opinion.

They were contained in a budget two years ago. The reality is that, over the last eight years, the only savings in difficult areas that this government have been able to achieve have been achieved with the support of Independents and minor parties. We have received no help from the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party left us with the irresponsible double: they left us with $96 billion of debt and they tried to block every single attempt of the government to repay that debt. Not only did the Australian Labor Party leave the country in debt; after we set about with a mandate from the Australian people to do something about it, that party have at no stage—firstly under the leadership of the member for Brand, then under the leadership of the member for Hotham and now under the leadership of the member for Werriwa—joined in trying to bring about sensible savings in the budget.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We put up an eminently reasonable proposal two years ago.

But as new drugs become available and inevitably health care, as a consequence, becomes more expensive, unless the reforms that were contained in the budget two years ago are enacted, that scheme will become increasingly unaffordable. </para><para>You have a simple case.

Honourable members may be interested to know that the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, announced last week that the British government was negotiating the establishment of some kind of offshore processing facility in Tanzania. This of course is not an identical situation with the offshore processing centre that we have in Nauru, but it is an endeavour by the Blair government to try to deal with the situation where, in particular, Somalis or people posing as Somalis may try to seek asylum in the United Kingdom. They can instead be processed in Tanzania so the problem does not become unsolvable. I understand from media reports that negotiations with South Africa for a similar sort of facility may be under way.</para></talk.start><para>The point I am making here is that the Blair government is an example of a government that has taken a tough approach to illegal immigration and people-smuggling, for good reason. I do not think anybody in Britain or too many people in Australia think that people-smuggling is to be encouraged. It has to be stopped. The British Home Secretary, Mr Blunkett, announced last week that tighter border controls, tough new legislative measures and enforced removals had halved the number of illegal arrivals entering Britain. The Blair government is about to pass tougher legislation preventing illegal arrivals from tying up the court system. I am sure our AttorneyGeneral would be pleased to hear about that. The court system in the UK has been tied up, as has been the case here, with appeal after appeal, and of course that is not an acceptable longterm solution.</para><para>I was interested to hear, though, that within days of Prime Minister Blair making his announcements on strengthening the approach to dealing with illegal immigration the Australian Labor Party spokesperson for immigration—and this was in a doorstop on 19 February—was calling the deterrent effect of offshore processing a `complete nonsense' and saying that the Pacific solution has to go. This is quite an interesting point. The Labor Party pay lip-service to the evils of people-smuggling, but they refuse to support the government's tough measures to stamp out the people-smuggling trade. Labor oppose offshore processing, they oppose excision and they oppose, interestingly, the most effective policy of all—turning boats back. Labor would have actually allowed the <inline font-style="italic">Minasa Bone</inline> to land, letting the people smugglers deliver their cargo, letting 14 Turkish nationals—none of whom, as it turned out, were refugees—come to Australia and clog up our courts even more. All 14 people have, under this government's policy, been returned to Turkey. That is where they are—in Turkey where they belong.</para><para>The simple fact is that deterrence has been shown to work. I have said this before: the Labor Party say that the way to fix this problem is to close down the offshore processing centres and to get rid of the excision policy to allow the boats to land. And what else are they going to do? They are going to set up a coastguard. But they never actually tell you what the coastguard is supposed to do. After the coastguard goes out there and meets a boat that is coming to Australia, what is it going to do? It is going to guide the boat into Australia, because that is the Labor policy. In other words, the coastguard is a coast guide. That is its job. All I can say is that the Labor Party in Australia have none of the courage or commonsense of New Labour in the United Kingdom. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Howard Government: Expenditure</title><page.no>25771</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>25771</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Fraser</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

They are professors emeriti when it comes to budget ill-discipline. They left us with that enormous debt. They ran deficit after deficit, they misled the Australian public through the entirety of the 1993 election campaign, and they then sought to retrieve their budget position by massive increases in indirect tax.

The latest farm financial performance figures have just been released by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Research Economics at the outlook conference now underway in Canberra. This year 42 per cent of farms will register a business loss, and average farm business profit will be a bare $12,600. In fact, off farm income for the average farm family will be about double the business profit from the farm, given that, surprisingly and interestingly, the average Australian farm now generates around $25,000 a year in off farm income. That is often extraordinarily important to those farm families.</para></talk.start><para>Interestingly, the rate of return to capital on the average farm in Australia will be negative for some sectors, but the average across all farms will be just 1.8 per cent. And that is in a recovery year. This, of course, reflects the historically low rates of return on capital that farmers face. Indeed, even in 2001-02, which was a good year, return to capital in the farm sector only reached 3.7 per cent, which is about as good as it gets. Last year in the drought year, return to capital was negative.</para><para>In this context, I am asked about a national policy response. It is, of course, very important in those circumstances that you have a government that is in control of the economic levers, that keeps interest rates as low as possible and that ensures that the trade unions are not able to reintroduce inefficiencies on the waterfront, in the transport chain and in all of those service industries that are so important to agriculture. It is very important too that the Commonwealth continue to take a strong lead on the security of title that farmers enjoy. Their titles are being hollowed out by state governments that are continually exercising actions that introduce unacceptable sovereign risk to bankers and undermine the investment security that they are able to enjoy.</para><para>Yesterday I was able to tell the House that the ethanol industry had found a new friend. Today I can tell the House that farmers have found a new friend: it is the Leader of the Opposition. I am indebted to the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Daily Leader</inline>, that erstwhile journal from Tamworth, which tells us that the Leader of the Opposition has been out there and visited a farm. He had a few things to say. When he finished the farm tour, he was interviewed and said: `I certainly learnt some things.' He went on to say, `I now realise that farming is more than just an enterprise, it is also a lifestyle.' That is probably a pretty important factor to keep in mind because, I have to say on behalf of Australia's farmers, you would not do the job for the rate of return on capital—you really would not.

I am very well aware of his keen interest in this issue. Everyone agrees that land clearing in Queensland needs to be better managed and controlled. Indeed, the federal government has taken an active interest in land clearing, especially because of its potential to make significant gains in relation to greenhouse gas reductions but also because we are interested in protecting the biodiversity and particularly the of concern vegetation. We attempted in our negotiations with the Queensland government to achieve a fair outcome for land-holders and all of those interested in land clearing.

That is a record number of individuals recognising efforts by our fellow Australians in building better communities, which is what Work for the Dole is all about.

I do not think it is going too far to say that they hate the concept of Work for the Dole. We know how the member for Grayndler feels. He has been on the record many times saying that the Work for the Dole program is a blatant discriminatory attack and that this government is all about punishment and discrimination. He thinks it is punishment and discrimination to give people an opportunity to build on their work experience and do something positive in their community.</para><para>He has some very good supporters on that side. You only have to look at the new leader of the Labor Party—that is, the President of the Labor Party, the member for Fremantle—who has said she finds that the idea that those who are out of work should be compelled to work for the dole to repay society for giving them something is insulting and destructive. She finds it insulting and destructive that someone should have to repay the benefit they are receiving from society. Those on this side of the House say that getting people out of their houses and getting them involved in worthwhile work in their communities is in fact very positive and constructive. Again we have the Leader of the Opposition in direct conflict with the President of the Labor Party and his shadow minister, but there is nothing new about that.</para><para>The member for Grayndler has admitted that he would not be keeping Work for the Dole in its current form.

Every one of the members that sit on this side of the House is committed to Work for the Dole and what it stands for. Work for the Dole is about giving people a hand. It is about giving people a fair go, not a free ride. The Labor Party wants to repudiate the notion that with rights come responsibilities.

Why wouldn't a future Labor government want this lease renewed, given that they think it is such a good deal?

So I have a very serious request to make of the Leader of the Opposition on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia: give now a clear, categorical, unambiguous undertaking that a future Labor government will not exercise the option.

In the handbook there is a standard 60-day period for a response to those particular issues. The industry, I hope, will put effort into developing an appropriate scientific response, and that ought to be their priority, rather than advertising campaigns and other things which might divert resources from what are the key issues to be resolved in settling these matters. The handbook demonstrates that there is 60-day period; if there is to be an extension then that would be a matter for the Director of Quarantine.

This morning I noticed a headline in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper in Melbourne which asked a very significant question, namely: `Will Latham be bad for business?' The answer is a resounding yes. In this article, the Labor spokesman for workplace relations, the member for Rankin, said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>We'd—</para></quote><para>that is, the Labor Party—</para><quote><para>have a light-touch regulation ...</para></quote><para>`Light-touch' is one way of describing it when the union bosses hold the power, having got repayment for the $40 million that they have donated to the Australian Labor Party over the last seven to eight years. This in fact is heavy-handed regulation that the Labor Party propose which would regulate every minute of every day of every worker in Australia.</para><para>Let me give some examples to the House of Labor's heavy-handed approach to industrial regulation. Labor's heavy-handed approach would give the union bosses a foot in the door of every workplace in Australia, whether or not there was a union member employed within that workplace—something which is in legislation before the Labor state government in South Australia at the present time. Labor's heavy-handed approach would require businesses to bargain with the union bosses regardless of their interest in talking directly with their workers. Labor's heavy-handed approach would give $3.8 billion in government contracts only to the small and medium sized businesses in Australia which the union bosses approved of, something which was part of ALP policy just a month ago in Sydney.</para><para>Labor's heavy-handed approach would remove flexibility and choice in the Australian work force by the abolition of Australian workplace agreements, of which in the order of 400,000 have been taken up to date—the fastest growing industrial instrument at the present time. Labor's heavy-handed approach would remove the secondary boycott provisions from the Trade Practices Act which protect small business from sympathy strikes. Labor's heavy-handed approach would also reconstitute industry-wide agreements, so we would have a return to this: 500-page, complex, complicated awards, industry wide, regulating, as I said, every minute of every day of every worker in Australia. In fact what the Labor Party want to do is to turn back the clock so far as the system in Australia is concerned so that it is written by industrial lawyers for industrial lawyers and the union bosses. If this is a `light-touch approach', it is a bit like the light touch the Leader of the Opposition has with taxi drivers.</para><para>The CEO of the Australian Industry Group, Heather Ridout, in this article this morning, said:</para><quote><para>Latham's regulatory industrial relations policies are at odds with his free market economics ...</para></quote><para>That is the judgment of business in Australia.

This is the government at it again. Whenever they are in trouble all they have is one solution: spend, spend and spend some more. We have to ask ourselves this question, though: spending for what? Not more affordable health care, because they are still running down bulk-billing; not more affordable education, because they are putting up the cost of TAFE and university fees; not decent retirement incomes; and not relief for struggling families, either through lower charges or through lower taxes.</para></talk.start><para>This is a government that has lost control over spending, and it is a government with waste and mismanagement rampant. We have just seen examples in question time where the government has refused to indicate where its savings are coming from and has defended wasteful spending that could clearly go to improving these things. It is a deal to save their political hide. They will do any deal to spend their way out of trouble. This is not good economic management; it is, indeed, economic vandalism.</para><para>There we were today listening to the Treasurer glowing about the latest product figures in the economy. But when he was asked if there would be money for relief for families—tax cuts—this is what the Treasurer had to say: `If the budget is balanced after paying for defence, security, health, aged pensions and the like then we should try and work at lowering the tax burden in Australia.' Understand this: according to the Treasurer, once this government has paid for more on defence, more on security, more on health and more on aged pensions, with no savings identified—none of them were identified today when the government was asked to do so—they will have balanced the budget.</para><para>If you are going to spend more money on tax cuts, doesn't that produce a deficit? That is effectively what this government are saying in their desperate bid in this election year. The Treasurer's press conference has effectively admitted that once the pressure is put on by all of the interest groups that come to the backbench, and then it funnels through to the Prime Minister, and he realises he is in trouble and will have to spend his way out, then, once that leaves the budget in balance, they will have to go into deficit to pay the tax cuts. But then, in the next breath, the Treasurer said that his aim is to produce a surplus.</para><para>I know that the Leader of the Opposition has been arguing very strongly that parents should read their kids three books a night. I think the Treasurer has been reading a book to himself: Norman Lindsay's <inline font-style="italic">The Magic Pudding</inline>. I went to an extract of this book so that I could see what the Treasurer has been fantasising about at night. It reads:</para><quote><para>The Magic Pudding is a pie, except when it's something else, like a steak, or a jam donut, or an apple dumpling, or whatever its owner wants it to be. And it never runs out. No matter how many slices you cut, there's always something left over. It's magic.</para><para>But the Magic Pudding is also alive. It walks and it talks and it's got a personality like no other. A meaner, sulkier, snider, snarlinger Pudding you've never met.</para></quote><para>This is the Treasurer with his admission today in terms of the budget, `We will spend more, then we will cut taxes, but we will produce a surplus.' Where is the magic pudding, Treasurer?</para><para>Just look at the record of this government. Since 1997, their increase in expenditure has been $94 billion. They talk about the debt that they were running down from Labor, but this is a government that have spent an extra $94 billion since 1997. But the big expenditure increases are in election years. In the 1998 election year, expenditure was $21 billion. In 2001 it was $26 billion. In 2003—the phoney election year, last year—it was $23 billion. And here we go again—the ratcheting up again—because $5 billion was added to the budget between May and December, and another $3.5 billion between December and now. That is $8.5 billion. In the last five days, $1 billion has been added, and none of it is funded from savings. Today we asked the Prime Minister where, in terms of that $8.5 billion, his savings were. No answer. We asked him where, in the $1 billion in the last five days, his savings were. No answer. I wait with bated breath for the Treasurer to tell us where those savings are. This is a government that talk the slogans of fiscal discipline but do not practise them.</para><para>You have got to ask yourself: if they are on this spending spree, where is the money coming from? I will tell you where it is coming from: it is coming from your taxes. The ordinary taxpayer in Australia is paying for this profligacy. Tax revenue to this government, between May and December, will increase by $19 billion into the future. The only thing greater than this government's propensity spend is their propensity to tax. This is the greatest taxing and spending government that we have had. They talk about tax and spend in terms of our side—they have rewritten the book. They have now introduced two new golden rules: tax to the hilt and then spend the money—and spend the surplus so your political opponents cannot. They go on a vote-buying spree whenever there is an election in the offing. That is the track record. Just look at this graph that proves the point. It shows $21 billion, $26 billion and $23 billion—all in election years, all significantly above any other expenditure that they engage themselves in in non-election years. What they do is seek to buy votes.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Costello, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Costello</name></talker><para>—Ha, ha!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name></talker><para>—Oh, the guffaw from the Treasurer.

All of the initiatives that we have announced have been fully costed and funded—every one of them. It is the discipline we have applied to date, and it is the discipline we will apply in the future. When people ask us where the money is coming from, they will know, because we will show them. But nothing in the government's announcements this week demonstrates that point. There are no savings measures and no bringing to account. Let us go through what Labor have been able to do by reordering the budget. Take education: no 25 per cent increase in HECS fees under us, no crippling student debt, 20,000 more university places and 20,000 more TAFE places, and a preparedness to invest in early education so that the Read Aloud program becomes a reality and our schools—all of them—funded on the basis of need.</para><para>All of the initiatives that Labor have announced to date have been fully costed and funded. We have put the costings out and, in the time that we have put these announcements out, from opposition we have identified in excess of $5 billion in savings. None of that has come from the government. Indeed, the government have picked up some of those savings and pocketed them for themselves. This is what the work of hard government must involve. The cornerstone of good budget policy is controlling your spending, but this government's spending is out of control. They are wasteful and making a naked grab for votes, because they find themselves in trouble.</para><para>We have a health policy to restore bulk-billing, establish a dental program and repair our aged system—all programs we will announce or have announced, fully costed and funded.

That is the challenge to this government, because they have not come up with anything. They have come up with slogans but no policies, no solutions.

In the eight years that I have been Treasurer I do not think there has been a day when the national accounts have been published that I have not been asked a question—until today.

The last budget of the Keating government had a deficit of $10,077 million; the one before that, a deficit of $13,181 million; the one before that, a deficit of $17,110 million; the one before that, a deficit $17,036 million; the one before that, a deficit of $11,585 million—and for the one before that, a surplus of $372 million! That was a successful year! In the six years in which the member for Hotham, who is being critical of this government's fiscal policy, served in government the cumulative deficits of the Keating government were $70 billion—they collected the revenues and then spent the money. The difference was that they spent $70 billion that they did not have.</para><para>Let us compare the last six outcomes of this government. Last year was not a deficit but a surplus of $4.6 billion; the year before, a surplus of $7.4 billion; the year before that, a deficit of $0.9 billion—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition members interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Costello, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COSTELLO</name></talker><para>—You are against deficits, I presume? The year before that, a surplus of $5.9 billion; the year before that, a surplus of $13 billion; and the year before that, a surplus of $4.3 billion. In the last six budgets there were cumulative surpluses of $35 billion coming off a Labor Party cumulative deficit of $70 billion, a turnaround of $105 billion. This is the fiscal policy that the member for Hotham is critical of. My goodness! Imagine if he had something to complain about. That is one way of measuring this government's fiscal performance—measuring it against our political opponents. If one does that, the answer is obvious.</para></talk.start></continue><para>When the member for Hotham and I came here in 1990, in the lead-up to a budget you would never have an argument about what the size of a surplus should be. It was just assumed that the budget would always be in deficit. The question was: what will the size of the deficit be? I did not arrive in government with a budget in surplus. When I came to the treasurership of this country, we had to think about how you balanced a budget which was then $10 billion in deficit.</para><para>The dream the member for Hotham has is to try to get into government and take advantage of what this government has done. His dream is to come in and to become a Treasurer or Prime Minister, or whatever he now dreams of, and take advantage of a budget which is balanced, of a debt to GDP ratio of three per cent, of an unemployment rate of 5.7 per cent, of an inflation rate which has averaged 2.6 per cent and of all the changes to the tax system which we put in place and to sit back and to bask in it. It is his dream to take advantage of everything he opposed in a policy sense and then to try and inherit the fruits of that.</para><para>There is another way you could compare this government's fiscal record. You could say, `All right, it's not fair to measure it against the Labor Party. Let's measure it against other developed economies to see whether or not our fiscal performance matches, shall we say, the United States—the world's largest economy. Is the United States budget balanced?' The United States budget deficit is five per cent of GDP. If we were running a budget policy the same as that of the United States, we would now have a deficit of $40 billion in this country. Let us compare ourselves with the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom government is a government which, when it goes through its third wave New Labour phase, sometimes seeks to emulate it. Is the UK budget in surplus? No, it is not. The UK is running substantial deficits at the moment and has been for years.</para><para>Shall we compare ourselves to France, Germany or Japan? Which of the countries of the developed world should we compare ourselves with? Again, if you want to take the international measure: does Australia lag? Is Australia lagging in relation to fiscal policy? Australia leads. In 1991, Mr McMullan, the member for Fraser—and people forget this—was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Labor Treasurer, Paul Keating. He knew what economic policy was happening in this country under Labor. I will never forget his opinion piece in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> on 5 May 1991. I think I have told the House this one before, but I really do like this. He said:</para><quote><para>Last week, I had the opportunity to represent Australia at meetings of the IMF—</para></quote><para>I have the opportunity to represent Australia at the IMF these days. He continued:</para><quote><para>Such occasions tend to put domestic concerns into perspective. Three things struck me during the course of the meeting: first, we should never forget our relatively favourable situation. As I have said before in these articles, when compared to the problems of Mali, Peru or Bangladesh, all Australians should rejoice in their good fortune.</para></quote><para>Mr McMullan used to go off to the IMF. Our budget was then in deficit by 2.8 per cent of GDP—which today would be a budget deficit of $22 billion—our unemployment rate was 11 per cent and the then Senator McMullan came back from Washington and said, `Don't worry, things aren't that bad; we are doing better than Mali, Peru and Bangladesh.' That was the way the Labor Party used to measure themselves. When they internationally benchmarked themselves on fiscal policy, they looked at Mali, Peru and Bangladesh. They did not benchmark against the United States, the United Kingdom, France or Germany, as I have just benchmarked Australia's fiscal policy.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

This government has run a fiscal policy which has now produced six consecutive surplus budgets and, as I said earlier, it is my intention to produce a seventh surplus budget in May. If we are able to do that, we will be continuing to lead the world. It ill behoves the opposition to come in here and attack our fiscal policy for being loose. What are the areas where we allegedly engaged in loose fiscal policy? It was an increase in veterans' benefits. The Labor Party opposed the increase in veterans' benefits. I could be wrong, but I remember Mr Edwards, the member from Western Australia, demanding that we increase expenses in that area. He then named Catholic schools. Does the Labor Party oppose giving more money to Catholic schools?</para></talk.start></continue><para>It ill behoves the Australian Labor Party to claim that we are being fiscally loose when all of their criticism is that we should spend more. The Australian Labor Party are blocking our health package in the Senate not because it spends $2.4 billion but because they want to spend an additional $2 billion. They blocked our higher education reforms not because they thought we spent too much money but because they thought we did not spend enough. They are blocking the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme changes of $1 billion in the Senate not because they think that that is spending too much money but because they want to spend more. They are blocking our disability support pension measures in the Senate not because they want to save money on disability support pension but because they want to spend more.</para><para>All of the measures that this government has put in place in order to keep fiscal policy discipline have been opposed by the Australian Labor Party. If the Australian Labor Party had come in on this MPI and criticised the government for not spending enough, I would have taken it—I would have understood where you are coming from—but, as you are opposing all of our savings measures, to come in and say that our fiscal policy is loose and that we are spending too much money is an absolute fraud. It is an absolute policy fraud, and it ill behoves the member for Hotham to try and resurrect his career as shadow Treasurer on that particular tack. The world has changed; he ought to change with it and acknowledge the success that this government has had on fiscal policy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>25788</page.no><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name><name.id>83S</name.id><electorate>Chisholm</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The world has changed, but I dare say it has not changed enough for the Treasurer; I am sure that he would like to see bigger changes on his side of the House than he is getting to see now. My notes read, surprisingly enough, that when the rant ends I should get up and ask the simple question: what is this government's agenda? What is its third term agenda, let alone its fourth term agenda? What are its priorities? We did not hear one mention of priorities and we did not hear one mention of this government's agenda. We did not hear one mention of how they will spend all this money that they are collecting with such enthusiasm. Where are they going? They do not have an agenda because they do not want one. They accuse us of having no policy, but they do not want a policy, because that would hinder them from being able to throw money at every problem that comes along—at every little thing that scares the backbench into thinking they may lose the next election. They have to hold on to that so they can throw a massive fistful of dollars at it.</para></talk.start><para>The answer to the question about what the government's priorities are is: spend and scare. Howard spent and scared his way into Kirribilli last time, and he wants to spend and scare his way into Kirribilli this time. I would say `the Lodge', but he never actually goes there, so I think we will just refer to it as going to Kirribilli for another term. Last election it was spend and scare: scare with lies and the degradation of human beings coming to this country; spend to shore up selected target groups. I love the hypocrisy of this. If the ALP were doing this, we would be lampooned by the government and the press as `economically irresponsible and captive to powerful special interest groups'—dare I say it, such as trade unions. But the government sees our illustrious Prime Minister's action of `spend, spend, spend' as sound economic policy. It is seen, as the Treasurer has just said, as `economic discipline'. I love the hypocrisy. Prime Minister, Treasurer: show me the money. How are you funding this round of pre-election promises and the ones yet to come?

From where and how is the government actually funding these announcements?</para></talk.start></continue><para>I just love the hypocrisy and I think it has been beautifully demonstrated by the recent Wentworth preselection. It is another great example of the double standards in Australian politics. If it had been an ALP preselection, it would have been portrayed as grubby ethnic branch stacking, propped up by shady union bosses. But the incredible efforts of Mr Turnbull to get into this place have been described by the Prime Minister as `vigorous democracy'. Please, spare me. It is like `vigorous economic discipline'. It is one rule for the Liberals and another for the ALP.</para><para>But we actually do not mind on this side of the fence; we do not mind, because we set ourselves higher moral standards and we will live by them. Our policy and associated spending is based on listening to our communities and responding appropriately within the parameters of fully funded measures. We are giving to our communities solutions, not simply throwing money willy-nilly to shore up the latest grab bag of votes. In all of the government's panicked attacks on the opposition, I have never heard one solution to the problems which families in my electorate are struggling with in their daily lives. What is the government doing to help families find a bulk-billing doctor? Bulk-billing rates in my electorate of Chisholm have fallen by more than 10 per cent from December 2000 to December 2003, tumbling from 82.4 per cent to 71 per cent. Ten per cent of bulk-billing doctors have gone. What is the government doing? What is the government's solution for the 15,600 young Australians who were turned away from TAFE last year despite meeting all the entry requirements? Nothing.</para><para>What action is the government taking to ensure that our aged can gain entry to a nursing home in their neighbourhood so they can age in familiar surroundings? Nothing. Near my electorate is the Salvation Army nursing home, Inala, which is being forced to sell. It has 600 residents in the aged care facility and another 400 in independent living units. What is the government doing for those people and those families who are ringing my office daily, scared—scared for their aged relatives? Nothing. Why in the 21st century should thousands of Australians be living for years in pain because they cannot afford to get dental treatment? I do not need to tell anybody on this side of the fence about people desperate for dental care. We get such people in our offices every day. We have listened and we have offered a solution that is fully funded.</para><para>Mums and dads are under increasing financial stress, with family payment debts averaging almost $1,000 hanging over the heads of 600,000 Australians a year—that is 600,000 people. The government has known about it, because we have read its leaked report. What is it doing? It is doing nothing. Yet the Treasurer keeps telling Australians—and he has done it today yet again—that they have never had it so good. The government is blind to the issues facing everyday Australians. It certainly cannot justify this blatant disregard by claiming its hands are tied because there is not enough money in the kitty; the Treasurer has just admitted that there is. The Howard government is the highest taxing government in Australia's history and there is no shortage of money going into its coffers.</para><para>The government had enough money to spend $15,000 on media liaison consultants during last year's visit by President George Bush. You will remember the great Bush sleep-over—$15,000 to liaise with media for the great Bush sleep-over. The government felt that there was enough money to squander $259,890 for two years worth of gardening services for the Lodge—a residence which is almost never occupied. I am sure my kids would like to play on a lawn that is manicured to that extent. It even felt it was acceptable to spend $16,500 employing a gift consultant to the Prime Minister. We are spending $16,500 on telling him what presents to buy. I would like to know what we have actually spent on the presents.</para><para>The fact is that the Prime Minister and his government have lost control of spending. They are out of control. When they are not squandering tax revenue on projects to enhance their own feelings of prestige, they are spending money to grease squeaky electoral wheels. Since last year's budget, the government has made promises which add up to more than $5 billion, and many of them are just bandaiding over problems caused by its own incompetence. We have conservative estimates of a $63 million advertising blitz occurring this year alone, with 18 taxpayer funded campaigns to get under way. An amount of $40,000 was spent on security at the wedding reception of the Prime Minister's daughter at one of his taxpayer funded properties. Yet the government's MPs can somehow maintain a straight face when they lecture us about fiscal discipline. Show us some fiscal discipline, please, because none is being demonstrated by what you are doing.</para><para>In contrast to the government, we have chosen to pledge funding to programs which will go to the heart of helping families under pressure. We have $1.9 billion planned to save Medicare. It will lift the average national rate of bulk-billing to 80 per cent by increasing the Medicare rebate to 100 per cent of the schedule fee and by offering incentives to doctors to bulk-bill again. We will invest $300 million in Australian dental care over four years, providing 1.3 million extra dental procedures for Australians—enough to clear the existing backlog and substantially reduce waiting lists. We will provide 20,000 extra TAFE places and an additional 20,000 university places.</para><para>Not only will these promises help ease the load of millions of Australians; they are also financially responsible. We have already identified more than $5 billion worth of waste and misguided priorities which we can cut from the budget. That is $5 billion we can spend appropriately on targeted areas that our communities are crying out for. The list will only grow as more of the Howard government's litany of waste and wrong priorities is revealed. I sometimes wish we could have Senate estimates every week so that we could list more identified waste. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr Emerson</name></talker><para>—The wine consultant.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83S</name.id><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name></talker><para>—Yes, the wine consultant; I should have gone to the wine consultant.

We have an agenda in this government of creating over a million new jobs, ensuring that families have the opportunity to have a breadwinner in the family, earning an income and earning self-respect. We believe in running the economy properly and ensuring that people have the opportunity of a job, not in dragging people down to the lowest common denominator. That is the way to build Australia. Our vision for Australia is to create opportunity and not to drag people down.</para></talk.start><para>I hear the members opposite whinge and moan, `Where is the money coming from?' They cannot really comprehend it, but a strong, vibrant, growing economy provides the revenue stream that allows a government to provide goods and services. The Treasurer today announced the strongest quarterly growth in years—1.4 per cent for the December quarter—and four per cent annual growth. This is world-leading stuff, and all that the members opposite—so bereft of vision, so bereft of any credentials on economics—can do is whinge and moan. Farm production is up by 13.3 per cent, rural exports are up by 8.2 per cent, household consumption is up by 5.5 per cent, private business investment grew by over 10 per cent, and the profit share for the economy is the highest ever recorded. This does not just happen; this happens as a result of a strong hand on the tiller, responsible financial management, and strong growth against a background of low inflation. They could not achieve strong growth against a background of high inflation, yet they seek to criticise.</para><para>They handed to this government a $10 billion black hole and they stand here today attempting to run some tired argument that they have some economic credibility. They try and attack the government's budget credentials—a government which has delivered surplus after surplus. They are the ones who left us with a $96 billion government debt. We have set to work and we have been paying that back. Over $60 billion has been paid back. And what can we do with the interest saving? We can spend on providing goods and services for the people of this country; we can spend on providing a better Australia; we can spend on providing opportunities for families and improving the quality of life for Australians. And we are still delivering surpluses. I am confident that we will have a very fine surplus delivered in the next May budget.</para><para>It is the coalition's strong and responsible fiscal policies that have allowed this country to prosper, and in doing so we have been able to do a number of great things: we have been able to provide $20 billion each year for families, through family tax benefits and child-care benefits; we have put in place the new tax system; and we have provided $11 billion in tax cuts—and, hopefully, we will see some more tax cuts coming up during the forthcoming year. The coalition has in fact provided $2 billion in family tax benefits. Our books are in good shape. We are running a surplus. We are always running a surplus—that is what this government does.</para><para>Let us look at Labor's record. Let us peer back in time. The new Leader of the Opposition does not seem to worry about what happened in the past; what happened in the past does not matter to him. The fact that there was an $11½ billion deficit in 1991-92 apparently does not matter; the fact that there was a $17 billion deficit in 1992-93 does not matter; and the fact that there was a $17 billion deficit in 1993-94 does not matter either. The deficits under Labor just continue and continue. They ran up those deficits while they were selling Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. They could not even balance the budget while they were selling off the farm.</para><para>The contrast between their economic credentials and our economic credentials is absolutely staggering. When Mr Crean, the current shadow Treasurer, was the minister for employment, unemployment peaked at over 10 per cent—a really good performance. He took unemployment over 10 per cent, and what is it now? It is 5.7 per cent. That is responsible economic management, with responsible economic policies, producing real results for Australians. The thing about Labor's deficits is that they are not shouldered by the people from Mars; they are shouldered by everyday Australians.</para><para>What a Labor deficit means is that the Labor Party is out there in the financial markets, competing with home owners to borrow funds. The Labor Party has its grubby hands in the financial markets, trying to rip out the money—money that is needed by people buying first homes and people who are carrying mortgages. So the Labor Party not only runs a policy of high unemployment and high interest rates but it competes with families in the mortgage market because it cannot balance its own budget. If a family were to run a deficit of a fraction of the proportion of their income that the Labor Party ran, they would soon be bankrupt, but the Labor Party seems to think that it has a licence to spend like there is no tomorrow.</para><para>I would like to just reflect for a moment on what some of Mr Crean's colleagues have said about Labor. I refer first to Mr Bob Carr.

I will say that again: the electorate hesitated to vote for federal Labor because of concerns about economic management. In another instance, our good friend Mr Bob McMullan was quoted as saying:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>There is evidence to suggest that one public perception which distinguishes Labor's success at a local level from our recent failures at a national level has been fear of a lack of discipline in our fiscal policy and concern about the implications of this for interest rates.</para></quote><para>It is quite obvious that the people of Australia would be concerned that the Labor Party, back in power, would be back out in the mortgage market, competing with people for finance, driving interest rates up, and making mortgages unaffordable.</para><para>It is strange that the Labor Party are criticising some recently announced spending initiatives which I think are valuable and will assist in creating a stronger Australia. I would like to know what they think is wrong with spending $267 million in additional funding to support our veterans. I think it is a very noble cause and our veterans are most deserving. It is something we should be supporting. The coalition was also able to give the states another $10 billion through last year's health agreements. That is another good thing to be spending money on. Do the Labor Party think we should take that money back and put it under a rug? I presume they want us to do that so that when they come along they can spend it. We also have the $2.4 billion MedicarePlus package, which is being held up by Labor. That is how much real concern they have for the welfare of the people of Australia—holding up MedicarePlus in the Senate, holding up that valuable safety net initiative. They really should wake up to themselves on this matter.</para><para>The announcement on the weekend of $362 million to assist Catholic schools is a very worthwhile initiative and one which should be supported. I would like to see the Labor Party state their position on why we should not be spending $362 million on Catholic schools. The Catholic school system is a very great educational institution. It should be noted that we have been spending more money on state schools too. Our federal funding expenditure for state schools has gone up by 60 per cent since we came to government in 1996. We have more young adults at university than ever before. Quite frankly, the spending initiatives announced recently are most proper. I do not want to see this spending on health reduced. We should be putting as many resources as we responsibly can into our health system. I do not want to see spending on education cut. We should be supporting education expenditure to the maximum amount a responsible government can because we know that education is a major driver in the future wealth of this country. We should continue to support our veterans with a good, solid veterans' affairs program, as we have.</para><para>But there is one thing I think we should be cutting expenditure on and I would be keen to initiate it as quickly as possible. The members opposite have been a bit slow, but we will give them a bit of time. We should cut expenditure on the lease of Centenary House. We should rip $36 million in unnecessary expenditure out of Centenary House and put it into training more doctors and nurses and providing additional education services, health services and support for our veterans. That is what we could do with that money.

Section 127 gives the Australian Industrial Relations Commission the power to order the return to work when unprotected and illegitimate industrial action is taking place. The bill would enhance this remedy by giving the commission another tool—interim orders—in relation to the matter. The government is disappointed that the opposition parties were not prepared to support this simple and modest bill in its original form. However, I am glad that the Australian Democrats have been prepared to negotiate with the government about this matter and to see the benefit of interim orders designed to help the commission deal with section 127 applications without the distraction of ongoing industrial action.</para><para>I believe that the measures to be removed from the bill by the Senate's amendment were important to ensure the commission appropriately deals with applications for return to work orders. Moreover, we believe that the provision in the original bill requiring the commission to deal with section 127 applications generally within 48 hours would have ensured that the commission acted promptly where workplaces were disrupted by short strikes designed to end prior to the commission dealing with the matter. The bill as introduced would also have ensured that if the commission could not deal with the application within 48 hours or before industrial action was due to commence an interim order could have been issued.</para><para>The proposed amendment removes the list of factors the commission should take into account in considering whether to issue section 127 orders. These factors are based on those previously used by the commission and would have emphasised the undesirability of allowing unprotected industrial action to occur, particularly during the term of a certified agreement. Although the amendment that we have negotiated with the Democrats, which they have moved, removes some of the useful elements of the bill, it is vital to ensure that the very simple but important reform of giving the commission the express power to grant interim section 127 orders remains. This is a significant improvement on the current situation of the commission relying on general powers to issue interim return to work orders. Contrary to what has been said in debate by the opposition, there is doubt about whether these existing general powers can be used to make such interim orders. Even the president of the commission has acknowledged that the commission's general powers may not support interim return to work orders. We must ensure that enforceable interim orders can be issued and that incidents of unions ignoring interim return to work orders are not repeated.</para><para>The government maintains that the bill in its original form is needed to enable the commission to grant effective, enforceable and timely relief against illegitimate and unprotected industrial action. However, to secure one modest but important reform that ends the uncertainty about interim orders, the government will agree to the amendment which was proposed in the Senate by the Australian Democrats.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>25794</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—After the failure of the 1999 second wave of industrial relations legislation, the government announced that it was going to try to pass that legislation again but in smaller parts. It has been trying to do this time and time again, breaking the second wave into smaller bills. But we will not accept them even as smaller bills. The Senate has wisely refused to pass all but a tiny number of the more insignificant of the government's workplace relations bills. The Democrats' amendment to the <inline ref="R1594">Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Remedies for Unprotected Action) Bill 2002</inline> has gutted the bill and inserted a provision into section 127 of the act which says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Commission may make an interim order under this section.</para></quote><para>Section 127 is the section under which the commission makes orders to stop industrial action. The commission already can and does make interim orders in respect of section 127, as well as in respect of other sections of the act. I assume that the government's attraction to interim orders is based on the fact that they stop industrial action prior to the parties having the opportunity to put their full case to the commission. We already know that the government is unconcerned about fairness in industrial relations and even more indifferent to resolving disputes or requiring the parties to bargain in good faith. The government, through other legislation, wants to make it almost impossible to take any industrial action, giving working Australians no capacity to stand up for themselves when negotiations fail.</para><para>The total effect of this bill is to slightly nudge the commission in the direction of making more interim orders. This is hardly a sensible and efficient use of the parliament's time and resources. But the minister has obviously decided that he prefers a shell of a bill to pass than no bill at all. He is trying to prove that he is a legislator, in contrast to his predecessor, the current Minister for Health and Ageing, who had no success in getting legislation in the industrial relations arena through the Senate. That seems to be the decision that the minister is making. He would prefer a shell to no bill at all.</para><para>Labor oppose this bill even as amended. We do not support legislation that further chips away at the commission's discretion, even if it is a very small chip in this case. If the commission thinks that the circumstances of a particular case warrant an interim order then it will make one. It does not need to be reminded that it has the power to do so. The bill as amended is the legislative equivalent of having the minister hovering over the commission's shoulders, waving a sign that says: `Don't forget the government likes interim orders.' We all know that this government likes interim orders.</para><para>I want to refer to the bill as it was prior to the Democrats' amendment. The bill in that form aimed to undermine the commission much more than in this final version. It implied that the commission was somehow not working effectively and urged the commission to be tougher on unions in its consideration of section 127 applications and orders. This is yet another attack on working Australians and the unions that represent them. It is yet another attack on the independent Industrial Relations Commission. It is hardly surprising that the bulk of this bill was taken out in the process of gutting it, given the evidence that was provided to the Senate inquiry. Parties as diverse as the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, the Australian Industry Group and the ACTU all gave evidence that the commission was dealing with section 127 effectively already. For example, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations said:</para><quote><para>The Commission has generally been responsive and prompt in dealing with section 127 applications.</para></quote><para>So what is the problem? The Australian Industry Group said:</para><quote><para>... the provisions of section 127 of the act are quite effective ...</para></quote><para>So what is the problem? No-one appearing before the Senate inquiry came up with either statistical evidence or a list of case studies that was in any way comprehensive enough to justify the original bill. I am not sure why the Democrats decided to throw the government a legislative crumb about interim orders. Perhaps they feel sorry for the new minister. I certainly do. We do not share the views of the Democrats and we will not support unfair and unwarranted legislation, no matter how trivial it is. Labor will be opposing this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>25796</page.no><name role="metadata">Andrews, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREWS</name><name.id>HK5</name.id><electorate>Menzies</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Very briefly, in reply to the honourable member for Rankin, it is my recollection that my predecessor in fact was successful in having three bills passed by this parliament.

I was impressed with the passionate speech by the member for Dunkley, which I thought made a very real contribution to the debate. I thank the member for Herbert, who has been a great champion for the tourism operators who depend on the reef for their livelihood, and the member for Leichhardt, who was the previous speaker, for his remarks. Tourism is by far the largest industry associated with the Great Barrier Reef and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The tourism industry welcomes this legislation and the fact that it honours the government's commitment to ensure that responsibility for the payment of the standard tourism charge rests with the visitors to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Some suggestion was made by the opposition during this debate that, in some way or other, the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators was unhappy with the way in which the government has been managing policy development in the marine park. Nothing could be further from the truth. The truth is that the marine park tourism operators are exceedingly happy and satisfied—one might almost say over the moon—with the decisions that the government has made in relation to the management of the marine park. I can put before the House as evidence of that the press release that was put out by the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators on the announcement of the reef rezoning plan. The press release from AMPTO said the following:</para><quote><para>Dr Kemp and GBRMPA should be congratulated for their efforts, courage and vision.</para></quote><para>Mr McKenzie, who is the executive director of AMPTO, said that. He went on to say:</para><quote><para>I doubt that I will see a more important conservation effort anywhere in the world in my lifetime.</para></quote><para>No comment could be stronger than that, and I think that puts paid completely to any suggestion that the marine park tourism operators have any degree of unhappiness at all over this. Indeed, they welcome this legislation and the major policy decisions that the government has taken to protect the Great Barrier Reef.</para><para>Comments were also made during the debate about climate change and its impact on the reef by way of increasing the probability of bleaching events arising from the warming of the seas. There is no doubt at all that the warming of the seas over the 20th century has increased the probability of bleaching events through unusually hot waters bathing the coral reefs. Comment has been made particularly about the present circumstances, and I think it is appropriate to comment about the current situation of coral bleaching.</para><para>It has been an unusually hot summer this year, with above average temperatures through most of the Great Barrier Reef region. While these conditions were not as hot as were seen in the early part of the 200102 summer, which led to the most extensive coral bleaching event ever recorded for the Great Barrier Reef, temperatures have been hovering around levels known to result in bleaching. We have had reports of minor bleaching from numerous sites, ranging from Lizard Island in the north through to Cairns, Townsville, the Whitsunday Islands and Heron Island. Weather conditions have been hovering around levels known to trigger coral bleaching for several weeks now, but they have not yet caused enough stress to produce a mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef. This means that the reef has been on the brink of a serious bleaching event since late January.</para><para>The cooler conditions that brought some relief to the central and northern Great Barrier Reef over recent weeks have recently given way to hot conditions once more, increasing the risk of coral bleaching, especially in the southern Great Barrier Reef. The weather over the next two to three weeks will determine whether the Great Barrier Reef experiences widespread bleaching this summer. Cooler air temperatures, cloud cover and strong winds will all lessen the risk of widespread bleaching, while hot, cloudless and still days will greatly exacerbate temperature anomalies and increase stress levels on corals. The staff of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority are monitoring key regional weather indicators on a daily basis and continue to monitor reports of reef conditions throughout the Great Barrier Reef with the assistance of marine park rangers and tourism operators.</para><para>I am very concerned about the potential effects of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef. The action that can be taken now—the only action that I am aware of—is to ensure that the resilience of the reef is improved by protecting it against overfishing, reducing pollution from coastal land uses and protecting biodiversity. This is what the government has been doing. Through the Reef Water Quality Protection Plan, targets will now be set for permissible levels of water quality coming into the reef lagoon from all rivers emptying into it. Significant funding is being provided by the government through the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality and the Natural Heritage Trust to ensure that appropriate land management actions are taken to improve the water quality in the rivers entering the lagoon, particularly in relation to sediment and nutrient levels, to ensure that stress from the river water quality is reduced to an absolute minimum.</para><para>The Representative Areas Program, reflected in the rezoning plan that has now been brought forward and that I have placed before the parliament for approval, is a key element of the government strategy. That plan will ensure that one-third of the entire Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is protected from any extractive activities and that stress on the Great Barrier Reef is reduced.</para><para>The opposition, for purely rhetorical reasons, has suggested during the debate that somehow the ratification of the Kyoto protocol will assist in protecting the Great Barrier Reef. We need to be completely realistic—it will not. The Kyoto protocol, designed to suit the interests of the European nations, will make almost no difference to global greenhouse gas accumulations in the atmosphere. What will make a difference is a satisfactory set of arrangements which include all major emitters, which the Australian government is working for.</para><para>I was very interested to note that the shadow minister for the environment made the point that a reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions of 60 to 70 per cent will be necessary to stabilise greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. While that statement is scientifically sound and gets no dissent from the government, I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition did dissent from it when he was the member from Werriwa plain and simple, when he was saying what he really thought. In the Cunningham by-election, he described statements of that kind, which were put forward by the Greens, as extremist statements that would lead to the closure of BHP in the Illawarra and the loss of some 10,000 jobs.</para><para>As we know, the Leader of the Opposition is not given to consistency in his statements—and I dare say he is now seeking to change his attitudes—but he seems very torn on the matter of Kyoto. When he was asked by the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times </inline>for some indication as to the opposition's policy, in a supplement published last weekend he admitted to that he had not turned his mind very much to the environment. No-one would be very surprised to read that because nothing much has come from the opposition or the Leader of the Opposition about the environment.</para><para>On Monday he went up to Gladstone and announced that not only was he in favour of ratifying Kyoto but he was in favour of a domestic carbon trading system in Australia, not realising that a domestic carbon trading system would impose particular costs on the aluminium and alumina industries that Gladstone, especially, depends on. If implemented, the domestic carbon trading system he was talking about would impose very significant costs on those high energy use industries, leading to a significant loss of jobs in the very city where he was making this announcement. So he is torn; while he says on the one hand that he wants to protect the environment, he says on the other hand that he wants to protect jobs of working-class Australians. In this area he seems to be utterly confused and is going around the country announcing policies which will have the effect of destroying jobs.</para><para>The government is taking a responsible attitude. We have committed and spent almost $1 billion to the reduction of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. We will meet the internationally negotiated target for greenhouse gas emissions from Australia, and there is no need for the job-destroying and discriminatory policies that the Labor Party is adopting in relation to climate change. In particular, there is no need for these policies because they will do nothing to protect the Great Barrier Reef. The government is doing what is required to improve water quality and to engage the tourism industry and other communities on the Great Barrier Reef in the appropriate action to ensure that the resilience of the reef is maximised to protect it against the inevitable warming events that will take place in oceans and seas surrounding the reef in the years ahead.</para><para>The legislation that is before the House now fulfils the government's commitments. It will be welcomed by all who value this remarkable natural icon in Australia, and I commend it to the House. The amendments that the opposition has put forward are not accepted by the government. They are purely empty rhetoric. They confirm that the opposition has no practical policies whatsoever to assist the government in its policy formulation, and the bill should go through unamended.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time.

The explanatory memorandum says:</para><quote><para>The Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2004 (“the Bill”) amends the <inline font-style="italic">Migration Act 1958</inline> (“the Act”) to put it beyond doubt that an unlawful non-citizen must be kept in immigration detention unless a court makes a final determination that:</para><para>the detention is unlawful; or</para><para>he or she is not an unlawful non-citizen.</para></quote><para>The explanatory memorandum goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Despite the current provisions relating to immigration detention, there has been a series of cases in which the Federal Court has ordered the interlocutory release of detainees, prior to the resolution of their substantive court proceedings.</para><para>The amendments are intended to uphold the scheme of Division 7 of Part 2 of the Act in relation to the mandatory detention of certain unlawful non-citizens.</para><para>The Bill seeks to prevent the release of a detainee from immigration detention pending a court's final determination of the substantive matter as to the lawfulness of the person's detention or whether the person is an unlawful non-citizen.</para><para>The Bill does not affect the jurisdiction of any court to conclusively determine any application made to the court, including an application for review of a decision to refuse to grant a visa or to cancel a visa, and to make appropriate orders.</para></quote><para>All those references are found on page 2 of the explanatory memorandum. Page 4 of the explanatory memorandum says:</para><quote><para>New subsection 196(4) puts it beyond doubt that, unless an unlawful non-citizen is removed, deported or granted a visa, he or she must be kept in immigration detention except where a court makes a final determination that:</para><para>the detention is unlawful (paragraph (a)); or</para><para>the person detained is not an unlawful non-citizen (paragraph (b)).</para></quote><para>The explanatory memorandum goes on to say:</para><quote><para>New paragraph 196(4)(a) would cover circumstances where a court finally determines that there is no real likelihood that an unlawful non-citizen will be removed from Australia in the reasonably foreseeable future, and therefore the detention is unlawful.</para></quote><para>That paragraph is clearly a reference to the Al Masri case and an acknowledgment by the government and the minister, through the explanatory memorandum, that the Al Masri case correctly states the law insofar as those circumstances are concerned. So, whilst the issue in the bill is quite narrow, the history with regard to the capacity of a court to order interlocutory relief, interim release, of an unlawful noncitizen from detention rather than waiting until a final determination has been made in respect of an unlawful noncitizen's position, is longstanding and quite large.</para><para>The minister in his second reading speech, and the former minister in debate on the 2003 bill, said words to the effect that this bill is an important measure in `upholding the principle of mandatory detention for all unlawful noncitizens under the Migration Act'. The problem is that, if that is the case, we have all been doing that since the Msilanga case in 1992—one of the first cases on the mandatory detention regime introduced by the former Hawke-Keating government in 1992. In his second reading speech the minister went on to say:</para><quote><para>The Migration Reform Act included section 196, which provides that an unlawful noncitizen must be kept in immigration detention until he or she is:</para><para>removed from Australia;</para><para>deported; or</para><para>granted a visa.</para><para>Subsection 196(3) specifically states:</para><para>To avoid doubt, subsection (1) prevents the release, even by a court, of an unlawful non-citizen from detention (otherwise than for removal or deportation) unless the non-citizen has been granted a visa.</para></quote><para>So the effort was made in the legislation to essentially exclude the capacity of a court to order the removal of an unlawful noncitizen—that unlawful noncitizen only being able to be removed from detention with the granting of a visa or removal from Australia or deportation.</para><para>The difficulty that presented to the courts—and that which the Federal Court found in the Msilanga case in 1992—was that the Federal Court, under the Migration Act and the federal Judiciary Act, was able to order the release of a criminal deportee, someone whose visa was proposed to be cancelled for character purposes or an unlawful noncitizen. The Federal Court could order interlocutory relief and release on an interim basis such a person from detention if the court was of the view that that person was unlawfully detained. That has been the statement of the law since the Msilanga case in 1992.</para><para>More recently, in 2002 and 2003, we saw the full Federal Court uphold the interim release of an unlawful noncitizen on the basis, in the VFAD case, that that unlawful noncitizen was not an unlawful noncitizen and, in the Al Masri case, that the detention had become unlawful. We are looking at a very narrow point: can the Federal Court order the interim release of a detainee or must it wait until there has been a final determination of that detainee's case? The starting point is not the VFAD case or the Al Masri case, it is the Msilanga case in 1992.</para><para>The minister argues that there has been a spate of recent cases. On the basis of best advice made available to me by the department, I asked what information the department had about such applications made since 1992. The advice I received was that there was no corporate data of earlier circumstances, but the corporate knowledge was that there had been about four applications received from 1992 to 2002 and 48 applications received during the years 2002, 2003 and 2004, all of which have now been resolved. Of the resolved matters, the applicant was successful and the release ordered in respect of visa cancellation on character grounds in 15 cases. There were 16 cases described in the note I received from the department that were of persons challenging the lawfulness of continued detention based on the Al Masri argument and 16 matters where the applicant was not successful.</para><para>Putting 15 of those 48 cases to one side, given that the parliament last year closed off the capacity of a court to order interim release in respect of section 200 relating to criminal deportees or section 501 relating to character failures, we are dealing with 15 successful applications out of 48 cases during 2002, 2003 and 2004. On my calculation, in the financial year 2002-03, 126,000 people came to Australia as migrants; 12,500 people came on a humanitarian program; and 8,000 to 9,000 people came on temporary protection visas. These are not large numbers. But the issue was very important for the 15 people who successfully applied to a court to order their interim release. That issue was their freedom—whether they were to be detained or not detained.</para><para>It is my strong view that this parliament should move very slowly and cautiously to remove from courts the capacity to remove a person from detention using, essentially, its habeas corpus powers. At the opposition's suggestion last year, this parliament responded to this issue, or this concern—as it was expressed then by the former minister for immigration—by suggesting to the then minister and to the parliament that we should close off the capacity for interim release in respect of character cases or criminal deportees. That sounded to me then—post September 11—and it sounds to me now like an eminently sensible thing to do. In the end, the nation-state has to be cautious about the protection and security of its citizens. Closing off that capacity, in my view, was sensible, bearing in mind that that capacity had been open to the courts since the Msilanga case in 1992.</para><para>In respect of the court's relationship to the Migration Act and its view of this matter, whilst the Msilanga case was, if you like, the threshold case as far as detention was concerned in respect of the capacity of a court to grant interim or interlocutory release, the starting point is, in my view, the High Court's decision in Lim's case in 1992. In Lim's case, the High Court was asked to determine, essentially, the legality and constitutionality of mandatory detention for immigration purposes. It is worth while recapping what the High Court had to say in that case and referring to some of the reasons for judgment by the full Federal Court in the VFAD and Msilanga cases. They put into context, firstly, this parliament's legislative powers as far as immigration detention is concerned and, secondly, the issue of the capacity of a court to order interlocutory or interim release.</para><para>The High Court in Lim's case affirmed the constitutionality of administrative detention under the Migration Act where the detention was reasonably necessary for immigration processing. Justices Brennan, Deane and Dawson, in a joint judgment, held:</para><quote><para>... if the detention which they require and authorize is limited to what is reasonably capable of being seen as necessary for the purposes of deportation or necessary to enable an application for an entry permit to be made and considered. On the other hand, if the detention which those sections require and authorize is not so limited, the authority which they purportedly confer upon the Executive cannot properly be seen as an incident of the executive powers to exclude, admit and deport an alien. In that event, they will be of a punitive nature and contravene Ch. III's insistence that judicial power of the Commonwealth be vested exclusively in the courts ...</para></quote><para>The capacity of this parliament to legislate in respect of immigration detention is limited. It is limited for the purposes of immigration. If it turned from being limited administratively for the purposes of immigration to being punitive in nature, the only institution in Australian society in accordance with the Constitution that can order punitive detention would be a court. This parliament has limited power in respect of immigration detention and that is why it needs to proceed, firstly, with caution and, secondly, with an eye to ensuring adequate and appropriate supervision by the courts of people who are in detention.</para><para>I move to the issue of the full Federal Court determining or viewing the question as to whether a court can order interim or interlocutory release. In the Msilanga case, the full Federal Court said:</para><quote><para>Both sections empower the court in an appropriate case to restrain on an interim basis and pending final determination of a substantive claim administrative action where a serious question arises as to the validity of that action.</para></quote><para>So the test in the Msilanga case in 1992 was that, if a serious question arose as to the validity of the detention, a court was empowered prior to a final determination of a substantive claim to order interlocutory release. That has been the law since 1992. In the second reading speech the minister said:</para><quote><para>This bill is an important measure. It is about upholding the principle of mandatory detention for all unlawful non-citizens under the Migration Act.</para></quote><para>If this is true, the parliament, the government and opposition have respectively turned a blind eye from 1992 to last year, when we closed down and narrowed that capacity and excluded the capacity of the courts to order interim release of those people of character concern or of criminal deportee status.</para><para>The two leading cases that we find in recent times are VFAD and the Al Masri case. I regard both the facts and the circumstances of those two cases as being exceptional if not unique. The VFAD case dealt with whether a person who was detained on the basis of being an unlawful noncitizen was in fact not an unlawful noncitizen. The Al Masri case involved an unlawful noncitizen who was being detained and who argued that his detention had become unlawful. In both of those cases the full Federal Court upheld decisions of single Federal Court justices acting alone that their capacity to order interim release by way of interlocutory orders prior to the determination of the substantive case was correct and consistent with the Msilanga case. In Al Masri in April 2003, the full court said:</para><quote><para>the reasoning of the majority of the High Court in Lim ... leads us to conclude that unless the power and duty of detention conferred by s 196 were subject to an implied temporal limitation broadly of the nature of the second limitation found by the trial judge, a serious question of invalidity would arise. Without such a limitation it may well be that the power to detain would go beyond what the High Court ... considered to be reasonably capable of being seen as necessary for the purposes of deportation.</para></quote><para>That second limitation referred to there by the full court is also referred to in their conclusions in the appeal, at paragraphs 176 and 177 of the judgment of the full court. At paragraph 176 of the judgment they say:</para><quote><para>The limitation is not encountered merely by length of detention and it is not grounded upon an assessment of the reasonableness of the duration of detention. ... the conclusion that there is no real likelihood or prospect of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future is one that will not be lightly reached.</para></quote><para>There the full Federal Court made it crystal clear that the basis of the decision in Al Masri's case was not the length of detention. It was not a view as to the reasonableness of the length of detention in Al Masri's case. It went to whether there was a real likelihood or prospect of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future. They held that there was not that prospect but they made the point that this was not a judgment which would be taken lightly. When a court is deliberating over its interlocutory power to order release or to make interlocutory orders in advance of a final determination of the substantive issues, it always proceeds in a cautious manner. That is the message that the full Federal Court is sending in that case.</para><para>If, for some reason, the minister for immigration, current or former, has the concern that he or she does not want the courts ordering the interim release of unlawful noncitizens prior to a substantive determination of their case simply off the back of the length of detention or a view as to the reasonableness of the length of detention, they have nothing to fear. That is not the basis of the Msilanga case, it is not the basis of Lim's case, it is not the basis of VFAD and it is not the basis of the Al Masri case. In VFAD, the full Federal Court said:</para><quote><para>The respondent in the present case is in a position not dissimilar in certain respects to that of the applicants in Msilanga. While we accept that at a formal level that case, and the many other cases which have subsequently followed it, can be distinguished, the principles which underlie those cases are not distinguishable. Those principles, in our opinion, remain correct, and are applicable to this case.</para></quote><para>The court there, in a sense, turns full circle, as it has been described by others, to the Msilanga case of 1992. So what is the mischief which the government seeks to close off by this piece of legislation? Does the legislation warrant or justify that mischief? Is there greater damage, or a greater concern or issue raised, by proceeding down the road which the government would seek to have the parliament follow? Firstly, what is the mischief? The mischief is that the government does not want a court, presumably the Federal Court, to be in a position to order the interim release of an unlawful noncitizen prior to the determination of the substantive issues related to that case, irrespective of whether there is a live issue as to whether that detention is in itself unlawful or whether the person being detained is an unlawful noncitizen.</para><para>On the basis of the rudimentary statistics able to be supplied to me by the department, over the period of more than a decade since the full Federal Court in the Msilanga case said that that was open to a court, we have seen 50-odd cases. Of the successful cases in the last two or three years, half have now been ruled out by the action of this parliament last year in refusing to allow a court to have that capacity of visa cancellation on character grounds under section 501 or for criminal deportees under section 200.</para><para>So, on the basis of information supplied to me by the department, over a 12-year period we have had 16 successful interim releases of unlawful noncitizens. I have not bothered to do the calculation as to what our refugee and humanitarian intake for that equivalent period was or what our migration intake for that equivalent period was; and there is no evidence in any of those cases where interim releases were ordered that any mischief contrary to the public interest occurred. But the government comes before this parliament and says that we should take away the right and capacity of a court to make those interim determinations, because of a handful of cases over more than a decade, when tests were applied and rigour was applied—by the High Court itself in Lim's case and by the full Federal Court in the cases of Msilanga, VFAD and Al Masri.</para><para>The government does not come here with clean hands. This is one of former immigration minister Ruddock's obsessions, and it will be as productive as his obsession with seeking to exclude judicial review by the courts through privative clauses if he embarks on or urges the government to continue to go down this path. Seeking to prevent a court from ordering the interim release of someone from detention—where the court has a live, serious and substantive issue as to whether, firstly, that person is indeed an unlawful noncitizen and, secondly, whether the detention itself is unlawful—is a grave harm to do to the individuals concerned. It pays no respect to the capacity of our courts to determine such things sensibly and adds nothing to the rigour of our migration system and the order that the community expects and warrants from our migration system.</para><para>The other issue that the bill raises in passing—I mentioned it when referring to Lim's case in the High Court—is that we do have before the courts at least one case that I am aware of where the constitutional basis of immigration detention has been raised. I am a strong supporter of mandatory detention. I think when people come here in an unauthorised way and we do not know who they are, we are entitled as a nation-state, and required as representatives of a nation-state, to detain those people for health, security, quarantine, character and identity checks. I have also made the point that you can have gradations of detention once you have done those initial assessments. Having inspected the residential housing project in Port Augusta, a short distance from the Baxter detention centre, that in my view is a very good model which can be used in appropriate circumstances, and the use of those facilities ought to be extended by the government.</para><para>But, as I said, we do have cases before the courts—at least one that I am aware of—where the very constitutional validity of immigration detention is being challenged, returning to the issue raised in 1992 by Lim's case. I would have thought that parliament's seeking to exclude the capacity of a court to order interlocutory relief for a person, where the court thought there was a live issue as to whether that person was in fact an unlawful noncitizen or whether that person's detention had become unlawful, would not necessarily help the argument that detention for immigration purposes was constitutional. I do not think the government or the parliament would want the High Court indicating that mandatory immigration detention was no longer constitutional, and seeking to exclude the court's capacity to order the release of people from detention might not encourage the courts to a sensible view of that issue.</para><para>So we oppose this measure. We opposed it in 2003, when the government brought it before the parliament. The government sensibly responded to our suggestion that, if there were an issue here, that issue was restricted and limited to section 200, which relates to criminal deportees, and to section 501, which relates to visa cancellation for character purposes. It seems like an eminently sensible approach to those cases, particularly post September 11. But in the area of unlawful noncitizens, where a serious or substantive issue goes to whether the person concerned is not an unlawful noncitizen, or indeed whether the detention itself has become unlawful and therefore unconstitutional, we should not close off the capacity of the Federal Court to conduct itself in this way. As I said, in the judgment for Al Masri's case the court said that such a decision was `one that will not be lightly reached'—one that will not be lightly taken. </para><para>On the basis of the statistics supplied to me by the department and on the basis of a lack of evidence as to any of these releases having caused any incident contrary to good government, good order or the public interest, there is absolutely no justification for seeking to exclude this capacity of the court which has been there since the Msilanga case in 1992. On that basis the opposition oppose the bill and will oppose it in the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>25806</page.no><name role="metadata">Prosser, Geoff, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PROSSER</name><name.id>RI4</name.id><electorate>Forrest</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in support of the <inline ref="R1982">Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2004</inline> that proposes to amend the Migration Act 1958 to put beyond doubt that an unlawful noncitizen must be kept in immigration detention unless a court makes a final determination that the detention is unlawful or that he or she is not an unlawful noncitizen. Section 196(1) of the act currently provides that an unlawful noncitizen who is detained under section 189 must be kept in immigration detention until he or she is either removed from Australia, deported or granted a visa. The new amendment to the act makes it clear that section 196(1) prevents a court from releasing an unlawful noncitizen from immigration detention unless the noncitizen has been granted a visa.</para></talk.start><para>Despite the current provisions relating to immigration detention there has been a series of cases in which the Federal Court has ordered the interlocutory release of detainees prior to the resolution of their substantive court proceedings. Therefore, the bill seeks to prevent the release of a detainee from immigration detention pending a court's final determination of the substantive matter as to the lawfulness of the person's detention or whether the person is an unlawful noncitizen.</para><para>The bill does not affect the jurisdiction of any court to conclusively determine any application made to the court, including an application for review of the decision to refuse to grant a visa or cancel a visa, and to make appropriate orders. The effect is to make unmistakably clear the parliament's intention that an unlawful noncitizen is only to be released from immigration detention in the circumstances specified in section 196 unless a court finally determines that the detention is unlawful or the person is not an unlawful noncitizen.</para><para>The bill substantially mirrors the Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2003 in its original form. The 2003 bill was ultimately passed with amendments that only prevented the courts ordering the interlocutory release of persons of character concerns. This new bill covers the broader concerns that government has on the interlocutory release of all persons from immigration detention before final resolution of their court proceedings.</para><para>This bill is an important measure that upholds the principle of mandatory detention for all unlawful noncitizens under the Migration Act and has been reintroduced to ensure the courts will not create ambiguities in relation to mandatory detention. To avoid doubt, subsection 1 prevents the release, even by a court, of an unlawful noncitizen from detention other than for removal or deportation unless the noncitizen has been granted a visa. It is obvious that the intention of section 196 was to make it clear that there was to be no discretion for any person or court to release from detention any unlawful noncitizen who is lawfully being held in immigration detention.</para><para>This bill ensures that the specific provisions dealing with mandatory detention in the Migration Act cannot be circumvented by the Federal Court of Australia Act 1977, which gives the court the powers to release on interlocutory proceedings. The new bill takes precedence over the Federal Court of Australia Act, which allows the release of noncitizens pending resolution of their status.</para><para>People who are not Australian citizens and enter Australia without a valid visa are called `unauthorised arrivals' and have acted unlawfully by travelling to Australia without a visa according to the Migration Act 1958, section 42. Also, the legislative term for a noncitizen who is in Australia without a valid visa is an `unlawful noncitizen'. An unauthorised arrival, or unlawful noncitizen, might apply to the Australian government for recognition as a refugee. Such a person could then also be called an `asylum seeker'. It should be noted that they are not considered refugees until their claims for protection are assessed against the internationally agreed United Nations 1954 convention and the 1967 protocol relating to the status of refugees and they are accorded such status.</para><para>Unauthorised arrivals in immigration detention are not detained indefinitely. Their time in detention is governed by their progress through the legal and administrative determination process that they engage in, which may include seeking asylum. It should also be noted that applications for protection from people in detention receive priority processing. A number of factors can contribute to extended detention periods, including difficulty in establishing identity, litigation, difficulties in obtaining travel documents and non-cooperation by the detainee.</para><para>Those people found to be refugees who engage Australia's international protection obligations are granted visas and released into the community. It should also be noted that people can leave immigration detention by leaving Australia. Australia does not have a policy of indefinite mandatory detention of asylum seekers. Indeed, the majority of asylum seekers have entered Australia with valid visas and are free in the community while they pursue their claims. Australia does, however, have a policy of mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals and other unlawful noncitizens.</para><para>Australia's entry policies and procedures reflect Australia's sovereign right under international law to control which noncitizens may enter our borders. We must have the capacity to manage the movement of people across our borders in an orderly and efficient manner. This has been and continues to be an important element of Australia's achievement of being a tolerant, multicultural society that values diversity. Without this crucial element, the idea of a managed immigration policy would rapidly become meaningless.</para><para>Australia is seeking to detain people not because they seek asylum but because they have arrived without authorisation. We place in detention people who arrive unlawfully until their claims to remain are determined. In many cases we must also find out who they are, where they are from and whether they have criminal records or health concerns. To do otherwise and let them free into the community is to risk their disappearances, as many other countries have discovered, to their great frustration. If it is determined that a person is a refugee and there are no character concerns they are immediately released into the Australian community.</para><para>Notwithstanding our obligation to detain all unlawful noncitizens the government is very mindful of the cultural sensitivities of those in detention and has given priority to women and children, albeit that they represent a small fraction of the total number. Last financial year, approximately 15 per cent of women and fewer than 10 per cent of children were detained.</para><para>Within the mandatory detention framework, however, the government has implemented innovative approaches to detention for women and children. Alternative detention options outside detention facilities include residential housing projects, foster care arrangements with state child welfare authorities and community care placements for people with special needs. These housing projects enable participants to live in the community in a more relaxed and family friendly atmosphere. All eligible women and children—including single adult females—in all immigration detention facilities have the opportunity to transfer to these supervised residential housing projects, which have been operating since August 2001.</para><para>The government has established residential housing projects in Woomera, Port Hedland and Port Augusta—which confirms the government's commitment to providing alternative detention arrangements for women and children. As at 28 February 2004, 29 women and children were accommodated in residential housing projects in Port Augusta and Port Hedland. While in detention, women and children have access to social, recreational and educational programs, and most children in immigration detention attend external schooling. All women and children in detention are assessed against guidelines for placement in a residential housing project. No woman or child is moved to a residential housing project against their will. Each individual or family can decide whether to take up the opportunity to move to a residential housing project if they are eligible and if places are available.</para><para>As at 27 February 2004, there were only 15 children in mainland immigration detention centres. These children arrived as unauthorised boat arrivals with one or both parents; all are failed asylum seekers and all have challenged decisions in courts or tribunals. Ten children and their mothers were offered alternative accommodation in residential housing projects but declined the offer, and five children and their parents were ineligible due to management difficulties such as behavioural or health issues.</para><para>I remind the House that Labor had hundreds of children behind barbed wire when they were in government. They had no residential housing projects for women and children and no community options. Labor had a higher percentage of children in detention—30 per cent in 1994 compared with this government's figure of seven per cent in 2004. In fact, if Labor were to destroy the Pacific solution, it would mean that hundreds more children would be in detention while they are assessed. I note that Senator Penny Wong has said that Labor will scrap the so-called punitive regime of long-term detention, when she really only wants political gain for herself in relation to failed asylum seekers. Let me remind her that it was a Labor government that introduced the policy in 1994. At that time there were 342 children in immigration detention centres—some 30 per cent of the total number of detainees. As of last week, as I have just stated, there were only 15 children in detention centres in Australia. Overall, the number of children in mandatory detention is down. In fact, children now make up only seven per cent of the total number of detainees—which underscores the fact that the overall numbers are down. This shows the success of the initiatives and measures taken by this government to stop the flow of unauthorised arrivals and to deter people smugglers who attempt to bring people into Australia illegally.</para><para>Mandatory detention remains an integral part of the government's unauthorised arrivals policy. The government believes that it is necessary to ensure, as a matter of public policy, that all unauthorised noncitizens are detained until their status is clarified. This means that they must continue to be detained until they are removed or deported from Australia or until they are granted a visa. Community opinion is not polarised with respect to the government's policy of mandatory detention. The community understand the process of substantiating an unauthorised arrival's bona fides, they stand firm in supporting our policy, and they expect the government to maintain our borders and allow only those people who meet our strict immigration criteria to stay.</para><para>All other migrants to this country have to abide by our immigration criteria, which firmly state and confirm the substantial status of permanent residents and Australian citizens in this country. As my parliamentary colleague, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, has previously stated in this House, our immigration criteria also underscore the lawfulness and the validity of all people who have come to Australia by lawful means.</para><para>The <inline ref="R1982">Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2004</inline> repeals subsections 196(4) and (4A), which were introduced in 2003 to prevent the interlocutory release of specific classes of persons into the community—that is, people of character concern. The repealed sections are substituted with a new subsection 196(4), which has wider application to cover all persons in immigration detention. The new subsection makes it explicitly clear that, unless an unlawful noncitizen is removed from Australia, deported or granted a visa, the noncitizen must be kept in immigration detention. The amendment does not, however, affect the court's powers to finally determine the lawfulness of a person's detention or the lawfulness of the decision or action being challenged. It is intended simply to clarify the existing provisions of the act. It does no more than what the courts have said that the parliament needs to do—that is, make the parliament's intention in relation to immigration detention unmistakably clear. This bill makes parliament's intention unmistakably clear. In summary, the bill implements measures to ensure that the parliament's original intention in relation to immigration detention is clearly spelt out and that the integrity of the mandatory detention provisions of the act is not compromised. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>25809</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It gives me no pleasure to rise to speak today on the <inline ref="R1982">Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2004</inline>, just as it gave me no pleasure to speak on this bill when it came before us on 26 June last year. This is, in reality, an indefinite detention bill. This bill is designed to prevent the release of a `prisoner'—and I use that word advisedly—held in an Australian immigration detention centre, pending a court's final determination of the substantive matter as to the lawfulness of a person's detention or whether a person is an unlawful noncitizen. </para></talk.start><para>Despite what the member for Forrest would have us believe, this is undoubtedly the most heartless, repulsive and inhumane bill that I have had to deal with since being elected to this place in October 2002—and that says something. As the member for Perth has clearly pointed out, the High Court of Australia ruled that immigration detention should not be punitive. Yet there is no doubt that the government, by its action, has instituted a punitive regime. In no way can detention now be seen as merely necessary for immigration processing for entry or deportation. With this bill, the government has sunk to new depths in its abuse of basic human rights and treatment of legitimate and legal asylum seekers in this country. Its action is most likely in conflict with decisions of the High Court and the Federal Court—as the member for Perth went to some pains to point out.</para><para>This bill is being introduced into the House because the previous Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, now the Attorney-General, saw fit in his wisdom to accept on an interim basis some amendments proposed by the Australian Senate to the original bill back in June-July 2003. These were amendments that restricted the impact of the bill, at least in the mind of the then minister, and he told us at the time that he would be bringing it back for more changes after it had been reconsidered by the government. This bill is the result of that reconsideration. As such, it is further proof that the government's support of its beloved mandatory detention regime is threatened by the Australian courts' ability to release men, women and children from Australia's desert prisons and other immigration detention centres.</para><para>Whilst the bill as passed last year in response to the Federal Court Al Masri decision was harsh enough, this bill goes further. It makes it more difficult for Australian courts to intervene to release people from our immigration detention centres, especially those who have no likelihood of finding a visa to another country or who have real fears for their personal safety, and the safety of their families, should they return home. That much is obvious. Unlike the government, however, I, and thousands of other Australians, believe that releasing people from Australia's desert prisons—for that is what an immigration detention centre is; nothing more or less than a prison—is a good idea. We do not believe, as the member for Forrest has just argued, that asylum seekers must be kept in detention outside of those periods when they are required for processing. This is where the government is completely out of step with feeling out there in the wider community.</para><para>The Australian Greens are clearly opposed to mandatory detention. We support the closure of the desert prisons and the facility on Nauru. We support the release of people seeking asylum who are not a threat to the Australian way of life. They must be treated humanely and must not be used by the government as a tool in the campaign to deter people-smuggling. It is clearly unacceptable to maintain this pretence of border protection as the reason for the present harsh mandatory detention regime, a regime which is severely impacting upon the lives of those unfortunate people caught up in it.</para><para>I do not want to repeat my comments of last June, but I will say that they still stand and that, until this government adopts a more reasonable and humane approach to the treatment of asylum seekers, it will continue to be rightfully held in contempt by a significant proportion of the Australian and international community. Frankly, it is disgraceful that we sit here in the comfort of this chamber and pass legislation which will have such a savage impact upon our fellow human beings. It is sickening when the Minister for Foreign Affairs uses question time, as he did today, to tell us about how other nations, such as Great Britain, are following the Australian model and looking towards developing offshore processing centres. It is sickening to hear the government gloat about turning boats full of asylum seekers away from our shores. Answer me this: how can a reasonable and rational assessment of the legitimacy or otherwise of an asylum seeker's status be determined on the high seas?</para><para>The government will undoubtedly be judged harshly by future historians when they look back to this period and deal with issues of justice, human rights and the role we played on the international stage. The government would have us believe that we will be remembered as playing a part in getting rid of Saddam Hussein. That is true, but I would suggest that the scars of the present inhumane mandatory detention regime will remain. I know this because I have spoken with a number of school students on this issue. Believe me, if you think my comments are rather emotive, then you should listen to what some of those students have to say. What they have to say does not mirror what we hear from government ministers and spin doctors. These young students feel ashamed at the way in which we are treating asylum seekers, whether they be men, women or children—just as I feel ashamed.</para><para>My worst fears about how we are treating asylum seekers were realised when I visited Villawood detention centre near Sydney last year. There I met a man who had been in detention for six years. There I met a young boy who had been in detention since the age of 15. He was approaching 20 and had spent the best years of his youth behind the razor wire. Here was an innocent young man whose life in Australia had been made hell by this government. He was scarred for life.</para><para>This is what we are dealing with here: real people; men, women and children, just like us. On numerous occasions I have condemned the government's approach to asylum seekers, and I do so once again here today. I do so for good reason. This time, though, I want to make it a bit more personal, for perhaps that is the only way in which the government will wake up to itself. I can only hope that it will become harder, with time, for the government to continue to hide behind legalese, statistics and spin, rather than acknowledge the harm that is caused by the detention of over 1,000 people in Australia's immigration prisons. I hope it will become harder to talk of those people in alienating terms such as `illegal noncitizens', especially when we turn to the circumstances of individuals whose interests will be directly affected by the passage of this bill.</para><para>In a debate dealing with mandatory detention, so-called queue jumpers and people bringing about their own detention by coming to Australia without appropriate papers, it might be worth while to consider the plight of one real, flesh and blood victim of Australia's immigration detention system. I would like to speak about Baxter immigration detention facility detainee No. 340. His real name is Muhammad Qasim.</para><para>I spoke with Muhammad by phone today from Baxter. He told me that he had been in every detention centre in Australia, except Villawood, over the last five years and five months. I asked him how old he was. He replied that he was not sure, as time is interminable in detention and one day is like a year. I know he is 29, though he said he felt like he was 100. He told me that he just wants to get out of detention and had asked to be repatriated—somewhere, anywhere—some eight months ago. But still he remains in detention—in prison—thanks to this government.</para><para>How can anyone on the other side of the House condone such treatment? This young man has been held in detention in Australian for five years and five months, without any likelihood of release. The previous speaker, the member for Forrest, said that all these people will be released. But there are people such as Mr Qasim who do not have any likelihood of any release, because of their circumstances. And this is nothing less than criminal on the part of the government.</para><para>According to the latest ABS statistics, during 2003 there were seven people in Australia convicted of murder who received terms of five to 10 years. Likewise, there were 367 people convicted of assault and 818 convicted of sexual assault who received similar sentences of five to 10 years. Has Mr Qasim been found guilty of murder or rape? No; yet his sentence has been five years and five months. His crime was to come to Australia in search of asylum, an action which is not illegal under Australian or international law. Nevertheless, he is being treated by the government in the same manner as the aforementioned murderers and rapists.</para><para>This is nothing less than disgraceful. Nothing that any minister or member on the other side of the House says can change this. I would like to read a section from the letter Mr Qasim sent to me on 20 January this year. It may help honourable members to better understand the consequences of the bill now before us. It reads:</para><quote><para>Dear Mr Organ</para><para>My name is Muhammad Qasim ... As I write this letter, I have been held in immigration detention in Australia for five years and four months, and it seems I have no choice but to spend the rest of my life in detention. I am writing to you in the hope that you will listen to my story, understand my plight, and please, if you can, assist me to find some solution.</para><para>I was born in the disputed region of Kashmir in India on 14 May 1974. When I was a young child, my father was murdered by the security forces because of his peaceful political activities, and my mother died soon afterwards. As a young man, my own peaceful opposition to the government's brutal policies in our region led to me being detained and tortured by the security forces, and after some years in hiding and on the run, it became necessary for me to flee my country.</para><para>I passed through Singapore and Papua New Guinea on my way to Australia, but these were places where I had no legal right to remain and no way to have my claim for asylum heard.</para><para>I arrived in Australia on 9 September 1998. The delegate of the Minister for Immigration who assessed my claim accepted that I was an Indian citizen from Kashmir, and also accepted that I had been tortured, but she did not believe that I faced a risk of persecution. On 20 October 1998 my application for a protection visa was refused. I appealed to the Refugee Review Tribunal, but on 11 January 1999 my refusal was upheld by the single tribunal member who reviewed my case.</para><para>Since January 1999, 1 have pursued no further appeals, so I have been liable for removal from Australia. I believe that I would face the risk of arrest and torture if I returned to India, but I would prefer that possibility rather than dying in detention in Australia. However, for five years now, I have remained imprisoned here. Because I have no passport, birth certificate, or other official document from India, and because I was an orphan unable to afford any formal education, the Indian government has so far refused to accept the fact that I am a citizen of that country.</para><para>In January 1999, the Department of Immigration lodged an application for travel documents with the Indian High Commission in Canberra. However, it was not until August of 2003 that the Department conducted a language analysis test and an interview to collect background information, in order to provide more evidence of my Indian citizenship. I would have been happy to answer the questions that were put to me in this interview at any time, and I do not understand why it has taken the Department five years to do this.</para><para>In any case, I am afraid that the Indian authorities will continue to refuse to provide travel documents to me. The state government of Jammu and Kashmir is busy dealing with the ongoing conflict there, and might not have the resources to make time-consuming investigations to establish my identity. Also, because there are 20 million people living illegally in India who come from neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, it is difficult to persuade the Indian authorities to accept anyone as a citizen without definite proof.</para><para>I have applied to almost 80 countries, asking if they will accept me, but I have received no positive replies.</para><para>So far I have endured five years and four months in detention. Living without the freedoms that ordinary people take for granted is very difficult. The conditions of detention involve small humiliations every day, and at times we are subject to great injustice, but the worst thing is having no certainty about when my imprisonment will end. Even a criminal knows the length of his sentence, whether it is long or short, but I have no such comfort.</para><para>In April 2003, a Full Bench of the Federal Court ruled that it was not lawful to keep rejected asylum seekers detained if there is no real prospect of removing them from Australia. However, the Minister for Immigration has appealed that decision to the High Court. I do not know which way the High Court will decide this question, but the lawyer for the Minister argued before the Court that the government should have the power to keep people in immigration detention for the rest of their life.</para><para>What's more, even if the government does not succeed in its appeal, that would mean people who could not be removed from Australia would be released into the community with no visa, and no rights at all, obliged to live on charity. The courts might order our release, but they could not give us the right to work and support ourselves with dignity.</para><para>Therefore, I am writing to you to ask that you seek a real, practical solution to the problem faced by me, and by others who have spent many years in detention and whose countries will not accept them. We are human beings, and we need to live in freedom, and with dignity. To the nation that provides me with these things, I can only offer my hard work, my loyalty, and my lifelong esteem and gratitude.</para><para>If you require more information about my case, please contact me. Thank you for taking this matter into your consideration. I look forward to your reply.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>Muhammad (Peter) Qasim</para><para>ID Number: BX 340</para></quote><para>What linguistic gymnastics will the government offer in defence of its policy that allows such a disgraceful set of circumstances as outlined by Mr Qasim to continue to occur? The government will prattle on about border protection while Mr Qasim and others waste away in a desert prison, with no solution from the government forthcoming, visa or not. Given the circumstances of Mr Qasim and the more than 1,000 individuals like him, I cannot in all conscience support this bill, for it is clear that it will further impact upon his few remaining rights and will leave him to perhaps rot forever in our immigration detention centres.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>25813</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The amendments to the Migration Act are intended to deny interlocutory relief for unlawful noncitizens held in immigration detention. The <inline ref="R1982">Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2004</inline> specifically seeks to amend section 196 of the act, which states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1) An unlawful non-citizen detained under section 189 must be kept in immigration detention until he or she is:</para><para>(a) removed from Australia under section 198 or 199; or</para><para>(b) deported under section 200; or</para><para>(c) granted a visa.</para></quote><para>The provisions result from a line of authority flowing from the courts in which exceptions to the general rule permit interlocutory release of detainees, whilst the visa applicant's status as a lawful or unlawful noncitizen is determined.</para><para>This bill is opposed by all parties other than the coalition—that is, the Australian Labor Party, the Greens and the Australian Democrats are in opposition to this bill. Why are we in opposition to this bill? The government is responding properly to the directions of the courts in flagging legal issues that are in need of redress. In this case, a string of court-made decisions reflects gaps in the statutory intent of section 196 which continue to permit the courts from handing down interlocutory orders where a visa applicant's lawful or unlawful status is determined. These court cases are of note: Al Masri v. Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 1009; M276/2003; Woolley &amp; Anor, Ex parte—Re (a High Court decision); and, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v. VFAD (FCA, 9 December 2002).</para><para>I now wish to briefly summarise the authority of these three judgments, which comprise two Federal Court decisions and one High Court decision. Al Masri is authority for the proposition that a failed asylum seeker may be released by court order where it is found that his or her detention has become unlawful, punitive detention. M276 is authority for the proposition that the present scheme of mandatory detention is unconstitutional insofar as the period of detention is indeterminate—specifically in relation to children—and, as the judgment says, `is not reasonably capable of being necessary'. VFAD is authority for the proposition that a visa applicant is entitled to interlocutory relief—that being release from immigration detention—where it is shown that the unlawfulness of a person's detention is in question.</para><para>These instances where interlocutory relief may be afforded are not closed. There is a string of powers under which a court may intervene. The existing bill is designed to address judicial review proceedings where interlocutory relief may be granted. However, these are not the only grounds. As was shown in case M276, release on grounds of unconstitutionality may also be raised. Equally, there are other grounds that may fall within the purview of the courts, including errors of law and the vast morass of existing subordinate immigration legislation, including the Migration Regulations, PAMS, ministerial series instructions, or MSIs—specifi-cally MSI 388, which deals with bridging visas—and ministerial directions and so forth.</para><para>I mention immigration by-laws because there is already a significant and very complex body of subordinate immigration legislation dealing with the release of unlawful noncitizens by the lawful application of bridging visa class E. The existing by-laws deal with the permissible release from detention of unlawful noncitizens who enter the migration zone. This raises a further complication to the existing proposed amendments to section 196 in that there are two groups of unlawful noncitizens to which this bill we are debating this evening may apply. These are the unlawful noncitizens who seek protection visas and other detainees who are unlawful for reasons other than protection visa applications.</para><para>I specifically refer to section 72 of the Migration Act, which relates to eligible noncitizens who have been immigration cleared. Subsection 72(2)(a) prescribes that the minister may make determinations under paragraph (1)(c) that a noncitizen is an eligible noncitizen if the noncitizen was an unlawful noncitizen when he or she entered the migration zone. The minister has issued directions and instructions relevant to this power. Migration Regulation 2.20 elaborates on the section 72 provision by further prescribing grounds upon which an eligible noncitizen may be entitled to a bridging visa. The bridging visa issued to eligible noncitizens who are protection visa applicants is a subclass 051 visa. This visa is prescribed in schedule 2 of the Migration Regulations 1994.</para><para>I question here in the House tonight whether the government has adequately reviewed the entirety of the migration law with respect to this bill. I note that the law already makes provision for the release of unlawful noncitizens who are mentally or physically sick, too young, too old, infirm or otherwise suffering harm from protracted detention. The bill anticipates closing the expansion of judge-made law in determinations that may further compromise the efficacy of section 196 on grounds of unconstitutionality, use of the provision for de jure punitive intent, or otherwise where the unlawfulness of the person is in question.</para><para>In response to this approach, I note, as I have done on previous occasions in this House, the draconian intent of this government in drafting legislation which takes a bloody-minded approach to dealing with immigration policy matters. When the government is challenged in terms of border protection, terrorism, other criminality or otherwise opportunistic conduct of prospective arrivals, the way it reacts is to attack the natural justice and procedural fairness rights of these people. I have also mentioned before in this House, when I have been speaking on migration bills, other amendments to the Migration Act which demonstrate a systematic disregard by the government for natural law and, with it, natural justice and procedural fairness. Regarding a previous bill, I referred to the provisions of subsection 501(3), which says that where a decision of the minister is made to refuse to grant a visa or cancel a visa that has been granted, subsection (5) prescribes that the rules of natural justice and the code of procedure set out in subdivision AB of division 3 of part 2 do not apply to a decision made under subsection (3).</para><para>Has it ever occurred to the government that the act of erasing natural justice is precisely what those who oppose freedom want to happen? The saying `The more you tighten the grip, the more a thing slips away' is appropriate here. Tightening the loopholes by restricting the equitable remedies that are available to the Federal Court and High Court fails to address the broader remedies already available at law. So it is clear that in this legislation the government is failing in its understanding of the problem. The problem is how to maintain the integrity of a detention regime in order to prevent persons escaping into the community, thus compromising Australia's border protection and other security, market, national and public interests.</para><para>The solution, I believe, is to be found in recognising the intrinsic wrongfulness of an action of a person who is otherwise not a bona fide applicant and who is in detention for reasons that were touched upon in the M276 case, which I spoke about earlier. In that case the visa applicant, an Afghani national, could not be compelled to return to Afghanistan because Australia had at that time no agreement with the Afghani government for the removal of Afghani citizens from Australia. I put to the government that the issues raised in M276 more properly raise matters going to immigration by-laws dealing with extraction procedures, including those dealing with preparation for removal, rather than depend on reciprocal arrangements with other governments on the return of their citizens. The current administrative procedures are that such persons who refuse to voluntarily leave Australia's immigration detention remain in detention for an indeterminate period. That is unacceptable. </para><para>Again there is a substantial body of by-laws that deals with the extraction of persons from Australia. I use the word `extraction' to distinguish between removal other than deportation, which deals with persons who otherwise have a criminal record, extradition or other prescribed arrangements with other governments. This matter in turn raises other ancillary but very important issues of issuance, travel documents and other preparatory documents necessary for the removal of unlawful noncitizens from Australia. As immigration detention team officers will tell you, as they have told me, this field of law is a science in itself. Uncooperative detainees who refuse to sign documents, refuse to obtain travel documents or simply refuse to cooperate find that these things all lead to protracted periods of detention. That is a fact.</para><para>Often the identity of a detainee cannot be determined. We read about those cases every day in the media. Often the country from which a detainee comes either does not recognise these people as citizens of their country or in some cases—as with Kosovo, Afghanistan or the former Soviet Union—the country does not exist or no longer exists. All these cases raise ancillary but related issues of statelessness and further blur the boundaries of migration law, cumulatively leading to protracted periods of detention. It would be a worthwhile exercise to draft law that clarifies the legal implications of people who will not or cannot obtain valid travel documents, which leads to a stalemate situation for extraction, rather than have this current government's limbic approach to extinguishing the judiciary's rightful and time-honoured recourse to equitable remedies in order to rectify impasses of the law.</para><para>I remind this House of a time-honoured maximum: where the common law fails, let equity prevail. The very reason why we are here debating this bill this evening is that the Federal Court and High Court of Australia have required recourse to the equitable remedies founded in our ecclesiastical courts which step into the common law and statutory law regime in situations where the statutory and common law have failed. It is the equitable jurisdiction which applies in the award of interlocutory relief in a system that is clearly not working. The remedy put by the government is to further extinguish the natural law in Australia, making the regime more punitive in the hope that this will gain public appeal. In reality, what this regime will do is create further festering distress for the many detainees and Australians who see the rising horror of protracted detention and, with it, the unnecessary suffering of people both inside and outside the detention centres. </para><para>In conclusion, it is legislation like this with its assault on natural law that will lead the Australian people when they vote—and that will be on either 18 September, if it is a double-dissolution election to get the media ownership law in place, or 30 October, if it is a general election. I notice that the member for North Sydney is laughing.

I can tell you that that is the mood of my electorate, and this is reflected in the so-called values in this bill that we are debating here tonight. People have had a gutful. They have had enough. They have said, `We want to have a change of government.' I have no doubt that when the gun goes off and we have the election—and you can see it here already, because the Prime Minister is clearly rattled; he is spending a lot of money at the moment in the anticipation that there is going to be an election this year; there could be an election at any time—it is bills like this that will influence people in my electorate to run to the ballot box on election day and grab the Labor how-to-vote card and chuck this government out. That is what should happen, and the member for North Sydney knows that. That will provide other opportunities for him and Mr Turnbull when he arrives. We will wait and see what develops, because this will be a very interesting period in Australia's political history. We look forward to seeing the new member for Wentworth when he arrives here on 30 October or 18 September.

Their figures are very misleading and very untruthful. In fact, they are more than untruthful—they are down right deceitful. There were 15 boat children in detention centres in mainland Australia as unauthorised arrivals with one or both parents as at 12 February 2004. All of them were failed asylum seekers. They had gone through the normal channels and had failed in their appeal for asylum. All have challenge decisions in courts or tribunals. Ten of them and their mothers were offered alternative accommodation in residential housing projects, but they declined those offers, and five of the children and their parents were ineligible due to difficulties in management processes, including some health issues and some behavioural problems. </para><para>There are other children in detention. There are 37 children with compliance cases—usually short term—and there are 15 children on Christmas Island and 83 children on Nauru. They are not in Australia, and they are certainly not behind barbed wire. It is also important for the member for Lowe's information to emphasise that these children do have access to education and recreation. I have visited, in my capacity as chair of the migration committee, a number of these detention centres. A number of the school children have external schooling, except for one who attends lessons within the centre. The children also have access to excursions such as movies, discos, swimming, picnics, camping, sightseeing and community events. I also emphasise—particularly when Labor talks about the Pacific solution—that there are hundreds more children who have access to these services.</para><para>One of the things that this government has had a very strong record in and has been very instrumental in is introducing the residential housing project. These residential housing projects exist in Woomera, Port Hedland and Port Augusta. They confirm the government's commitment to providing alternative detention arrangements for women and children. Everyone would agree that wherever possible women and children should not be in detention centres. I strongly agree with that. On 27 February 2004, there were 29 women and children in residential housing projects in Port Augusta and Port Hedland. I have been to those projects, and the people are very well accommodated in the community. They are able to do their own cooking and shopping, and they are able to live, as best as possible, in a very homelike environment.</para><para>But let us not underestimate this: they are in detention. The Labor Party would have us release anyone in a detention centre out into the community. Residential housing projects provide a more domestic environment. It is particularly important in many cultures for people to be able to prepare meals themselves and have the freedom to do their own cooking and shopping. They are also able to participate in community activities. Listening to some of the previous speakers, one would think that they were not free to engage in many of the community events that occur or in day-to-day activities like shopping et cetera.</para><para>Participation in the residential housing projects is voluntary; each individual family can decide whether they want to take up that option. Where there are concerns about the protection and welfare of a child, state agencies play a key role in the child's ongoing care and management. If a state child welfare agency recommends separation from parents, that advice is certainly accepted to the extent that it is possible within a legal framework. </para><para>Everyone in detention has different and special needs and, wherever possible, the accommodation of the residential housing program is appropriate. If the department finds that it is not appropriate they look at a number of detention options. When a child is in detention, some of the options that are available include foster care under the supervision of the state child welfare authorities or relatives. Also, there may be cases where alternative detention needs to be looked at under the auspices of a community organisation. But it is always in consultation with the Immigration Detention Advisory Group. The department provides discussions with community groups on alternative detention options and they are able to provide suitable care arrangements for detainees eligible for the granting of bridging visa E, subclass 051. As I mentioned earlier, while in detention women and children have access to a number of social, recreational and educational programs, and most children in immigration detention attend external schooling.</para><para>The reason these measures have been put in place is that there have been a number of unauthorised arrivals. In the year 2002-03 there were no boat arrivals on the Australian mainland, but there had been a significant number of boat arrivals previously, and the reduction has occurred as a result of the legislation that has been introduced. Some of the legislative changes have enabled certain parts of the Australian territory to be excised from the migration zone and those who arrive offshore without lawful authority are excluded from applying for any visa. The legislation provides the discretion to detain people in those offshore places or to move them to a declared safe country, such as Nauru, where their claims and their refugee status can be determined. From 26 August 2001 to 30 June 2002, there were 2,372 unauthorised boat arrivals at offshore excised places. This compares with 4,049 in Australia in the period from the year 2000 to the end of June 2001. From July 2001 to 15 September 2001, there were 1,277 unauthorised boat arrivals. This compares to 390 people in the period from July to September 2000.</para><para>It is important that the bill recognises and amends the Migration Act 1958 to put it beyond any doubt that an unlawful noncitizen must be kept in immigration detention unless a court makes a final determination that the detention is unlawful or that the person is an unlawful noncitizen. This bill adds a new subsection to section 196 of Migration Act 1958 that clarifies the parliament's intention that an unlawful noncitizen is only to be released from immigration detention in the circumstances as specified in section 196.</para><para>The bill is substantially the same as the Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2003. It ultimately was passed with amendments which limited its scope to stop courts ordering interlocutory release of persons of character concern. It is important that the bill cover broader concerns on the release of all persons from immigration detention centres before the final resolution of their court proceedings. The bill is an important measure in upholding the principles of mandatory detention for all unlawful noncitizens under the Migration Act. Subsection 196(1) of the act provides that an unlawful noncitizen who is detained under section 189 must be kept in immigration detention until he or she is removed from Australia, deported or granted a visa. Subsection 196(3) makes it clear that subsection 196(1) prevents a court from releasing an unlawful noncitizen from immigration detention unless the noncitizen has been granted a visa. </para><para>Despite the current provisions relating to immigration detention, there has been a series of cases in which the Federal Court has ordered interlocutory release of detainees prior to the resolution of their substantive court proceedings, and the amendments uphold division 7, part 2 of the act in relation to the mandatory detention of certain unlawful noncitizens. The bill also seeks to prevent the release of a detainee from immigration detention pending a court's final determination of the substantive matter as to the lawfulness of the person's detention—whether the person is an unlawful noncitizen. It does not affect the jurisdiction of any court to conclusively determine any application made to the court, including an application for review of a decision to refuse or grant or cancel a visa or make appropriate orders.</para><para>This is a very important bill. The residential housing programs have been working well. As of 27 February 2004, there were only 15 children in mainland immigration detention centres who arrived as unauthorised boat arrivals. From my experience of visiting these facilities, these children are very well cared for. It is an alternative to the detention centre, and I did note that many of the children and their mothers were quite happy in residential housing programs. They are free to come and go from the residential housing projects to the detention centre at any time. It is not compulsory; it is up to the family whether they decide that they want to take up that alternative accommodation. Currently 49 per cent of women and children are detained as a result of compliance action.</para><para>The government continues to develop and implement innovative approaches for women and children in detention. I believe that the residential housing programs will be developed even further and will be expanded. A lot of interstate cooperation is also required, particularly in foster care arrangements and areas of schooling. I know that arrangements with the states will continue to improve. There are also community care placements for people with special needs.</para><para>I feel that this bill addresses a very important issue—an issue of ensuring that we provide alternative arrangements for women and children. I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending what the bill proposes. It is a difficult area, as I mentioned earlier. It is absolutely and unmistakably an area that always arouses emotion in the community. But we do ensure that genuine refugees are given every possible form of assistance. Any visit to the Refugee Review Tribunal will reassure people that that is the case. I have visited the Refugee Review Tribunal on many occasions and seen exactly what is provided for people making applications. I have absolutely no hesitation in commending the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>25820</page.no><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name><name.id>YU5</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1831">Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2004</inline> is designed to further inhibit the power of the courts to order the release from detention of noncitizens who are in Australia in an unauthorised way. It is designed to strengthen the government's mandatory detention regime with respect to asylum seekers and people who, in the eyes of the government, are unauthorised illegal migrants. It is further turning the screws on people in detention and further reducing the power of the courts to order interim release pending the determination of final legal proceedings with respect to the status of people who are in detention.</para></talk.start><para>The legislation is supposedly directed at those who are the subject of being returned pending a final decision. But there are apparently some legal experts who claim that it could even affect the situation which arose in the Al Masri case, where the court released a failed asylum seeker who simply was unable to return home to his country of origin because he was Palestinian. His detention was overturned by the court on the grounds that it had in effect become punitive detention and that it had become unlawful.</para><para>Regardless of the ambit of what the legislation is ultimately going to achieve, there is no question that what it is about is reinforcing the brutal and punitive nature of the government's mandatory detention regime and ensuring that people who arrive in Australia seeking asylum are faced with the prospect of indefinite detention in circumstances that are little different to the imprisonment that is imposed on serious criminals.</para><para>Under the regime that operates in this country, asylum seekers who arrive in Australia are put behind razor wire. They are put in detention centres that are, in some cases, out in the middle of nowhere and are designed in such a way that they are unable to see the outside world. In these detention centres there is a sense of being closed in and of being prevented from connecting with the outside world, even in some of the detention centres in the major cities—like Maribyrnong detention centre, which is very close to my electorate. When you are in that detention centre you have a very powerful sense of separation from the outside world. When you enter the detention centre there is a whole array of doors and electronic processes that are basically the same as a modern prison.</para><para>As is conceded by the member for Petrie, as part of the regime we still have significant numbers of children in detention, including children who were born in detention. We have poor accountability in the system. There has been an array of scandals over recent years associated with the management of the various detention centres by Australian Correctional Management. Due to the fact that that process has been privatised by the Howard government, you do not have direct government administration of detention centres and you therefore do not have the degree of accountability that inevitably is associated with direct government administration.</para><para>Most significant of all with the detention centres in which asylum seekers are held is the fact that you have the problem of effective indefinite sentence. You have the situation where people are held in detention—effectively imprisoned—with no indication of what the future holds for them, no idea of how long they will be in detention and no idea where they are going to end up. That is an enormously psychologically powerful and effective way of destroying people. The asylum seekers I have spoken to who have experienced detention or are in detention clearly indicate that that complete hopelessness—that lack of a sense of the future, possible release or when relief will come and they will be able to participate in any kind of normal life—has an enormously powerful psychological impact on people. That is why so many people in detention centres have engaged in acts of self-harm. That is why so many people in detention centres have done things that at one angle look relatively extreme. It is because of the psychological impact of not only being imprisoned but also having no idea how long that imprisonment will be for and when it will be terminated. On top of that is the fact that these people have committed no crime.</para><para>It is worth pausing for a moment to think about the people who are in detention centres in Australia, the people on whom this debate has focused—asylum seekers, predominantly boat people. Who are these people? Why are they here? What are their aspirations? Statistically, it has been found that they are mostly refugees, people who have been fleeing genuine threats of persecution, torture and death. They are people, in many cases, whose close family members have been murdered. They often flee their countries of origin with no idea of where their family is and with no capacity to discover what has happened to their loved ones. Obviously not all of those people are in that category, but the outcome of refugee applications certainly indicates that many of them are ultimately determined to be in that category.</para><para>Those people who are not determined to be in that category, failed asylum seekers, end up in detention for lengthy periods of time and in many cases are unable to return to their countries of origin. What crime have they committed? Why are they in Australia? The worst that can be said of these people, almost invariably, is that they are seeking a better life for themselves and their families. Even regarding those people who can be described only as economic refugees or economic migrants the worst that can be said is that they come from very poor countries with very limited opportunities and that by coming to Australia they hope to achieve a better life and better opportunities for themselves and their families. Those aspirations are nearly universal in our own society and I find it hard to condemn them on the part of anybody, be they Australians or people seeking to come to Australia.</para><para>Those are the kinds of people that we are dealing with. Yet when we hear both at first hand and second hand of the experiences of people in indefinite detention and the impact that it can have on young children—who can become withdrawn and suffer a whole range of physical and psychological illnesses and damage—we have to ask ourselves a very fundamental question: why do we treat in this way human beings whose sole aim is to improve their own lives and the lives of their families and who have committed no crime? Why does our society do this?</para><para>The Victorian Foundation for the Survivors of Torture, which has long been present in my electorate and is run by superb and very dedicated people like Paris Aristotle, is a good source of information about these issues. When you talk to the people who are directly involved in helping refugees who have come to this country fleeing the threat of persecution and torture, you get some sense of the life experiences that many of these refugees have had, of the threats that they have faced in their countries of origin and the reasons why they seek to come to a country like Australia. In many cases they have had life experiences that are so extreme and appalling that we can barely imagine them. In many of these cases, refugee status is achieved correctly, but not in all. There are plenty of people who fail to get refugee status for one reason or another. When you hear the stories of these failed asylum seekers and you understand what they have been through and what they faced in their home countries, it is very difficult to look them in the eye and say, `We have no place for you in our country.'</para><para>I understand that we as a nation cannot let everybody in. Clearly we cannot have an open door policy, nor should we. We have a range of fundamental national interest questions that have to be considered in determining how people come to this country—whether or not they are allowed to stay permanently and in what circumstances. But the vilification by this government of entire groups of people, such as asylum seekers and boat people, who are guilty of nothing worse than seeking a better life and better economic opportunities for themselves and their children is something that I have found extremely difficult to stomach over recent years. We do have issues to deal with and matters to debate regarding how to deal with people who enter Australia in an unauthorised way, people who overstay their visas and illegal migrants who work. These are legitimate issues. There are a range of matters that we all have to deal with, and they are a legitimate subject for debate. There are understandable differences of view as to how hard we as a society ought to be in seeking to regulate these matters.</para><para>But the one thing in these debates that in my opinion has been simply beyond the pale and beneath contempt is the persistent and vicious vilification of entire groups and classes of people on the basis of who they are, not what they have done. They are vilified not for any crimes or offences they may have committed, but simply for their aspirations. The bad behaviour of particular individuals has been by implication attributed to entire groups. In the eyes of the Howard government, all asylum seekers—all the so-called boat people—are tarred with the misdeeds of a small number of individuals who may fit that description. The acts of particular individuals have been attributed to entire groups of people in the public domain in order to vilify those people and condemn them as a group in the eyes of the Australian community.</para><para>We all remember phrases like `we don't want these sorts of people in Australia' and the scandal of the `children overboard'. But the point that I think has been missed by many commentators in the debate about the `children overboard' scandal is what happened immediately after it was exposed. What did the Howard government—in particular the Prime Minister and the then minister for immigration—do when it finally became clear that the `children overboard' story was simply a fiction? They came into the parliament and, instead of apologising and indicating clearly that they were mistaken and that it was wrong for them to vilify entire groups of people on the basis of what was subsequently demonstrated to be nonexistent evidence about the supposed acts of one or two, they immediately sought to vilify and condemn the same entire groups of people based on the other acts attributed to one or two individuals.</para><para>So the minister for immigration came into the parliament and started to regale us with a variety of stories about particular asylum seekers who had sought to sabotage boats, even to deliberately try and sink boats, in order to force the hand of the Australian government. Not only did the government not retreat from the appalling slander of the `children overboard' story and not only did they not apologise for the group vilification—the guilt by association—that they had pursued and imposed on hundreds of people based on the alleged acts of a couple of people that ultimately turned out not to have occurred, but as soon as that was exposed they then moved on to do exactly the same thing with respect to other alleged acts—the same thing. They attributed the misbehaviour of a handful of people, assuming that it might have happened, to all people in the same category.</para><para>If you are on a boat with 300 or 400 people and a couple of people seek to disable the engines for some tactical purpose, it is automatically assumed that you are equally guilty of that action and equally responsible for it. This from the party of individual responsibility. This from the Liberal party—the party that purports to uphold the rights and responsibilities of the individual in our society: vilifying whole groups of people based on the alleged acts of particular individuals.</para><para>Added to that has been a consistent pattern of seeking to ensure that the Australian people cannot connect with asylum seekers in any kind of natural or human way. There have been consistent efforts to ensure that the media cannot portray boat people as human beings, that no inconvenient pictures of young mothers with small children in their arms find their way into the media and that there is no way for ordinary Australian citizens to actually see asylum seekers for what they are: ordinary people from different countries and poor countries who seek nothing more than to escape the threats they have experienced and to get a better, safer life in Australia. All of this is in order to manipulate racist sentiments in the Australian community for political gain. That is the thing that I simply cannot accept.</para><para>I can accept that there is a legitimate debate about how to arrange our laws with respect to people who arrive in an unauthorised way. We do have to protect our borders. We do have to ensure that we know who is coming into Australia and in what way—that is all legitimate. There will be different views on that. I disagree with the government on many of them and the Labor Party disagrees with the government on many of them. What I cannot accept is the appalling vilification of innocent people for the purposes of political gain—for the purposes of arousing some of the darkest passions in the Australian community in order to achieve the political gain that would enable the Howard government to be re-elected.</para><para>It could be said, and I think it is probably correct, that to some extent this strategy is now breaking down. There are signs of quiet softening on the part of the government. In fact, some of comments of the member for Petrie indicate that the government is quietly trying to reduce the number of children in detention. That at least is an improvement. In circumstances where asylum seekers have been exposed to the Australian community—in the case of temporary protection visa holders, they are admitted refugees; they are just not given the same status as others who make successful refugee applications—it is good to see that, where those people have been in the community working in many parts of rural Australia, the response from those communities has been powerful and positive. From conservative communities—in many cases communities where there are not many people from a non-English-speaking background—the response has been powerful and positive: `These are good people. We would like them to stay. They work hard and contribute to our community.' To the great credit of one or two members of the government, such as the members for Mallee and Riverina, those views are starting to be reflected in the views being put in the parliament and in the party room.</para><para>There is a debate about Australia's population and about how we will grow as a nation and what role immigration will play. I am a high-immigration person. I think that immigration has been absolutely fundamental to the building of Australia. I think that, of all the decisions that have been made by politicians in this nation over the past 100 years or so, there have been few of greater significance than that taken by Arthur Calwell and Ben Chifley in the post-war era to open Australia to mass non-English-speaking immigration. It has fundamentally changed and improved our society. I think we need to stick to that approach and that means welcoming people who are refugees. It means welcoming those who are seeking the opportunity to make a better life, because, overwhelmingly, people who come to Australia with those objectives will contribute enormously to our community.</para><para>Labor believe that we should restrict the role of mandatory detention, that we should have a 90-day period for the purposes of health, security and identity checks and that, thereafter, any further detention in that regard should be subject to an automatic monthly review by an independent expert committee, so there is hope—there is a way out—for people who are detained. We believe the government, not dubious private companies, should administer the detention centres. Most of all, we will not engage in the kind of vilification that has been the hallmark of the Howard government's approach to these issues.</para><para>There will be a day of reckoning in Australia about the recent history of our treatment of asylum seekers. It will be similar to the cathartic experiences in the stories of the stolen generation. The time will come when huge numbers of Australians, many more than is currently the case, start asking: why did we treat innocent people and small children this way? There will be a day of reckoning. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>25825</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I listened with great interest to the member for Melbourne and I commend him on the tone of his contribution. I also have some brief comments to make in my opposition to the <inline ref="R1982">Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2004</inline>. I believe it is no more than a cynical political exercise by the government designed to get asylum seekers branded illegal entrants and get the issue of border security back on the agenda for the election. How anyone describing their philosophy as liberal can countenance such legislation is a mystery to me. I have heard in recent weeks grave concern expressed by many people who support this government on other policy platforms; they feel abhorrence over this policy and its results in recent years. Notwithstanding the security issues that they are concerned about, they can separate—and quite easily separate—the issues of security and the treatment of people as human beings seeking a better way of life.</para></talk.start><para>In September last year the Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2003 was passed by this parliament, having been successfully and fairly amended by the Senate. The 2003 bill was the government's reaction to Federal Court decisions such as in the Al Masri case, where the court ordered that a TPV applicant who had agreed to return home be released from detention because at that time passage through three of six countries bordering his homeland had been denied, with the remaining three still under negotiation. The court found that this person could not be detained indefinitely until the repatriation process was sorted out and his return home could be ordered, and therefore his detention was unlawful. The court ordered his release. This was an interlocutory order, because his release was ordered before a final decision about his fate had been made.</para><para>The 2003 bill sought to prevent the Australian courts from ordering the interlocutory release from immigration detention of people determined to be unlawful noncitizens. This was to apply to all people in detention: those who had breached the conditions of their visas, those who were deemed to be of character concern and those detained while seeking asylum. The government's argument then was cloaked in terms of protecting the Australian community from criminal, undesirable and illegal immigrants, including asylum seekers—again paying no mind to the fact that it is not illegal to seek asylum.</para><para>The parliamentary process rightly saw the bill amended so that the exemption from interlocutory release orders could be applied only to those of character concern—for example, those who breached their visa conditions by overstaying or criminal activity—rather than all so-called unlawful noncitizens, people who in the vast number of cases arrived by plane and not by boat. This effectively meant that the court could still order the interim release of asylum seekers applying for temporary protection or other visas if the court decided this was appropriate under the circumstances of a particular case. The government's argument for the protection of the community meant that the minister backed himself into a corner and had to accept the Senate's amendments, and the parliamentary process thus delivered a fair piece of legislation.</para><para>This 2004 amendment to the Migration Act delivers on the minister's promise that he would introduce a new bill to ensure the exemption from interlocutory release was applied to all unlawful noncitizens. Never mind the fact that parliament has already thoroughly debated, and decided to exclude, this particular amendment to the Migration Act, and never mind the democratic principle of the separation of powers. The government do not trust the democratic parliamentary process, it seems, and they do not trust the courts. It is not the role of the parliament to unquestioningly support government policy, nor is it the role of the courts to unquestioningly implement it. The motivation for the 2003 bill was to stop the courts undermining the government's tough stance on border security and asylum seekers. The effect of the 2003 bill being passed with amendment was that our laws to deal with criminal and other illegal activity were improved, and our obligation under international law that refugees should not be treated as criminals was therefore preserved.</para><para>As the previous speaker, the member for Melbourne, said, the psychological damage done to women and children in our detention centres in recent years is a disgrace. Notwithstanding his comments about the moves that have been made after significant and overwhelming public pressure for a better process for women and children—for some to be placed outside those outback camps—our detention centre process in recent years has been a disgrace, a shame and a travesty of human rights.</para><para>Rather than debating an amendment that the parliament decided to reject five months ago, we should be looking at ways to improve our system of dealing with asylum seekers. A system that results in detention for periods of one, two or three years, or indefinitely—which was the potential outcome of the Al Masri case—is a flawed system, to put it mildly. We should be looking at separating asylum seekers from other immigration detainees and dealing with them in an entirely different system, recognising our international obligations. We should be thinking in terms of faster and more efficient processing, rather than indefinite or unacceptably lengthy detention, as the first step for those seeking asylum.</para><para>If the government is looking at current polling, it might note that many in the Australian electorate, while still concerned about security issues, are also concerned about the loss of our `fair go' reputation and are questioning both our asylum seeker policies after the debacle of the Pacific solution and our eagerness to get involved in a world police force. We can and should have a policy that treats asylum seekers as human beings, not one that demonises them and brands them potential terrorists. That only feeds ignorance and intolerance within our society.</para><para>Last Sunday evening I had dinner with two Kurdish refugees and their wives in Bathurst. Both men fled Iraq prior to 2001; one had been in the Iraqi army. They fled to Turkey, where they hid for two years in fear of recapture and their return and likely execution. These men have been granted residency and have found employment in Bathurst. One has completed a university degree, as has his wife, although they are looking to Sydney for greater employment opportunities; the other works for a local company—he is a permanent employee. All four love Bathurst and its people, who have made them so welcome.</para><para>They point out how natural it is for recent refugees to gather in communities and to speak their language with fellow countrymen. They have many friends in the suburbs of Sydney where Middle Eastern immigrants now live. They do their monthly shopping there. But they are quite happy to return to Bathurst, which they now regard as their home town. As they were telling me this story I remembered the years of the post-war immigration—and even recent immigration from Vietnam and other places—and how the first generation of settlers from whatever country gathered in communities to seek the security of their own cultures, cultures that in many cases are thousands of years old. Why wouldn't they? What is the culture to which they are supposed to suddenly transform themselves? What is the Australian culture? Surely it is but an amalgam of all of these influences from the post-war migration program and beyond. Whatever it is to be Australian, these Kurdish friends certainly understand what it is to be Australian now. They are people who have contributed in a far richer way than they ever dreamt they possibly could to this society, because they have been accepted.</para><para>What it means to be Australian now is different to what it meant 20 or 30 years ago and is perhaps a lot different to what it might be in another 30 years. That is the beauty of our ability to bring these people in and accept that the first generation might logically want to gather in their own cultural areas and share language and experiences with those of their own culture. But that is no reason to condemn them, as we are being in many cases encouraged to do by a very subtle use of policy, public statement, implication and innuendo. The media has played a role, too, in jumping to brand people with a tag often because of their country of origin.</para><para>As we have vilified whole groups of people in recent years—as the previous speaker, the member for Melbourne, said—on the basis of slur and innuendo and fearmongering, we have created fear and suspicion in our suburbs. We have exacerbated the sorts of incidents that do occur. I do not deny they occur, but they have been occurring for many years. We can look at the influence of some quite shady characters on the southern European migrants that came to this country in years past. We can look at the Riverina and the influence that certain individuals had on the Italian community, much to the dismay and horror of that community, who were 99.9 per cent hardworking contributors to the economic growth of this country post the Second World War.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YU5</name.id><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Tanner</name></talker><para>—We had a few Nazi war criminals as well.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>KL6</name.id><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name></talker><para>—We may have had.

They talked about how natural it was for recent refugees to gather in those communities.

That is stereotyping and the worst form of racial tagging, I would suggest.</para><para>While we seem to spurn and point fingers at certain sectors of the community, I wonder whether we are going to write off the whole of our National Rugby League on the basis of one group of people and certain allegations.

They may have ended up in Curtin, Port Hedland, Nauru or Woomera. They also may have been subsequently sent back to their homeland and they may have been unfairly branded. But fortunately they came prior to the hysteria that has created this stereotyping. They may have been temporary protection visa holders, but they may also have been rejected. Who knows?</para><para>They are little different from the several hundred who arrived on the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> in 2001, I would argue, or those who arrived after 2001 or the many hundreds who arrived before. They are not among the 60,000, mostly from countries of Anglo-Saxon origin, who are in this country illegally after arriving on a visa. These are the illegal non-Australian citizens, not the asylum seekers targeted by legislation such as this. Instead of exploiting these people for political gain, how much closer to our fair-go reputation might we be if we compulsorily detained asylum seekers for only the time—ideally a maximum of six to eight weeks; I think I heard the member for Melbourne say 90 days—it took for security and health issues to be ascertained?</para><para>We have the technology these days to release asylum seekers into the community under the care and supervision of church and charity organisations, not just to send mum and the kids off to suburban Woomera and give them a home while dad stays in the outback desert camp but to keep the families intact. Perhaps we have the ingenuity in this country for us to be a trendsetter. Why not a smart card to allow access to basic needs? Why not a finite and determined amount of social security that these people could access with their smart card? Then we would know where they were at any particular time. The computer technology is there. The decision on their application for temporary or more permanent protection would be delivered to them in person. They would be required to turn up for the decision and the interview.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hockey</name></talker><para>—What happens if they don't?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>KL6</name.id><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name></talker><para>—I would suggest there would be very little temptation for the people I have spoken with on this issue to disappear into the woodwork like the 60,000 people who have arrived under other circumstances with a visa by aeroplane into this country. As I have suggested, they are the ones who want to disappear. Asylum seekers, by and large, are very genuine. They want to keep their families intact. They want to partake of the opportunities this country offers. I would suggest the smart card technology as a way of enabling them to be humanised and to be part of our society. Then, if it is determined that their country is safe enough to return to, so be it. As we have seen with the Hazaras in Young and Dubbo and with my Kurdish friends in Bathurst, these people want to work and contribute. They want to share their determination and their energy; they do not want to abuse the privilege they would be offered—and believe me, they regard the offer of even temporary protection as an absolute privilege. I am a fairly emotional person, but it does bring tears to your eyes when you see how determined these people are to make a go of it—and how they are making a go of it and seeing opportunities that many Australians never thought were there.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is a disgrace that we should attempt to tighten a noose around these people and perpetuate the dehumanisation of outback incarceration. This is something we did not do with the Kosovar refugees or, indeed, with those from eastern Europe after World War II. The shame of it all is that we do not take any responsibility for people once we do send them back, should their asylum status be denied. I have got a series of questions on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> for the minister around this issue, and I do not believe the concerns of Hazara temporary protection visa holders about the safety and security of returnees to their country are in any way mollified by assurances from Afghan authorities. The same applies to asylum seekers from Iraq or Iran. I reject any legislation that could have the effect that a person is unlawfully kept in detention for a significant period of time because the court did not have the power to release them because of the operation of this amendment to the Migration Act. I therefore totally reject the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>25829</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1982">Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2004</inline> essentially deals with the power of the Federal Court to make interim orders in relation to the continuing detention of a small number of asylum seekers—and I stress that it is a small number. One of the points that emerged from the contributions of the member for Petrie and the member for Forrest—when they tried to make a political point about the number of women and children in detention some decades ago and the limited number of people in detention now—was: what is the urgency of this legislation? The numbers involved are minimal, and they have established that point. The two other classes of people who were previously subject to detention have been dealt with, so we are indeed dealing with a very small number of people.</para></talk.start><para>This bill seeks to reopen a debate on legislative changes that were dealt with by the Senate last year. As is well known, the Migration Act provides for a system of mandatory detention for all unlawful noncitizens. An unlawful noncitizen is defined as someone who does not have legal authority to be in the Australian migration zone. The law provides that an unlawful noncitizen must be detained until one of two things happens: either they leave Australia or they are granted a substantive visa, such as a temporary protection visa. I have long been, and I remain, a strong supporter of mandatory detention. Fifteen years ago I was probably as naive as many of the speakers I have heard in this debate. I believed that everyone who came to my office was genuine, honest and sincere—that they were, as they claimed to be, asylum seekers. The reality, many years later, convinces me that we do need a form of mandatory detention.</para><para>I am not a person who would brand these people `terrorists'. I think that anyone who has half a brain would know that the last way by which a terrorist would try to come to this country would be to endanger themselves in a leaking boat and face detention. But in the real world, in the daily reality of my electorate, we do have to face up to the fact that we do need identity checks. We do need health checks. We have to look at security issues. Most crucially, we have to look at the fact—which, unfortunately, the member for Calare, whom I respect deeply on a wide variety of issues, does not seem to understand—that people will disappear. That is the international experience. For all the determination of people to work and contribute to this country, when people are faced with the glaring reality of losing their cases, they do not front up. They disappear. That has been the experience of all of the European countries. It has certainly been the experience of the United States.</para><para>It is up to those people who oppose mandatory detention to come up with a viable alternative. There are expressions thrown around about the possibilities of technology et cetera; there are dreams that groups out there are going to actually take responsibility for people whom they take into their care. It is not believable, quite frankly. These people will find it very difficult to detain people. They feel so compassionate about them that, at the end of the day, they will not take responsibility and these people will disappear.</para><para>There are currently three broad categories of people subject to mandatory detention. The first is criminal deportees, generally noncitizens whose permanent residence was revoked after serving a period of imprisonment following conviction for certain criminal offences. I note concerns on my part that perhaps the government has been exploring the option of actually taking citizenship away from people, and that is why there is an FOI in regard to that matter. In recent years, the minister of the day has become too inclined to deport people for criminal offences. I have seen instances of people in my electorate, like one person of Croatian extraction. He was 38 years old, and he had never committed a violent offence. His offences were related to fraud, social security cheating et cetera. He came to Australia when he was four years of age. This was a very different case from people like Vietnamese drug dealers, British drug dealers or whatever, who arrived a year ago and have not got citizenship. He was 38 years old, he had been here for 34 years with parents, brothers and sisters, he had no family in Croatia, and he was deported by this government. Can I say, while I am at it, that the government is going too far down that road. The second category of people subject to mandatory detention are those whose visas have been cancelled in response to character concerns, including security concerns. The third category is asylum seekers who arrive in our migration zone without a valid visa and whose claims are under consideration or have been rejected.</para><para>The member for Forrest spoke of a series of cases from the very limited number of people who are in the asylum seeker category. He was actually talking about two cases, and they are very narrow in their focus. The stated reason for the introduction of this bill is to constrain the courts, particularly the Federal Court, from interfering with the operation of mandatory detention by making interim or interlocutory orders for the release of applicants pending the final determination of their claims. The two cases referred to are very narrow. They set very little precedent for the other people in detention, and this is quite simply a political gambit.</para><para>The opposition would be concerned if there were evidence that the courts were increasingly and lightly releasing unlawful noncitizens in circumstances of mandatory detention. As I said earlier, I believe in the system. We have to have it. I would be concerned if I thought that, willy-nilly, the courts of this country were releasing people unnecessarily. No evidence has been produced in support of such a contention. In fact, it is notable that, while the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs referred in his second reading speech to `a trend by the Federal Court to order the interlocutory release of persons in immigration detention', he made specific reference to just one case—and a quite exceptional one at that. This trend, as specified by him, is one case, one example.</para><para>I do not deny that there might have been several cases, but I remain unconvinced that there has been a sufficient trend to cause alarm, particularly given changes to the law that the opposition has already supported. I would emphasise that the opposition supported an earlier law change that prevents the interim release of criminal deportees and those who are subject to character concerns. So there is no dispute about those two categories of people and no evidence that the law change applying to them is in any way deficient or inoperative. We are thus left with the issue of a small number of cases involving asylum seekers.</para><para>While there may be others, there are two headline cases involving the Federal Court issuing interlocutory orders. The first case, the one referred to by the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs in his second reading speech, is that of VFAD, an Afghan asylum seeker whose case was before both a single judge and then the full court of the Federal Court in 2002. While the minister made a reference to the order of the court, he made no reference to the circumstances involved. He did not tell this parliament the specific circumstances, which are extremely narrow and very rarely apply. The reality is that the notes for the case indicate that on 7 December 2001 a migration officer said:</para><quote><para>... that he was satisfied that the respondent had a well-founded fear of persecution.</para></quote><para>That departmental officer departed overseas two days later, having said, basically, that the person would become a citizen if his security clearance was good. In the intervening time, there was an emphasis on changing circumstances in Afghanistan. But the situation was that a departmental officer essentially determined that that person had a valid refugee claim. This case was also accompanied by other peculiarities. The Hotham Mission gave guarantees with regard to housing, ongoing support, referral and material assistance. The court said at point 40:</para><quote><para>The position of the applicant in the present case is quite different in that, if his application succeeds, he will not be an unlawful non-citizen but, rather, will be a lawful non-citizen who is being unlawfully detained.</para></quote><para>Those were the specifics of the case. We are not talking about the kind of broad brush approach that is allegedly the basis for this legislation. This person had a very singular and unusual circumstance. An officer departed overseas soon after seemingly thinking the applicant had a valid refugee case. At point 50 of the case the judge said:</para><quote><para>The applicant has a strong prima facie documentary case as the decision record appears to be a decision to grant him a protection visa.</para></quote><para>That is the reason the court released him, not because the courts were saying, `We're going to let people out every five seconds; we want to overthrow the legislation; we want to destroy mandatory detention.' They let him out because of the peculiarities of the case. It was a specific, idiosyncratic, very individual case. Under FOI, the files for that case were obtained and perused, and the applicant argued that he was not, in fact, an unlawful noncitizen in the terms of the act. The court accepted that as an arguable proposition, based on the evidence before them, and ordered his release. It is clear that the circumstances of the case are extremely unusual and offer no comfort to others who are in detention.</para><para>The other case, the case of Al Masri, is interesting for two reasons. It shows those dreamers who believe that all the claimants are honest and that their words can always be taken as gospel that that is not so. Mr Al Masri said that he wanted to leave the country. He wished to get on a plane and leave, and at the early stage he was released. But the telling point here is that later on the court threw him back in detention. The same court that is under attack for being so loose and liberal, so easily persuaded to release people, said that in the intervening period the government had persuaded Israel, from recollection, to allow Mr Al Masri's movement so he could leave the country. Mr Al Masri, the man who had wanted to rush onto a plane and leave the country, decided at this stage that he did not want to leave the country, and he sought an injunction to restrain the government from releasing him.</para><para>The case is a narrow one. It received some publicity. The person was a failed asylum seeker who had, on the surface of it, agreed to depart Australia but was unable to do so, because a number of countries in the Middle East initially refused to allow him to transit through their territory. Eventually, the court ordered his continued detention, pending the finalisation of the necessary arrangements for his departure from Australia. And that is the point: the case which is cited as one of the examples of this trend, this tendency, this need for legislation, is actually extremely narrow and is not one that is going to be repeated every five minutes. It is clear that neither case has raised the probability of the courts ordering the interim release of masses of asylum seekers who are in detention.</para><para>As I said earlier, we need a detention system. We need to be able to check on people. We have a situation where vast numbers want to come here. Previous speakers have said that we should be pleased that we get aspirants, people who are keen to live in this country and who will work hard et cetera. Obviously, we would do the same thing. If we were in their circumstances, we would try to beat the system. But, equally, every society has the right to try to contain this problem. If we want to say that it is right that these people beat our refugee humanitarian intake rules because they are going to contribute to this country, we might as well go to Beijing or Nairobi and say that we have a new processing system for people who are aspiring to a better lifestyle. Let us be honest about it. The refugee humanitarian intake should not be utilised for people to come here with false claims and basically beat the system. That is part of this picture.</para><para>No-one else would dare to say this, including the government, but, contrary to the statements of some members on this side who come in here and say that most of these people are proven to be refugees and it is dreadful that anyone is impliedly detained, I have a belief that there is a covert policy in the department to approve as many of these onshore cases as possible. I do not believe it is intellectually viable to argue that, just because a person comes to this country on a boat, that person ipso facto should have greater proclivity to being a genuine refugee than people lining up in Islamabad and New Delhi.</para><para>To me it is interesting that a very high proportion of onshore claimants, despite all the refugee advocates' complaints, win their cases. It is not because they have better cases or because their struggle to pay the money and get on boats proves that they are more genuine; it is because, fundamentally, the politics of this country require that as many as possible are released as soon as possible. It is an embarrassment, a political difficulty, for whoever is in power if hundreds of people are detained for long periods.</para><para>Contrary to the view of some members on this side of the House, I do not see that as being related in any way to saying that mandatory detention is wrong, just because the vast majority pass through the system. The reason for that is, firstly, because there is a covert policy to pass them and, secondly, because they cannot be checked in the same manner as offshore claimants. We cannot, in these cases, go around to houses in Islamabad. Late last year, of the six women who claimed to be on their own, in four of the cases the immigration department found their spouses living in the same house. Male partners who were claimed to be dead were found to be present in Islamabad and Peshawar. In reality more people pass through the system in this country because the system cannot vet them probably. People throw away material and evidence and invent ethnicity and political histories that are not true. As I say, that is no argument against mandatory detention.</para><para>With regard to the government's genuineness in these matters, as I say I think this legislation is unnecessary. It is aimed at marginalising the opposition as having a pro-refugee, anti-detention policy. But the government's own record shows its total failure to deal with illegal workers. The government took a very strong stand recently: it provided a phone number, and you can apparently phone and dob people in. The immigration department says  that this is the responsibility of the department of labour, but the department of labour then says that is the responsibility of the department of immigration. Labor has said that people should have a card that proves they have the right to work in this country; if they do not, they are illegal and their employers should be heavily fined.</para><para>I will not linger on this matter. Suffice it to say that we have a situation where 1,000 permanent visas were given to rejected applicants. The immigration department, which vets people, said that these people had no claims, that they should not be in the country and should not be given permanent residence. The minister, under ministerial discretion, allowed 1,000 to stay permanently. This matter has been canvassed very strongly over the past year. But people started complaining about boat people. I complained too over the latest case of the Kurds, who were determined to come here. They were generally found not to have valid refugee claims. It is worrying that these boat people attempted to come here. But, when 1,000 permanent visas were issued by the minister, after the applicants were rejected by the department, you have to wonder about the bona fides in this matter.</para><para>I strongly oppose the legislation. It is unnecessary, does not deal with the fundamental problem, the numbers that would be affected are minimal, there is no evidence of a trend that the government needs to counter and the court has not been out there in a cavalier fashion letting people out. The court has done so in two individual cases whose circumstances were very narrow. They are not precedents for a wide-ranging policy. The legislation is totally unnecessary.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>25833</page.no><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name><name.id>CK6</name.id><electorate>Moreton</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—I am pleased to join this debate on the <inline ref="R1982">Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2004. </inline>I thank all the members who have made a contribution. The purpose of this bill is to restate and uphold the original intention behind the Migration Amendment Act 1992 and the Migration Reform Act 1992. These are the acts that introduced mandatory detention. The acts were introduced by the Australian Labor Party when they were in government. They have been maintained by the Howard government during our time in office and they are about sending a signal to those who would like to ply the trade of people-smuggling to try and bring people to this country by unlawful means that all unlawful arrivals will be detained to allow their status to be worked out, and to work out whether or not they qualify for entrance into Australia.</para></talk.start><para>This bill is not a departure from the Migration Act. It is a reinforcement of what was clearly the intention of the parliament back in 1992. The purpose of section 196 was to put beyond any doubt that an unlawful noncitizen must be detained until he or she is either removed from Australia, deported or granted a visa. Section 196 makes it clear that there is to be no discretion for any person or court to release an unlawful noncitizen from detention until one of these events occurs. Recently, however, there has been a trend for the Federal Court to make interlocutory orders for the release of persons from immigration detention, pending the final determination of that person's judicial review application. This has resulted in those who are unlawful noncitizens being released into the Australian community until their applications are finalised by the courts.</para><para>This process can often be a lengthy one and can often result in inconsistencies in the way the policy of mandatory detention is applied. This was never the intention of the parliament a dozen years ago, in 1992, when the mandatory detention regime was introduced. This bill ensures that parliament's original intention in relation to mandatory detention is absolutely clear. The bill amends section 196 to ensure that an unlawful noncitizen must be kept in immigration detention, except where he or she is removed from Australia, deported, granted a visa, or a court makes a final determination that the detention is unlawful or that the person is not an unlawful noncitizen.</para><para>As I mentioned when I introduced the bill, this bill does not prevent a court from making a final decision in relation to any application made to the court. The simple and clear intention of this bill is to uphold the government's mandatory detention policy, which was the policy of the previous government. Although those opposite can afford, as oppositions can, to have a variety of views, depending on the day of the week or the fora in which they happen to present them, we on this side are consistent in our determination to ensure the efficient and effective removal of unlawful noncitizens from Australia.</para><para>We on the side have been accused by the opposition of having some sort of obsession about this. But we are obsessed about consistency, we are obsessed about a sense of purpose, we are obsessed about the enforcement of that consistency and sense of purpose, we are obsessed about the rule of law and we are obsessed about ensuring that we decide who comes to Australia—in other words, about ensuring that our borders are protected from those who would attempt to breach them by bringing unlawful arrivals to this country in boats and by other means.</para><para>It is the very clear and simple intention of this bill to uphold the mandatory detention policy and to ensure that we send a strong signal to those who want to ply this trade that this country is very determined also to uphold the integrity of people who come to this country lawfully. But, yet again, the Australian Labor Party are sending a signal that they are soft on border protection. The Australian Labor Party are sending a signal that they have a variety of views in their own caucus—that there is torment in their caucus, as far as these matters are concerned. Now that the courts have demonstrated an increasing willingness to release persons from immigration detention pending final determination of their cases, we want to ensure that this matter is given the urgency that it deserves. It is absolutely crucial that this bill is passed.</para><para>The member for Reid, in his contribution, raised the case of VFAD in 2002, where the full Federal Court held that section 196(3) is silent as to the power of this court to grant interlocutory release in circumstances where a person in detention claims not to be an unlawful noncitizen. Further, the court did not accept that section 196(3), by implication, denied it power to order the interlocutory release. The member for Reid, in his contribution, suggested other reasons. But in the Federal Court's own opinions that have been offered in this particular case, the clear reason that needed to be addressed in this bill, and which is being addressed in this bill, is that `parliament has not made unmistakably clear its intention to abrogate the power of this court to protect a fundamental freedom by ordering the release, on an interlocutory basis, of persons in detention'. This bill is all about making that absolutely and completely clear.</para><para>I note that the member for Reid did admit that people do disappear—and this is the point. As people are released without a determination about their lawfulness being made, they can disappear into our community. That is the situation that occurs in the United States and Europe, where collectively there are millions and millions of people who are unlawful. There are millions of people in the United States alone, and across Europe, who are part of those societies without lawful reason to be there and who are making a mockery of the immigration processes of those places. This country is now becoming a template for other countries in that our approach and the range of measures we have in place have made a difference. This country is very much determined to make sure that a strong signal is sent to people smugglers and those in the legal profession here in Australia who hover nearby to try and deliver access into the Australian community, via court orders, without lawful visas having been issued.</para><para>The Labour Party in the United Kingdom are grabbing our approach; those opposite have the ghost of Gough Whitlam hovering over the policy-free zone. They have a policy on border protection of `let them in', and their policy on detention is `let them out'; it is the `let them in, let them out policy'. The member for Melbourne said that we vilify asylum seekers; no, but we vilify people smugglers. We believe their vile trade needs to stop. We do not apologise for this, whereas Labor seems to be very accommodating to people smugglers, sending them a message that, if they should be elected later this year, the people smugglers will be well and truly back in business and more and more people will be able to come to this country through that process.</para><para>The member for Melbourne even held up the late Arthur Calwell as a champion of non-English-speaking migration. What an absolute farce! The man was well known for his comments about `Wongs and whites'. At the end of the day, the Labor Party are trying to rewrite history yet again on these matters. While they may well have had, over the last 20 years, some 13 different ministers and shadow ministers covering the area of migration, it is a hot potato that those opposite seem never to want to hold. The latest shadow minister for immigration, the member for Perth, gave an eloquent listing of a variety of cases—but I think he was being totally bamboozled by the detail—distracting attention from the fact that those opposite are demonstrating complete ambivalence towards the concept of mandatory detention, a process that they themselves introduced.</para><para>In summary, the amendments contained in this bill will ensure the parliament's original intention—the intention that was stated in legislation introduced by the Labor Party in 1992—and will ensure that, in relation to migration detention, everyone around the world and everyone in our region understands very clearly what this government stands for and that the integrity of our Migration Act cannot be compromised.

In my electorate of Calwell, one such individual was Petros Pantazopoulos, who passed away suddenly on New Year's Day this year. Petros was born on 1 April 1943 in a small town near Kalamata in the southern mainland of Greece. Like thousands of other Greek migrants, Petros arrived in Australia in the early 1960s seeking a better and secure future. Like many of his Greek compatriots, he settled in the high-rise flats in Collingwood in Melbourne's inner north before moving to the outer north-western suburbs of Melbourne and settling into the suburb of Coolaroo. It was here that he would settle with his wife—his childhood sweetheart, Antonia—and together they would raise two very bright, warm and thoughtful children, George and Helen.</para></talk.start><para>Petros was always motivated by the desire to help those who were often unable to help themselves. He donated himself to community life without reward but, rather, to simply offer support and advice to those who needed it. He spoke fluent English and had excellent knowledge of his community structures. It was no surprise therefore that those who were not as familiar with the English language would seek Petros's assistance, and he was always happy to help. But it was his involvement with the Upfield soccer club that gave him the greatest satisfaction. His other great passion was politics. Petros was dedicated to the Upfield soccer club, which he had been involved with since its inception in 1982. In his latter years, he would become an effective and successful secretary of that local soccer club, and in 2003 he took its seniors team to its first premiership in 10 years.</para><para>Petros was an almost daily visitor to my electorate office, and it was this premiership win that was arguably his favourite topic of conversation in the latter half of last year. To say that this brought Petros an incredible amount of joy would be quite the understatement, and it certainly brightened up what had been unfortunately a sad couple of years for Petros and his family. In 2002, Petros and Antonia tragically lost their much loved son George to cancer. This of course created a void in Petros's life—one that I am sure that, try as he might, he was unable to fill. As much as he adored his three delightful grandchildren, each of whom looked up to him as their big best friend, the emptiness associated with his son's loss remained. However, his role within the local community continued as always, and his commitment to the maxim of community spirit remained as strong as ever. He also remained a loyal comrade—if I may be permitted to call him that—working hard for the Labor Party locally. As I said earlier, politics was always his passion. In fact, it was in his role as an active and devoted activist that I first got to know Petros in the early 1990s. His work and passion for the Australian Labor Party were undying, and his assistance at all levels of campaigning will forever be appreciated.</para><para>Petros was one of those rare, street-wise political activists. You could always rely on him to tell you a few home truths, and that is what I admired most about him. He was up-front and almost always correct in his assessment and advice. His loss is one that has been felt by a large number of people, as was evidenced by the huge turnout at his funeral, with local, state and federal levels of government and a host of community based organisations represented. He was a constant source of advice and counsel, not only to me but also to my staff, who were always available for a chat on issues of the day. Petros will be widely missed, and I want to take this opportunity to once again pass on my sympathy to his wife, Antonia; his daughter, Helen, and her husband, Alfred; and his daughter-in-law, Mary. Petros Pantazopoulos was an individual who touched many people's lives, including mine and my husband's. He was our friend, and we will continue to be grateful for his support and commitment and will strive to do him proud.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Macarthur Electorate: Standards in Advertising</title><page.no>25838</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>25838</page.no><name role="metadata">Farmer, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FARMER</name><name.id>00AMO</name.id><electorate>Macarthur</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The people of Western Sydney are decent, hardworking people. They set themselves high standards in everything they do. That is why, like so many in the electorate of Macarthur, I am becoming more distressed by the gradual loss of community standards we are seeing in everyday advertising. We have all heard the catchphrase `sex sells'. It is not easy to come up with a great advertising campaign, which is why many take the easy option of using scantily clad or naked women on their billboards and, as someone who drives regularly on Sydney roads, I am offended by them.</para></talk.start><para>What brought this to my attention was driving, with my two young children in the car, past billboards where a woman's backside is prominently displayed to try to sell an ice cream. What can you say when your own children turn to you and say, `Dad, that's rude, isn't it?' As a parent, I try my best to instil in my children morals, good values and respect for women. Sometimes it takes a fresh mind and the voice of a child to remind us how desensitised we have become.</para><para>Today we think nothing of seeing Kylie Minogue's scantily covered body splashed across billboards in Sydney. I blame the self-regulation of the advertising industry for this. The makers of the advertisements hide behind the decisions of the Advertising Standards Board. This is a board that is mostly made up of people from the advertising and media industries. I do not see a housewife, a mechanic or an ordinary Australian on this board. It is ordinary people who think these advertisements objectify women and that these advertisements are wrong. The board's membership clearly does not represent the values expected by ordinary Australians. The board is a toothless tiger.</para><para>I will give you an example. There was major controversy in 2000 when Windsor Smith unveiled billboards portraying a woman in her underwear apparently about to engage in an act of oral sex. The standards board did its job and requested that they be removed. Windsor Smith agreed to comply with the request, but only in its own time. The request occurred in the middle of March but it turned out that the hundreds of billboards, which had been strategically placed around the country, were to be taken down a few weeks later anyway. By the time the billboards were taken down, and with the increased publicity the case brought, you could hardly argue that there was any punishment for Windsor Smith or its advertising agency.</para><para>We need stronger penalties for agencies that breach the standards. In fact, the current system rewards them in the form of extra publicity. I cannot help but think that agencies deliberately take this approach to grab this type of publicity. We live in a society where crime and violence against women are becoming more prevalent. I do not need to remind anybody in this House of the alarming increase in violent attacks on women, including gang rapes and sexual assaults. While I do not directly blame this type of advertising it is part of the general decline in community standards that have led to an increase in violence and unacceptable behaviour.</para><para>Sport is another area in which I have noticed a real decline in standards. It is an important area to watch because it is such a vital part of our culture. Today, we regularly see violence and aggression on our sports fields. For instance, take the following quote:</para><quote><para>I can take you to any sports field any Saturday morning and show you parents getting stuck into it. Having a go at the ref, yelling abuse. </para></quote><para>This quote was made by the Leader of the Opposition, the Member for Werriwa, in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> magazine a few years ago. He identified a real problem. This type of behaviour is becoming more common. But where the member for Werriwa was wrong was the way in which he totally dismissed the problem in his next breath, with the misguided belief that this type of behaviour is acceptable. He told Maxine McKew:</para><quote><para>It's part of the Australian Way. We're not a namby-pamby nation that hides our feelings. I think were a nation that's willing to call a spade a spade and, if need be, to pick up the spade and whack someone over the head with it.</para></quote><para>I am yet to find a parent in my electorate of Macarthur who agrees that yelling at the referee, screaming abuse, venting aggression or hitting someone with a spade is part of the Australian way. Sport is the Australian way; it is the cement that holds us together as a nation. Hurling abuse at somebody and attacking them, whether verbally or physically, is not the Australian way.</para><para>This comment from the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa, goes to the heart of what is wrong with modern society. It goes to the heart of the decline in community standards and morals. As leaders of our communities, members of this House need to stand up and promote better standards in society. We should lead by example and not, as the Leader of the Labor Party would have us do, promote or condone violence, poor behaviour and a decline in community standards. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employment: Mature Age Workers</title><page.no>25839</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>25839</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name><name.id>84S</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Much has been said over the past few days about the concept of Australians working beyond the current retirement age, or `working till you drop' as it is being termed. Let us have a look at a recent attempt to encourage Australians to defer their entitlements. The pension bonus scheme is a voluntary scheme that supposedly rewards people who defer claiming the age or service pension. To benefit, you must register as a member of the scheme and then continue working for at least 12 months.</para></talk.start><para>I have a constituent who was one of the first to register for the scheme. He chose to continue working after he had attained the pension eligibility age, partly to provide himself with a focus after the death of his wife but mainly because he felt he could continue to make a contribution to society. He completed the five additional years in the work force required by the scheme. In addition, he acted as the principal afterschool carer for his grandchild for three hours each day. As a clerk, he never earned a big salary nor is he earning a big salary now. His capacity to expand his superannuation has been restricted by age. What is the net result for him for staying in the work force? The extra five years of work has had the effect of increasing his assets by just enough to make him ineligible for both the benefit under the pension bonus scheme and the pension itself—so much for an incentive to work longer.</para><para>It was not so long ago that politicians and commentators were talking about how Australians should be preparing for the time when we would all have more leisure time. We were encouraged to think about activities we might pursue and to think about our health so we would be in a position to take advantage of the new lifestyle. Now, seemingly instantly, we are going the other way, encouraging Australians to work longer into their older years. It might sound great in theory and on the surface it might seem a solution to Australia's demographic challenges.</para><para>It is fair to say that until now the largest proportion of Australians who have worked past the normal retirement age have been self-employed as well as professionals such as doctors, lawyers and accountants. They will continue to do so and it will not change anything. But how realistic and sensible is it for Australians who, for example, work in manual occupations to work beyond the current retirement age? The reality is that we all become physically weaker as we get older. It does not seem sensible to expose older Australians to unnecessary illness or injury, creating a heavier burden on our health system. Quite apart from that, after toiling for 40 or 50 years, hard working Australians are entitled to a retirement which they can enjoy.</para><para>A perfect example of a career with stringent physical and psychological demands is that undertaken by our police force. If officers believe that they can no longer meet the physical and psychological demands of policing after age 55, surely they should be allowed to retire with dignity and their entitlements. The flattening of organisational structures has impacted as much on police forces as on other groups in the community. Consequently, if those officers cannot meet the rigours of frontline policing, there is currently no role for them.</para><para>I would hate to think that these latest proposals would lead to a situation where Australians were expected to work beyond the current retirement age or in a manner that placed them at a greater health risk. One shudders to think of older Australians receiving white feathers or the like in the mail because they are no longer in the work force. I have no problem with good, well thought out incentives which encourage those older Australians who wish to remain in the work force to do so, but the expectation cannot and should not be universal.</para><para>Earlier this year the government expressed surprise that so few Australians had accessed the pension bonus scheme. If my constituent is any example, the answer is simple: after opting to work longer, they are no longer eligible to access it. Rhetoric and theory is fine; messing with people's lives and the retirements to which they have looked forward to—or leading them up the garden path—is not fine.</para><para>Let us not also forget the critical role which retired Australians play in our community. They provide a very substantial proportion of our volunteer work force. Volunteers save Australia millions of dollars every year. But, in order to give their skills in community service, they have to have not only the inclination but also the time. Older Australians, tired, ill or injured through working beyond a reasonable age, will be less inclined or able to volunteer as community workers. Any system which encourages, expects or obligates Australians to work beyond retirement age must be carefully thought out. There must be safeguards to ensure that those who opt in are not disadvantaged at some later stage as a result.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cook Electorate: Sutherland Shire Council</title><page.no>25841</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>25841</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As the House is aware, in New South Wales we are rapidly approaching local government elections, including for Sutherland Shire Council, which covers my electorate and part of the electorate of Hughes. These elections are due to be held on 27 March.</para></talk.start><para>Every second Saturday I hold community consultations and meet with shire residents to talk to them about the issues that confront them in terms of their own living and interaction with the council. During many of these community consultations, local council matters dominate the discussions. One would think that they may come down to congratulate the government on our strong economic performance and our strong stand in terms of security matters and a whole range of things where the government has taken initiatives, but very often they come down to complain about the council.</para><para>The Sutherland Shire Council is made up of some very fine people, and the general manager, John Rayner, does an excellent job. But local constituents are very much concerned about issues such as footpaths and kerbs and guttering. Residents and local small business people have approached me with regard to shopping centre upgrades, which have been promised for the last four years. The council has budgeted for these upgrades but it has underspent on this important work by almost $3.7 million since 1999. Drainage is also a matter of great concern, with much of the existing infrastructure either broken down or in a state of disrepair. </para><para>Only yesterday a story regarding a constituent of mine was carried in the local newspaper. The article reported on a home in Loch Lomond Crescent in Cronulla, which is in the eastern part of my electorate. The owners of the home, Mr and Mrs Bakker, have for four years been suffering from flooding from a council drain which is adjacent to their home. According to Mr Bakker, during heavy rain, stormwater—which is often contaminated by raw sewerage—floods their property, washing much of the hillside on the lower portion of their property into Port Hacking. Their swimming pool is unusable due to contamination from this flooding. Mr Bakker has been in discussions with council for more than four years to have the problem addressed. He was led to believe that the council would agree to fund the approximate $140,000 which was required to fix the problem, but he was informed last week that the council had deemed the drain operational, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The problem has reduced the value of the family home by more than $700,000.</para><para>A further concern of residents of the shire is the extremely high council rates which we are forced to pay. Sutherland Shire Council is one of the highest taxing councils in New South Wales. To compare the council's rates to other areas in Sydney: for a block of land valued at $400,000, a resident in Blakehurst, in the Barton electorate, would pay $779; a resident in Neutral Bay, in the electorate of North Sydney, would pay only $752; and a resident in Vaucluse, one of the richest areas in Australia, would pay just $794. In the mean time, an average young family in Cook with a block of land of the same value pays a staggering $1,531—twice what residents in the richest postcode in Australia have to pay. These rates give the Sutherland Shire Council a turnover of more than $184 million per annum—a magnificent budget by any standard—and yet many residents of the shire do not even have some of the most basic services, such as bus shelters, kerbs and guttering and properly maintained parks. </para><para>The council's debt has soared in the last four years to more than $38 million in internal and external debt. This has increased from $13 million under the last shire council. We now have a coalition of Shire Watch and Labor. Despite the efforts of Shire Watch to show that they are independent, they move as one with the Labor council. And of course there is expenditure. According to the council's own budget paper, it spent $12,000 sending a member of the council staff on an all expenses paid trip to Greece, Switzerland, England, Wales, Ireland, Northern Ireland and Singapore. There has been expenditure of $4.51 million since 1999 on private sector consultants—an increase of 143 per cent in consultants' fees compared with the previous council. </para><para>Then there is the campaign against ANSTO—the local nuclear processing station, which provides medical isotopes. The council spent $279,000 on the campaign and a further $6,500 flying in specialists from overseas. They allocated $20,000 to the Al-Zahra Muslim Women's Association in Arncliffe, which is outside the Sutherland Shire. Legal payments to the previous mayor amounted to some $56,000. So we have a political campaign and expenditure which goes on and on. The council needs to get its priorities right. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Higher Education Contribution Scheme</title><page.no>25842</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>25842</page.no><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name><name.id>HH4</name.id><electorate>Scullin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In answer to question on notice No. 2672, the Minister for Education, Science and Training informed me on 3 November 2003 that, in the postcode areas wholly or partly covered by the electorate of Scullin, some 15,000 people have an outstanding or accumulated HECS debt of over $93 million. To put this into perspective, in the areas with postcodes 3074 and 3075—the suburbs of Lalor and Thomastown, which are wholly contained in the electorate of Scullin—some 2,700 people have a combined outstanding or accumulated HECS debt of over $20 million.</para></talk.start><para>I chose those two postcodes to illustrate the problem in disadvantaged areas. Those two postcode areas, under any reckoning or analysis, are disadvantaged areas of great need. These HECS decisions have already affected local areas. We must indicate our regret at a local level that, because of the government's changes to university HECS fees, the La Trobe University on Monday night decided to increase its HECS fees by 25 per cent for the year 2005. This additional impost will be a further disincentive to those in the electorate that I represent who are contemplating university education.</para><para>Fifteen or 16 years ago, arising from the RAN report, the then Labor government decided to institute a HEC scheme. Often Scullin was given as an example, because of the low number of tertiary qualified people in the boundaries of the electorate, to illustrate that HECS, in leading to additional places, would be an equity issue. It is time that we had an analysis to see if that is correct. Unless that is so, why should we continue to increase the obligation under the HEC scheme to future taxpayers? That obligation has risen from 20 per cent of university operating grants in the early 1990s to 33 per cent in 2003. There was a reduction in Commonwealth funding to universities from 77.1 per cent of university revenue in 1989 to 40.1 per cent in the year 2002.</para><para>Another example of the reduction in Commonwealth grants for higher education is that in 1975, Commonwealth expenditure on higher education as a percentage of GDP was 1.36 per cent, in 1988 it was reduced to 0.99 per cent, and in the year 2002-03 it was 0.53 per cent. Let us put to rest the idea that the Commonwealth is in any way protecting its input into higher education. This is part of this government's move towards ensuring that there is privatisation of a whole host of services, including education and health. It is consistent with the way in which in many areas of public policy we see a greater loading on putting private resources into the provision of services.</para><para>I believe that we do not value the effect of higher education, not only on the individual but on the community and the nation. That is the most important thing that seems to be missing from the current debate. There has not been a proper study. The government has said, `Why should other taxpayers be paying for a benefit that accrues to an individual?' This is nonsense in equity terms, when we look at individuals that are prevented from tapping their skills and talents by not going into tertiary education. I understand that tertiary education is not the be-all and end-all. But, if people are dissuaded from undertaking higher education because of the disincentive of a looming, burgeoning and increasing HECS debt, can we say that that is fair public policy? Are we actually tapping that unskilled talent that abounds in disadvantaged areas?</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Women: Sport</title><page.no>25843</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>25843</page.no><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name><name.id>HH4</name.id><electorate>Scullin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to touch on another issue that I annually get a chance to speak about, which is to do with women's sport.

On this occasion, I congratulate the ABC, which showed the grand final direct, at least to the Melbourne market, which was a great improvement on the previous year, when they had a delayed telecast at about one o'clock in the morning. I congratulate the ABC for that.</para></talk.start><para>But I express my concern—along with others who have expressed concern, including the Prime Minister—that the ABC has regionalised its coverage of sport in general on TV and that the Melbourne market will be subjected to a sporting package within the news coming out of Sydney.

It should understand that it has a responsibility to ensure that the regional differences that abound in Australia are protected and catered for.

Despite the very high public health needs and relatively low income in my local area, there is still no access to local bulk-billing magnetic resonance imaging services in the entire western metropolitan region. By comparison, there are 13 bulk-billing MRIs in central Melbourne and the eastern suburbs. To access a local MRI service, patients must pay out of their own pockets, and this can cost $200 for a single procedure. Indicators of public health and income in the area show that the need for a publicly funded MRI service is clear. According to analysis that has been done by Western Health, the primary local hospital services over half a million people, in 1,335 square kilometres, to be precise. The population in the west is predicted to increase by 100,000 over the next five years. So the need for us to have this service is increasing.</para></talk.start><para>The population of those aged over 70 is predicted to increase by 11 per cent by 2011 compared with an increase in the Melbourne metropolitan area of only seven per cent. It is important for members to know that the life expectancy in this catchment area, which includes my electorate, is lower than the Victorian average. There are higher than average rates of cancer, cardiovascular disease and infectious disease. The Maribyrnong local government area, which is entirely included within my electorate, has the highest rate of cardiovascular disease in all of Victoria. The local rate of diabetes is significantly higher than the Victorian average for men and women. In parts of my electorate, men suffer from chronic respiratory disease at a higher rate than the Victorian population at large. Parts of Western Health's catchment area also include areas of very low income, where payment up front for MRI procedures is something people simply cannot afford.</para><para>It is extremely important that the government consider making an eligible MRI available in the area. It is a serious problem that links to our general health issues and the declining bulk-billing rates. But to have not a single rebatable MRI machine in such a large section of Melbourne which has the highest need is simply unsustainable and unfair. This situation must be addressed immediately. An MRI machine that people can afford to use is now becoming a central part of many treatment processes in the medical profession. I went through the different rates of cancer and cardiovascular disease in my electorate. Many of the symptoms that people will suffer and the diseases that people will need to have treated do rely on MRI services to be detected early and treated properly. The history and health concerns of my electorate relate to an ageing population who worked in very heavy industrial areas. It is important that they are able to access local services that can be covered by Medicare and that they are not faced with a $200 up-front fee or with simply not having a choice to get this service because they cannot afford it. I urge the chamber and the government to address this situation immediately and to provide a rebatable machine in the western suburbs of Melbourne. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>McEwen Electorate: Services</title><page.no>25845</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>25845</page.no><name role="metadata">Bailey, Fran, MP</name><name role="display">FRAN BAILEY</name><name.id>JT4</name.id><electorate>McEwen</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—When I travel across the 15,000 square kilometres and 185 communities that make up my electorate of McEwen, in my mobile office or when holding town meetings in any of those communities, I am frequently told what my local constituents expect of government, and the federal government in particular. There are three key themes that constantly come through. What people in my electorate expect, firstly, is that they will have opportunities to succeed. They want to be able to operate in an economic environment where they are rewarded for their efforts and where they get those opportunities. Secondly, they expect the federal government to maintain our national security. Thirdly, they expect the provision of services.</para></talk.start><para>When we came into government in 1996, throughout the 15,000 square kilometres of my electorate there was not one Centrelink office—not one. It took a lot of work to get that established. Initially, we got it established in a small shop in an arcade in Seymour. Today we have not only a purpose-built building but we have outreach services going into towns, plus, most importantly, we have the Murrindindi Cyberbus, which provides direct electronic access to Centrelink. It is the only one of its kind in the entire nation. Bob, the bus driver, is the secret to the success of the Murrindindi Cyberbus.</para><para>The services that constituents in McEwen expect include access to Medicare. In every pharmacy across the 15,000 square kilometres, we have Medicare Easyclaim machines. Occasionally, my constituents want access to something like a post office box from Australia Post. After 12 months of battle, we have finally got a post office box in Mill Park Lakes—a new suburb which is fast-growing and demanding. The residents are now telling me that they want access to an ATM and public toilets. This is not directly the responsibility of federal government, but we have already started the campaign to make sure that the local council—the Whittlesea council—honours its obligations to providing services and delivers on the public toilets, and we are going to pressure the major banks to provide an ATM service.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Bacon, Mr Jim</title><page.no>25845</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>25845</page.no><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name><name.id>849</name.id><electorate>Braddon</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My local newspaper, the <inline font-style="italic">Advocate</inline>, recently said of Jim Bacon: </para></talk.start><quote><para>Jim Bacon will leave his role as Premier with the State's economy in its best shape for decades, perhaps ever.</para></quote><para>Yet Jim Bacon's reply to this was that he was happy from the bottom of his heart, but what made him happiest was: </para><quote><para>... to see the Tasmanian people now optimistic, happy, really confident about the future compared with what we inherited when we came to office in 1998, which I've often described as being virtually a clinical state of depression of the whole community in Tasmania.</para></quote><para>Jim Bacon personified this optimism.

Of course they are always stories that are extraordinarily negative. How often do we see the good news stories on these programs? I am very fortunate and privileged in my job to be able to visit many of the Commonwealth government departments, particularly Centrelink in Townsville. I took that opportunity some three weeks ago. It is a totally different story when you are there on the ground, when you see the staff working and the dedication and hard work that they put into looking after their customers.

That has to be remembered when we see these stories week after week on the current affairs shows; it has to be remembered that Centrelink does a fantastic job. It has a huge responsibility, but it carries it out extraordinarily well.

This is the first visit of a serving Slovenian foreign minister to Australia. It comes at a very important time for Slovenia and for relationships between our two countries. Slovenia will be joining the European Union on 1 May—one of a number of countries to be acceding to the union on 1 May. That will be a very interesting and important time for Slovenia. Slovenia has been a trading partner of Australia's for many decades now. In fact, Australia is Slovenia's largest export destination in the Asia-Pacific region. Mostly, we import tyres from Slovenia. We also export a number of goods to Slovenia, and it is interesting to note that Harvey Norman recently—last year, I believe—opened their first store in Slovenia. They see it, as I think a number of other Australian businesses see it, as a country that will be a gateway to what was formerly known as the Eastern Bloc countries as well as to Eastern Europe. The port of Koper will link goods coming by sea to Slovenia with a number of other countries beyond Slovenia's borders. It is an excellent opportunity for Australian businesses to have access to markets that are not well known to them at this time.</para></talk.start><para>It is also worth saying that Slovenia, in slightly over 10 years since it declared independence from the former Yugoslav federation, has had enormous growth in its economic prosperity. The unemployment rate is low and inflation, which used to be one of the major problems with the Yugoslav economy, has certainly been brought under control. With all of that said, it disappoints me greatly to note that when a colleague of mine tried to exchange his Slovenian tolars after a very successful trip to Slovenia some time ago he was not able to exchange them at any Australian bank. He went first of all to the ANZ and was told that they would not change his tolars for Australian dollars, and on contacting other banks it became apparent that no bank would change tolars for dollars. The money of a country like this, which is about to join the European Union and has a strong economy and low inflation, should certainly be able to be exchanged in Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Emergency Call Services</title><page.no>25847</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>25847</page.no><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LLOYD</name><name.id>IK6</name.id><electorate>Robertson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As honourable members would be aware, the other day in parliament I raised my concerns about the fact that if the American 911 emergency number were dialled in Australia it should not be diverted anywhere. I put forward a proposal that if 911 were dialled in Australia it should be immediately diverted to 000. I still maintain that that is an option, although I have since been told by Telstra that it would cause difficulties for phone numbers that already start with the prefix 911. But nothing is impossible, and I can see no reason why those prefixes should not be changed by adding another digit or some other procedure should not be put in place so that at least if children have heard the 911 number on American TV shows and they dial that number in an emergency some action is taken to assist them.</para></talk.start><para>In raising this issue, another concern has come to light. The concern is that 000, our Australian emergency number, is not known by many Australians. In fact, a survey recently conducted in Queensland showed that 50,000 Queenslanders were not aware that the Australian emergency number is 000. That is of great concern and I am sure that that figure is reflected in similar numbers throughout other states in Australia. This issue was raised when I was on a talkback radio show last night, with Stan Zemanek. I certainly agree with him that this is a concern that should be addressed, not only by Telstra but also by the Australian government. I can see no reason why the Australian government should not put more resources into a publicity campaign so that all Australians—young and old, and people from other countries—as well as visitors to this country, are fully aware that the emergency number in Australia is 000 and not 911 or any other number.</para><para>Recently, Telstra introduced a four-second recorded message on 000, which will hopefully alleviate a number of incorrect calls. Also, there are people who believe that 000 is an information service—that if they want to know something they can ring 000. Of course, it is not designed for that; it is designed for life-threatening situations, where immediate help from fire, ambulance or police services is required. Again, a publicity campaign should not only highlight the fact that the number to dial is 000 but also highlight the reasons why you dial 000—that it should be dialled only in a life-threatening situation. I use the short time I have in the parliament today to highlight my concerns about that and hopefully the government will address those concerns. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

I am at this stage, as I have been previously, a member of the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. Members of the committee had discussion on and bipartisan support for the idea that the work of the committee had not concluded, notwithstanding that the 10-year sunset clause in the legislation had expired. We were of the view that there was still work to be done and that we should approach the government—particularly the Attorney-General, and secondarily the minister responsible for Indigenous affairs—to seek agreement to an extension. It was the unanimous view of the committee that that was the best way of extending the ongoing parliamentary scrutiny of this important and evolving piece of national legislation and of the public agencies which apply and administer that important act. </para></talk.start><para>When we in the committee agreed to take that approach, I was not optimistic that we would get agreement from the government to such a proposition. We discussed alternative possibilities, including the possibility that we might—by way of resolution of each house of the parliament—establish the committee with a parliamentary authorisation rather than a legislative authorisation. But in my view the government made a quick and prompt response to the committee's representations and has introduced this legislation to extend the committee's term. I welcome that; I think it is the preferred course of action. It is not the only course of action but it is the better of those options available to us. I welcome it and I support it.</para><para>The committee has done important work, but there is more work to do. In recent times the committee has looked at the development of the idea of Indigenous land use agreements. I think it did useful work in assessing how that initiative was evolving and it reported accordingly to the parliament. It has also regularly looked at the work of the National Native Title Tribunal. Only last night it met to examine and consider the work of the Indigenous Land Corporation and the associated land fund for which it is responsible. While those things are important and they have been done, there are ongoing elements of that work and there is more work to do. I would like to come to that in a moment. </para><para>Let us have a look at the context of this situation. The native title legislation arises from the High Court's decision in Mabo. That was a controversial decision because it made a major change to the nature of land use law—property law—in Australia. There is, in my view, a misconception that it created a new right. What it did was recognise an historic right that had gone unrecognised for 200 years. It corrected an historic anomaly and injustice in our history. It disposed of the myth of terra nullius forever. Terra nullius was a flawed concept. It had perpetuated an injustice and it had flowed through our legal system and into our historic analysis and our contemporary perceptions of race relations in this country. </para><para>It has not been an easy decision for people to accommodate themselves to. While I disagree with some of the colourful things that were said at the time of the decision—some of them I thought were more than colourful; they were repugnant—many of those things were said by people of goodwill grappling to come to terms with a major change that affected them and their lives and their businesses. They have not found the adjustment easy, and I am not critical of those people for that. Some who sought to exploit their unease I am very critical of: I think they have done the nation a disservice. But many people of goodwill have found native title a difficult concept to accommodate themselves to, and I understand that. That is a legitimate position, because it is a major change and people will not easily and comfortably come to terms with such major changes.</para><para>But it is overwhelmingly a positive initiative in the Australian historical context. It is playing, and will continue to play, a positive role in the evolution of race relations, property matters and the proper application of the law in Australia. I regret some of the narrow interpretations that have been made of native title post Mabo. Some of the decisions I think are flawed; nevertheless we all live in a country with the rule of law and when courts make decisions with which we disagree we have to work with them, just as we do when they make decisions with which we agree. I will continue to speak out on this issue over the years to come. This is not the place for a generalised discussion about native title, only to say that that is the context.</para><para>The magnitude of the change means that we should not be surprised or disappointed as a parliament that we are in the process of coming to the view reflected in this legislation—that after 10 years the work of this joint committee is not finished. We envisaged initially that perhaps five years would be insufficient. We extended it to 10; now we are extending it to 12. In my view, it will probably extend beyond that—not that I am critical of the two-year extension; that is a matter of judgment for the government. A two-year extension of the role of the committee is not long, but it does take us past the next election and will enable a considered judgment to be made by the new government.</para><para>I will not take all the time available on a matter that is agreed—the parliament does not need half-hour speeches to outline why we all agree about something—but I do want to take a few moments to talk about what I think is one of the important tasks still before this committee and which I hope will be its next priority activity. That relates to the circumstance confronting the native title representative bodies—the bodies that are tasked under the act with representing the interests of applicants in native title matters and which act as very important linchpins both in the efficient operation of the act and in the just outcomes of matters proceeding under the act.</para><para>The native title representative bodies are caught in a very difficult pincer movement, and I think, with respect to colleagues of all political persuasions on the committee, it is a shared view that this is a matter we should look at—perhaps not a shared view about what the outcome of looking at it will be but a shared view that this is a matter we should examine. The native title representative bodies deal with a budget that is externally fixed by the federal government and that has not been increasing rapidly. At the moment I am not talking about the magnitude of the funding. The funding is fixed, but the tasks that they have to perform are generated externally. The government does not say, `This is the job you have to do and here is an amount of money to do it.' The government gives them an amount of money, but the courts set workload, respondents bring matters forward and people with legitimate interests saying, `I would like to make some development on a property that is the subject of native title,' can initiate a matter. The native title bodies have a necessary obligation to respond to those matters, but they do not have the capacity to control the work flow, whereas the respondents' funding is met in a more normal manner for court matters through the Attorney-General's Department to participate in native title matters.</para><para>There is a structural problem there. It is not an easy one to resolve. I do not pretend that somehow or other a magic wand will solve that problem, but one of the tasks properly before the committee, in my view, is to look at the question of how we set a proper framework for the operation of native title representative bodies. It is not only a financial matter. It is to do in some instances with their structure and in others with their area of responsibility, their relationship with applicants, their proper role and function, and funding.</para><para>But they are matters that are causing problems not just for the representative bodies—although that is where the problems are most obvious, because they are the people who have to deal with the budgetary circumstances—but sometimes for respondents and sometimes for miners, pastoralists and others who seek an outcome in relation to a land matter and find that the representative body is not able to respond as quickly as they would wish, because of other priorities and funding crises. While on the face of it this is a problem for applicants and for the native title representative bodies—and it is—it is also a problem for respondents and for those seeking agreement from representative bodies about land use matters. So I hope this will be the next issue the committee takes up—not the last one, but it is of itself sufficient to warrant this legislation.</para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I said I would speak for 15 minutes. In order to honour that commitment, let me simply say: I support the legislation. I welcome the government's prompt response to the representations from the committee chair, Senator Johnston. I congratulated him last night on the success of his representations in this matter. The two-year extension is not long, but it will take the committee past an election, and I hope that the new government will give ongoing responsibility to this committee to oversight and report to the parliament on the ongoing operations of the Native Title Act and the land fund.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>25851</page.no><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TUCKEY</name><name.id>SJ4</name.id><electorate>O'Connor</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Naturally, I too support the extension proposed in the <inline ref="R1972">Extension of Sunset of Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title Bill 2004 </inline>of the operations of the Joint Statutory Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. Clearly, the parliament has a distinct responsibility to oversight this important legislation in a bipartisan fashion. But it also therefore gives me an opportunity to comment on the operation of this legislation, and hopefully some of my remarks will be taken account of by the committee, if not by the government of Australia—or governments, given that the act requires both state and federal governments to legislate. Let me say that the failure of state governments—and, in fact, the absolute rejection of their responsibility, in the case of the Gallop government in Western Australia—to take up their responsibility to give native title, particularly in the context of pastoral leases, a substance which allowed for its resumption as it would apply in other circumstances, with appropriate compensation of which the Commonwealth promised the states it would pay 75 per cent primarily as a means of overcoming the logjam that exists in dealing with native title, was very foolish.</para></talk.start><para>I thought it was very foolish, because it accepted a principle that the High Court has virtually not designated. There could be a more appropriate or formal property right than native title. Where it might exist state governments could make even a prospective decision to resume it to allow for other development, but, where there was a proven loss arising from that native title, compensation would be paid. That is a fundamental principle of land ownership within Australia, and I think it was a major contribution to the system that was offered in the Howard government's 10- or 12-point plan that passed the parliament many years ago. I had a significant interest as the backbench chair of the committee that made those suggestions.</para><para>It was not something designed to take away from the Aboriginal people; it created an opportunity where people could get on with business that was in the national interest, if that was the view of the state. It might be a mineral claim or it might be the business of development, as I have found in my own electorate. The time taken to resolve native title issues—which sometimes, it is eventually agreed, do not exist—in order to add a small industrial estate to the boundaries of a town in one of my electoral areas is just outrageous.</para><para>Opportunities are lost. Someone comes along and says that they want to create jobs in a particular town and that a piece of land is required. They might be transferring business activity out of the city. They go down to DOLA, as the Department of Land Administration in Western Australia is known, who say, `We will now have to research all the native title issues.' By the time that research has passed through all its processes, the entrepreneur who wanted to move into the town has gone and rebuilt in the city or somewhere those issues do not apply, so the opportunities for decentralisation, jobs in rural and regional areas and economic diversity are lost. To me, that is very foolish and would have been overcome by the government simply saying: `We will resume native title rights in this area. We are not really sure what they are, but we the Commonwealth will compensate the appropriate interest groups in due course.' That still stands in the Commonwealth statute book but, of course, it has not been taken up by a single state government. As I said, it was taken up by the Court government in Western Australia, but it was overturned by the Gallop government.</para><para>In my view, the operation of native title—not the principles—is quite debilitating to the process of development, and that frequently reflects on even advantage to the local landowners, the Aboriginal people that may have native title rights. Nevertheless, it is worth putting on the record that the High Court in its Mabo judgment—and the member for Fraser gave that a fleeting remark—said that native title was not an estate in land; it was a form of access to land for certain historic and cultural purposes—for instance, the conduct of ceremonies or hunting and gathering. Of course, it is very hard to put a value on those things.</para><para>The Keating legislation, which still survives, said that, where a native title claim might be made, the participants with the exception of the claimant—that is, the prospective Aboriginal native title holders—would negotiate in good faith. For reasons I cannot understand, because it should be a universal requirement, the Aboriginal people are not required to negotiate in good faith. History proves that that has unfortunately become the right not to negotiate. The act has some provisions that allow claims and anything else to be arbitrarily taken after quite a lengthy period to the Native Title Tribunal. Other parties have to turn up to meetings to discuss issues related to that. I do not object to that but Aboriginal people frequently do not turn up, so there can be no negotiations. That is their right under the legislation.</para><para>I think that, if ever the committee wanted to uphold the good Aussie principle of a fair go, it would make it a requirement that all parties negotiate in good faith—if only to progress the matter. The great benefit that so frequently arises for claimants, whose rights to a claim are probably very shaky, is the extension of the negotiating period to a point where someone who, for instance, has a highly prospective mineral area and wants to get on with the business of development to the benefit of all asks: `Just how much do you want? How much should I pay to get you out of the road?' There may be no legitimate claim at all, but if you have spent $1 million on exploration, you have a prospective title and you want to get on with it, maybe $10,000 or $20,000 is cheap. That is fine in my mind, if there is a genuine inherent right in the claim. But, if there is not, why should people be forced to pay just to clear the decks?</para><para>A constituent of mine informed me the other day that he had eventually obtained a right to drill for oil. I would think that that is pretty important for Australia. But he has been telling me for at least three years of the battles that he has had over claims which have eventually come to nothing. There was no claim in the end because none could be substantiated, but the delays to that project might be quite expensive if he discovers oil—oil that might have been assisting Australia in its balance of payments. </para><para>I think all of us the other day got a bit of lobbying from APPEA, the petroleum export association, who told us of the great opportunities for our national economy arising from their gas reserves and how they might be better encouraged to progress those businesses. They raised the issue—which other sectors of the minerals industry are raising with government—of flowthrough shares. Flowthrough shares virtually mean that, if you invest in a company that is in exploration, the losses that that company incurs in its processes of exploration can flow back to the shareholder, who can then of course reduce their personal income in that process. However it is described, it is virtually a tax incentive to encourage people to invest in exploration. Prior to the Native Title Act, no such incentive was needed. I am not sure that flowthrough shares will overcome the problems that people experience through the delays to their right to explore and develop that arise from the failings of the Native Title Act or the failure of state governments, who are the land administrators, to take up the options that are inherent in the Commonwealth act as it was amended.</para><para>None of this is designed to take anything away from genuine applications for native title. It is all about speeding things so that both parties can come out of it with a better arrangement. That is very important. I think, consequently, that this committee in its extended life should be coming back to the parliament with some clear recommendations as to how we can get the situation moving. If an Aboriginal group has a legitimate claim that can be resolved, it might be resolved if all parties were obliged to turn up to the negotiation session. But one party turns up and the other does not and it drags on and on until it becomes a tribunal issue and then the tribunal has a backlog. It may then extend to a court somewhere and the court will have a backlog too. Who wins from that? Nobody. In fact there could be a unique situation where a native title right could be resumed on a pastoral property, which is mostly where these developments occur, and it could be paid out in due course in compensation. That is something that would benefit all parties.</para><para>On the matter of native title, I think the Kimberley Land Council were complaining the other day that they were short of funds to proceed with certain legal cases. This is another issue. We have all this litigation associated with these matters, and huge expense. Unfortunately in some cases the defendants—those who consider they are the titleholders under the laws of Australia—find themselves entering into huge legal costs with no assistance financially, whilst the applicant has been virtually 100 per cent funded by the government. But we find today that, for certain land councils, the funding they have under the current methods of distribution is insufficient.</para><para>As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, a group of members of parliament made a submission to the Hatton inquiry, which was looking into the financing and funding associated with ATSIC. They made a suggestion, which I stand by very strongly, about the current tops-down funding process, as I refer to it, where a very large amount of money is transferred to ATSIC—now ATSIS, because the government has decided to take back the chequebook from ATSIC, for reasons that have been well publicised. There are funding decisions made in Canberra that eventually filter down through a series of Aboriginal organisations and a fraction of the money eventually arrives in the areas where it is needed most. We proposed to that inquiry that we should reverse the funding—that we should take up the local government model, where the Commonwealth government allocates an amount of money and it is distributed immediately and in full to the 727 local authorities.</para><para>If one looks at the language borders that have been laid out by the Institute of Aboriginal Affairs—I think it was them; I have certainly seen a map in their building—there are just over 300 acknowledged language areas. I am of the belief that they would probably come up as the appropriate boundaries for a series of Aboriginal local authorities. I choose to call them boards of trust, and I do that because I openly admit, from my own long experience in dealing with Aboriginal people, that they are under huge family pressures if they are the keepers of money. There needs to be a process to protect them from those pressures. They are not dishonest but they can get trapped into doing things that are not compatible with the administration of public moneys. So I call them boards of trust. I see a process were all that money is identified in the budget, similar to the local government funding, and the Commonwealth Grants Commission would decide how much each of those boards of trusts receive on a weighted per capita basis.</para><para>We know how to do that. They are experts in that field. There is no politics in it—we are not running around buying votes or anything like that. We make a commitment—it is quite a huge amount of money—and then that body sit there and make judgments as to where they want that money to go. They might make judgments about contributions to their local hospital to get better amenities. For instance, I would hope that, rather than funding Aboriginal health, which frequently puts another GP in a town that desperately needs specialist services and does not need two GPs—it is just not big enough—those people sitting in judgment with their own money would make better expenditure decisions.</para><para>I propose that the trustee of those funds might be the nearest local government authority, which in some cases would be an Aboriginal council but one subject to the laws of the state in terms of prudential arrangements. They would be there to countersign cheques and give some protection to the boards if they were asked to make financial commitments that were not within the guidelines. I would like to think that the parliament and the government were prepared to further discuss that.</para><para>I was very impressed with the support my submission got. Some 12 or 15 MPs wrote letters of support for those fundamentals. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> started to try and say, `Tuckey is saying that Aboriginals cannot manage money'. That was not what I was saying. Some of them can do it very well. As an example, I used to cash tens of thousands of dollars worth of cheques in my hotel for hardworking Aboriginal people who had jobs on the main roads and so on, and they always wanted $5 or $10 in single dollar notes to settle with the rellies, who knew it was payday and were waiting outside. They knew they had to take the bulk of that money home to their wife and family, but they were also under pressure to share what they had with others who might have been worse off. Unfortunately, that situation progresses right up to someone who has to manage money that the Commonwealth has provided. I think there needs to be a process. Some might have a different idea of how to do it, but the fundamental of our proposal was that the money should go out on the ground where the real need is and that people living there should make decisions within guidelines as to how it would be expended. The management of that money, we thought, was important and we did not leave that out of our submission.</para><para>I just add that to the day because, to the extent to which the community would want to fund native title issues, I would like to think that the process did not put pressure financially on people and that there were simpler and better arrangements. That is why I raise that matter also. I note that I am running out of time, so I will close my remarks. It is an important issue and it is important that Australia continues to have economic growth, if only to make sure that it has funds available through the taxation system, the royalty system and other proposals to help people in need, whatever their ethnic background. I think we have had too many delays. I think the mining industry has a false hope that they can extend their exploration activities by taxation incentives unless the administrative processes they must deal with today with native title are made more effective.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>25854</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R1972">Extension of Sunset of Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title Bill 2004</inline> because it gives me the opportunity to raise some issues which I think are extremely important in the way this parliament operates and communicates its deliberations to the people of Australia and the sad state of affairs concerning native title in this country at the moment. I would like to say at the outset that I support the extension of the sunset clause contained in section 207 of the Native Title Act. This would allow for a further two years sitting, to 2006, of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund.</para></talk.start><para>Having briefly looked at some of the committee's work over the years, including the minutes of the most recent meeting of 12 February 2004, it is obvious that there is a real need for such a committee. I would perhaps go further and suggest that a standing committee on native title be put in place such is the importance, to my mind, of this issue and the operation of the Native Title Act. As Richard Ah Mat, Executive Director of the Cape York Land Council, stated last November in a paper on public administration and governance on CapeYork Peninsula, `family, kinship and traditional ownership could be used as a model of good governance' in this country. Traditional ownership, land rights, native title or whatever you want call it, this goes to the heart of Aboriginal culture and heritage in this country. Aboriginal people know this, but whitefellas like to ignore it.</para><para>As the speech of the member for O'Connor reflected just now, native title is more and more being seen as a process to facilitate development rather than to redress traditional ownership issues. Money is running the agenda, not cultural heritage issues and Aboriginal sovereignty. Therefore, if this parliament claims to truly represent the people of Australia, it must ensure that traditional ownership and native title is dealt with in an appropriate manner. This is not happening at the moment. The joint committee, I feel, has a role to play here. I note the House does have a standing committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs and I would assume that it works closely with the joint committee on native title.</para><para>Unfortunately, my brief reading of the work of the joint committee as it currently stands and my many discussions with Aboriginal people in the Illawarra and my own electorate of Cunningham in New South Wales would suggest that there is a lot wrong with the native title system as it operates in this country in 2004. There are obviously many reasons for this, not least of which are the recent High Court decisions, especially Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v. State of Victoria &amp; Ors, which has stripped away the ability of ordinary members of Australia's Indigenous community to obtain access to native title rights and other traditional rights.</para><para>The access of the native peoples of this country to native title is now so much more difficult than the promise that was held out when the Mabo decision came down over a decade ago. Native title for the Aboriginal people of my electorate of Cunningham, a metropolitan, semi-urban area located south of Sydney, is now just a dream. It is a dream that they have been pursuing with vigour since the mid-1990s, but it is one which has failed to bring forward any real, positive outcomes. I wonder whether the members of the joint committee truly understand the feeling out there in the Indigenous community with regard to this issue and how whitefella law and politicians have let them down.</para><para>I would also suggest that few people in Australia are aware of the work of the joint committee or of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. But, as I believe native title is such an important issue and one which goes to the very heart of empowering the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this country, I am nevertheless supportive of their work.</para><para>In preparing to speak to this bill I cast my mind back to 1988, the year of the bicentennial, when there was a real flourish of interest in the true history of this country. Around that time landmark publications such as Henry Reynolds's <inline font-style="italic">Frontier </inline>and Eric Wilmot's <inline font-style="italic">Pemulw</inline><inline font-style="italic">uy appeared to show whitefella historians like me that we had been lied to, that our history had been distorted and that Aborigines had been excised from the historical accounts of the development of the nation of Australia since the white invasion of 1788. Perhaps the book that most influenced me was a smallish one by Peter Turbet, entitled </inline><inline font-style="italic">The Aborigines of the Sydney District Before 1788</inline>. This little book reinforced to me the simple fact that in the Illawarra, an area where my family has resided since 1839, the Aboriginal people actually lived for thousands of years. This might seem like an obvious statement, but it was one that was not really understood by a lot of Australians prior to the time of the bicentennial.</para><para>Growing up in the northern Illawarra, surrounded by housing estates, I saw no obvious evidence of Aboriginal occupation. This is a rather sad indictment of our history. I was not told about the Aboriginal history of Australia and the Illawarra by any of my teachers at school. I knew about Aborigines out in the Australian deserts, but I did not know about Aboriginal people in society, living in urban areas such as the Illawarra. I was not told the truth. The bicentennial opened the eyes of hundreds of thousands of Australians to the fact that we whitefellas were recent arrivals only and that the more than 40,000 years of Aboriginal occupation prior to that was real, meant something and needed to be accepted and recognised. We as a nation have been trying to do that ever since—though government, the law and vested interests both within and without the Aboriginal community have been getting in the way.</para><para>The call for land rights throughout the sixties, seventies and eighties gave rise to the Mabo decision in the early nineties. We also saw a realisation that assimilation did not work; it was abhorrent. Under the mantle of reconciliation, Australians hoped to solve some of the core issues facing our ongoing relationship with Aboriginal society. It seemed as though all the problems would be solved in the short term, as there was obviously a lot of goodwill in the general community. The mistakes of the past were now out there, exposed for everyone to see. But, no; we have not progressed nearly far enough. Today the picture is perhaps grimmer than it was back in 1988.</para><para>I can only comment on what I know. I can only comment on what I have gathered from talking with Aboriginal people in my electorate of Cunningham and the Illawarra and the South Coast in general. I was fortunate in that in 1988-89, as a local historian, I was able to publish a work which reproduced historical accounts of the Illawarra and South Coast Aboriginal people, dating back to Captain Cook sailing by the area in April of 1770. My book has been widely dispersed among the local community, both black and white. Just like the work of Henry Reynolds, it has revealed to our community some of the tragic events which occurred when white people invaded this country, took away the land from the local people and—make no mistake about it—engaged in atrocities such as poisoning, murder and rape. Dispossession was as real in my home town of Bulli and in Wollongong as it was in every other part of Australia. Native title was real. Charles Throsby Smith, the first white settler in Wollongong in 1818, later wrote when reminiscing in the 1860s:</para><quote><para>The Aborigines owned the authority of Chiefs, in a certain degree. Old Bundle was the name of the chief who claimed Wollongong, and no end of tribute have I paid to his Majesty, in the shape of tea, sugar, flour, meat, &amp;c ... Timbery, however, claimed Berkeley.</para></quote><para>There we have clear evidence that the local Aboriginal people claimed ownership of the land—clear evidence that they did not hand over or sell their land to the British invaders and clear evidence that they were basically ignored, belittled by the British legal system. The local Aboriginal people owned the land, but this was never recognised. The Native Title Act does not redress this basic injustice. When we look at the minutes of the 12 February 2004 meeting of the joint committee and we read the statements by the Director of Service Delivery, the Registrar and the President of the Native Title Tribunal, we must unfortunately take their comments with a grain of salt.</para><para>While I am sure the members of the National Native Title Tribunal are doing their best under the circumstances and the legislative framework that is forced upon them, I believe that the whole system is flawed. There is ample comment within the Aboriginal community that the native title system is not working. There is lots of talk that this government is especially keen on making sure it does not work in the best interests of the native peoples of this country. Why is that? I believe it is because it is all about land. In this country, land, land ownership, the rights to the resources under or above that land and the profits to be made therein, drive the whole land rights and native title debate. And this is where my experiences come in with regard to the Illawarra. When looking at the work of the joint committee over the last decade, I note that it has travelled widely throughout Australia, but, in my opinion, it seems that most of its work has focused on remote areas. This is reasonable, I suppose, considering that large numbers of Aboriginal communities are located in these areas and there is a lot of mining and exploration in these areas which require the quick settlement of native title issues for the development to proceed. The previous speech, by the member for O'Connor, pointed out some of those issues. But it seems that native title is not hitting the ground in urban and metropolitan areas of Australia. The fact is that it should be. These areas contain large Aboriginal communities, usually composed of traditional owners and others who have come to the cities from regional and outback areas. That is right: in areas such as Sydney, Melbourne and Wollongong there are traditional owners—owners who have rights to native title—but this often not considered or recognised. Sure, a lot of the land in these metropolitan and urban areas has been alienated—that is, it is no longer classified as crown land. But the fact remains that, in areas such as the Illawarra, we still have the Timbery family and others like them, who were dispossessed by white settlers such as Charles Throsby Smith back in the 1810s and 1820s and who have never been compensated. This is a basic injustice which needs to be redressed.</para><para>Just two weeks ago, I facilitated a meeting between some local Illawarra elders and senior management of ATSIS and the office of the minister. During that meeting, which lasted for just on an hour, we tried to talk about all those native title and land ownership issues as they affect the Aboriginal community in the Illawarra. We spoke about how native title claims have been submitted by local elders from about 1994 onwards. We spoke about how the vast majority of those claims have been expunged, ticked off, removed, deleted or whatever by the New South Wales Native Title Service without any real consultation with the people who put in the claims. We spoke about how local councils such as Wollongong City Council and Shellharbour Council have been able to proceed with inappropriate, environmentally destructive developments—developments which destroyed known Aboriginal heritage sites such as at Sandon Point—and how those councils have been able to tick off any so-called native title issues because of the action of the New South Wales Native Title Service in facilitating this process. It is clearly believed by the local people—and I agree—that the New South Wales Native Title Service operated in the interests of shire local councils and developers, and against the interests of the local Aboriginal community, in these matters.</para><para>This has been going on for almost a decade now. It is obvious that native title is not working for the Aboriginal people of the Illawarra. The fact is it should work; it should work for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this nation. It should work because, as I said earlier, native title and traditional land ownership lies at the heart of Aboriginal culture and society. We know about the recent problems at Redfern, which are mere symptoms of the general malaise. We know about the poor health of Aboriginal people in this country, about their high levels of incarceration, about their poverty, low rates of employment and difficulties in accessing education. We know that, as an invading community, we have failed the Indigenous people of this nation. Since day one, we have imposed our so-called civilisation upon theirs—we have treated them inhumanely and with an arrogance which shames us all. We have refused to empower the native peoples of this land. Where are their representatives in this House? Where is the recognition of their traditional law and customs within white law? As the latest issue of the <inline font-style="italic">National Indigenous Times </inline>proclaims: `The great divide continues: Yearbook's black figures'. That is the headline and it goes on to show various graphs and tables revealing the shocking state of Aboriginal disadvantage within this country.</para><para>There is, of course, a way out of this. It is a relatively simple way. It is to recognise the legitimacy of Aboriginal culture, heritage, society and relationship to the land. As Richard Ah Mat points out, the Aboriginal people of Australia `demand the right to take responsibility'. Alongside responsibility must come power, and this is something which whitefella society obviously does not want to relinquish. Whilst ever millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds meant to assist Aboriginal communities are wasted by bureaucracy and never actually hit the ground or get to those communities, nothing much will change. This is where I must say I agree with the member for O'Connor on the fact that we have to make sure that a lot of those millions of dollars do get down to the local communities, the local Aboriginal people, who need that money—rather than it being frittered away before it reaches them. </para><para>Whilst ever governments—whether they be local, state or federal—in this country refuse to give Aboriginal leaders power and responsibility or to allow Aboriginal communities to manage themselves, instead clinging to the old missionary `we know best' attitude, then nothing much will change. As long as governance mechanisms undermine Aboriginal traditional culture then nothing much will change. As Richard Ah Mat points out, `Native title is both a positive and negative for the Aboriginal community.' In the paper he delivered last November he stated: </para><quote><para>Native title on its own has thrown up new relationships and questions that we in the Indigenous community have never considered before. For example, many of our people have lived for over a hundred years or more outside their traditional lands. Many call home the lands of their neighbouring clans. What is their decision making role in the development of these Indigenous lands? The actual granting of native title creates for the first time in our history the possibility of a feudal hierarchy of decision making based on family ties to traditional lands. But our traditional society never admitted the possibility of a landowner being a law maker as in the kind of ownership exercised by an English baron or earl over his country estate and all of the peoples on it. So what is the role of traditional landownership that we want to develop? </para></quote><para>In summary, it is issues such as this which the joint committee needs to address. I hope it can do this over the next two years. I hope it can address some of the major problems facing native title in this country. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>25859</page.no><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name><name.id>IJ4</name.id><electorate>Lingiari</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to be able to speak today to the <inline ref="R1972">Extension of Sunset of Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title Bill 2004</inline> to extend the life of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, as established by part 12 of the Native Title Act 1993.

I say that because at the time the native title bill was first passed I held the seat of the Northern Territory and I now hold the seat of Lingiari, where around 48 per cent of my constituents are Indigenous Australians. That obviously means that I have got the highest concentration of Indigenous Australians of any electorate—far higher than Kalgoorlie—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Pyne</name></talker><para>—Sturt.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name></talker><para>—and much higher than Sturt, Grey, Maranoa or any others around Australia that you might name. Prior to entering parliament I was an employee of the Central Land Council in Alice Springs. I was involved in that capacity in many debates with the then Hawke Labor government over the issue of national land rights. I will come to that issue a little later on. Having been engaged and involved—proudly, I might say—with the discussions about and the development of the first piece of native title legislation, I was then in 1996 unfortunately shown the door by my voters. But that was an opportunity—and they sensibly changed their minds 2½ years later.</para></talk.start></continue><para>During a substantial period of that 2½ years I worked as a policy adviser for the National Indigenous Working Group on Native Title, at a time when native title legislation was facing amendments in this parliament. I well recall those days, because of the frustration that was experienced by many Indigenous Australians about the way in which native title legislation was proceeding, the way in which the law was changing as a result of various High Court decisions and the way in which certain conservative elements of the Australian community were seeking to limit native title. We saw that in the way in which the amendments that were passed in 1998 effectively provided a capacity for mass extinguishment of native title around Australia and changed the basis under which native title could be pursued by many who would otherwise have been entitled to think they were legitimate native title holders.</para><para>That raises significant questions, and I think we need to understand that this is a matter of great interest but also an intellectual challenge, because it is around the issue of how Indigenous title has been superseded by the Crown and then how the Crown has dealt with land and its impact upon that title. As I have said, we have seen mechanisms set up so that native title rights can be extinguished—by the Crown alienating from itself title by saying that if land is used for particular purposes that means that that land has been alienated and therefore native title has been extinguished. In 1998 we saw huge lists—I recall them well—of what areas of land in every state and territory in Australia would now no longer be available for native title claims. As a result, the proportion of Indigenous Australians who actually have access to native title is very limited indeed.</para><para>But it is nevertheless extremely important for those who do, and there are structures that have been put in place for them. One is the National Native Title Tribunal, which the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund has the responsibility of reviewing, particularly in relation to its annual reports. I was not present, although I am a member of the committee, but last night in this house that committee sat and perused and examined the board of the Indigenous Land Corporation, or at least its executive officer and chair, Shirley McPherson. </para><para>I am sure you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, that the creation of the ILC was part of a negotiated arrangement with Indigenous Australians in 1993. It was part of a package of arrangements. There would be an Indigenous Land Fund, which the Indigenous Land Corporation would administer; there would be native title legislation, for which the National Native Title Tribunal is fundamental; and there would be a social justice package. Of course, the Keating government was defeated in 1996 and, although it was progressing towards a social justice package, that social justice package has never been put in place. That is a significant issue because when we look at native title we need to understand that it was recognised by government at the time that native title was not a possibility for some Indigenous Australians, given the nature, as I said earlier, of the law and the way in which the High Court then interpreted and has successively interpreted native title. So it was therefore seen as important that the Indigenous Land Fund be created, to provide the possibility at least that Indigenous Australians who did not have access to land rights under state jurisdictions or under federal law would be able to have access to some lands.</para><para>Then there was to be the social justice package. It is important that we understand that the deal has not been completed and that the social justice package has never been provided. As a parliament, despite the fact that governments change, we need to comprehend and accept responsibility for the fact that an arrangement—which was agreed to by a previous government and which led to the development of the Indigenous Land Corporation and the passing of the native title legislation—was part of a deal which had a third leg. Governments have a responsibility, in my view, to live up to that deal, and we need to understand that it is extremely important that we do.</para><para>I note that the previous speaker spoke about the inadequacies of the Native Title Act in terms of the ability for Indigenous people in his own electorate to access land under the native title legislation. As I said earlier, we need to comprehend that, as a result of the way in which the law has developed, it is unlikely that will change. We need to also understand that state and territory governments have a responsibility to look at other ways of dealing with land issues through land rights legislation.</para><para>We should understand that native title legislation and land rights legislation are very different: native title legislation is the evolution through the common law, and land rights legislation is statutory law. The strongest piece of legislation, in terms of either native title or land rights law, is a piece of statutory legislation passed by this parliament in 1976: the Northern Territory land rights legislation. It provides people with rights as a result of this parliament giving due consideration to a report of a royal commission; it gives people rights which are far stronger in many ways than they could otherwise achieve under native title legislation. That is why, as I said earlier, there was an engagement with the Hawke Labor government in the mid-eighties over land rights. No doubt, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall—although the member for Sturt was probably too young—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Pyne</name></talker><para>—What year are we talking about?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name></talker><para>—About the time you were in grade 3, I suspect. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that there was a push by the then Labor government, with Minister Clyde Holding and Prime Minister Hawke, to introduce national land rights legislation. It was effectively stymied because what was planned was to weaken the Aboriginal Land Rights Act so that it would conform with what the Western Australian government in particular, under Premier Brian Burke, was prepared to accept, along with the mining industry. I am happy to say that I was part of the organisation of the Central Land Council, under the then leadership of Pat Dodson, and the National Federation of Land Councils that took on the responsibility to make sure that legislation was not passed in that form, and we succeeded. We maintained the strength of the Northern Territory land rights act and it has been maintained ever since.</para></talk.start></continue><para>When we think about the development of law in this country, we need to understand that we have the responsibility and the power in this place to make laws which will benefit Indigenous Australians. In this particular case the parliament chose to do it in a way which gives strong powers to Indigenous Australians. In the native title legislation, however, as a result of the way in which the native title law is being changed, both through this parliament and as a result of the High Court determinations, we have taken a step backwards. What has happened as a result is that many Aboriginal people, Indigenous Australians, have seen what they thought were their native title rights being extinguished, and that is a matter of grave concern.</para><para>In relation to the development of native title and, in particular, the way in which it has been dealt with by the respective state and territory governments, prior to the election of the Martin Labor government in the Northern Territory 2½ years ago now the former CLP government in the Northern Territory refused to deal with native title. Indeed, it froze applications for development on pastoral leases in the Northern Territory for an extensive period because it was not prepared to allow the Native Title Act to impose a regime upon the Northern Territory for the deliberation of native title. That was, of course, an act of lunacy, but the decisions were taken and this was done for base political purposes—for the same reasons that over time successive CLP governments in the Northern Territory chose to use race, racism, the land rights act and Aboriginal rights as a wedge in the community for political purposes. That was not much better—in fact, it was probably a lot worse in many respects—than the Hansonite movement in the last decade.</para><para>It is important to understand that when the new Labor government were elected in the Northern Territory they decided that they would adopt a different approach. In the previous 27 years of conservative government in the Northern Territory, every time there was a conflict it was taken off to the courts. The most litigious government in Australia in relation to Indigenous interests was the conservative Northern Territory government—the one which should have been the most responsible. It perennially took these matters to the courts. The new Labor government under Clare Martin adopted an entirely different approach. They took the view that the way to settle issues over native title and land rights, where there was a conflict of views or a difference of opinion, was to sit down and negotiate—to end the litigation. And, whilst there are still test cases which have been put to test the limits of the law on native title, what has happened since has been groundbreaking—indeed, breathtaking—in that there has been discussion, negotiation and compromise between the Northern Territory government and their agents, and the native title applicants, native title holders and the Northern Territory land councils acting as the representative bodies in the Northern Territory. Historically speaking, it is unprecedented.</para><para>This parliament could do a lot worse than to look at the way in which the Northern Territory government have operated in relation to native title as a blueprint for what other governments and jurisdictions should be doing. I say that with all sincerity. Things are not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but the improvements are palpable. We need to know that the outcomes are obvious to all concerned. Particularly, by treating Indigenous Australians as equals, sitting opposite them at the table and negotiating deals and arrangements, you know you can benefit all sides and the whole community, and there is no conflict. To me, that is the way to proceed. Yet, historically—and I have to say this—it is not the way in which conservative governments in this country have chosen to operate, because they have not been able to. They have chosen to use issues of race, land rights and native title as a wedge for base political purposes.</para><para>It is incumbent upon the government to ensure that the representative bodies which are set up under the Native Title Act are properly resourced. We know—and we only need to look at the submissions which have been made to this committee, the life of which we are extending today—that those native title representative bodies have been significantly underresourced. Whilst the National Native Title Tribunal has money almost dripping out of its pockets, the organisations which are there to represent the interests of the native title holders—those who were given that responsibility by the government—are underresourced. We have seen only in recent weeks how the Kimberley Land Council, which is the native title representative body for the Kimberley in north-western Western Australia, has had to withdraw from native title hearings because of a lack of resources. It did not have the funds.</para><para>That is what produces the injustice about this process. If the representative bodies do not have the resources to represent properly the interests of the native title holders in hearings over native title, whose rights are going to be extinguished further? It will be those of the native title holders and native title applicants. It is extremely important that this government and the next government, which will be a Latham Labor government, understand that they have a responsibility to ensure that these organisations are properly resourced. Whilst periodically we hear stories of these representative bodies going off the rails, the fact is that they are crucial and vital if we are to actually achieve any measure of justice under the native title legislation.</para><para>I know that the two representative bodies which work in the Northern Territory—the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council—are responsible and well managed organisations. They both do their jobs properly and represent adequately—indeed, I think very successfully—the interests of native title applicants and native title holders, whom they also represent. The land councils were set up under the Northern Territory land rights act in the first instance, but they represent the interests of those people who claim land under the land rights act and, subsequently, manage their affairs.</para><para>As a previous member said, if we are to provide a measure of justice to Indigenous Australians, we have to accept our responsibilities in this place to be wise about what we do. I am sorry to say that the amendments passed in this place in 1998 were in many ways not wise. The mass extinguishment of native title does us no good at all. It might have relieved the interests of those in the community who were scared after Mr Howard put a map on TV—you all recall that—saying that all this part of Australia would have its land extinguished in terms of native title, you would not be able to live on it, backyards would go and all this sort of nonsense. As a nation we are better than that. We need to accept that we have a responsibility to show the world community that we are better than that. We should not be concerned when the United Nations want to look at our record, unlike this government, which chose to refuse a United Nations committee the right to come and look at what we were doing in relation to native title and Indigenous issues. That is not right; it is inappropriate. We need to understand that we have responsibilities which we must carry out in a way which meets the needs of the whole Australian community.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>25863</page.no><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PYNE</name><name.id>9V5</name.id><electorate>Sturt</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It gives me great pleasure to be summing up for the Attorney-General today the debate on the <inline ref="R1972">Extension of Sunset of Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title Bill 2004</inline>.

I do not have the long history or the huge number of Indigenous constituents that the honourable member for Lingiari has, but I am sure that he would recognise that I was actively involved in the debates about native title in 1994 and spoke in those in the House on numerous occasions. I was one of the coalition MPs who at the time, in my first term in this place, argued for a measured and moderate response to the native title issue that was on the agenda. Now, 10 years later, I am sure we can say with some confidence that the hype that existed at that time from either the enormous expectations or the fear that some people had of native title has not been fulfilled. In fact, native title has been appropriately managed in those 10 years by both Labor and Liberal governments.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The member for Lingiari's speech was yet again an impassioned one about Indigenous issues in his electorate, but it did not touch very much on the extension of the sunset clause for the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. I will not argue with him about mass extinguishment of native title, about which Deputy Speaker Causley knows a great deal more than I do, or the point that he was desperately trying to get in—a new issue about United Nations committees visiting Aboriginal settlements in the Northern Territory—at the last minute there. The member for Lingiari has a history of ranging over many subjects when he gets the chance to do so. He did so again today.</para><para>He did make a couple of points which are worth responding to. He did say that he thought we should have a permanent standing committee on native title and the Aboriginal land fund. I do not agree with him about that. I think the parliament has it right. The native title committee was always to be a temporary committee. It had a five-year life then a five-year extension. We have now suggested—and Labor are supporting—a two-year extension for that committee. And there are good reasons for that. It is good that the parliament is flexible about its committee system. There is no point in enshrining in the standing orders or in the parliament committees that become irrelevant and building up a foundation that makes it very hard to remove them for one reason or another. There is no point in having a proliferation of committees focusing on subjects that will not need to be dealt with in the future. Sunset clauses are entirely appropriate.</para><para>The member for Lingiari also talked about the intellectual challenge that native title presented to people in the 1990s. I agree with him about that. Some of the best legal minds in the country were working on native title, both when the Keating government introduced the native title bill and when the Howard government had to deal with issues following the judgment on Mabo in the High Court. The minister at the time, Nick Minchin, from the Senate, was responsible for making changes and ensuring that it was a workable system, and he did that. It was a very interesting and intellectual challenge for all of us in this parliament to deal with native title over that time.</para><para>The member for Lingiari also said that the land available for native title is limited but important. I agree that it is limited and it is important, but it is also appropriate. The Howard government achieved the right balance not to please but to deal with all of the various stakeholders that were involved in the debate at the time. Many people would have liked to have seen native title disappear off the radar screen in its entirety; others wanted to extend it much further than either the High Court or the parliament had ever intended. A balance was struck by the Howard government, and an outcome was achieved.</para><para>The member for Cunningham made an unusual contribution to the debate. He did not comment on the sunset clause at all but ranged widely over a whole lot of statements that failed in being backed up by any facts. One of the more extraordinary remarks that he made was that he thought native title should be extended into metropolitan areas. I think the member for Cunningham needs to understand the system of native title. Perhaps he needs to work out the meanings of extinguishment and alienation of land. Obviously it is not possible under the decisions of the High Court or the parliament to have native title where land has already been alienated. The member for Cunningham should perhaps find that out for himself by doing some more research.</para><para>I commend the matter to the Main Committee. It is an appropriate sunset clause. I note that the Labor Party are supporting the government's position, and I thank them for that. I think it indicates the continual renewal of the committee system of which we have all been part. I thank the member for Fraser, the member for Lingiari, the member for Cunningham and, of course, the member for O'Connor—who made an erudite and useful contribution to the debate—for their contributions and commend the bill to the chamber.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para><para>Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2003-2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>25864</page.no><id.no>R1975</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 4) 2003-2004</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1976</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 2) 2003-2004</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1977</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 4) 2003-2004</title><type>Bills</type></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>25864</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 2 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slipper</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMullan</inline> moved by way of amendment:</para><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>“whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its budget waste and mismanagement, and wrong priorities which have resulted in:</para><para>(1)	a costly Medicare `safety net' which does not protect families from increasing health costs and declining levels of bulk billing;</para><para>(2)	inadequate funding and higher fees for students seeking access to higher education;</para><para>(3)	a growing number of families who are financially squeezed and trying to balance work and family; and</para><para>(4)	500,000 Australians waiting up to five years to get their teeth fixed”.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>25865</page.no><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ADAMS</name><name.id>BV5</name.id><electorate>Lyons</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are debating the additional estimates of 2003-04 through <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline>, <inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> and <inline ref="R1977">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline>. These are relatively straightforward bills which, as supply bills, we all know will pass without opposition. However, many members and senators may oppose the policies which these bills reflect. It has become obvious in the last couple of weeks that problems are hidden in the delivery of programs around Australia. We have heard about the difficulties many students have had in accessing appropriate and affordable education and training. University places have been cut back or have been priced out of the local market, and many students have been guided towards TAFE education. They have replaced many of the young people who were seeking a TAFE course as a first preference and who are now unlikely to be able to find a place in their chosen course.</para></talk.start><para>It is very sad that our children are not getting the opportunities they need to gain qualifications. We know that literacy is very important in the early years, but, as one travels through the schooling system, once literacy has been mastered there are many other courses that are important in the development of a job-ready person. It worries me as I watch what is happening to our young people—mainly the teenage boys who are constantly finding themselves in trouble with the law and the community. They have lost their way through the education system and now have nothing to fall back on. I watch our teenagers and compare them with teenagers and young men in other countries. There are striking similarities—and I talk of suicide bombers in the Middle East and the ethnic problems we have in our cities. They are young, energetic men who have little hope, who are totally disaffected by the current world and who are ripe for brainwashing by whatever cult happens along at the time. We have had the Eastern and Western religious cults, and now we have the Middle East varieties tied up with the Muslim fundamentalists. These cults come and go, but they run their course. They take with them the flower of our youth—in particular, teenage boys. We cannot as a nation afford to have that happen.</para><para>This means our society is failing them. It means that there are few programs in place to help young people make the transition from school to work. Having a home and a training course is becoming only a dream for many of our young people. Centrelink is making so many errors that young people are being breached for problems beyond their control. It is making them hopeless and angry. How can you explain 1.3 million mistakes affecting 700,000 Centrelink clients over a four-month period? No wonder people are disillusioned about the sort of help they might look forward to—help that they do not get. If you read the Centrelink manuals, you can understand why these mistakes are made. Whoever wrote them must be held to blame—not the employees at the coalface of Centrelink. The manuals are muddled, confused and sometimes downright contradictory. Government changes the guidelines as it goes along, usually in some centralised computer system, and every time there is a change the procedures become more and more complex. The old customer officer struggles to keep up. No wonder there are mistakes. This is what the government is doing to us.</para><para>Then look at what has happened at the other end of the scale with regard to our old people. Access to nursing homes is becoming critical. Our pensioners are queueing up to get a place and still more wait hopelessly for the type of care that they actually want. Couples are being split up as there are no spaces available. After spending their lives together, we are not giving them the option to be able to spend the last years of their lives together. Some people are hovering at home without the necessary backup and care. Now we have the government trying to seek funds from the elderly to prop up commercial nursing homes. We are seeing another try by this government to bring in nursing-home bonds because they have been so tardy in sorting out the management problems facing nursing homes. The charitable groups are giving up trying to make ends meet with their homes and they are selling them off.</para><para>The program that really needs more funds, of course, is Medicare. It has been stripped and threatened for years, and it is sadly in need of renewal. It should be more than a safety net; it should be a universal care provider. Instead, this government is just increasing dollars to doctors without looking at the overall need to improve hospital funding and access to doctors, and without actually looking at programs that would encourage doctors to practise in regional areas. Add to this the obstructions put in the path of overseas-trained doctors who come to Australia and try to help the chronic shortage of doctors in regional Australia, and one gets the picture of a rather sick country, with people too scared to go to the doctor in case they cannot afford to pay the bill.</para><para>This has also been happening for ages with dental care. Labor's dental programs have been totally abolished. We have a policy to bring them back. This government knocked all those programs out. There are people who have been waiting for months with a toothache. Nothing is more debilitating than a constant toothache, yet many older people cannot get near a dentist unless they pay up front. It is a national disgrace. People do not want to hear about how Australia can get a budget surplus; they want to know how and when they can get their teeth fixed. They want to see some of that budget surplus not being wasted on getting the government re-elected but actually being spent on practical things like fixing their teeth. They do not want to hear about tenders and deals; they want to hear about jobs and the assistance to get them. </para><para>It is enormously disappointing to hear nothing about the things that really matter to people in these bills that are being considered. In fact, the bills seem to be about saving money to create a surplus to spend at elections, rather than about spending it on the people who really need it. Evidence of this has come out in the papers today, as the government is trying to sweeten a budget deemed to be aimed at winning over sectional interests that might have been turning to Labor. The government is throwing money at the different groups it has broken promises to in the past. Why has it waited so long? The veterans have finally managed to win some concessions but this is only in part honouring the promises that were given to them. There is nothing new; it is just honouring the promises that were given to them. </para><para>There are still niggling discrimination problems within that system so that some veterans are getting payments while others miss out. Veteran groups are very strong on the fact that the special rate is still being eroded: instead of losing $78 per fortnight over seven years, veterans are likely to lose approximately $30 a fortnight over the next seven years—hardly keeping up with inflation. It reminds me of the Malaysia-Borneo veterans—people who fought for so long to be recognised as having been in combat and then missed out on the many privileges because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. I wonder now what will happen to those who served in the gulf and in Iran and all the peacekeeping missions in recent years. Are they to be eligible for some decent assistance when they suffer illness or suffer as a result of the service that they have given our great country? We are always getting cases that fall between the guidelines of assistance because of technicalities. The government needs to sort this out once and for all. </para><para>The government have also been throwing money at private education instead of singling out those schools that have been living on nothing for decades. They have been tossing funds into the private school pot without any developmental work going on at all. They are just giving it to their old mates—that is, to the schools that they went to.</para><para>In trying to get the Medicare package through, the Minister for Health and Ageing is trying to bribe the Democrats into supporting a safety net threshold at a flat $500. Many families would not be able to find the money to pass that threshold and are therefore likely to forgo doctors appointments and treatment because of the cost. I am not talking about those who are on some sort of benefit; I am talking about families on low wages—and there are a lot of them in Australia today. They are the working poor who have been created by this government. They get no benefits from the government. They are struggling to pay their rent and feed their children, and now the government is talking about a $500 threshold.</para><para>Family payments have become so complicated and scary to access that many risk going hungry rather than go to Centrelink, because Centrelink will demand back some of the dollars that they have given them if they happen to make a few extra dollars in a month. People are now scared of Centrelink. They are scared of the organisation that was put there by government to assist people. That is what this government has done: it has made people frightened of an organisation which should be assisting people.</para><para>I listened with amusement to the member for Warringah's vicious attacks on the Labor Party regarding the lease of Centenary House, which is merely a business deal set up by the party's executive some years ago as part of extensive property investments to try and hedge against low interest rates. Some of the investments have performed better than others and have been good business practice—something that those on the other side seem to not want to understand. Maybe they are just very jealous that the ALP have been able to do this so well. They are jealous that the ALP have such good businesspeople and can hold and organise their finances in such a good way. That is what this ranting and raving is all about. The member for Warringah has green eyes. The government go crook at the opposition for wanting to ensure that all Australians have equal access to the services of government and for not being good businesspeople. And yet they cannot hack Labor being very prudent with money and being good money managers.</para><para>These appropriation bills give us little comfort that funds are being allocated properly and that Australians are going to be better off under this Howard government. Each year under the Liberals money has less value. Not only are ordinary Australians smarting, but business and industry sectors are being routed by the government's obsession with getting trade deals with the US at any cost—including in particular the sacrifice of the Tasmanian apple and pear industry. Australia and Australians are losing out all around.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>25868</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I want to limit my comments on the <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline>, the <inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline>, and the <inline ref="R1977">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline> to the fiasco that has become Job Network mark 3. This system was meant to assist the unemployed in getting off welfare and into work, but it is struggling to work itself. The roll-out of Job Network mark 3—the third significant overhaul of employment services in just eight years—has been a litany of government mismanagement, government incompetence and delusional denials from the Minister for Employment Services.</para></talk.start><para>The transition to Job Network 3 has been a failed experiment in social policy, implemented not with the welfare of job seekers foremost in mind but to satisfy the ideological agenda of the Howard government at a cost to taxpayers of $2.85 billion over the coming three years. Just nine months into the Job Network's latest three-year contract, known as Employment Services Contract 3 or ESC3, its longer term financial viability is still far from certain. Only this week both the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>and the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review </inline>reported on a confidential document written by the National Employment Services Association, the peak body representing private as well as not-for-profit Job Network providers, which warned that, unless providers receive an immediate cash injection from taxpayers, many will have to close their doors. One can only lament the crisis now besetting the Job Network, particularly given the fanfare and great promises made by the government at the time of its development.</para><para>Let us cast our memories back to the months leading up to the start of ESC3 on 1 July 2003. We can recall the confident claims being made by the Minister for Employment Services, the member for Longman, Mal Brough. There was the press release on 27 March 2003 in which the minister said:</para><quote><para>... from July, Job Network members will deliver even better services to Australia's unemployed ... They will have greater access to jobs, more flexible assistance through a Job Seeker Account and a Service Guarantee ... The state-of-the-art job matching service will compare every job seeker's resume with every listed job, every night and the result can be accessed the next day for quicker access to work opportunities.</para></quote><para>On 28 March in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline>, the minister said that ESC3 `will be delivering a very personalised, visualised service'. In the parliament on 27 May, the minister said that ESC3 `builds on what has been a very successful transition from the old CES to the Job Network'. Also on that day, he said:</para><quote><para>... there will in fact be more Job Network personnel working in the [system] delivering quality services to Australians in country towns and in suburbs where the service is needed. Furthermore, it will be backed up with the world's best IT.</para></quote><para>In a press release on 19 June 2003, the minister said:</para><quote><para>We'll have the same Australia-wide coverage as in previous Job Network but the services will be more relevant and better tailored to the needs of local communities.</para></quote><para>On 19 June in the parliament, he said:</para><quote><para>An unemployed person needs to be treated as an individual. We need to take them, build them up personally and provide them with the skills and the connections for the jobs. To do that, we have provided what we call the job seeker account.</para></quote><para>Unfortunately, the reality has simply not matched the government's earlier rhetoric. We know this from talking to the unemployed and to Job Network providers. We also know this from freedom of information documents provided by the government's own department which show the contrast between what the minister was saying publicly, what the government and the minister were being told privately and what was actually occurring on the ground.</para><para>The transition to ESC3 resulted in the closure of some 1,100 offices around the country. This is a government that closed more offices than it left open—53 per cent. Most of those office closures occurred in rural and regional Australia. Some 58 per cent of the offices there—691 Job Network offices—closed as a result of that transition. As a result of that, many towns have been left without any Job Network office, forcing job seekers to travel further to get the help, assistance and training that they need to find a job.</para><para>While Labor first exposed the cut to regional Job Network services more than eight months ago, the FOI documents obtained from the government show that the government itself was being told by its departments that the level of service available to regional and rural job seekers would be lower. The FOI documents state:</para><quote><para>Job Network membership coverage is not available in some remote and rural areas (and appears to have been reduced with the third Job Network contract) and [the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations] has not yet provided a service strategy for these jobseekers.</para></quote><para>What an outrage! The FOI documents clearly show that this government was alerted to what the problems were but was not alarmed enough to take action. The closure of these offices was part of the shutdown of any public sector provision role. This is a government that wound up Employment National, resulting in the loss of more than 400 jobs across 165 localities. When the government moved to the Job Network it argued that we needed a public sector provider as a safety net; yet it moved away from that commitment.</para><para>On top of that, the size of the Job Network pool meant that the whole basis of the contracts for Job Network 3 was simply not what providers were told. Providers were told that there would be 720,000 or 780,000 people in the system. We know that that simply is not the case. What the minister purported to say was: `That's because unemployment has fallen.' But we know that that is not true, because the data shows that at the time that the tender documents went out, September 2002, there were 644,722 people receiving benefits. In July 2003, when the Job Network contract started, there were 633,259 people receiving benefits—a reduction of only 11,463. The latest figures from January 2004 show a further reduction of just 3,036, down to 630,223 people.</para><para>We know that the government confused those people who were activity tested, and therefore compelled to participate in the Job Network, with volunteers—people who could certainly go along to a Job Network office but who had no compulsion because of the nature of their benefit or because they were involved in some other program. That meant that the pool was more like 500,000. The government initially, in some circumstances, talked about a pool of 900,000. That meant that, even if you took their lowest figure of 720,000 to 780,000 people, when the real figure was 500,000, the size of the market was some one-third less. So, if you established your business under ESC3, expecting a revenue base of, say, $300,000 a month to be coming in, and all of a sudden you are getting only $200,000, then no wonder you are in strife. That is the basis of the fundamental flaw in the model from 1 July. And the minister knew, because on 25 July 2003 a minute from Centrelink to FaCS stated:</para><quote><para>I think we need to bring out the fact that there are only perhaps 500,000 customers who can be compelled to come in.</para></quote><para>So, in spite of spending $11.3 million on preparing, developing and implementing Job Network 3, the minister simply got his numbers wrong. The combination of increased costs and reduced revenues has already claimed one provider. Options Community Enterprises was a provider that specialised in helping people with disabilities to find work and was a top performer under Job Network 2. However, under Job Network 3 this 27-year-old organisation has been forced out of business. </para><para>Then we go to the IT debacle. On top of diminished service coverage, the operation of the Job Network has been further impaired by ongoing so-called technical difficulties with the IT system. Honourable members will recall that earlier in my speech I referred to the minister calling this `the world's best IT'. A briefing note to the Minister for Family and Community Services dated 11 June 2003 stated: </para><quote><para>It is now 11 weeks since ESC3 was introduced. There have been only two or three days where there has not been a system outage. </para></quote><para>For only two or three days out of the first 77 days when the system was supposed to be operating was it actually up and running. No wonder one provider has labelled the system a dog. A major component of this IT system is of course the Australian Job Search database. This system seeks to automatch job seekers with job vacancies. The vacancy information sent via various electronic means is supposed to be tailored to the job seeker's skills, work experience and areas of employment interests. But what have we seen? We have seen Joanna, a 53-year-old Tasmanian woman and former art gallery worker, matched with a job requiring a chainsaw licence. We have seen Rosa, a 56-year-old woman from Daylesford, who suffers from severe blood pressure and severe arthritis, matched with a job in the Army Reserve as a combat medic. We have also seen a young Tasmanian man matched with a job in an escort agency and a Western Australian matched with a job seeking someone to launder money. This is on the government's web site. The government is critical of the old operation of the CES. I say this to Minister Brough: the CES did not send people who were unemployed to jobs in escort agencies, while the government system has done that. </para><para>I now want to move to the job seeker account. This was the flexible part of the system. There was $900 available to Job Network providers. This fund had a total of $223 million allocated to it. It was there to be used to increase the employability of the unemployed. However, just last week we asked in Senate estimates hearings how much of the job seeker account had been accessed and we were told that, to date, a mere $31.4 million or 14 per cent of the money had actually been used by providers. Providers have been warning for some time that the overly bureaucratic nature of accessing the money in the job seeker account was discouraging its use. In one case study reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 1 March 2004, a rural provider calculated it had spent $75,408 on 3,240 job seeker account transactions without compensation. Unfortunately, when providers raise these issues the government simply ignores the problem. Therefore, the money sits unused in a government bank account rather than being used on the unemployed. The combination of the problem with the lack of numbers, the problems with the IT and the problems with the usage of the job seeker account means that many providers are under severe pressure. A February board report of a major Job Network provider stated:</para><quote><para>It is prudent to report to the board the general low ebb in morale that the organisation is experiencing at present—not too surprising, when you recall the historic graph. The situation hasn't happened overnight, but steadily, as our Job Network income has decreased and focus on performance has increased, the result is of course that people have departed either voluntarily or by termination of contract. This is unsettling, naturally.</para></quote><para>It goes on:</para><quote><para>It is sometimes difficult to appreciate the real wins we have actually made on the board when dealing with the seemingly constant run of problems.</para></quote><para>Then it goes on to say:</para><quote><para>They really need to see a few small successes very soon, in order to re-energise the morale and provide a light at the end of the tunnel (that hopefully is not a train).</para></quote><para>Indeed, I hope that the light at the end of the tunnel for the Job Network is not a train, because that train will run over Job Network providers—decent people, largely operating in not-for-profit organisations, who are not in it for the money but in it because they are committed to the satisfaction that comes from getting someone who is unemployed into work and making a fundamental difference in people's lives. But, more importantly, the unemployed at the moment simply are not the priority of the government. The priority of the government is defending the flawed system rather than acknowledging that the problems are there. Unless you acknowledge the problems that are there, you cannot take the steps to fix them, and that is what the minister needs to do. Just last week the head of a Dubbo job agency called for the service to be overhauled. The CEO of the OEC group, Rod Cooke, said a contract system that worked in the city was sending battling regional agencies broke. In the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Liberal</inline>, which is the local newspaper in Dubbo, he said:</para><quote><para>We're all hoping we can convince the Government to wake up to itself and give us the money we need to run their employment service.</para></quote><para>The article says:</para><quote><para>Mr Cooke said regional agencies were wearing the cost of trying to source jobs in areas where high unemployment meant few “outcomes” are achieved.</para><para>“A survey of rural providers showed they are operating at 80 per cent of expected income and 120 per cent of expected expenditure,” he said.</para></quote><para>That is not the Labor Party but the CEO of a Job Network provider in rural Australia saying that. I concur with Mr Cooke's comments and the comments that are being made by providers all around the nation that the government does have to wake up to itself. It does have to make changes, because it needs to back up the system that is only struggling to keep going because of the commitment of Job Network providers and Centrelink staff. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>25871</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is like a poker game: the new player is keeping cool with a straight face; the more experienced player is looking uncertain and at times a little desperate.

This followed a post-budget spend of $4.5 billion, taking the spend on net new policy decisions made in the 2003 calendar year to $23.1 billion. Spending decisions since the mid-year review have now added at least $3.5 billion. The government is continuing to eat into the surplus, announcing another $362 million in funding to Catholic schools last Sunday and in excess of $200 million for a veterans package only yesterday. Why is the government promising so much new spending? It is because it is getting uncomfortably close to an election.</para><para>The government is a classic flip-flopping, big taxing, big spending government which realises that it is in real electoral danger. We are about to see the characteristic behaviour of this poll-driven government, as we did in 2001, when Mr Howard responded to his party president's `mean and tricky' memo published in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>. The Howard government is now in a financial squeeze of its own making as it talks about delivering tax relief. The government's budget problem comes down to three sets of figures: (1) the Prime Minister's track record of buying the votes of interest groups in an election year; (2) the amount of bracket creep he must return to taxpayers to make them no worse off than they were when the GST was introduced; and (3) the size of the budget surplus. On present figures, over the budget and three-year forward estimates, the numbers do not fit. Mr Howard will have to choose what to sacrifice: the expectations he is building up amongst interest groups, the full return of bracket creep or the budget surplus. Alternatively—and more likely—he will compromise on all three.</para><para>First, let us look at Mr Howard's spending record. His government has been a classic adherent to what economists call the political business cycle. Before he went to the polls in 2001, the Prime Minister spent $25.6 billion buying interest group votes without promising even a dollar of personal income tax relief. This was poll-driven spending. It was not a case of the government having saved the good policy announcements for the election year; it was a case of the government's spending priorities being determined by the Liberal Party's private polling and directed on the single criterion of buying votes—government by Textor. The criteria that the Howard government uses to determine its spending have nothing to do with either what is fair or what is good policy. In fact, any connection between where this government directs its new spending and what is good policy is purely coincidental.

By contrast, the Prime Minister's new policy commitments in non-election years have averaged only $3.9 billion. Last year was the only exception to that pattern. If you disregard the $23.1 billion spent in the 2003 calendar year, non-election-year policy commitments only average $124.6 million. This raises two questions: was Mr Howard seriously contemplating a poll in 2003, and will 2003 go down as the year Mr Howard lost the fiscal plot and the 2004 election? I should probably refrain from giving the Prime Minister gratuitous political advice after the event, but if he had not spent so much in 2003 he would be in a lot better financial shape to deal with his political problems now.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Treasurer, of course, was not too concerned about spending money last year. He would have done anything to make the Prime Minister feel as though he was at the pinnacle of his career in the hope that he would toddle off into the sunset.

That means that, over those four financial years, 63.9 per cent of the budget surplus is attributable to bracket creep. If Mr Howard spends the entire $20.8 billion, as I fully expect him to, almost two-thirds of those dollars will be from the increase in taxation arising from bracket creep, so he is doing nothing more than handing back money that he is about to take from taxpayers.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I would like to thank the Melbourne Institute for doing a couple of extra model runs for me to put these figures together. In particular, they gave me an estimate of the bracket creep that will accrue on current tax scales in 2007-08, which is one year beyond the forward estimates period, based on expected wages growth and inflation. That bracket creep estimate for the 2007-08 financial year is $6.2 billion. That means the cost of eliminating bracket creep in the 2004-05 budget year would be $17.8 billion over the next budget year and forward estimates period. We will not have the government's estimate of the projected surplus for 2007-08 until the budget is handed down, so we will not be able to estimate how much of that surplus is attributable to bracket creep or whether it is efficient to hand back the extra taxation that has been taken through bracket creep. Mr Howard's 2003 tax cut cost $10.7 billion and was ridiculed by a member of his cabinet, known for her frankness, as being equivalent to a milkshake and a sandwich. However he shapes his next tax cut, the Prime Minister will do almost anything to avoid that analogy being repeated as he approaches a federal election.</para><para>Finally, there is the surplus, which dwindled to $20.8 billion over four years, as measured in the mid-year review, after $4.5 billion of post-budget spending. As I said earlier, the government has made more commitments since the mid-year review, with the Prime Minister spending over $3.5 billion. Clearly Mr Howard cannot do both his usual election year $23 billion vote buy-up for interest groups and an almost $18 billion spend in eliminating bracket creep, using a surplus that is now less than $20.8 billion. In this year's budget, look out for smoke and mirrors and overcooked economic growth forecasts to boost revenue as the Prime Minister looks for the maximum amount of room to wriggle. We can expect to see money being pulled out of hollow logs.</para><para>Chris Richardson from Access Economics tells me the Reserve Bank may be one of those hollow logs. He has estimated that the Treasurer left perhaps a billion dollars of profit in the bank this year so that he can move it into his election year spend. According to Chris's back-of-the-envelope figuring, if the profit held up at the notional 2003-04 level then there would be an extra $2 billion to spend in 2004-05. The beauty of this sort of exercise, from the government's point of view, is that what is in the forward estimates for dividends from the Reserve Bank is whatever the Treasurer says that he will take. My response to this is that there may be a problem with the Treasurer's plan for raiding the bank, because the dollar has appreciated sharply over 2003-04. Reserve Bank profits actually increase when the dollar falls, because the bank sells foreign currency that it has bought when the dollar is high and is in its balance sheet at historic cost. Because it gets more Aussie dollars when it sells that foreign currency than it paid for it, Reserve Bank profits rise.</para><para>When the Aussie dollar appreciates, as it has done this year, the bank should be rebuilding its reserves by buying foreign currency. In these circumstances I would not expect the profit level that the bank had achieved when the dollar was falling to be maintained. On budget night, if there is a big increase in the revenue line marked `dividends', you can bet that the Treasurer has raided the bank at the expense of the governor being able to rebuild foreign exchange reserves. I would like to think that those considerations would prevail and the Treasurer would not make a raid on the bank in this election year, but that would be a triumph of hope over experience.</para><para>A couple of years ago the Treasurer took a special dividend out of Australia Post, and the price of a stamp went up by 5c. The problem with this sort of behaviour is that it is not sustainable. For eight years now the government has tried to base its economic credentials on tight budget policy and debt reduction. Eight years is long enough to judge any government. Since September 1991, Australia has enjoyed almost 13 years of almost continuous economic growth, interrupted only by the introduction of the GST. The government's stated fiscal policy is to balance the budget over the course of the economic cycle. However, the government's focus is on the political business cycle and not the economic cycle. Because the Howard government is prepared to spend all the surplus when the economy has been growing for a long period, it is a government whose spending is decidedly procyclical. It is easy to ignore that when the immediate economic outlook seems benign. However, with almost all the surplus being spent, unless the current period of growth goes on for a very long time the Howard government will not balance its budget over the course of the economic cycle: that is, if it lasts that long. In any significant downturn caused by a change in world economic conditions that sort of procyclical spending is likely to increase the size of the resulting river of red ink.</para><para>I am not predicting an economic downturn, but I also do not accept the Treasurer's presumption that his own economic management has been so brilliant that Australia is now no longer exposed to the international economic cycle. It is worth remembering that in the last half of last year the Secretary to the Treasury had sufficient concerns about the economic outlook to be arguing with the Governor of the Reserve Bank at board meetings that a further easing in interest rates should be considered. A careful reading of the governor's transcripts of evidence given to the House economics committee indicates that he too was not entirely sanguine at that time about the domestic implications of a world slowdown, given Australian households' exposure to debt. It is something you think about if you have been involved in managing the budget over the course of an international business cycle; the current Treasurer has not, having taken over the economy with the recovery already well established and the budget returning to balance.</para><para>The Howard government's first budget was tight, slashing $24 billion over the forward estimates, but since then the government has made new spending decisions worth $94 billion. By the time Australia goes to the polls that figure will far exceed $100 billion. Mr Howard's frame of reference might be the next poll, but Labor's will be Australia's future.

COX</name></talker><para>—Mr Costello may boast that he has reduced net debt by $72 billion, but that is much less impressive when you recognise that he has done it with $56 billion worth of asset sales. Most of his debt reduction is simply moving assets and liabilities around on the balance sheet, rather than any sustainable improvement in net assets. When we are talking about the Howard government's economic credentials we must not forget that many of those asset sales were made at low prices and some, like the sale of major public buildings, have significant long-term costs for the budget.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The problem the Howard government must face now is that families are paying more and getting less. This is the highest taxing government in Australia's history. The tax to GDP ratio has increased 2.4 per cent since the government came to office. In current money terms that is the equivalent of Australians paying an extra $19 billion in tax. While Australian taxpayers are paying more tax than ever before, the government says it cannot afford to invest in the education of the next generation and it cannot afford a universal health system—only an inadequate safety net. The truth is the money is there for these priorities; it is just that the Howard government is wasting and mismanaging it. Australians deserve a government with priorities that reflect the best interests of all Australians. They deserve policies that provide opportunities for all.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>25876</page.no><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name><name.id>JH5</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In commenting on the <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline>, the <inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R1977">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline>, I want to focus on the wrong priorities of this government insofar as the average Australian family is concerned. The government likes to talk a lot about its strong economic achievements, and there is no doubt that we have been, as a nation, through a lengthy period of good growth. But I want to argue that, at a time of good economic growth, the government has failed to ensure that the growing wealth and prosperity of our country are being fairly shared by all. It is clearly not the case, because every indicator points to growing inequality in our society and a retreat from principles of egalitarianism. In fact we are becoming a much more unequal society, even in comparison with other OECD countries.</para></talk.start><para>The tragedy is that the Howard government continues to turn a blind eye to this growing inequality. For all the talk that we hear from the Howard government about its commitment to the battlers and to such things as family friendly policies, the reverse is actually the case: the government is creating more battlers—more battling families just trying to survive and eke out an existence. As far as family friendly policies are concerned, I think the average family will tell you that they have never had it as hard as they have it today. They have been hit very hard by the highest taxing government of all time. It is these average families that are suffering under enormous financial pressures as a result of this government's wrong policies and priorities.</para><para>Under this government, Australians are paying more tax than ever before. The tax cuts that came with the GST, as some measure of compensation, have long since been eroded. But the GST lives on, day in, day out. Household debt and credit card debt have gone through the roof under this administration. The great tragedy for the average family and their children is that the Australian dream of home ownership will never be a reality for many young people.</para><para>Financial stress and pressure are at an all-time high, and combined with that there is a decline in services and a reduction in opportunities for the average family. While services are declining, the government is relying more and more on the user-pays philosophy, which is now rampant in areas like higher education and, increasingly, health. With the greater tax share that is coming to the government, one would have thought there would be no excuse for the government not providing the outlays that are necessary to ensure a universal health system, underpinned by bulk-billing, and no excuse for the government not making sure that merit, not money, opens the door for access to further education. </para><para>There is little joy in the government's policies for large numbers of families that I represent in my electorate. I think the government fails to recognise the pressures that the average family is under. Nearly 30 per cent of the families I represent survive on a family income of less than $500 per week. That is 8,642 families and their dependants struggling to survive on $26,000 gross, or less, each year. Can you imagine how tough it is for them? The median family income in Throsby is around $44,000 per year. I represent families that could generally be described as middle- and low-income families. These families, who have contributed so much to the nation's prosperity and are the glue in the community networks, are precisely the families that are missing out on much of the rewards of Australia's economic growth.</para><para>The government cannot have it both ways. It cannot take praise for the good economic outcomes while turning a blind eye to the fact that those outcomes and that prosperity are not being shared equitably in our community. It is the average families who are slowly but surely sinking under the weight of an unfair tax system.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">A division having been called in the House of Representatives—</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 12.10 p.m. to 12.23 p.m.</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>JH5</name.id><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name></talker><para>—As I was saying, the impact of the government's wrong policies and priorities on average families is making their situation very difficult. They are slowly but surely sinking under the weight of an unfair tax system. As my colleague the member for Kingston pointed out in his contribution, the insidious effects of bracket creep are pushing more and more working families into the next tax bracket. We know that there is a lot of unpaid or overtaxed overtime occurring. They are struggling under the introduction of a user-pays philosophy for basic services. They are struggling under a government-induced family payment debt system. All in all, it is a system which is robbing people of any incentive to earn extra and better themselves and their families.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Howard government is squeezing the very Australians who have made our economy strong and prosperous. One issue that I particularly want to draw attention to is the impact that the interaction between the tax and welfare systems is having on low- and middle-income families who are out there wanting to earn additional income or, in some cases, as we have in my electorate, on people wanting to move from welfare to work. I would like to quote from a letter that I received from one of my constituents, Margaret Geeves, because I think it is typical of the frustration that is being carried by families all over Australia. The Geeves are a single-income family of six. Her husband, Dennis, has been in his job for 32 years and she is a stay-at-home mum by choice. I will quote from her submission to me. She says:</para><quote><para>Dear Ms George,</para><para>I am writing to you in the hope that something can be done about the taxation system that the Government has in place. It is not a fair and just system for all Australian people. There is no incentive to better oneself as I am about to explain in our situation. I challenge you to find someone in Government to justify and clarify why my husband is only $207 ... better off after receiving a bonus of $1,000 ...</para></quote><para>She goes on to explain that her husband had done well at work and achieved this bonus payment, but the impact of the bonus payment was that 47 per cent was taken away in tax, that is minus $470, and then another 30 per cent was taken away, that is $300, because of the clawback of 30c in every dollar in family allowance. So for the extra effort that Dennis Geeves had put into getting the bonus at work, the family was left with $230. This, as she points out:</para><quote><para>... when spent incurs 10% GST (another tax) leaving us just $207 extra money coming into our household not affected by tax. </para></quote><para>She goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Not much an incentive to work harder to earn more especially when this is all bonus money that was achieved through goal making. Not much of incentive for being a stay at home mum losing Family Allowances especially with teenage children who can't get part time jobs.</para></quote><para>The letter continues:</para><quote><para>We aren't extravagant. We drive old cars .... We rarely eat out. We don't wear designer or surf brand clothes. We don't have a holiday very often as it is too expensive to accommodate six people ... We haven't been away for three years and we were thrilled with the bonus and planned a holiday ... but looks like we will have to cancel, as there is not much of this money left to use.</para><para>I hope that there is someone in Government who knows what I'm talking about when it comes to family matters ... The question I ask is how as a family can we see past today if the Government wants to take most of our well earned money? </para><para>As a mother I feel I have contributed to society by being there for my children and I am very proud to say that they are genuinely very nice people. I will never regret being there for them but I will always regret that the government made it so damn hard to survive in a system that takes so much from middle income families on one wage who are unable to claim much tax relief. I know we are not the only ones going through this fate and would like the Government to realise that people like us with large families on single incomes do not fit into the rich category of paying the highest income tax and losing family allowances.</para></quote><para>Margaret Geeves's comments express the frustration, resentment and anger of the average low- to middle-income family. This government turns a blind eye to the problems and struggles they experience on a daily basis.</para><para>Why is it that this government hits low- and middle-income earners with higher rates of tax than millionaires? One million Australian workers today are paying 60c in every additional dollar they earn through the impact of tax and the withdrawal of benefits. The government's own recently released figures show that many families in the middle-income range of $31,000 to $85,000 are keeping as little as 21.5c of each extra dollar they earn through the impact of bracket creep and reduced family tax benefits. Why is it that a government that talks so much about family friendly policies provides no incentive for mothers to return to part-time work? For each dollar they earn on return to part-time work after the birth of a child they lose 30c in family tax benefit A, 30c in family tax benefit B, 17 per cent in tax and, on top of that, their Medicare levy. Again, I ask, as Margaret Geeves asked me: why is it that the government is not hearing and not listening to the pleas of the average family?</para><para>I have spoken on numerous occasions about the flawed family payment system and the terrible tragedy of innocent families who have done the right thing being treated as cheats. We now learn that, since the changes to the family tax benefit system back in July 2000, at least three million families have received incorrect payments. That comes as no surprise because the whole system is based on the absurdity of people trying to guess and predict their income in advance.</para><para>Some 1.6 million Australian families have been punished and treated like cheats in a flawed system that has slugged them with debts of some $1.4 billion. And still nothing is done by this government to rectify this obvious injustice. It is ironic that the government surpluses keep mounting. The war chest is certainly being built up, as we have seen just in the last couple of days. The war chest is out there for the government to try to buy its way back into power, but it refuses to act on this problem. That is despite the fact that its own interdepartmental committee told the government exactly what we have been saying for many years now—that the flawed family payments system is creating victims who have done nothing other than try to guess their income in advance as best they can and to notify Centrelink of any changes. I think it is absolutely scandalous. </para><para>In my electorate 2,506 families have been hurt for doing nothing wrong. They have been hurt with total debts in that period that have now accrued to over $6 million. The average debt carried by families, 30 per cent of whom bring in less than $500 a week, is $711. I think the government's inaction on this issue shows that it does not care. It does not understand the pressure that families are under because, if it did, it would not allow this scandalous situation to continue.</para><para>The last comment I want to make relates to the growing number of working poor in our community. In a country as affluent as ours it is a tragedy that, for increasing numbers of families, paid employment is no longer a protection against poverty. While wage inequality grows under this government, it does nothing of a positive nature to improve the plight of the very low paid workers who depend on the award system. Some 20 per cent of workers—that is, 1.6 million people—rely totally on their award for their protection and for their wages. The only increases in their award rates of pay come through the ACTU's annual living wage applications. </para><para>Yet since 1996 this government has opposed every increase sought on behalf of low-paid workers by the ACTU. These are workers currently earning $11.80 per hour. They are workers in industries like hospitality, retail and community services, many of whom are part-time and casual workers and about 60 per cent of whom are women. At the moment, the ACTU is seeking to lift their minimum wage to $24,700 a year. It is hardly an exorbitant increase that they are seeking. Yet again we have this government not having the goodwill to support the claim. In fact, had the government had its way these same workers, today on minimum wages, would have been almost $2,000 a year worse off than they currently are. Thank goodness, despite the intentions of the government, we still have an independent Industrial Relations Commission where some measure of justice can be achieved for the very low-paid workers. </para><para>I think it is an absolute disgrace that wages at the top end of town go through the roof and that we see, on a weekly basis, the kinds of golden handshakes that are paid out to CEOs of companies that have not performed well; yet people at the lower end of the income scale, struggling on less than $12 an hour, cannot get support from this government to ensure that at least their minimum wage lifts them out of the possibility of falling under the poverty line. I think it is disgraceful that the government talks about tax cuts for people paying top marginal tax rates but shows absolutely no concern for those on low incomes and the growing number of working poor. Despite all the evidence that low wages are pushing many working families into poverty, the Howard government has consistently opposed any efforts that have been made by the union movement to secure reasonable increases in the minimum wage. As all the indicators show, the workers in hospitality, tourism and community services are in industries that are recording good profit outcomes; productivity has improved and continues to improve. Yet these workers are condemned by this government to try to survive on wage levels lower than $12 an hour.</para><para>In conclusion, I want to reiterate my view that the government's policies and directions are creating a more unequal Australia, a land of the haves and the have-nots. We are retreating from the notions of a fair go and egalitarianism. Who is bearing the brunt of all this? It is the average, hardworking, honest, toiling low- and middle-income earners who have contributed to this nation's prosperity but who, at the end of the day, are being left behind by a government that is not ensuring that our prosperity is shared equally by all.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>1</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the outset, I would like to associate myself with the comments of the previous speakers with regard to minimum wages and recognise the campaign of the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union, under the leadership of Jeff Lawrence, whose organisation covers cleaners, hospitality and the security sector—sectors that particularly bear the brunt of this government's determination to drive down real wages. <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline>, <inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> and <inline ref="R1977">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline> provide for variations to appropriation in line with spending and revenue measures adopted by the government since the budget and changes resulting from revisions to portfolio budget estimates. Arising from these bills and the immigration portfolio additional estimates statements, there are a number of matters I wish to canvass with regard to my shadow portfolio.</para></talk.start><para>From the outset, I note that the additional estimates statements are almost entirely lacking in proper information about changes that this government is making to migrant settlement services. This is part of a continuing assault on transparency and accountability under the coalition. It is no wonder that the opposition has instigated measures to try to tackle the assault on freedom of information in this country—that is, the way in which this government is endeavouring to decrease the amount of transparency in government through restrictions on FOI.</para><para>The history of the matter of settlement services is clear. Suddenly, out of the blue, in 2002 Minister Hardgrave announced an in-house review of all settlement services for migrants and refugees. There was, understandably, considerable suspicion that the review was more or less pursuing a predetermined outcome on the part of the department and the minister. That is of course because it stayed in-house. It was unparalleled. Organisations outside of government had carriage of previous reviews of such a nature; this was a departmental inquiry. There was particular suspicion in relation to major changes proposed in the final report of the review regarding migrant resource centres and project funding under the Community Settlement Services Scheme, the CSSS. The department's report was, however, also quite critical of the coalition's approach to access and equity issues and of arrangements to provide on-arrival assistance to refugees under the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Service, the IHSS.</para><para>We are witnessing a pattern of consultations upon consultations, where the number of meetings convened by DIMIA seems to be inversely related to the amount of real influence that service providers exercise over the process. I am constantly told by the sector that everyone is in the dark about what the future really holds and that funded services are being warned not to take their concerns to their elected parliamentary representatives. One of the other things that disturbed me initially in this portfolio as I went around the country was the view by some MRCs that they had to ring up the department to see whether the shadow minister was allowed to come to meetings of their organisation to canvass what they were doing, the kinds of communities they were serving et cetera. I am pleased to say that the paranoia the government has forced upon these MRCs seems to have decreased over time.</para><para>At the report's release, Minister Hardgrave said that a high-level task force, chaired by Prime Minister and Cabinet, would be set up to pursue the major changes. That is about all the minister has chosen to reveal. We do not know the membership of the task force or its exact terms of reference. We do not know what its riding instructions were in terms of budgetary matters. Thanks to the Senate additional estimates hearing we do know, however, that the task force has completed its job, having reported to the government more than two months ago. To date, nothing has been revealed about the findings of the task force or about what decisions the government has taken in response. This is just not good enough.</para><para>It is particularly pressing that the minister tells us what the government has planned for what we term `established migrant communities'. The departmental review, instigated by the minister himself, questioned whether such groups should continue to be eligible for funding for migrant welfare projects under CSSS. It specifically mentioned the Armenian, Greek, Italian, Jewish, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian and Ukrainian communities as groups targeted for change. There are no doubt others. They have questioned whether these groups that have been here many decades should continue to be essentially covered and assisted by DIMIA. I want to say on a personal note that, particularly in regard to the Ukrainians, the Maltese, the Greeks and the Italians, this affects my electorate in Western Sydney.</para><para>This recommendation was clearly a key matter before the high-level task force, so the government should be able to tell us what it has in mind. Will DIMIA continue to support such communities or not? Does the government think they are the responsibility of some other portfolio and, if so, which portfolio and what guarantee is there that existing migrant welfare projects will continue to be funded? Or does the government really believe that it is all someone else's problem, and will it try to pass responsibility to the states or local government—a practice that has become very prevalent in recent years? We deserve answers to these questions.</para><para>What the government has reluctantly revealed so far is not reassuring. Under questioning from the opposition, the head of settlement services in DIMIA, Jennifer Bryant, told the Senate hearing on 17 February that the issue is: </para><quote><para>... still under consideration by the government and, in the interim—</para></quote><para>in the interim, I stress—</para><quote><para>there have been no changes to eligibility criteria for the 2004 CSSS funding round. Any established community applying for funding in that round—</para></quote><para>in that round, I stress—</para><quote><para>will have their application considered on its merits ...</para></quote><para>Reading between the lines, this is a short-term expedient measure to cover the government's backside until after the election. There is no long-term commitment there. In my media release of 18 February I noted that the clear implication of Ms Bryant's comments is that the government proposes to make major changes to the CSSS next year if it is re-elected. In the meantime, the vast majority of projects are on the shortest possible grant period, to give the department the greatest scope to make cuts down the track.</para><para>Minister Hardgrave's press release of 25 February has only dug a deeper hole for the government and himself. Nowhere does it say that the established ethnic communities will be eligible for DIMIA funding after this year. It merely repeats Ms Bryant's comments that there have been no changes to eligibility criteria for the 2004 CSSS grants round and that all organisations that currently receive funding are eligible to apply. Big deal. We knew that already. We wonder why he cannot say what happens after that, other than talking about yet more community consultations, with no commitment that the money will continue for a wide variety of long-established welfare organisations around this country. </para><para>Some of those organisations are ones in which various ministers flaunt themselves and make adulatory comments about how fantastic these groups are, what a great job they are doing and how close to the community they are. There is a real threat here that the government is essentially going to cut their funding under the pretext that they are not the government's problem, they are not DIMIA's problem, they have been here too long and they are not part of migration settlement.</para><para>A related issue is the position of migrant resource centres, or MRCs. Somewhat paradoxically, the MRC program is a legacy of Malcolm Fraser. Their establishment was a key recommendation of the Galbally report, commissioned by his government. I stress that that was an external review of how the system should operate. It was not, like the latest one, an in-house, departmental, ministerially driven analysis. The purpose of MRCs is to offer multilingual information, advice and referral services, provide a base for sessional ethno-specific services, and foster the development of new services to develop local needs. </para><para>I am a strong supporter of MRCs, on three grounds. Firstly, they are multicultural in nature, with their boards and services not dominated by particular ethnic groups. I have seen at various stages attempts in my own area by specific ethnic groups to take them over. Those attempts have failed, and these organisations generally around this country have a broad coverage of occupation, background, politics and experience as well as a wide diversity of communities. Secondly, they are large and visible enough to have a greater impact than most small scale organisations. Finally, they are community controlled and thus receptive to the needs and concerns of the region they serve. I think the previous minister, the member for Berowra, would certainly agree that the MRCs in my region, which he has visited on many occasions, are doing a tremendous job. It is pleasing that the previous government established them and that groups like Auburn and Parramatta are functioning so well.</para><para>For reasons that have never been clearly explained, the current government has been far from enthusiastic about MRCs on a general front. We have had a number of them close. Some of them have closed for good reason—I could not dispute the need to close them. But we do see a fundamental thrust by the government to perhaps move towards the replacement of community controlled organisations which have a lot of volunteers with a lot of commitment and purpose with religious and other groups that perhaps do not have the expertise, background, knowledge and grassroots connections that are necessary for these groups.</para><para>Concerns include the withdrawal of funding for several centres, as I mentioned, and the nature of the replacement services that were put in place, usually under the CSS Scheme; and, secondly, the settlement services review proposal to amalgamate the separate CSSS and migrant resource programs into a single program, with vague references to MRC funding being `more contestable'—in other words, more under attack and open to other bidders—and to DIMIA core funding not being used to provide infrastructure support for other Commonwealth or state funded projects run by MRCs. I note that the review itself provided no evidence whatsoever that DIMIA core funding was in any way subsidising those projects that they are supposedly trying to avoid funding in future. They do not establish a problem and they do not make an allegation or accusation but, somehow, part of the reason they are attacking MRCs is to do with avoiding this problem.</para><para>We are now told that yet more consultations will be held in April on the ground rules for the new combined funding program. The proposed new case recording system, which seems to be purely driven by DIMIA's statistical and IT requirements, is also under question. The outline of this system seems to have been developed without adequate regard for the wealth of case data that the migrant resource centres need for their own planning and service delivery purposes. It completely excludes client contacts of less than one hour's duration in the statistics that they want and raises privacy concerns for individuals about the requirement that client visa numbers be recorded and notified to DIMIA—in other words, the visa numbers of people who are helped and assisted have to be given to the department, for some unknown reason.</para><para>There was a long discussion about this matter at the recent Senate estimates hearing. DIMIA appeared to concede some deficiencies in the proposal they have developed by saying that centres were free to use a second case recording system if they needed more data than the DIMIA system can provide. Just why any centre would want to use two separate systems to record one set of client cases was never explained by these bureaucrats, nor was it indicated who would fund the development and upkeep of this second system.</para><para>On the subject of IHSS enhancements, we welcome the modest improvements that DIMIA has made to the IHSS, revealed in Minister Hardgrave's recent answer to my question on notice. These improvements do not, however, address all the funding deficiencies highlighted by the settlement services review or solve the structural problems with the contracts for the programs. I have to say that, when I have been visiting organisations around this country, I have seen the reality of large numbers of volunteers, whether they were based on church or religious groups or had other charitable interests or were from certain ethnic communities, who have given their time and wanted to help their fellow human beings. I have had the evidence from them about the fact that they have walked away from the system. They have found the bureaucracy, red tape and requirements too great to put up with. </para><para>I have spoken to organisations that talk about the peaks and troughs of the arrival of humanitarian entrants. They get very little notification of when people will arrive and how many et cetera and they are supposed to service them and cater for them. I have seen the reality of different contracts in some states, where too many contractors handle different parts of the schemes. By the way we are going at the moment, it will reach the stage where one group will be providing chairs and the other will be providing tables. It really is a mess. These structural problems need to be solved before the next IHSS tender round, which is due to commence later this year.</para><para>In relation to the citizenship campaign, $6.3 million was revealed by the government communication unit to Senator Faulkner at separate estimates hearings. There is no portfolio budget statement for this campaign. It is an implied admission that, despite all the posturing around the place by the minister, the government's performance in regard to citizenship levels is very disturbing. He can do all he wants—he can get into an aeroplane and have a ceremony giving people certificates there or he can run around sports centres, which is all very noble and all very interesting—but the truth is that the citizenship rates are of concern. As I say, the government seems to be about to do something about that with its $6.3 million, but what it is going to do is unspecified.</para><para>My fundamental concerns with waste and extravagance by DIMIA are the $600,000 annual contract with a media monitoring firm and a further annual contract of $140,000 with a separate firm, apparently to distribute departmental and ministerial media releases. That is $740,000 in that area. There is a travel contract with a private sector travel agency for the provision of international and domestic travel, presumably for DIMIA staff, costing $28 million over 2½ years. There are litigation contracts with private law firms totalling $24 million over 4½ years, in addition to three separate contracts worth almost $40 million with the Australian Government Solicitor. </para><para>There are fundamental concerns with this portfolio, one of which is the survival of migrant resource centres in this country—organisations established under the aegis of the Fraser government and continued under Labor. They have very grave concerns as to their future. In IHSS things are being contracted out just because of the ideological need to do so: `Contracting out sounds good, so let's just try it. Who cares if there is a mess afterwards? We'll come back in a few years time and try to rectify the structural problems.' Also, there is of course the issue of the overall settlement services review.</para><para>As I said, there is also the question of where long-term communities in this country are going to fit. Italians are still the largest group with non-English ancestry in this country. They are a typical example of a long-term community. Throughout this country they have established very fine, respected welfare organisations. Many of these receive DIMIA funding, for very good reason. There is a real question about whether that is going to continue if the government succeeds at the next election. Its commitments to fund these organisations are clearly only for this year, only for this round. One has to ask why the minister and the department are not answering questions and criticism and guaranteeing that they do not intend to attack this program, because their own review clearly signals an intention to attack the funding basis of these larger communities.</para><para>It is all right to say that it might not be appropriate, that the Eritreans, the Ethiopians, the Somalis, the Sudanese, the Sierra Leoneans—the more recent arrivals—may have more needs. Yes, they do have greater needs. We see that in the sharing out of time at SBS. We have to have those debates. But one does not take money from these old, established communities without ensuring the kinds of services that are provided will be picked up by another government department. One cannot attack their funding simply because one has to fund other organisations. Just because Eritreans have a need does not mean that this government should attack the Jewish community, the Italians and the Greeks. That is what the government are on about.

It also shows that if an election were held today Labor would win easily. I believe this is because many Australians want to get on Mark's ladder of opportunity and because they grow increasingly tired of a government and a Prime Minister who have been in office for over eight years now and have nothing new to offer the country. Indeed the Prime Minister gives every indication of wanting to stay in office forever. What must Treasurer Costello be thinking?</para></talk.start><para>I believe it is time that the Liberal Party looked seriously at generational change—at getting rid of a tired, stale, old Prime Minister and stale old ministers and seeking to refresh and reinvigorate the Liberal Party with new blood and new challenges. But let us not forget that Treasurer Costello had his opportunity. Way back in 1995 when the then Leader of the Opposition, Alexander Downer, had lost it, the Treasurer could have fought the previous leader, John Howard, for the leadership. He chose not to. Do you know why? Because he looked at the next election and he thought to himself: `I might lose. Better to wait.' In a comparable situation, Mark Latham chose to fight Kim Beazley, the member for Brand, for the leadership because he looked ahead to the next election and he said to himself, `I might win.' That is the difference between Mark Latham and Peter Costello.

The Treasurer might get to put in a couple of heartbreaking years in opposition, but if things start to get interesting he will be mown down by the present Minister for Health and Ageing or by Malcolm Turnbull.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This government's eight years in office have been a disaster for health care in Australia. In my electorate of Wills and right throughout Australia, bulk-billing has declined every single year since the Howard government won office, and families have had to pay more for essential health care each year. Last week the Howard government approved a 7.5 per cent average premium increase for the private health insurers—that is triple the inflation rate—which will mean another cost impost on millions of Australian families. They will be forced to pay an average $150 a year extra for their health insurance. That is last year's tax cut gone in one fell swoop.</para><para>I have to say that I am disgusted at the cosy relationship between this government and the private health insurers. I do not know the detail of what private health insurers do for the Liberal and National parties or for individual coalition MPs and candidates, but it must be a heck of a lot because this government is prepared to give $2.4 billion of taxpayers' money directly to the private health funds rather than spend that money promoting bulk-billing or promoting direct hospital services, where it could do so much. They claim that the taxpayer subsidy keeps premiums down, but have a look at the evidence: premium rises of 6.9 per cent in 2002, 7.5 per cent last year and 7.5 per cent this year—way above the inflation rate.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Is the member for Boothby seeking to ask a question?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>TK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr Southcott</name></talker><para>—Yes.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Will the member for Wills allow a question?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name></talker><para>—Yes.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>TK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr Southcott</name></talker><para>—How would the member for Wills propose to spend the $2.4 billion that is currently spent on the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name></talker><para>—I have no doubt that much of the money has been spent in a wasteful way and that we would be far better off if we were to provide money directly for bulk-billing, directly for services and directly for hospitals.

They do not contribute anything, yet they are the one group of people this government is in love with and will do anything for. When groups of workers ask for pay increases, the Liberal and National parties go spare. Have you heard the hysterical rhetoric from the Victorian Liberals about pay claims in Victoria? In Victoria, the Liberals simply cannot be satisfied. If the Victorian Labor government settles the pay claims, the Liberals say they are giving in to the unions. If they do not settle the pay claims, the Liberals say there is chaos and industrial anarchy and the government should do something about it. The message is that pay rises will lead to inflation and ruin us all—yet, when it comes to the private health insurers, money is no object. They do not care if ordinary families have to pay another $150 per year.</para><para>As shadow environment minister, I lament the way this government has been going up and down on one spot over action to tackle climate change. The need for action gets more urgent with every passing year. Back in August 2002, after the government announced that it would not be ratifying the Kyoto protocol on climate change, it announced the climate change forward strategy. It indicated that the strategy would be developed over the course of the next 12 months. We are still waiting for it. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, the Treasurer and others took to cabinet a proposal they had developed for a greenhouse emissions trading regime. It was a very modest scheme. It talked about introducing emissions trading by 2013. But the Prime Minister simply knocked it on the head. The aluminium industry and the power industry had got to him. Those who had been working on the climate change forward strategy fell off their chairs. The government has not announced the climate change forward strategy, because it has nothing to announce. There is no climate change forward strategy. We are going up and down on the one spot, and all the while the effects of climate change get more serious.</para><para>Then there was the long-awaited national energy policy. I am told that the Energy Task Force is just confusing matters further. At the last budget the Treasurer said more than he was supposed to say about the government's intentions in taxing LPG. This threw the LPG industry into a tail spin and caused six months of utter confusion on excise arrangements. The government finally issued a statement on this late last year, but it does not know where to take energy policy from here. The fact is that taxing LPG will increase greenhouse gas emissions, and those working on the energy policy have no bright ideas as to how to offset this. So business, consumers, motorists and environmental groups are all in the dark. There is no national energy policy and no climate change forward strategy. It is a government which is clueless when it comes to greenhouse and energy policy.</para><para>This brings me to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> back in January by Simon Grose. This article contains many errors. It is a bit hard to know where to start, but I want to deal with one paragraph in particular. It says:</para><quote><para>Despite what Thomson may say in Opposition, there is little he would do differently on greenhouse emissions if he were in the minister's seat, and he would have inherited a country in a pretty strong position.</para></quote><para>Firstly, Australia is not in a pretty strong position. Projections of emissions to 2020, prepared by the Australian Greenhouse Office, show that greenhouse gases produced by the generation of energy will have shot up to 160 per cent on their 1990 levels. To the extent that we are on track to meet our Kyoto target—and in fact we are presently tracking for 110 per cent of 1990 emission levels, when our Kyoto target is 108 per cent—this is due to the impact of one-off changes to land-clearing arrangements. This cannot be done more than once.</para><para>The statement that there is little I would do differently as minister about greenhouse gas emissions is arrant nonsense. Had Mr Grose bothered to contact me before writing his article, I could have spared him the embarrassment of making a mistake by pointing out several things. Firstly, I would ratify the Kyoto protocol and have Australia play a constructive role in international negotiations, rather than try to scuttle and undermine them. Secondly, Labor would develop a system of emissions trading. The Kyoto protocol may not be happening in the absence of ratification from the US or Russia but the European Union is developing an emissions trading regime, which will come into effect from 1 January next year. We would develop a regime which would be recognised by and compatible with that, because to do otherwise would see Australian businesses frozen out of a huge market. Thirdly, Labor would increase the mandatory renewable energy target by an additional five per cent by 2010. In contrast to this government's do-nothing approach to renewable energy, to clean energy, we would promote it. Fourthly, we would introduce a greenhouse trigger into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. So there is a great deal that I can and would do about greenhouse gas emissions.</para><para>And we do need to act. Climate change is hitting Australia already and will hit us harder in the future. I saw the tree decline in the midlands of Tasmania, where that area is drying out and trees are dying of thirst. Similarly, in south-west Western Australia there have been many years of reduced rainfall and we have seen a drier climate for that part of Australia. We face the prospect of losing our snowfields in Victoria, of coral bleaching in the Barrier Reef, of species diversity in the wet tropics declining by anything up to 50 per cent, of dengue fever spreading further southwards and even of malaria. We face the prospect of extreme weather events—droughts, floods and bushfires becoming more frequent and more severe. </para><para>All of this means that I was astonished to hear recently of the National Farmers Federation telling a Senate committee that they do not support ratification of the Kyoto protocol. This idea is absolutely in the teeth of the best interests of Australia's farmers. Farmers have much to lose from extreme weather events. The recent drought, for example, was the most severe in history. That was not only because the country was very dry but because our temperatures were of the order of two degrees Celsius higher than they had been during previous droughts. That led to more evaporation, less moisture availability and a more serious drought. So the position that the Farmers Federation are taking is astonishing.</para><para>Kyoto is about getting other countries to do the right thing. It is about addressing those 98 per cent of emissions that come from the rest of the world. How on earth can it make sense for a farmers organisation to say that while Australia is going to meet its Kyoto target—and that is what the government says—we are not interested in international action to make other countries meet their targets? It is like turkeys asking for an early Christmas. Beyond Kyoto, Australia's role as a spoiler in international environmental forums has become notorious. Indeed, at a recent conference on biological diversity in Malaysia, the environmental organisation Greenpeace thought Australia's performance so bad that we, together with Malaysia, were the joint winners of the 2004 `Champion Assassin of Life on Earth' award. Good grief!</para><para>We received that award for our insistence on introducing trade issues into the Convention on Biological Diversity, undermining the precautionary principle of the convention and questioning agreed targets. At one stage, the Australian delegation, presumably acting on the authority of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, decided that if it did not get its way on the definition of the precautionary principle it would try to bring the conference to a dead end by random objections, objecting to already agreed texts and abusing the conference's rule of procedure, which requires all decisions to be taken by consensus. Australia proposed to delete a sentence as innocuous as, `Respect for land tenure, prior informed consent and Indigenous territorial rights were critical in this regard.' Australia argued against recognising a range of governance systems, including traditional knowledge and practices of Indigenous peoples. Australia argued against a proposal to have a thorough framework for assessing protected area system gaps. Australia pushed to have two of the targets previously agreed to in Montreal in November reconsidered. That was the kind of action which earned us such an unfortunate award.</para><para>Just today we have seen the government again show its hostility to environment protection by announcing that its land-clearing promise has been broken. Minister Truss in question time announced, in an embarrassing reversal for the environment minister, that the government does not intend to honour its promise to pay $75 million to Queensland farmers in compensation for a ban on land clearing of remnant vegetation in that state. I will just take the House through some of the history of this. On 16 May last year, the Queensland government introduced a moratorium on broadscale land clearing in Queensland. The federal Minister for the Environment and Heritage, David Kemp, said that the Howard government had acted to stop land clearing in Queensland. He said:</para><quote><para>We've worked with Queensland closely and today I'm delighted to announce that a moratorium has now been imposed on new applications and permits on land clearing in Queensland.</para></quote><para>He boasted:</para><quote><para>This was a result of the fact that the Howard Government has been working in close partnership with the Queensland Government to ensure that we can bring into place a proper framework to govern vegetation clearing in Queensland and to protect native remnant vegetation.</para></quote><para>A week later, on 22 May, he followed this up by announcing a joint Commonwealth and Queensland assistance package of up to $150 million, with $75 million to come from each level of government. During the remainder of 2003, the Commonwealth government failed to follow through on this commitment, and at the end of last year, after numerous unanswered letters, the Beattie government decided that the Howard government was not serious at all about a halt to land clearing. On 18 January this year, Premier Beattie announced that he would increase Queensland's contribution from $75 million to the full $150 million. Notwithstanding that, in a subsequent press release dated 30 January, the environment minister still claimed that the Howard government `has committed $75 million to achieve an end to broadscale land clearing in Queensland'. Today we find the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry telling the parliament that the Howard government is no longer committed to paying the $75 million.</para><para>Action is urgently needed on land clearing. Land clearing has three strikes on it: it is the principal cause of salinity; it is the principal threat to endangered species of birds, plants and animals; and it is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Land clearing in Queensland kills around 100 million native mammals, birds and reptiles every year. Both Queensland land-holders, the farmers themselves, and those people who are concerned to protect the environment will be disgusted at the federal government's withdrawal of financial support for needed action there.</para><para>The other area I want to return to as a conspicuous example of government environmental failure is its handling of the defence land at Point Nepean. First, it said it was going to sell part of Point Nepean. The member for Flinders thought that was all right. He said, `I accept full responsibility for fighting for such an outcome.' He told the <inline font-style="italic">Mail </inline>newspaper that on 30 July. Later on the government decided that it was not going to sell it; it was going to lease the land to a group involving Queensland developer FKP. The member for Flinders thought that was all right too. He told Barry Cassidy on 3LO radio, `This is a fantastic outcome.' Later on he decided that he had been a saviour of Point Nepean. In fact, he is one of the executioners of Point Nepean, pretending to be its saviour. The result at Point Nepean has been achieved over the strenuous objections of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, the member for Flinders and, indeed, some personnel in Environment Victoria who sold this issue out a long time ago and who left it to the likes of Kate Bailleau, Chris Smythe and others to fight on and establish a community campaign of such strength that the federal government could simply not ignore it.</para><para>The government has said it is going to establish a trust when what it should really do is hand the land over to the Victorian government to be declared a national park. Why should the community have to wait five years before Point Nepean is handed over to the Victorian government?

I have been told by constituents many times about the frustration of not being able to get dental treatment. People who cannot afford a private dentist are missing out on critical dental treatment. The elderly and the disabled are often vulnerable to deteriorating dental health, for a number of reasons. Many medicines, for instance, cause dry mouth syndrome, which can lead to gum disease. Loss of teeth, badly fitting dentures and/or painful gums impact on the diet and the overall health of the elderly, reducing many of them to unsatisfactory and unsatisfying mushy food. Physically or mentally disabled people are often unable to care properly for their teeth and therefore they too suffer from dental health problems.</para></talk.start><para>All this suffering has come about, at least in part, because the Howard government abolished the Commonwealth Dental Health Scheme in 1996. At the time the scheme was abolished there were about 380,000 Australians on the waiting list, which was about six months long. By May 2000 the waiting list had grown to 500,000 people, and these people were facing a wait of between eight months and five years. No figures are available for the period since, as the collection of national figures has been stopped—and I wonder why. Despite increasing expenditure by state governments on dental services for low-income people, there is now a big unmet demand for public dental services. A recent national survey found that one-third of Australians in the $30,000 to $50,000 household income bracket had not been to the dentist for over two years, because they could not afford to go.</para><para>For this reason, I am very pleased that the ALP have decided to make dental health one of our priorities when in government. Federal Labor, with the state governments, will establish the Australian dental care scheme. This will be separate from Medicare, which was never intended to cover dental services. $300 million will be provided in the forward estimates for provision of dental care for health care card holders and their dependants. Of this, $120 million per year will be allocated for Australian dental care and $13 million will be used for dental assessments of older Australians entering residential aged care. Every person entering a residential facility will receive an oral health assessment and a written action plan from a qualified dental professional spelling out the appropriate measures for oral health. The Australian dental care agreement between the Australian government and the state governments will ensure that all low-income Australians, no matter where they live, will have access to affordable dental care.</para><para>I would like to spend a couple of minutes debunking a few myths about dental services. The first myth is that the Commonwealth Dental Health Scheme was only ever a temporary one—a one-off program—so it was okay for the government to stop the scheme. The fact is that in 1996 funding, increasing from a base of $100 million per year, was built into the forward estimates up to 1999-2000. This means that the Commonwealth Dental Health Scheme was planned as an ongoing program. The second myth is that the states should have redirected hospital funding to public dental programs. The truth is that the states are actually forbidden by the Commonwealth health care agreements to spend Commonwealth hospital money on dental services. The states face heavy financial penalties if they do move this money to dental programs. The third myth is that the states have sole responsibility for dental care. The Constitution itself is the source for debunking this myth. The Constitution gives the Commonwealth responsibility for making laws for the provision of hospital benefits, medical and dental services. Labor used this power when it established the Commonwealth Dental Health Scheme, and Howard canned the scheme by removing its funding.</para><para>I would like to turn to the subject of aged care. I hear over and over again—and I see for myself—the crisis in our aged care sector. The crisis comes from three sources: one is the underfunding and, if you like, the overadministration of aged care; the second is the lack of places; and the third is the crisis in staffing. The underfunding and overadministration of aged care is a common tale across Australia. People from aged care facilities in my area tell me about the inadequate funding of various levels of patients and the need for funds for capital improvements. There is a growing number of facilities not meeting accreditation requirements, closing down or being put into receivership because of financial problems.</para><para>I am told that people going into residential care now are sicker and frailer than people were when entering an aged care facility a decade ago. This has implications for staffing and for the finances of the facility. I cannot forget the nurse who approached me some time ago and told me about the utter frustration and despondency she and her colleagues feel because they cannot give the residents the care they need. Staffing cutbacks because of a lack of funding mean that staff do not have the time to stop and spend a few minutes talking to a resident or calming a resident in tears, and feeding residents becomes a rushed job. The fact is that these professional people are forced to give care which is rushed and less than perfect. It is both undignified and totally unsatisfactory from the point of view of both the resident and the staff member. Nurses in aged care facilities are paid less than their colleagues in the acute care sector. This only adds to their frustration and to the growing difficulties aged care facilities have in recruiting staff.</para><para>If there is any doubt about this situation, one can look at the number of homes being sold off simply because the present owners cannot afford to continue owning them. The Salvation Army has recently put 15 of its 19 aged care facilities around the country—including some in Victoria—on the market. The Salvation Army has said that the matter of ongoing financial viability, the need to find capital in excess of $100 million to upgrade facilities and significant consolidated losses in the last three years are some of the reasons for its decision to sell its facilities.</para><para>Administrators in aged care facilities also frequently raise the problem of the increasing paperwork required for the accreditation system. They tell me about spending most of the day behind the desk writing reports instead of being out there with their residents and providing the care the residents deserve and need. This excessive time spent on paperwork is made even more wasteful when there is no clear evidence that this system actually leads to improved care. The Australian National Audit Office audited the accreditation agency last year. In its report, the National Audit Office noted that there is no way of knowing whether or not the accreditation system actually improves the quality of care for the residents. This is because the government has not undertaken an evaluation program to determine this vital information. The accreditation system is costly to the taxpayer—about $11.5 million a year. The service providers themselves are also asked to pay a fee for their accreditation review—a review that is time consuming and of no proven value.</para><para>Another issue in aged care that needs attention is the growing demand and need for aged care that is culturally appropriate. This is needed for our Indigenous people and the frail aged people who were not born here. I watched my Dutch born, well-educated, highly intelligent mother-in-law, who had an excellent command of the English language, grow old and frail before she died. She changed from a woman who used English as her preferred language for years to one who forgot her English and returned to her native Dutch language. Towards the end, she was unable to make herself understood to the staff looking after her and barely able to communicate with her own sons—one can imagine the frustration of that for all concerned.</para><para>We need aged care facilities which not only have staff who speak the language of the residents but which provide meals in surroundings suitable and comforting to the residents. An excellent example of this is the Dutch aged care facility in Carrum Downs in my electorate. We need all sorts of different languages and cultures in aged care, including many Asian languages. A Vietnamese constituent of mine told me about his friend with an elderly mother. The friend was unable to find a culturally appropriate nursing home for his Vietnamese-speaking mother anywhere in the south-east region of Melbourne. There are no facilities specifically for Indochinese people in the south-east. The city of Greater Dandenong has the largest number of Indochinese elderly people in Melbourne, yet there are no culturally appropriate low- or high-care facilities for these people.</para><para>I want now to talk about education. Late last year I received a petition from 458 people, mostly students, condemning the Howard government's higher education legislation. The petitioners were alarmed at the prospect of having to pay $150,000 for a university degree. They saw the changes as the end of tertiary education for many students from middle- and lower-income families. I have heard the argument that education, particularly university education, is not of interest to many people, particularly those on low incomes. This is not my experience, and it is not the opinion of the 458 petitioners. I have met many parents who themselves have not had the benefit of completing secondary school and certainly have not seen the inside of a university yet go to extraordinary lengths to ensure their children get a good education. These parents understand that education is the key to their child's material success and fulfilment as a person.</para><para>It is getting harder and harder to get into a university or even a TAFE course. There are now 20,000 fewer fully funded university places than there were in 1996. This means that this year about 20,000 people who have the qualifications for entry into a university course have missed out. About 15,000 people have missed out on a TAFE place. The government's response to this is to introduce increased HECS fee places and full fee-paying places for universities and to ignore the TAFE system completely. By increasing university fees, the government will continue to deny a university education to many young people. Andrew McCallum, the President of ACOSS, says that the participation in tertiary education of students from low-income families is already 50 per cent below that of medium- to high-income families. This government shows no care or concern for this fact. By increasing HECS and encouraging full fee undergraduate courses, the government is callously denying many young, capable people access to higher education.</para><para>Recent comments from the Prime Minister about valueless government schools is further evidence of the arrogant attitude this government has towards access to education. This government is actually encouraging division in our society between the well off and those not so well off. It is making sure that those with deep pockets get a good education while those without deep pockets, despite any talent or potential they might have, are in essence being thrown away. This is a waste of our resources from a community and economic point of view and is devastating to the young people involved.</para><para>The Labor Party's response is set out in the Aim Higher document. It states that the ALP in government will create 20,000 new full-time and part-time undergraduate places every year by 2008, create 20,000 new full- and part-time TAFE places every year by 2008, abolish full fees for Australian undergraduates, not increase HECS fees and increase the HECS repayment threshold to $35,000 from July 2004.</para><para>We keep on hearing about the Australian economy and how well it is doing. The problem is that this prosperity is not being shared by all or even most Australians. Over 100,000 Australians are homeless, and 2.4 million live below the poverty line. Poor Australians are struggling even if they have a job. One million households have some work, but not enough to give them a decent income. The divide between the well off and those struggling is getting wider. The top five per cent of income earners earn the same in total as the bottom 45 per cent. The incomes of the top 20 per cent have grown seven times faster than the incomes of the bottom 20 per cent and 50 times faster than the incomes of middle-income earners over the last four years.</para><para>We have an alarming number of people either unemployed or underemployed. Those with jobs are more likely than ever before to be employed on a casual basis. A person in a casual job gets trapped. They have no access to sick leave or holiday pay. Even those who have been with the same employer, working regular hours, for a very long time are denied these entitlements. As at June last year, the number of men in permanent, full-time jobs had grown by 3.5 per cent since 1996. For women, this figure was 7.5 per cent. In the same period, the number of men in casual jobs had increased by 21 per cent and the number of women by 14 per cent.</para><para>Quite apart from losing out on entitlements, a person on a casual wage lives a more insecure life. Often families relying on casual work cannot rely on there being enough income to cover the household bills or to pay for a school excursion for the kids. A person on a casual wage often cannot borrow money to buy a house or even a household item. They cannot borrow from reputable lenders anyway. The person stuck in casual employment often gets stuck in the poverty trap. Despite our economic growth, there are more long-term unemployed people now than when this government came into power in 1996. Despite the increase in the long-term unemployed, this government has halved its spending on labour market programs. The government accuses people of adopting welfare dependency, yet it cuts programs to assist people back into the work force. </para><para>Add to this the problem of those who are aged over 45 years and trying to get back into work, and a very dismal picture is painted of the Job Network system and also of this government's lack of commitment to getting people back into work. Almost one in three people over 45 who are unemployed say that they are unemployed because of the attitudes of employers—employers who consider that those over 45 are too old. This figure grows to 59 per cent of those over 55 years of age. We must get better at employing older workers. We have to change the culture that says that these people are too old to be useful and we have to stop the discrimination that exists against mature age workers. I hear too many stories of people who are basically tossed into the too-hard basket by Job Network agencies. People who have lifetime experience are invaluable in the work force. They have the technical skills required and they certainly have a different perspective on things than their younger colleagues. A sensible workplace will have a mix of men and women, young and old. We must work to establish a culture where older workers are valued.</para><para>This picture of older workers having trouble getting work is set against the background of the Treasurer recently urging us to work beyond normal retirement age—in fact, to work until we drop. Those who have worked hard all their lives and have reached a reasonable retirement age look forward to being able to retire. Usually people look forward to spending their retirement in good health and doing the things they have saved for all their lives. Maybe they look forward to taking a holiday—some people like to exchange bricks and mortar for a caravan. Most people look forward to a mix of spending time with family, including grandchildren, enjoying sport and social activities, doing some volunteer work and maybe undertaking some study. People heading for retirement do not want to be told now that all their plans should be tossed away and they should just stay at work.</para><para>Another issue that has been well rehearsed here is the issue of Medicare. Let me be very clear about this: people in Isaacs do not want Medicare to be destroyed. People want the option of being able to attend a doctor who will bulk-bill them. People are worried about not being able to afford to go and see the doctor. I was talking to a constituent recently who was very upset because she now has to ration her visits to her GP. This woman has cancer and should be seeing her doctor regularly. What sort of a society are we living in where a sick person has to ration her visits to her doctor?</para><para>The lack of bulk-billing is just one symptom of a health service in crisis. There is also a shortage of doctors in the outer urban areas. The combination of these two things means that people are turning in growing numbers to the public hospital system for attention when they should really be seeing their local GP—if only they could find one and if only they could find one that bulk-bills. Dandenong Hospital has reported that 38 per cent of all the presentations at its accident and emergency department are primary care type presentations—in other words, people who should be seeing their local GP. It is interesting that at the nearby Frankston Hospital there is a much lower percentage of primary care type presentations, and that is because Frankston Hospital has a bulk-billing GP clinic attached to it. I think the message is very clear.</para><para>In finishing, let me summarise my points. There is a need for affordable dental care for those on low incomes, and that need is becoming desperate. We need more aged care beds, and we need them to be properly funded. We need aged care facilities that are culturally appropriate for non-English-speaking people. We need to have higher education available to those who have the academic ability, regardless of how deep their pockets are. We need secure ongoing employment, to replace the de facto permanent jobs offered on a casual basis only. We need to change our attitudes to employing older people. We need to respect those who have reached retirement age and now want to enjoy their retirement and we should not force them to work until they drop. Finally, we must ensure that Medicare is saved.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>25895</page.no><name role="metadata">Livermore, Kirsten, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LIVERMORE</name><name.id>83A</name.id><electorate>Capricornia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is with great pleasure that I join this debate this afternoon on the <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004, </inline><inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R1977">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline>. It is a very useful debate, because it provides the opportunity to talk about issues of importance to people in my electorate. These bills clearly illustrate what the government's approach to running this country is—and what it has been about since coming to office in 1996.</para></talk.start><para>The time has come when the Australian people clearly understand that this Howard government has in its arrogance forgotten to whom it is accountable. The government has failed to finance the basic services that Australians expect their government to provide. The Howard government has failed to provide adequate basic services like health and education. This is not a government for all Australians. The Howard government has created a situation where some communities are looked after lavishly while other communities are neglected. It has created an environment where some Australians are living in poverty and struggling to put food on their tables. In Australia today some families have to decide whether they will go to the doctor and buy medicine or buy food. They simply cannot afford to do both.</para><para>Nowhere is this failure of the present government more clear than in regional Australia, in electorates like mine, Capricornia in Central Queensland. This is not the Australian society that I or those of us on this side of the House wish to see, but it seems that this is the Howard government's vision which is being imposed on the Australian people. In the short time I have to address these bills today, I want to focus my remarks on some of the government's failures that are adversely affecting the people of Capricornia in Central Queensland. I also want to make the point that, with this Howard government, the pain for regional Australia is not over yet. The government has more to come, and I wish to take this opportunity to flag a couple of the new policies we all know the current government has in store for people in electorates like mine in regional Australia.</para><para>Many communities across Central Queensland are only just starting to learn to live with the closure of one or more of their local bank branches. Labor believes that banking is an essential service and there should be equality of access and costs for all Australians for such an important service. However, the recent report by the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on regional banking services and the foreign ATM fee structure has sent another shudder through rural and regional Australia. </para><para>Currently, banks charge their customers a foreign ATM fee when they use an ATM owned by another institution. This fee is the same whether you live in Sydney or Rockhampton, Longreach or Mount Morgan. However, under pressure from the banks, government members of parliament are proposing to allow banks to charge rural and regional customers higher fees to use an ATM. Some experts are suggesting that the cost of using a foreign ATM in rural Australia could rise to between $5 and $10 per transaction. Foreign ATM fees have already risen by 262 per cent since the government came to office. Clearly this government is not interested in the welfare of people living in regional Australia and it is becoming more and more obvious that this government does not understand the needs of people in rural and regional Australia. </para><para>Anyone travelling through rural Australia will see that small business is at the heart of all of these small towns. Nowhere will you see a Bunnings or a K-Mart but in every town you will find local families committed to their small business and their local community. It is these small businesses which the government has penalised $15 million for not complying with their BAS obligations in the past 12 months, while Australia's big businesses were only fined a total of $9,000.</para><para>Under the Howard government a third of small businesses spend one to two days on each of their BASs with a further 20 per cent of small businesses reporting that they spend more than two days on their BASs. Figures released by the Australian Taxation Office show that small businesses in regional and rural Australia are having trouble complying with their BAS obligations, with many finding the system too complicated to handle. Instead of helping these small rural businesses, the government rips another $15 million in penalties from that already overtaxed section of our economy. Only Labor has a simpler BAS option for small business operators, which will free up those people to run their businesses and spend more time with their families and their communities instead of filling out a mountain of paperwork for this government. </para><para>While talking about small business, one also has to look at employment in this country. Again we find that the Howard government has failed the most vulnerable in our society—I am speaking about our young people. Alarming new figures reveal that one in six teenagers in Central Queensland are unemployed. Figures based on recently released Australian Bureau of Statistics data show that, for the 12 months ending October 2003, youth unemployment was 18.9 per cent. This means that young people in places like Rockhampton and Yeppoon are being left behind by the Howard government. Instead of getting our young people into jobs or training, the Howard government is letting them fall through the cracks. These shocking results come at a time when the Job Network is failing to assist many young people to get into jobs. </para><para>Figures released by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations show that the Job Network intensive assistance program placed only 19.9 per cent of young Australians in full-time jobs in the year ending March 2003. The department's figures also found that, on completion of the intensive assistance program, an alarming 57 per cent of young unemployed Australians either remained unemployed, were in further assistance or, tragically, were so discouraged from their experiences they left the labour market altogether. Young Australian adults and their families deserve opportunities that give them a strong start in life. Our young people should not be condemned to starting their adult lives on the unemployment queue. </para><para>We have heard from many members about the experiences of constituents in trying to access dental care under the current system. The member for Isaacs ran through that issue in quite some detail. I would like to add to the debate the experiences of people in my electorate. There are many examples I could give of individuals who have been badly affected by this government's failure in dental care, but I would like to bring to the attention of the House the plight of just one person as an example of the problems faced by so many. A constituent of mine from Yeppoon has been waiting over a year for her treatment. Two of her molars are causing extreme pain and are starting to crumble in places. Over a year ago she visited the public health system and explained her situation. It was not until she had suffered three weeks of excessive pain that she underwent an interim filling, which was really just a quick fix to stop the toothache so that she could join the waiting list to have her teeth properly filled and repaired.</para><para>She has been waiting over one year now and the temporary filling fell out seven months ago. She still experiences extreme tooth pain, which is now also affecting her jaw. She has been advised by the staff at the public hospital that the dental surgeon comes once a month for one day and that she is No. 90 on the list. She cannot be promised when she may receive her treatment. She has been told that she will just have to wait until her name eventually moves up the list. It is a simple piece of mathematics to work out that, if one surgeon comes once a month and sees on average five patients, this woman would have to wait another 18 months to have her two fillings attended to. This poor woman has tried over and over to explain to the nurses that her tooth problems are affecting her whole jaw area and she is being kept poor by having to buy pain-killers on a daily basis.</para><para>This Howard government owes this woman an explanation. More than that, this government should act immediately to ensure that this woman and the many like her around Australia receive treatment quickly. It should be understood that the crisis in public dental care was exacerbated by the heartless decision made by the Howard government in its first budget back in 1997 to scrap Labor's Commonwealth Dental Health Program. It was a decision that profoundly affected the poorest people in our community. The decision to axe that program cannot even be defended on financial grounds for, as we now know, investing in public dental services now will save money in the longer term. There is increasing evidence that poor oral health is associated with many illnesses including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and preterm or low birth weight babies. Yet this government has washed its hands of this national crisis. It does not even acknowledge that this crisis exists. </para><para>The then Minister for Health and Ageing said on television some 12 months ago that the Commonwealth and states have various responsibilities and public dental health services are the responsibility of the states and `we don't deliver direct dental health programs'. It is not good enough for this government to try to pass the buck to the states by saying it is a state and not a Commonwealth responsibility, when Labor's effective program showed that we could attend to people's basic dental needs, cut down on waiting lists and have as part of our program preventative dental treatment.</para><para>In the case of my own state government, I think we need to congratulate the Beattie government on the way in which it has tried to fill the void left by this heartless and mean Howard government. Queensland Health currently has the largest public dental service in Australia, providing free services to school students and eligible adults and their dependants state wide. This is now a fully funded state program following the cessation of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program in December 1996. The demand for public dental care is increasing in Queensland as the population increases and more people are eligible to access the service. Queensland, with the other states and the Australian Dental Association, has lobbied the Commonwealth government to once again fund the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. The Beattie government has advocated for the restoration of this important national program as well as participating in the development of a national oral health plan to gain oral health its deserved national priority status.</para><para>Queensland was and remains the only state to recurrently fund a supplement to replace the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. The evidence of the need to introduce a Commonwealth funded dental program is compelling. Again, only Labor has listened to the people and only Labor will respond with a $300 million Australian dental care policy and program. This commitment by Labor is in stark contrast to the Howard government's failure in the area of dental care. It is in this general area of ensuring access to basic care and of assisting families, particularly those under financial pressure, where this Howard government needs to be condemned. Australian families feel that this government has failed them and the facts support the sentiments of these hardworking Australian families.</para><para>It is clear that we are in the grip of a national crisis as far as the provision of public dental health services is concerned. It is a crisis that this government will not acknowledge and will not take any action to remedy. It is a crisis because, as the Australian Council of Social Services has pointed out, there are 500,000 people across Australia currently on waiting lists for public dental treatment. It is a crisis because at least half a million of our fellow citizens cannot afford to pay for private treatment and are forgotten and left languishing on waiting lists in all states and territories. Hardest hit are low-income families and pensioners, including many people in rural and regional areas such as in my electorate of Capricornia. It is a crisis because people are waiting years to get basic treatment, such as having a tooth filled, and are often waiting between five and seven years for dentures. Again, it is the people living in rural and regional centres who are worst affected by this crisis. The staff in my electorate offices have a continuously open file on constituents in Capricornia whom this government has failed in that most critical area of dental care.</para><para>The examples that I have given this afternoon point to a government whose priorities are all wrong and a government that is out of touch with the needs of people in my electorate. This government is the highest taxing government in Australia's history, yet it cannot rein in its waste and mismanagement of public resources and refuses to take proper responsibility for the provision of basic services. There is a high price to pay for this government's careless attitude towards taxpayers' money, and it is the every day working families in my electorate who are paying that price. They are paying through higher fees for services that used to be regarded as the fundamental role of our national government—things like health and education. Those working families and those even worse off on pensions and benefits are paying for this government's neglect and mismanagement through the lack of access to vital services in my electorate. These include nursing home beds, bulk-billed GP visits, TAFE and university places and child care and outside school hours care. Right now the people in my electorate are paying the price for this government's neglect, and I believe that when the election is called later this year it is the Howard government that will pay the price—and quite rightly too.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>25898</page.no><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PLIBERSEK</name><name.id>83M</name.id><electorate>Sydney</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In rising to speak on the <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline> and the related bills, I want today to talk about sexual and domestic violence against women. These are particularly relevant crimes all of the time because of the vast number of victims of these crimes but, in a week in which we have been reading about the fallout of the allegations made against the Bulldogs Football Club members alleged to have assaulted a woman in Coffs Harbour, perhaps it is even more top-of-mind than it would normally be.</para></talk.start><para>Everyone would know that a number of members of the Bulldogs team have been accused by a 20-year-old woman in Coffs Harbour of sexually assaulting her. Of course, an allegation of such a crime is disturbing. The idea of the crime itself is disturbing. If it has occurred, it is a terrible thing for that woman, a shock for the whole community and a shock for many people who have read about it in the newspapers. An additional thing that I found incredibly disturbing is the language that is being used in the reports whereby you have players speaking about group sex using slang terms for it in a way that indicates that it is very often the topic of conversation. They have come up with a whole language for describing what happens in these situations. I think that that in itself is incredibly disturbing. That it is a matter for such common discussion that a language has developed around it with its own particular terminology is disturbing. Furthermore, it is disturbing that part of the discussion has occurred on rugby league web sites on which fans and others have been writing in a way that, in an absolutely classic fashion, blames the victim of this crime.</para><para>This speaks to us of a glaring problem in Australian culture. We know from research that has been done that up to 30 per cent of young men think it is okay to force a girl to have sex with them. We have a problem in this country with sexual assault, and the figures bear that out. In 2002 there were 17,850 victims of sexual assault who reported that they were victims of sexual assault. We know that this is the most underreported crime there is. There are varying estimates of the level of underreporting, but most experts would agree that there are probably 250 to 300 sexual assaults every day in New South Wales.</para><para>Sexual assault is a particularly violent and personal crime that leaves the victim in a highly traumatised state. Victims of this crime are often the most vulnerable people in our community—sometimes children, very young women, very old women, women with disabilities or mental health issues, or Aboriginal women. The thing that is particularly shocking about it as a crime is that in the vast majority of cases the women know their attackers. They are usually work colleagues, friends, family members or next-door neighbours, even partners.</para><para>The very illustrative point about the Bulldogs situation is that all of the things that the women are saying in the newspapers can be extrapolated to victims of sexual assault more generally. The things that are being said about these women are what women fear will be said about them if they report. They are things like: `She was asking for it', `It was the way she was dressed', `She was talking', `She was flirting'. It is extremely worthwhile to be having this debate now about how inappropriate, wrong and criminal these acts are. I am also shocked by the fact that the officials of the game are getting up and saying, `If they have broken our code of conduct we will deal very strictly with them.' If they have behaved in this way they have not broken a code of conduct: they have broken the law. I do not think we have heard a single one of football's supposed leaders out there saying, `If this has happened, these people have broken the law and they should go to jail.'</para><para>It reminds me of a couple of other recent cases. There is one case where the sentencing is happening at the moment. There are five young men involved and two girls. Four of the men were brothers, and it is alleged to have taken place in their home. The young men are saying that they did not realise that it was culturally inappropriate behaviour to gang rape two girls. We are so missing the point if we start talking about whether it is culturally appropriate behaviour or not. This is a criminal act. It is not just a criminal act in Australia; I imagine it is a criminal act in every single country in the world to force someone to have sex with you.</para><para>We have a problem with young men's attitudes to young women—and it is not just young men and young women; we have a problem with men's attitudes to women in that so many men seem to be able to convince themselves that somehow they are not culpable if they are involved in this behaviour and that somehow there is an excuse. Sometimes their families give them an excuse—we have seen court cases where the perpetrators' families have called the victims and their families names and accused the victims' families of somehow being complicit in what has happened to them.</para><para>What can be done? It is no good just saying that we have a terrible problem with attitudes in this country. We do, absolutely, and we need to police these crimes. We need to make sure that people who commit them are jailed and that the court system does not continue to make the life of the victim a living hell when it is protecting the lives of the perpetrators. We need to have good policing and good judicial structures, but we really need to be changing attitudes from a very early age. This is why I raised the point that 30 per cent of young boys in one survey said it is okay to force a girl to have sex. The only thing we can do is start teaching people from a very early age that violence is never okay and that relationships between human beings have to be based on respect and consent.</para><para>That was the purpose of the `No respect, no relationship' campaign that was being developed for this government. I was really very pleased when I saw a few years ago now that this government had made a commitment on this. I think it was at the time of the last re-election of this government. The Prime Minister said that domestic violence was going to be at the top of the list of priorities and dedicated $25 million, then a few years later another $25 million, to domestic violence and, at the same time, $16½ million for this campaign on changing attitudes towards sexual assault. I thought that was terrific. I do not often think that the Prime Minister is doing great things, but this was something that I was really very pleased to see. I think it is an incredibly important thing to do. That is why I was so very disappointed to hear about the decision to pull this advertising campaign.</para><para>This advertising campaign is not designed, as the Prime Minister has implied in his answers in parliament, to be a first port of call for information for someone who has been sexually assaulted. The campaign's communications strategy and the advertising agency brief, each approved by the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications, specified that the agency—Grey Worldwide—direct the target market to a specially created web site. That is what the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> says about it. It was an advertising campaign that was aimed at raising awareness and providing a point for further information for people to look at. The fact that it does not behave like a piece of information that is designed for people as a first port of call in a crisis is exactly the brief that the advertising agency was given. For the Prime Minister to imply—though he has never said it as directly as this—that the reason the ads were pulled was that they did not provide that crisis information is disingenuous given the government's own brief on the issue. I had a little play with these ads myself and, if that was the barrier to running the campaign, you could add an extra line at the bottom of the print ad that says, `If you have been sexually assaulted, call the police or your nearest rape crisis centre.' You could very easily run a national ad with one additional sentence. You would not have to change the layout of the ad at all. If you wanted to do state based ads, you could go one extra step and insert a phone number. I am not an advertising genius, but it took me about 15 seconds to work out how you could address the Prime Minister's main stated problem with these ads.</para><para>The advertising campaign is not going to go ahead. We have been told that the group that pulled the ad, the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications—which interestingly had no women on it until Sussan Ley was apparently recently appointed—decided that it was not in line with the government's message on this issue. The Prime Minister said on 17 February, `My broad understanding is that there was an intervention because the campaign did not conform to the decisions of the government.' On 19 February he said, `Suggestions that the campaign has been cancelled and will not go ahead are completely wrong.'</para><para>If the only thing that is wrong with it is that, as he originally said, it is not appropriate to tell someone who has just been sexually assaulted to look at a web site, I agree with that and I have told you the solution to that. If the problem is that it does not agree with the government's program or message in this area, I really want to know what the program or message is. This advertising campaign basically says that relationships have to be based on mutual respect and that, if you want further information, here is where you go. There are specific messages in each of the advertisements. One young girl who has been assaulted says, `I reported him. It was so hard to do but such a relief.' The message is that she did the right thing. Another young woman says, `I said no, but he wouldn't stop. I didn't know what to do.' The message is that that was sexual assault. A young man says, `Well, she was flirting with a couple of mates, and I gave her a slap. She deserved it.' The message is that, no, she did not deserve it. Another young man says, `A mate said the way I treated my girlfriend was embarrassing. I just never saw it until he said it.' The message is that it is important to think about your behaviour.</para><para>I am absolutely perplexed to know what could possibly be inappropriate in those messages. If we acknowledge that we need to change behaviours from a very early age in young men and young woman, who are underreporting and taking the blame and the shame on themselves if something like this happens, these messages would seem to me to be incredibly appropriate. All of the experts in this area—all of the experts who deal with attitude change in the area of sexual violence—say that these are the best tested messages that they have seen and that they would set a new international benchmark for good campaigning in this area. Again, I am perplexed that the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications could find anything with these messages that is problematic. Triple J, which were going to be part of this consolidated campaign, have decided apparently to go ahead with their eight 10-minute sections promoting healthy relationships between young people. I congratulate them for doing that. I think that is very responsible of them to do it. It is a shame that they will not have the backup of the print media for their campaign.</para><para>I want to turn very briefly in the few minutes left to me to the area of domestic violence. As I said earlier, the Prime Minister said at the beginning of his first term that domestic violence was going to be a priority for this government. In 1997, he announced the Partnerships Against Domestic Violence program, which was due in 2002, and then there was a further roll-out of funds for this partnerships program. I could go over the history of underspending in this area—the most obvious and classic example, of course, being the $10 million underspend which was diverted to use for the terrorism fridge magnet—but I want to talk about the more substantive issue.</para><para>The area of domestic violence affects very many Australians. Last year more than 32,000 women with young children were given shelter in women's refuges around this country. The statistics vary about how many people are affected by this, but it is not unusual to hear a figure of one in three or one in four women who in their lifetime experience domestic violence. It is an incredibly high figure. The underspending in this area is a problem in itself; there is plenty to spend money on. Many of the programs that have been run eventually under the Partnerships Against Domestic Violence program have been really excellent programs. I am not afraid to say that, even though there has been underspending by this government, many community organisations have come up with and run really excellent programs. The problem with this model of funding—and I have grave concerns about it—is that the money is not given out until late in the funding cycle. By the time a program gets under way, there might only be a year or 18 months left before their money runs out. If there is one thing that we can be absolutely sure of, it is that this is not a problem that is going to be solved overnight; this is a problem that will take generations to finally solve in this country.</para><para>The message on domestic violence is that we need to work with young people to break the intergenerational cycle of violence and that we need to educate whole communities and whole groups of people about domestic violence—what it is, what people have a right to object to in the first place. This is still not clear in Australian society. We have a great deal of work to do with the victims of domestic violence. Of course, we have to do something about the perpetrators too. The tragic thing is that, when 40 per cent of homicides in this country take place within marriages—within domestic relationships—and are the result of domestic violence, we muck around with a program that runs for a year or 18 months and when that year is up the program coordinator has to spend the next six months worrying about whether they are going to have the funding to keep running their program at the end of the funding cycle. I think that that is a really disappointing public policy result. It is an enormous frustration to the amazing people who work in this area, who are confronted every day with situations that no-one should be confronted with. It is a real letting down of the victims. Whenever we spend money on domestic violence or sexual assault awareness raising, the emergency services required go through the roof. We have to make sure that we are not just raising awareness and letting people hang out to dry. We have to fund the after-care services, the follow-through services, appropriately.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>25902</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—These appropriation bills seek funding for the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, AusAID and the Australian Federal Police for ongoing commitments and aid work in the Solomon Islands. They also cover funds for the New Guinea deployment of our Federal Police, the implementation of the MedicarePlus package and several other specified amounts for particular purposes. As well, the bills contain clauses that provide a mechanism for the Minister for Finance and Administration to lapse amounts not required by departments. This sensible provision seems designed to prevent agencies or departments from seeking ambit claim appropriations or from carrying forward unspent amounts. If that is the intention, it is obviously a sound budgetary move.</para></talk.start><para>The appropriation debate enables members, however, to make wide-ranging comments, and I want to discuss several matters that are highly pertinent to this election year. Telstra is one issue vital to this government's budgetary ambitions but at the same time vital to the Australian public's belief that continued public ownership of our major telco is non-negotiable. The latest twist in this debate is the Telstra-Fairfax furphy. As I said in a recent press release when the story hit the headlines:</para><quote><para>The political hand of the Prime Minister is up the shirt of the Telstra puppet in the latest act of the privatisation show ...</para></quote><para>I believe that the outrageous idea for Telstra to buy Fairfax emanated not from the Telstra senior management but from the cabinet and the Prime Minister to fuel the argument that a government should not be in a position to own a private media outlet.</para><para>The government desperately wants to get its hands on the $30 billion from a full Telstra sale. Indeed, its survival may well depend on it. No doubt many of the items on the government's wish list for the approaching campaign would depend on a full sale. Indeed, the Telstra-environment nexus could be further exploited by another heritage fund, as it was in 1996. But the public have consistently argued against the full sale of Telstra, and an overwhelming majority of rural constituents in particular are adamant that they will not countenance any sale under any circumstances. Telstra's inability to meet demand for new services in the bush makes a joke of the government's continued insistence that services are up to scratch. Only yesterday I was looking at recent figures of Telstra's response to the Estens inquiry, and it was pointed out that there is no separation of the city-country service figures in that and that the so-called 90 per cent or 95 per cent service rate that is being reached is highly coloured by the metropolitan outcomes.</para><para>This nebulous term `up to scratch' was invented on the run by a Queensland National Party senator at the end of his career who is more concerned about the survival of a political anachronism than about services to future generations of rural Australians. Despite the rhetoric of broadband Internet access, there is little hope of affordable access for people other than those close to a major centre or exchange. CDMA mobile services continue to disappoint and frustrate and are nowhere near the reliability once provided by the GSM-analog mix. Breakdowns and slowness of repair continue at a regular rate despite the best efforts of hard-working Telstra Country Wide staff in my area, who I suspect are totally frustrated by the inadequacy of their budget allocations.</para><para>Yet the Prime Minister, in response to pressure from the big end of town, stands in this place and defends not the people of rural Australia but the private shareholders of Telstra—these people holding shares without the permission of the wider Australian public. Indeed, the Prime Minister is arguing for the selfish interests of minority private shareholders at the expense of the majority public shareholding. How about the Prime Minister arguing on behalf of the majority of Australians, who do not want Telstra fully privatised—the 90-plus per cent of rural Australians who have answered surveys by me and the member for New England with a deafening `No!' when asked whether Telstra should be fully privatised? Of course, the continued public ownership of national assets is anathema not only to the corporate friends of the government and to the finance industry that stands to win—I would hardly say `earn'—a cool $600 million for the sale of the last tranche of Telstra. It is also anathema to the free market agenda, and no doubt there is already pressure for Australia to hand over its publicly owned telco to the market, as the Singaporean government has been required to do with its government owned SingTel under its FTA with the US.</para><para>Moving on to free trade, if you examine the trade fact site of the United States Trade Representative, you will read that under the FTA Australia will accord substantial access to US service suppliers, subject to very few exceptions, based on the so-called negative list approach. Australia's commitments apply across a wide range of sectors, including but not limited to telecommunications services and financial services, including banking, insurance and securities. Given that under the FTA all US investment in new businesses is exempted from screening under the foreign investment board regime and that thresholds for acquisitions are raised from $50 million to $800 million, one wonders: why is there a need for any limits on US ownership of Telstra; should it go to the market? Why is there a need for a foreign investment review process if, as the US trade site says, the higher $800 million threshold would exempt 90 per cent of US investment transactions from screening? I thought the Foreign Investment Review Board process was designed to ensure investments were in the best interests of Australian people. The average Australian would ask: `Why this lack of transparency?' Indeed, members in this place must be asking the same question if they are serious about their representative duties.</para><para>As for support for this free trade agreement from the so-called grassroots, I am battling to find it in much of my electorate. Most people seem to want an answer to the most basic question: if trade is supposed to be free, why has there been no increase in sugar exports and why is there such a long time frame for anything approaching free trade in beef and dairy products? There are also legitimate and deep concerns over the disadvantage that our manufacturing industry may face from the country of origin rules, and I suspect the car industry's enthusiasm may well be somewhat premature.</para><para>On top of this came last week's recommendations that pork, banana and apple imports be allowed. In the case of apples, growers are outraged that there has been no satisfactory explanation of how the fire blight bacteria can be kept out of this country if imports are allowed from New Zealand and, inevitably, from North America. We are being asked to concede that it is an acceptable risk for apples to be imported from fire blight infected New Zealand, whether it is from a currently active area or not. Apples that have had antibiotics not allowed in Australia sprayed on them during their flower to bud stage, supposedly to kill off any fire blight bacteria, have to be cool stored for six weeks. This replaces a previously discredited protocol, suggested several years ago, where a 50-metre buffer zone was to be created around export crops in New Zealand. That has now gone out the window and is substituted by this new regime.</para><para>This is protocol on the run. Whereas the New Zealand application for entry to Australia was rejected several years ago—as it has been since the 1940s when New Zealand growers first tried to access our markets—now, in the year of the free trade agreement, it seems that Biosecurity Australia has been forced to roll over for economic rather than quarantine reasons. Nothing has changed in this debate since 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000—indeed, for the past 80 years—except for one thing: the free trade imperative, which is to rule over all other considerations. Non-tariff barriers are no longer acceptable in any form—that is the message—and tariff barriers are only okay if they are selectively applied by the United States and complemented by subsidies. That is the real situation, and apple growers and horticulturists in my electorate are ready to revolt. I would suggest that growers in other electorates that cover the Murray Valley, the Tumut-Batlow area, parts of southern Queensland and Tasmania are feeling likewise, and that is only apple and pear growers, not pig or banana producers, who are already making their feelings known.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> editorial yesterday asks, `How come New Zealand is such a producer and exporter of applies if it's supposed to have this fire blight bacteria?' New Zealand has, like 39 other countries around the world which have been infected by legal and illegal imports, sustained its industry on the back of such infection. The disease can and does wipe out entire orchards and it destroys livelihoods. New Zealand growers have put up with the risk, just like they do with the Johne sheep-wasting disease. New Zealand's idea of a level playing field is one infected with every disease under the sun. Like America, with genetic modification, they believe that, unless they can contaminate the rest of the world's markets, they are not going to have the access that they require and, in many cases, the control of those markets by dint of their economies of scale. Is that any reason not to maintain every possible barrier to fire blight from entering Australia, especially when the Australian climate is said to be far more conducive to the spread of fire blight than the New Zealand climate? Just because New Zealand and North America's apple industries survive, with the ever present threat of fire blight and the ever present effects of it, is that any reason to risk infecting our orchards?</para><para>I asked the minister today whether he would consider an extension to the 60-day reply to the draft protocol and the recommendations that have been released. As I understood his answer, the minister said that the science has already been documented and we have been through this process many times in the past, but, yes, AQIS may consider an extension. But he seemed to be asking: why is it necessary? As I said, the last time around the protocol was rejected quite strongly because of the inherent risks. Now farmers are being asked, in the middle of harvesting, to come up with a science based response to a new protocol that has to deal with the antibiotics and the chlorine dip, which is supposed to obviate the risk of the fire blight bacteria getting into the calix and then into the core of the fruit. As I understand it, there is no guarantee that the antibiotics will do that job. It creates air pockets at the base of the apple. There is every risk—as I heard at a meeting in Orange last week, addressed by department of agriculture horticulturists and apple advisers—and real concerns that the very apples that have been treated in such a way could still be the carriers of this particular disease.</para><para>So we have the antibiotics; we have the chlorine dip, which is new to the protocol; we have the cool store, which is new to the protocol; and we no longer have any buffer zone. Yet the minister seems to be arguing that we have already covered the science. We have not. There is new science being put up as the answer to New Zealand's argument that they do not pose a risk, and it certainly requires more than 60 days for orchardists to get together the expertise that they need to respond in any substantial way to this recommendation. They are certainly very suspicious of the apparent speed with which AQIS, Biosecurity Australia and the government seem to be rushing this thing through. They wonder how coincidental it is that it is all happening at the same time as the free trade agreement is being put on the table.</para><para>Canada's National Union of Farmers has produced a startling report, showing how farmers in that country have fallen further and further behind the eight ball under the modern free trade model. The report is called The farm crisis: bigger farms and the myths of competition and efficiency. It maintains that the destruction of rural communities, growing environmental problems, declining farm numbers and the farm income crisis cast doubt on the sustainability of the current high input, export oriented expansionist model. The report puts it thus:</para><quote><para>As the system is currently structured, farmers are just the hamsters in the wheel that powers an expanding agribusiness empire. The Government's solution to the farm crisis is for the hamsters to run faster.</para></quote><para>The Canadian farm union's report further states:</para><quote><para>Globalisation and trade agreements have increased competition levels for farmers—driving down farmers' prices and profits—and the effects for the dominant agribusiness transnationals have been just the opposite—</para></quote><para>and not only for the transnationals, I would suggest. We saw the report released yesterday—and I think the minister was again talking about it in question time—that showed that Woolworths' and Coles' profit margins are only 4 per cent and so the growers have not got an argument when they say they are being squeezed by the supermarkets. How they are being squeezed, though, is by the increase in imports and the opportunities for other product, some of it produced with far cheaper labour than we have in this country, to come onto the market. That creates a surplus of supply and further drives down the prices that growers are getting. Even old season apples are being sold at about—or a little above—the cost of production.</para><para>We are risking our orchard industry, quite forgetting for the moment the risk of fireblight. We are increasing supply, and of course the supermarkets love that. They can force down prices. We seem always to be looking at the benefits to the consumer, but we are not going to have any producers if we continue down this route. We are only going to have supplies from those areas that can produce at the most minimal wage cost. That is what is happening. That is the danger that our agricultural industry—particularly the horticultural sector—is facing. Of course, it is not just a rip-off in the chain from grower to supermarkets; it is the fact that the supermarkets are able to screw down the prices they can deliver to local growers by importing masses of product from offshore.</para><para>Elsewhere in this report from the Canadian farm union, they say:</para><quote><para>Economists simply create the illusion of efficiency by refusing to factor in resource depletion, biodiversity loss, habitat destruction, water use, pollution, climate change, the degraded nutritional value of some foods and a host of other externalities.</para></quote><para>Madam Deputy Speaker Gambaro, mark those words. They could apply equally to much of Australian agriculture—and that is before the much vaunted free trade deal kicks in, with the American market enjoying a substantial advantage over ours for years ahead. Added to this is the quite deliberate agenda of contaminating our relatively clean green agriculture, land and products with genetically modified crops so that a few major transnational companies can control what our farmers plant and what chemicals they use and what products consumers eat, despite the growing rejection of GM-engineered foodstuffs by consumers in Europe and Asia. Producers in my area are asking why there is such a rush to introduce GM-engineered canola, when markets around the world are saying, `Hold off; we do not know the long-term health and environmental consequences.'</para><para>Indeed, a grower in my area, Lachie MacSmith, who recently went with an open mind to Canada to have a look at this as a canola producer, came back totally alarmed. The growers he met said, `Don't go down this route—we've basically become slaves to the GM industry and we can't segregate.' Once you go into it, the whole process means that you become captive to the technology.</para><para>This parliament was told by the AMA, in a committee inquiry I was party to about three or four years ago, that the jury is still out on the long-term environmental and health consequences. That was enough for me to hear alarm bells ringing. How, then, can the Monsanto spokesman, Mark Buckingham, say that GM crops have been accepted by Canadian farmers and have proved successful when the evidence is showing quite the contrary? From where do the Gene Technology Regulator and the GM industry acquire their superior wisdom when the AMA is not even prepared to proffer a projection on what the long-term consequences of this technology are?</para><para>What is the meaning of the New South Wales government's moratorium on the planting of commercial crops when we understand that they are about to buckle to requests to allow commercial trials? It makes an absolute nonsense of their promise, during the last state election campaign, to impose a meaningful moratorium. I call on the New South Wales minister to send a representative of his department to a meeting in Canowindra next week, to be attended by the deputy president of the Canadian farmers union, where she will spell out what she sees as the dangers of this technology to a country which should be prizing its clean green status and the buffer zone of the oceans around the continent.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>25907</page.no><name role="metadata">Vamvakinou, Maria, MP</name><name role="display">Ms VAMVAKINOU</name><name.id>00AMT</name.id><electorate>Calwell</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In debating the <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004,</inline> the <inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R1977">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline> I would like to demonstrate how the government both ignores the needs and increases the burden on Australian families. I also wish to highlight how the distorted social spending of the government mirrors the extent to which it is out of touch with the reality of daily life in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>Despite claims of superior economic management, it is an indisputable fact that the Howard government is the highest taxing and highest spending government in Australian history. As these bills indicate, it is also indisputable that, despite massive tax windfalls resulting from the GST and the sale of Telstra, essential public services are being eroded and some might say even destroyed. It is a growing paradox. It is certainly a paradox for the people in my electorate when this government collects record high taxes whilst simultaneously professing an inability to fund its health, education and welfare responsibilities. This government's distorted funding priorities and disregard for the welfare of Australians is making life for my constituents more and more difficult. Their frustration, of course, is understandable because, despite contributing more of their household income to the public purse, the government is wrenching affordable education, health and aged care from their reach.</para><para>In the end, it is a choice between differing values and the value we place upon the backbone of Australian society, which is of course our families. Labor recognises the tremendous pressure that is burdening Australian families and, unlike the current government, we are actively working towards easing that pressure. Ignoring the needs of Australians only serves to augment social frustration and dysfunction. Unfortunately, the government does not understand the pressure on our families and, unlike Labor, does not consider support of struggling families with the same sense of urgency that it requires. One need look no further than the yellowing pages of the Prime Minister's report into families in 2002, which clearly identified the need for immediate social reform.</para><para>Unlike the Prime Minister, who chose to ignore this call for assistance and deal with the problems facing countless Australians, Labor has already formulated viable, affordable solutions to give our families the helping hand they deserve. Labor's prioritised social agenda for health, education and aged care is not a political white elephant. The funds to provide those services exist and we will fund these services by relocating government spending in line with societal need. Labor can potentially invest an extra $5 billion into public education and health—$5 billion that the Howard government is wasting through its misdirected priorities.</para><para>This commitment to reprioritise the agenda and redirect funds is being met with relief and approval by Australian families. I see evidence of this in my electorate office on a daily basis. Families are responding positively to Labor's agenda and are excited about the opposition's focus on opportunity for all. Our policies on early childhood learning, decent Medicare bulk-billing levels, the national dental health scheme, environmental progress and more places in our universities and TAFEs have indeed struck a chord with the people in my electorate.</para><para>Of course, there exist countless examples of the government's distorted and apathetic policy responses to Australians' needs and concerns. I would like to refer in particular to the government's axing of the essential and affordable national dental health scheme. How does refusing to fund access to dental services for needy Australians stack up against the $693 million blown by this government on advertising material? That material supposedly promotes Commonwealth initiatives, but in reality it is little more than shameless political advertising. How does spending an extra $2 billion on consultancies stack up against families being unable to access bulk-billing GPs—in particular, after hours? How does maintaining the Prime Minister's two lavishly appointed taxpayer funded households stack up against the thousands of Australians living in poverty—many of whom are in my electorate of Calwell—or the escalating number of young people unable to afford to buy a home of their own, despite the government's much flaunted but inflationary First Home Owner Grant Scheme? How does wasting $1 billion of taxpayers' money on failed currency swaps stack up against the critical shortage of nursing home beds for elderly Australians?</para><para>In my electorate I suspect that the government's distorted priorities have resulted in the rejection of an application to the Department of Health and Ageing by Kiwi Dale Pty Ltd for funding under the 2002-03 aged care approval round for the building of a 124-bed facility in Roxburgh Park. Needless to say, the people from Universal Care Management, acting on behalf of Kiwi Dale Pty Ltd, are shocked at the rejection, given that stage 1 of the development is due for completion in June-July of this year and stage 2 is expected to be completed two months after that. They are shocked because they have ventured into providing a service and facility that they know and we know is desperately needed. They—and I—are bewildered as to why the department would knock back such a proposal at a time when a major operator such as the Salvation Army is abandoning the field of nursing home care.</para><para>Who is going to fill the space that has been vacated by the Salvation Army? Surely it makes sense that universal care should be supported in its venture and not rejected. As this is a very important issue I want to make reference to some comments in a letter that I received from Universal Care Management, which I think are very important:</para><quote><para>The facility is also ideally located within a retirement living development at Bridgewater Lakes [Roxburgh Park]. People taking up residency are looking for care support services which were to be provided from the aged care facility. This may now not be possible.</para><para>Given that it is the clear policy objective of the Federal Government to have contemporary aged care accommodation on the ground and operational, and this was to be given high priority in the last and, I suspect, all future ACAR processes, I cannot understand why the Department of Health and Ageing would pass over a facility that will obviously be available mid 2004 for a new application which cannot be operational until late 2005 or early 2006.</para><para>In addition to the obvious delay to the community in accessing services, up to 100 employment positions and significant local consumption expenditure will be adversely impacted upon as a result of this decision.</para></quote><para>Obviously the result of this decision directly contradicts the government's professed commitment to easing the burden of elderly Australians, especially in the area of the provision of aged care facilities.</para><para>But I do want to talk about the national dental health program, which I made mention of earlier. The government's axing of the Commonwealth dental health program upon acquiring government in 1996 is probably best described as mean-spirited. When the program was axed, there were some 380,000 Australians waiting an average of six months for public dental care. Since then, these figures have skyrocketed. Today, in 2004, there are over 500,000 people waiting up to five years to get their teeth fixed or attended to. Many of those waiting for access to dental care are elderly Australians—the very people we have a duty to support and care for. But low-income families are also heavily affected. A national survey found that one-third of people in the $30,000 to $50,000 household annual income bracket had not been to see a dentist for over two years, because they simply could not afford to. Many of these people endure months and years of pain, diminished health, social embarrassment and discrimination as a result of not being able to go to the dentist or as a result of going to their local health service to be told that they have to wait. They have to wait and wait—for possibly up to 15 to 24 months.</para><para>This situation is reflected in my electorate, where the latest statistics indicate a staggering 2½ year wait for a dental appointment at the local Dianella health service. In fact, such is the depth of the crisis in my electorate that people are resorting to simply having their teeth extracted, because they can no longer wait for dental care. In comparison to other OECD nations, Australia's dental health record is not very good. We have to ask ourselves why. In my electorate, public demand for our local health centre is so great that the centre is forced to refer people to the very few private dentists that we have in the area. Regrettably, the numbers of such private clinics prepared or able to afford charging patients a reduced rate are small. They are very few and far between. In fact, it is unrealistic and unfair to burden private practices with the inaction of this government.</para><para>I want to make reference to a woman who recently came into my office seeking my assistance in helping her access desperately needed dental care. The health centre that she had gone to was unable to assist her and the local dentist could not afford to see her at a reduced fee. What struck me about this was that my eight-year-old daughter was actually in my office on that day, and she was listening to this woman's problems—and I presume that it would be quite fascinating for an eight-year-old child to see an adult actually become very distressed about the fact that they could not get access to a dentist. To my surprise, my daughter took it upon herself to put together a list of her friends and other people that she knew that she wanted to collect donations from in order to assist this woman. From my point of view, it was an admirable act on my daughter's part, and I am proud of her for it, but I think it is very pitiful that people are in many cases forced to forgo their dignity and come into our offices literally begging for assistance—an assistance that was once available to them. It is an assistance that has been ripped away with the election of the Howard government. Quite frankly, it is pretty disgusting that the government refuses to acknowledge that there is a crisis and refuses to reinstate the Commonwealth dental program.</para><para>Labor will not ignore the Australian people. Already we have pledged accessible dental care for all who need it. We will invest $300 million in Australian dental care over four years. We will provide for up to 1,300,000 extra dental procedures. This should be enough to clear the existing backlog and substantially reduce the enormous waiting list that currently exists. Under Labor's plan, concession card holders such as pensioners, healthcare cardholders and their dependants will have access to free check-ups when they need them, as well as subsidised dental treatment, restorations and dentures. Under Labor's plan, no Australian child will have to miss out on dental care because their parent's wallet is not big or deep enough.</para><para>Recently at a street stall in Sunbury, a newly acquired part of my electorate, I confirmed first-hand something that I have seen in other parts of the electorate—that is, the opinion of families on declining bulk-billing levels. Sunbury, which is a suburb with some 10,000 children under the age of 18, is a commuter town with a very young population, an elderly population and certainly a growing population of families. While we were asking local residents to sign a petition to save Medicare, I could not help but be aware of the beeline made by mothers and young women in particular to sign the petition. All were deeply concerned about the rising cost of health care at local general practitioners and the loss of local bulk-billing and after-hours services.</para><para>Since the Howard government came into office, bulk-billing rates have plummeted nationally by 13 per cent. In the electorate of Calwell, the percentage of Medicare bulk-billed consultations has slumped by 6.2 per cent to 81.5 per cent in the year from December 2002-03. At the same time, the out-of-pocket expenses of seeing a doctor have risen by 10 per cent. The number of bulk-billing practitioners sits at 81.5 per cent in Calwell. Some people might think that is very high, and that may be the case. However, we are talking about an area that has many lower socio-economic families who rely very much on the availability of bulk-billing GPs. Any loss of bulk-billing services hits my community, and it hits it very hard. One of the other major problems, in addition to the loss of bulk-billing GPs, is the fact that a lot of public hospital emergency and casualty wards are being swamped by patients who, unable to get access to GP services, in particular after-hours GP services, take themselves and their children—they are usually families—to the casualty wards and sit and wait in very long queues. This is an ongoing and growing problem, and it needs to be addressed. There is, of course, a way that we can address this, and we can do it by funding GP practices that are positioned adjacent to hospital emergency centres. The GPs in these practices will be available to deal with routine matters, leaving casualty and emergency wards to attend to the more difficult cases, which usually involve emergency and high medical care requirements. It is bizarre that the government appears to be adverse to such a solution.</para><para>The Northern Hospital, although not in my electorate of Calwell, certainly services a great number of the people who live in my electorate. The federal government left the Northern Hospital waiting for funding to begin operating a GP practice. It was set up and ready to go but it could not be operated for months because it was waiting for funds from the federal government. Eventually it did not get any funds from the federal government, and it was the state government that had to step in and provide the funds so that this GP practice could commence operation. This is not a permanent situation for the state government. The state government has only stepped in to provide the funding for a short period of time, and no doubt the Northern Hospital will be back lobbying—and perhaps even begging—the federal government to consider allowing this practice to continue. In fact, I have to say that, if it was not for the excellent local health care services provided by the Dianella Community Health Service—and in this case the Bracks government's dedication to affordable general practice access through a collaborative partnership and the funding of the on site general practice service at the Northern Hospital—the increasing demand of local residents for accessible and affordable health care would simply not be met.</para><para>Another critical issue facing my electorate is the lack of educational opportunities for young people. Calwell residents already suffer disproportionate rates of disadvantage and diminished educational access. Demands by the government that those who miss out on one of the highly competitive HECS places should sign themselves up for full fee places and burden themselves with debts that would be equivalent to house mortgages, ignore the economic realities of my constituents. Accumulated poverty and disadvantage already limit their access to tertiary education. Universities have now been given permission to increase their HECS fees and decisions to increase their HECS fees by up to 25 per cent will turn away prospective students from the northern suburbs who are unwilling to burden themselves with crushing debt and who will always have to consider the prospect of mounting student debt when determining their postsecondary choices.</para><para>La Trobe University's decision to increase fees by about 25 per cent, which I think was announced yesterday, is regrettable and will seriously affect my electorate as thousands of my young constituents study there. They rely on institutions like La Trobe University to help them progress and fulfil their ambitions and aspirations, so this is not going to be very good news for them. But we are lucky in Calwell to have an excellent TAFE college which provides further education and technical training and opportunities for kids, particularly kids from Broadmeadows and the surrounding areas. The Kangan Batman TAFE is one of those institutions that provide excellent education and training. The minister himself often proclaims the value of TAFE institutions and, in particular, promotes them as alternatives to universities. Despite this, the government's 2003-04 budget has denied TAFEs new funding—in fact, there is no funding. This government has wilfully ignored the pleas of these great institutions such as the Kangan Batman TAFE and simultaneously, by ignoring them, it disregards the concerns of the students and their families.</para><para>The Labor Party listen to and work for Australians. Our funding for an extra 10,000 TAFE places and an extra 10,000 university places will address the needs of Australian students. Rather than denying education to students and increasing the financial pressure on students and their families, we have pledged not to support increased HECS or upfront fees. The differing responses of Labor and Liberal to the higher education funding crisis draws a clear distinction between two visions for higher education: our vision of opportunity for all and the government's vision of a two-class education system. Where you end up depends very much on where you live, what the sizes of your parents' wallets are and what your opportunities are. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>25912</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—<inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline>, <inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> and <inline ref="R1977">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline> offer members on both sides of the House a very important opportunity to highlight key issues of concern to their electorates. Some of those issues have national connotations; others are quite local. In my case, there are some very important issues of real concern to my constituents. The first one is health. Previous members have contributed much in this debate to the issue of health. When looking at the health system in the Geelong region, it is fair to say that at the moment it is in crisis. That is not a reflection on Barwon Health or the workers who earn their living in this very important industry, but it is a reality.</para></talk.start><para>There are several elements to this crisis situation. The first is the shortage of GPs in the Geelong region. I have had representations from the General Practitioners Association of Geelong about this particular issue. Many of my constituents are not able to access a general practitioner and, of course, that is of real concern to them in meeting their primary health care needs. This factor and several others have put immense pressure on the casualty department at Geelong Hospital and also on waiting lists at the outpatients department of that hospital. Some of that pressure comes from the fact that in the region we have a shortage of aged care beds. People are being kept in the Geelong Hospital when they should be attended with care in specialised nursing home facilities. I will say this to the government: you can find $1 billion for a war in Iraq but you cannot find the resources and funds necessary to enable older people in Geelong to live out their days in dignity and receive appropriate standards of care.</para><para>When I talk about a crisis in Geelong's health system, I also refer to the impact of the government's policies on the pockets and the incomes of families in my constituency. We have seen a substantial increase in health costs for families in Geelong. Firstly, this has come from the rapid decline in bulk-billing in the Geelong region. I will provide to the chamber some statistics on that in a minute. The other particular pressure on health costs has come from the increase in private health insurance premiums. We have a rather high level of private health insurance usage in Geelong, with GMHBA based in the city. We have seen recently, as a direct result of government policy, some very substantial premium increases that are impacting on Geelong families to the tune of $150 a year.</para><para>When the bulk-billing rate declines in a community, low-income earners and families under economic pressure face real difficulties and pressures on their household budgets as a result. Bulk-billing was designed as an essential part of the universal health care system of Australia. It enables low- and middle-income Australians to gain access to a universal health care system—a quality one at that—at a reasonable cost. Bulk-billing delivers an economic advantage to people who use bulk-billing doctors. The last time Mr Howard released bulk-billing figures for each federal electorate was in the September quarter of 2003. At that time, the rate of bulk-billing in the electorate of Corio stood at 58.4 per cent. In the Liberal-held electorate of Corangamite, over the Barwon River, it stood at 41.8 per cent. The figure for both of these Geelong based federal electorates stood well below the national average of 67.4 per cent.</para><para>When you look at the national figures since the Howard government came to power, you can see that the rate of bulk-billing has generally fallen by around 13 per cent. At the same time, the average cost of seeing a GP has risen by 64 per cent. In September 2003 that increase stood at around $13.40 per visit. When you take the rising costs of seeing a GP and the economic disadvantage that flows to low- and middle-income families from reductions in bulk-billing and when you add to this the increased premiums for private health insurance, the economic pressure on Geelong households in this health area alone has been quite substantial.</para><para>Labor do have a plan for the health care system, as we did when we structured the great universal health care scheme in Medicare. We have a plan to restore bulk-billing. We will immediately lift the Medicare patient rebate for all bulk-billed consultations to 95 per cent of the schedule fee—an average increase of $3.35 per consultation. Labor will subsequently lift the Medicare patient rebate for all bulk-billed consultations to 100 per cent of the schedule fee. That will be an average of $5 per consultation. We will offer doctors an incentive of up to $22,500 to meet stipulated bulk-billing targets and we are going to provide more GPs and nurses in areas of critical need. This is a plan to address the damage that has been done to Australia's health care system by the Howard government. Members opposite can run but they cannot hide. The electorate are now poised with their baseball bats, ready to take them to this coalition government because of the broken promises and the burdens it has visited upon them.</para><para>The second important area of concern for Geelong families is that of educating their children. Australian families, and Geelong families in particular, do not ask much from their governments and their education system. They simply ask that a decent opportunity be provided to their children—that their children have the opportunity to develop their skills and personalities and become good contributors to Australia, to the ongoing development and greatness of this country. We know that at this particular point in time in our history that there are gross inequities in the opportunity that is available to students in this country to access a good education. These inequities are no more pronounced than they are in the Geelong area. We do have schools that are very well resourced. I cast no aspersions on the parents who choose to send their children to those schools—they make a sacrifice to send their children to those particular schools. But the economic reality is that many of the parents who do send their children to those schools have an economic capacity that far surpasses that of others in the Geelong area.</para><para>We have an extraordinary situation in Geelong where schools that exist within two to three kilometres of each other are like chalk and cheese when it comes to the level of resourcing and, of course, access to real opportunity. That is where it is the responsibility of government to make sure that educational institutions most in need have the first call on the resources and that every Australian child—including every child in Geelong—gets a fair crack of the whip at getting the education that will propel them along a road to new opportunity. That is not the case in Geelong, and that is a reality that the community in Geelong has to face.</para><para>We have the greatest deceiving government in Australia's history at it again in the electorate of Corio. I refer to the recent announcement in a press release by the Minister for Education, Science and Training of a number of places at Deakin University. It stated: </para><quote><para>... the Geelong region will benefit from 164 new Commonwealth scholarships ...</para></quote><para>On the face of it, the electors of Corio might say, `That is the government doing its job and expanding opportunity.' But we find that the scholarships are spread across all Deakin campuses, including Burwood, Toorak and Warrnambool as well as Geelong. So the Geelong campus is one of four that will share in these 164 scholarships. I welcome the initiative. I am not going to turn my back on 164 scholarships for Deakin University, but the minister ought not come into my electorate and put out a press release claiming credit for addressing a need in the Geelong region when in fact some of those scholarships will go to Melbourne.</para><para>Under the Howard government, we have seen the recently announced slug on Geelong families of a 25 per cent Deakin University fee hike. This 25 per cent fee rise has also been announced by Griffith University, the Queensland University of Technology and La Trobe University and we understand that a number of other universities are about to follow suit. The minister has stood up in this parliament, day after day, week after week, claiming that his new policy for higher education would not lead to maximum fee hikes. We told him that it would. We told the minister that his policies would lead to these 25 per cent increases. What has happened? We now have 25 per cent fee increases, and they will impact quite heavily, for instance, on working families in Geelong who seek to send their children to Deakin University in their own community.</para><para>Labor will remedy this situation, and we are committed to removing that 25 per cent fee hike. We are going to provide an extra $300 million to universities over the next four years to make sure that they can deliver a quality education to their students not only at Deakin University but at universities right across the country. We will fully index grants to those universities to make sure that they have the capacity to deliver the quality education that we expect. We will also create 20,000 new places not only in the higher education sector, at universities like Deakin, but also at TAFE institutions, such as the Gordon Technical College in my electorate.</para><para>In the time remaining, let me talk very briefly about Geelong's transport network. We all know how important the transport network is to the economic wellbeing and growth of communities. When Labor was in power, the Keating government, in its great infrastructure spending, created the Western Ring Road around Melbourne. That particular public investment has altered the economic geography of the 13th largest city on the face of the earth. It has certainly made it a little easier for me to get to Melbourne airport, but now with the Jetstar announcement to fly out of Avalon I may not be using Melbourne airport as much as I have in the past.</para><para>The issue of real concern now is the Geelong ring-road or the Geelong bypass. It took the community of Geelong many years of very difficult and sustained lobbying to get the third lane on the Princes Highway between Melbourne and Geelong. That has proved to be a great advantage to commuters and has provided a great economic benefit to constituents in the Corio electorate. I do not doubt that. Unfortunately, that third lane on the Princes Highway ends at the northern suburbs of Geelong. The Bracks government has committed some $190 million to the ring-road and has requested that the federal government make a matching contribution under its Roads of National Importance program.</para><para>I think it is fair to say that, in discussions we have had with the minister and, indeed, the shadow minister, as would be expected at the first cut and call of these particular lobbying efforts, the community has not been successful. We will keep on trying because we think we have a very important economic and social case to make. That ring-road will certainly connect the Princes Highway from Melbourne with the Bacchus Marsh Road and the Ballarat Road—and I note the presence in the chamber tonight of the member for Ballarat, an excellent member who will hold the seat at the next election—and around to the Midland Highway. It will, of course, rejoin the Princes Highway going into the western district, into the heartland of the electorate of Corangamite, and it will also connect with the Surf Coast Highway. This is a very critical piece of road infrastructure which will alter the economic geography of the Geelong region.</para><para>I ask Minister Anderson, in a spirit of bipartisanship, to consider the representations that are being made. I ask the shadow minister, the member for Batman, to also consider carefully the arguments that are being advanced by the community. This piece of infrastructure will connect Melbourne with the Great Ocean Road, one of the premier tourism attractions in Australia as well as in the state of Victoria. Ayers Rock, the Great Barrier Reef and the Great Ocean Road all occupy a special place.</para><para>So the economic advantages of connecting this last piece of the puzzle are quite substantial. But there are also safety considerations, because at the moment that traffic goes through the middle of Geelong via Latrobe Terrace. We have traffic jams and degrees of congestion and environmental pollution in that stretch of road through Geelong that could be mitigated should this bypass be completed. As well as the safety aspect, there are enormous social benefits, because many of my constituents and the constituents of the member for Corangamite travel to Melbourne to work. They have seen the benefits of the great lifestyle in the Geelong region. I hope good sense will prevail and ministers and shadow ministers will open their minds to argument and that we can have a sensible debate and discussion on this very important piece of infrastructure for the region. Health, education and transport are the real issues for my constituents, and these are the issues that I bring to the attention of the House tonight.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>25915</page.no><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WINDSOR</name><name.id>009LP</name.id><electorate>New England</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to speak about a number of issues in relation to the <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline>, the <inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R1977">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline>. The first issue that I have some concern about—probably the most recent event that has occurred in the parliament that could have significant impact on country Australia—is the ethanol debate, which has been before the parliament for quite some time. I was astonished last night to watch the Senate when it was debating the labelling issue in relation to ethanol. I was absolutely staggered to see that The Nationals in particular voted against the recommendations of the task force that was set up by the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, to look at the labelling issue and to try and overcome some of the confidence problems that had been expressed in the community. Those confidence problems were basically started by the Labor Party with a bit of a scaremongering campaign that took place some months ago. But I found it astonishing after all the work that had gone in.</para></talk.start><para>I know that one of the proponents of the Gunnedah ethanol plant, Matthew Kelly, was involved with that committee and with putting together recommendations so that people when they pulled up at the bowser to get their fuel knew that they were buying up to 10 per cent ethanol and that they should check with their car manufacturers as to the impact of ethanol on their engines. The recommendations were a fairly positive indication that ethanol, after checking with the manufacturer, is okay to use. And that is known world wide. Everybody knows that that is the case. Ethanol has been used in the United States, parts of Europe and South America for many years. Any number of countries have used ethanol.</para><para>The recommendation—and I am told that it was done at the beck and call of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, a member of the Liberal Party—was changed and a very negative spin was put on the label that will appear on the bowsers when motorists pull up. The label even has the absurd suggestion down the bottom: `Do not use in any aircraft.' I have not seen an aircraft pulling up at a road station for quite some time and I do not think I will again. There is a little place called William Creek out on the Oodnadatta Track where that sign might be appropriate, where aircraft use the main street. That label was not recommended by the committee. The committee was set up by the government itself—a lot of community members took time to be involved in that decision-making process—and it has come out with this absurd suggestion: `Do not use in any aircraft.' When you buy diesel to put in your car, you do not see: `Do not use diesel in aircraft.' You do not see that on LPG. You do not see on petrol browsers signs saying `Do not drink after dinner'. You do not see a sign on petrol bowsers that says: `There are cancer-causing agents within this fuel.' So why did the Senate endorse it?</para><para>The Nationals have supposedly been promoting this particular product. They say they are behind it, but everything they do seems to be negative. They did not support a disallowance motion that was put before the Senate last night by the Democrats—in particular, Lyn Allison. To her great credit and that of the Democrats, they have been stalwarts in this debate. There is an amendment in the Senate that would allow for a 10-year freedom of excise period so that the industry could get established. In the past there has not been a tax on ethanol. The government has decided that, through its cleaner fuels policy arrangements, it will impose an excise regime that is based on energy components. But I will not get into that.</para><para>What is required for the ethanol industry to take off is at least a seven-year excise exemption from the start of production, not the five-year program starting from last September that the government has endorsed and which is currently sitting in the Senate. Any new players who want to become involved in the ethanol industry—other than Dick Honan, the Prime Minister's friend, of course—would get probably only 2½ to three years of excise exemption. Anybody who knows anything about that industry knows that it will not start under that arrangement.</para><para>One has to wonder what the government's agenda is. It has a cleaner fuels policy. It wants 350,000 megalitres of fuel produced by, I think, the year 2010, which is laudable and I applaud that particular policy. A grants scheme has been put in place to encourage people into the industry. Then the government imposes a tax regime that it knows will not start the industry and will benefit only the existing players, the major one of which is Manildra and the Prime Minister's friend—or previous friend now, I am told—Dick Honan.</para><para>I was astonished to see this negative label endorsed by country members of the Senate last night. I was particularly disappointed to see the Tamworth based senator, Senator Sandy Macdonald, who has been wandering around the electorate of New England saying that he is a great supporter of ethanol, physically in the parliament but not saying anything and voting for it. I also note, having checked the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, that the self-proclaimed champion of the bush, Ron Boswell, did not even turn up to vote and did not say anything about it. He is out in the country areas of Queensland suggesting what a great thing ethanol is and saying: `We're in there working for you—it's the filthy Labor Party that is opposing it, but we're there. We're the champions of ethanol. We're working on getting the sugar industry involved in the ethanol industry.' He did not even bother to go in and vote on this absolutely crucial issue.</para><para>I had some people in my office today who are prepared to finance a particular ethanol plant. Two years ago, I met with them in Sydney. They are still here now and no progress is being made. If the government is serious about cleaner, renewable fuels and import replacement and those sorts of issues, let us get on with it and give these people a period of grace to get established and create the jobs in the country that all country members are talking about. Let us get positive about this particular fuel—the rest of the world is and we should be as well. It is an ideal opportunity to make a significant change in terms of agriculture in Australia and do it to the benefit of those people who live in the country as well as others who reside in this nation.</para><para>Most people would know—and the fuel companies definitely know—that in 2006 there will be changes. Again, they will be government driven, and I applaud the government for making these particular changes. Certain additives will be taken out of petrol because of their carcinogenic nature. The nonbenefit in relation to the removal of those additives from the make-up of fuel is that there will be a reduction in the octane content of petrol. So what do we do about that? We have got engines designed to certain octane levels running around our roads at the moment, so what do we do to fix that? The easy fix—and I am told that the fuel industry is recognising this now—is to use a natural agent that naturally oxygenates the fuel and increases the octane level. That, strange as it may seem, is ethanol—this renewable product that can be grown every year on our farms throughout Australia and provide an important added product and import replacer for our nation.</para><para>We hear all this talk in this place about the free trade arrangements and how we have got to become global players, and here we have something that we could be producing for ourselves every year. It would have the environmental impacts that I spoke about earlier, and we have a government which seems almost afraid to embrace it. One has to ask the question why. Why are we denying these industries the right to be established? Why do we assume that if the farming community becomes involved in the ethanol industry, produces fuel for the nation and removes a number of the carcinogens from existing fuel processes it should be taxed?</para><para>We had the Deputy Prime Minister in the parliament today talking about agriculture and the farming community, almost gloating over the fact that the farming community earns on average a 1.8 per cent return on capital and drawing some absurd analogy with the Labor Party building—the rorts for rent or whatever it is that Tony Abbott speaks about. A 1.8 per cent return! We have an opportunity to help not only those farming families but also the farming communities around them, particularly in the Queensland area, where whole communities are involved. Peter Costello was heard saying today on one of the radio stations that there are only 6,700 sugar producers. That was almost saying to the Sydney radio market that that is not many people—it is not even half a suburb, what are we worried about?</para><para>There are whole communities involved. I am sure you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, would be fully aware of the reliance on sugar that those communities have. It is not just the farmers and it is not just the people in the mills; it is the extended multiplier effect in those communities and the way they have existed in the past. We are going to go around with another rash of handouts to an industry that is sitting there screaming for a positive way out of predicament it is in. We have been unable to achieve a free trade arrangement for sugar, so that is an issue that is having an impact as well.</para><para>Here, we have the possibility of assisting those communities into ethanol, and there are proponents of it who are quite happy to look at fifty-fifty grain-sugar arrangements for ethanol where the storage problems for sugar would be overcome. Half of the year they would be using sugar and the other half of the year they would be using grain. Those sorts of options are there. We have Ron Boswell running round Queensland saying, `We're going to look after you, the National Party is the only way out—it is the only one that will look after you.' What did they get yesterday but some sort of dole arrangement being doled out to them just to buy them off for a few more months.</para><para>We have private sector investors who are prepared to invest in these industries. Country Australia has been screaming out for city money that people want to invest. I had people in my office today who are keen to invest $80 million in the industry. The only thing that is standing in their way is the legislative arrangements in this parliament. The government have endorsed the principle of excise freedom. The government, in their policy, have said in the Senate, `We endorse the principle of excise freedom.' The policy says that any entrants into the ethanol industry will have five years excise freedom from September 2003. As I said earlier, any new entrants would probably gain only two to 2½ years of excise freedom. The government know that, but having accepted the general principle of excise freedom they should be of a mind to transfer the five years to seven years from start-up of production so that the economic viability of the industry will be established. During that period of time, the debt payback can be made. I have seen the business plans for a number of plants. It can be done. Then they can settle down to the new energy driven excise arrangements that the government have put in place already. I would urge the government to look closely at that, particularly coming up to the next budget. I think that some amazing changes could occur.</para><para>One of the other issues that I would like to speak about is national competition policy. One of the reasons I stood for federal parliament was that I was very concerned about the way in which national competition policy had very little regard, almost by definition, for country communities—remoteness, smallness and distance being factors in terms of the economic processes. I still see a lot of those warning signs out there. There is an absurd arrangement at the moment where the National Competition Council is threatening to impose a $50 million fine on the New South Wales government. The New South Wales government is playing a bit of a political game back with it. There is an absurd arrangement to do with the farm debt mediation bill that was put through the parliament—I think whilst you, Deputy Speaker Causley, were a resident of the New South Wales parliament. You may well have voted for it at that particular time. I know I moved 10 amendments to it because it was not in a very good form at the start. I am pleased to see the member for Parkes here, because I think he was involved with the farmers association at the time, prior to being president. That organisation was very pro the farm debt mediation legislation at the time.</para><para>We currently see the National Competition Council and the Treasurer, Peter Costello, threatening to fine New South Wales if it does not adhere to the recommendations of the council. But the farm debt mediation legislation in New South Wales has helped hundreds of farmers—not thousands of farmers, but hundreds. It has brought people together to mediate where there have been debt problems and it has done it very successfully. That is going to be taken out under the theory of national competition policy. It is an absurd suggestion. We see it also occurring in relation to the liquor industry.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

I did mention that the New South Wales government is playing its own game. But this is a federally initiated policy, through the various COAG arrangements that have been put in place. The federal government can stop the absurdity in relation to the way this is being applied. Even Fred Hilmer would turn in his grave if he saw what is happening here. In theory, at least, this could be provided by other private sector people, but to apply national competition policy to farm debt mediation is quite absurd. To apply national competition policy to the chicken meat industry in the northern part of New South Wales, in the name of competition, when there is only one processor is absolutely absurd and has the potential to wipe out much of the chicken industry.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I would have thought that the member for Parkes, with his background in the farmers association, would at least have some sympathy towards that idea, but obviously he is not attempting to do anything to change it. We have seen some far from innocuous aspects of human social behaviour in recent weeks, and I listened to the member for Sydney earlier on talking about some of those aspects. We have an absurd arrangement in New South Wales at the moment where the Commonwealth is going to impose a fine on the New South Wales government if they do not open up every corner store and fuel station so that people can pick up cheap grog at these places. Thank God the aircraft will not be able to get into the fuel stations to get their ethanol! This is an absurd aspect and impact of national competition policy. If we apply that to chemists, for instance—and the theory is that we will—the first people to be impacted will be those in the country towns, because chemists will lose some of their trade to corner stores and other people in the community, and they will not be viable with the residual trade of the drugs that only they will be able to prescribe.</para><para>It is about time that people in this parliament, rather than moving ridiculous amendments in the Senate that impose restrictions and negatives on country communities, started to look at some more positive aspects—and at the way in which national competition policy is having a negative impact on the social fabric of our nation. It is absolutely absurd to apply this sort of policy to chicken meat, where there is one processor. There is no competition, so how can you apply the policy? It is all very well for the member for Parkes to say that Bob Carr can write back and suggest that these sorts of things are not good enough. That has been done. It is no good going back and saying, `It wasn't done well enough.' The Treasurer can stop it. There is this absurd arrangement in this place where no-one seems to know whether it is the National Competition Council that makes the decision or whether the Treasurer can overrule the council; they both hide behind each other. The member for Parkes has said that if the state wrote back and said it was not good enough the National Competition Council would change its mind. Let us see it happen, because the state has written back asking the Commonwealth to change its mind. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>25919</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This week during question time the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, was good enough to draw the House's attention to the fact that my electorate contains a number of Jewish schools. Indeed it does. I have visited most of them, as I have visited most of the schools in my electorate, many times—as have successive Labor leaders, including the current Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham, the member for Werriwa, who made an extremely positive impression on all those schools which they remember to this day. I am very proud to have many fine schools in my electorate—government, denominational, Catholic and independent—and also to represent the parents, teachers and students of these schools.</para></talk.start><para>The minister went on to imply that the opposition's education policy will result in government funds being taken away from these schools. I am sure that the minister knew that this insinuation was untrue but, in case he was genuinely mistaken, let me make a few points about Labor's policy on school funding and the history of this debate. In 1973 Kim Beazley senior, the most farsighted education minister this country has ever seen, introduced a policy of needs based funding for all schools, regardless of whether they were government, denominational or independent schools. He established the Commonwealth Schools Commission to assess all schools on the basis of their needs and to fund them accordingly. Naturally, in practice, the schools that benefited most from this policy were poorer government schools and, indeed, the poorer Catholic schools. That is why Archbishop James Carroll, then the Catholic spokesperson on education, welcomed the new policy so warmly. The wealthy independent schools benefited least, but no distinction was made in principle between schools of one type or another.</para><para>Although the Fraser government abolished the Commonwealth Schools Commission, they did not tamper with the principle of needs based funding. It took the Howard government and the former education minister, Dr Kemp, to try and undo the work of the Whitlam government. The new formula introduced by the Howard government ostensibly continued to fund non-government schools on a needs basis, but it adopted a new formula to calculate how federal government money should go to non-government schools.</para><para>The new formula was calculated by linking a student's home address with a socio-economic status, SES, of the census collection district, CDC, in which the student's family lived. But this funding formula ignored the fact that all of the families living in a single CDC do not have the same household income—some families have higher incomes, some have lower. It should be obvious that families who can send their children to the wealthiest private schools will be wealthier than the average of families from within the CDC where they live. This leads to the wealthiest schools receiving lower SES ratings than they would have received had the real income or wealth of the families who use those schools been measured directly.</para><para>This distortion is particularly striking in country areas, where disparities of income between the wealthy few and the less wealthy are more striking. In a given rural census district, there will be a handful of landowners and a large proportion of people on lower incomes. Therefore, many of the wealthy parents of students at say, Geelong Grammar, will live in census districts which are, on average, low income. This has the effect of lowering Geelong Grammar's SES score and allowing it to obtain more government funding than some would argue it deserves.</para><para>This distortion has been remarked on ever since the former education minister, Dr Kemp, the member for Goldstein, introduced the SES formula. Whatever the modellers intended, I cannot believe that they deliberately designed this system to divert higher levels of public funds to the wealthiest and best endowed private schools at the expense of not only government schools but also the less wealthy majority of non-government schools, particularly most of the Catholic school education system, which are poorer in capital, endowments and the ability to charge fees. Catholic parents make great efforts to send their children to Catholic schools and also raise funds for the schools. It is a disgrace that we have a funding formula which benefits category 1 schools, most favoured by members and supporters of the frontbench who send their children there, while disadvantaging the vast majority of independent schools, including the Catholic schools, such as the excellent Christian Brothers College in East St Kilda in my electorate.</para><para>Catholic schools are not the only schools which are disadvantaged by the funding scheme the Howard government has introduced. As the minister pointed out, there are several Jewish schools in my electorate, which has the highest Jewish population proportion in any federal electorate. These schools all have SES ratings of between 110 and 121, putting them at the upper end of the ratings ladder and thus placing them at the lowest level of assistance under the present system. By comparison, the three best-known former category 1 elite private schools in my electorate, Melbourne Grammar, Wesley College and Caulfield Grammar, have SES ratings of 121, 118 and 115 respectively. Frankly, it is farcical that a gravel covered college like Yeshiva College, which has an SES rating only 1 point higher than Caulfield Grammar School and a couple of points below Wesley College, is compared to those schools. If anyone ever visited these two schools the disparity in income, endowments, physical circumstances and their capital is astonishing, yet they receive the same level of assistance under this so-called needs based funding formula set up by Dr Kemp.</para><para>These schools in my electorate are excellent schools. They all have high levels of academic achievement and the best facilities that the parents and communities associated with them can afford. But they do not have the fantastic facilities of say, Melbourne Grammar, which has just opened a magnificent new sporting complex in Port Melbourne. For instance, Leibler Yavneh College in Elsternwick does not have a swimming pool. It has two tennis courts—and this for a school with nearly 600 students. Yet, according to the SES formula adopted by the current government, Melbourne Grammar and Leibler Yavneh College are placed on exactly the same level in terms of funding that they receive. Any reasonable person visiting both schools would conclude that either Melbourne Grammar is being overfunded or that Leibler Yavneh is being underfunded, or both. On Monday, the minister sought to suggest that the funding for Jewish schools in my electorate in particular—and I really thought his objection was very offensive—would somehow be put at risk under the policies of the opposition. In fact, under any reasonable funding formula, most of these schools would be better off not worse off. This has been repeatedly assured by the shadow education spokesman, who has visited all of these schools with me over the last few years. I will quote the education policy adopted at the ALP national conference earlier this year:</para><quote><para>Labor continues to respect the right of parents to choose a non-government school for their children and, on the basis of educational and financial need, for these schools to receive public funding consistent with the MCEETYA principles outlined above.</para></quote><para>The principles referred to are those of the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs. They include, among other things, the principle that public funding across different schools and sectors should be distributed fairly and equitably and that public funding for schooling must support the right of families to choose non-government schooling and must support non-government schools on the basis of need. The policy continues:</para><quote><para>Labor rejects the Howard Government's unfair and divisive funding arrangements for schools, which have delivered the largest increases in Commonwealth funding to some of the best-resourced schools in Australia. Labor will adopt new funding arrangements for non-government schools that reflect the following principles:</para><para>—Commonwealth and state and Territory funding policies and arrangements will be aligned to provide a coherent national approach to funding conditions, mechanisms and accountabilities;</para><para>—the resources available to non-government schools, including income from private sources, will be considered when assessing financial need—</para></quote><para>This, of course, is one of the great faults in the current government's addressing of this issue, particularly in relation to the elite private schools. Not only does the government not take into consideration the huge fees these schools are able to charge—which, of course, the parents of today are often making great efforts to pay—but also it does not take into consideration the massive endowments and great capital that these schools already have. In my view, the huge increases in federal government funding that some of these elite private category 1 schools are getting are undermining public support for the level of funding that they and all independent schools should receive. Labor's policy continues:</para><quote><para>—public funding should be subject to non-government schools meeting quality standards for curriculum and teaching, planning arrangements that promote the economic use of public resources and accountability and reporting conditions that are consistent with those required by governments for schools in the public sector.</para></quote><para>I have no doubt that Catholic and Jewish schools in my electorate will meet these criteria and will be no worse off—and probably better off—than they are at present. I turn to another area of appropriations that I think has seen a serious abuse in my electorate. Very unusually for Melbourne Ports, it is the issue of the Australian defence budget—namely, the use of defence resources to promote commercial activities. As honourable members know, the Australian Grand Prix is held every year in Albert Park in my electorate. It will be held next week. There is widespread participation by Australians in this event and some enjoyment by Victorians right across the state. I do not denigrate that, but citizens in Middle Park, St Kilda, Elwood, South Melbourne, South Yarra, Albert Park and Port Melbourne constantly deluge me with complaints about the noise caused by the annual fly over of an F18 fighter bomber from the Royal Australian Air Force that coincides with the Grand Prix.</para><para>No-one who knows my record would ever accuse me of being against the defence establishment or anti-RAAF. It is absolutely appropriate that the Roulettes flying exhibition team participate in this event but, for reasons that I will outline, the participation of serious aircraft like the F18 is inappropriate. Every year since 1996 my constituents have objected to this fly over, which takes place over one day, at a low level over the most densely populated suburban areas in Australia. The F18's extremely loud boom frightens many people, particularly children and the elderly. It terrifies household pets. But the worst aspect of this Grand Prix fly over is the waste of defence resources and public funds. Last year I succeeded in getting the government to reveal the cost of this exercise. The assistant defence minister, Mrs Vale, informed me that the direct costs of the fly over amounted to $697,969, with $23,201 for fuel—a total of $721,170. No doubt it will cost more this year.</para><para>At a time when this country has major defence commitments in Iraq, East Timor, the Solomons and other places, and when the defence budget and our defence personnel are stretched to the limit, in my view it is a scandalous waste of money that $720,000 is used to fly an F18 over an inner suburban area to promote a commercial car race—a race that is highly profitable and is run by the billionaire Mr Bernie Ecclestone. The House should recall that the Grand Prix is a private commercial event operated for profit. I have no objection to people making a profit by staging public entertainment events, but it is outrageous that we should expect the taxpayer to provide Grand Prix entertainment in order to boost their profits.</para><para>When the Howard government came to power in 1996 and began this policy of subsidising the Grand Prix—no doubt as a favour to the then Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, and his business friends—the then Minister for Defence, John Moore, said the annual cost of the fly-over was about $200,000. It is striking that the cost of this exercise has more than trebled in eight years. I ask honourable members opposite: why is the Howard government, which has made such major commitments of our defence forces overseas, and which makes so much of its support for defence personnel, providing more and more expensive entertainment for the Grand Prix? What equipment or amenities are our service men and women on active service overseas being deprived of so that $720,000 can be wasted in this way for one fly over of Mr Ecclestone's Grand Prix?</para><para>Finally, I want to raise again the continuing crisis of administration in Centrelink. Recently, Windsor Centrelink, which is just outside my electorate but serves many of my constituents, held an open day. As usual, my staff went along to this open day—usually I go as well—and were impressed by the dedication and sincerity of the Centrelink staff, whom we know and work with. My office nearly always finds them to be cooperative and sympathetic when we raise particular problems that are being experienced by Centrelink clients. The fact remains, however, that Centrelink is structured in a way that makes it grossly inefficient and indifferent—indeed sometimes hostile—to the needs of its clients.</para><para>This is not the fault of Centrelink's staff or even Centrelink's management; it is the fault of the government and successive ministers for family and community services. At the bidding of the Prime Minister and Treasurer, they have deliberately designed a system which punishes Centrelink clients by pushing them out of the system for trivial reasons, without explaining those reasons adequately, and then makes it very difficult for them, even with the assistance of the office of a member of parliament, to regain access to the system. My office—like, no doubt, the offices of most other members and certainly the members on this side of the House—deals with a steady stream of Centrelink clients, many of them elderly and from non-English speaking backgrounds, who have received letters from Centrelink telling them that their benefits are being cut off or reduced for reasons which they do not understand. They tell us that they cannot get Centrelink to take their phone calls or answer their letters and they cannot get a straight answer to the most basic questions about their circumstances. As I hope I have outlined, there are a number of appropriations of this government that could be highly questioned.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>25923</page.no><name role="metadata">Edwards, Graham, MP</name><name role="display">Mr EDWARDS</name><name.id>83R</name.id><electorate>Cowan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have made the point in this place before about the hard-nosed attitude that banks have in pursuit of profit and about their hard-nosed attitude to customers, whom they seem to see as a distraction from the real business of making money. Indeed, in the past I have noted that studies by the Labor Party have shown that (1) Australia's bank accounts are second only to Canada as being the most expensive in the world, (2) Australia is one of the most concentrated banking markets in the world and has one of the most concentrated markets for retail transaction accounts, and (3) banks have created a bank-fee poverty trap which poor customers are often unable to escape.</para></talk.start><para>It is as true today as when I first raised this issue to say that banks are the most profitable businesses in the Australian economy. One has to wonder then why we see the costs of banking services continuing to rise, why we see banking services continually being withdrawn and why services are made harder for customers to access on a face-to-face basis. All of the above, of course, form part of the reason that community banks in Australia have attracted the attention of a service-starved public seeking customer-friendly products delivered face to face.</para><para>I am very pleased to have had a close working relationship through my office with the launch of the Kingsway Community Bank as a branch of the Bendigo Bank. This bank launched its prospectus last November, and the realisation of many people's expectations came a step closer recently when plans for the new bank were lodged with the City of Wanneroo in Perth's northern suburbs. I want to compliment chairman Bill Meredith for the work he has done and for the work of the board. Bill has on his board: Rachel Dodge, as a hardworking and dedicated secretary; Joe Hawkins; Edith Slade; Alison Thomson; Patricia Tassell; Alan Green; Laurin Lang and John Halligan. In addition, associate members Stan and Elaine McEntee and Bernie Tynas continue to make a strong contribution to the Kingsway Community Bank. I know everyone involved is hoping that the building program will be finished in about three months. Indeed, on 28 March a groundbreaking ceremony will be conducted as another step in the determination of this community to have its own bank. I congratulate all involved and, like them, I look forward to the day that the bank opens its doors. I will be one of its customers.</para><para>The next issue I want to deal with relates to the Wanneroo cadet unit, which operates out of Wanneroo Senior High School. These cadets do a great job, not only on Anzac Day when they parade at the local Wanneroo Anzac service but also in attending the annual fete at Belgrade Village and in assisting the seniors there. They assist the community in other ways, but they particularly assist the seniors. It came as a shock recently for the cadets and their parents to learn that their unit was to be amalgamated with another unit in the neighbouring local authority of Joondalup. Taking something from Wanneroo and relocating it to Joondalup is simply not a popular thing to do up in the northern suburbs. Fortunately, I was able to make an approach to Fran Bailey, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence. Fran kindly and quickly arranged a meeting for me with her office and senior officers in Canberra to discuss the matter. I thank the member for McEwen for her understanding and sympathetic response to this important issue. The result is that the Wanneroo cadets have been given a stay of execution and have been given time to recruit numbers and to show that they can sustain those numbers over a period of time. This is an important local issue, and I now urge the broader community to get behind this cadet unit and these young Australians. I know the parent group are keen to see this unit continue, and I trust that they will get the support they need. I know too that Dot Newton, as a local councillor and parent of a cadet, has the support of the City of Wanneroo. I wish them well in their endeavours to see that this important cadet unit continues.</para><para>Like a lot of others in this place, I have been a cadet. I know I had tremendous fun with my mates in the cadet unit of the day, and I know the tremendous benefit that I got out of being in cadets. I think today, when there are so many pressures on and so many diversions available to young people, it is important that we do keep these cadet units running, and it is important that we give these young people support through the community to enable them to be involved in cadets. I think it is a great thing for young men and young women to be involved in and they certainly have my support.</para><para>The third and last issue I want to deal with tonight relates to a bloke by the name of Mick O'Mallon. Mick is a TPI Australian SAS veteran of Borneo and 7RAR in Vietnam. Mick is living in Vietnam on his pension only and is unable to afford the cost of travel for himself, his wife—he married in Vietnam—and two children to come to Australia. Mick has had a run of bad times, and it is hoped that individuals and associations in the veteran community will get behind Mick and help to bring this Australian home. I am very grateful to a bloke by the name of Lex McAulay from Queensland who has put together a bit of a story about Mick, and I want to put it on the record. Lex McAulay wrote:</para><quote><para>Mick's next tour of duty was in Vietnam with 7RAR, as a forward scout. After RTA—</para></quote><para>that is, return to Australia—</para><quote><para>he spent the rest of the time when we were involved in that war as an instructor, and was about to take his discharge when he was interviewed about joining the military police.

I might say that, despite that, there are still a lot of veterans who are happy to help him. Lex McAulay continues:</para><quote><para>Mick tried various small business enterprises without success and spent some time in the NSW Department of Corrective Services as a guard in the Goulburn jail, and later as supervisor in the forestry section of the department. This ended in a dispute originated by Mick over workplace safety.

Yes, some blokes are a glutton for punishment.</para><para>About five years ago, Mick was in Melbourne for Anzac Day, wondering what to do with his life, when he literally tripped on a sign board outside a travel agency. They advertised visits to Vietnam. Mick walked up and down past the shop for three days before he went in to ask about the Vietnam tours. By this time, the shop staff were about to ring the police; Mick is not an oil painting, either.</para><para>During the visit to Vietnam, he met a local lady who is now his wife and the mother of their 4-year-old. Mick is also step-father to her son from a previous relationship.

Therefore, some of us have decided to contact as many Vietnam veterans and veterans' associations as possible to inform them of Mick's situation, and ask that financial assistance ... be donated ...</para><para>In this way we can bring back to Australia an Aussie with two tours of frontline active service, who has had his share of hard knocks, and give two kids a better chance at life.</para><para>Please give this serious consideration. If the veterans do not help Mick, no one else will.</para></quote><para>That is the end of the story, which is very well put together by Lex McAulay.</para><para>Graham Smith, who is an ex-6RAR soldier and an existing committee member for the restoration of the Long Tan Cross, is one of those who is helping to coordinate the support that the veteran community is trying to put together to get Mick home. Mick O'Mallon has done a great job in Vietnam working with the Australian Vietnam Veterans Reconstruction Group, a group of which I have the pleasure to be patron, and I know that he has done an immense amount of work in helping to preserve and keep open the area where the Battle of Long Tan was fought. I approached the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to find out whether there were any circumstances in which the application fee—which, from memory, is some $850—for the visa that Mick would have to apply for in Vietnam could be waived. The answer was that there are no circumstances in which that fee can be waived. Fortunately, the Vietnam Veterans Association in North Brisbane have decided that they will put up the money to cover the cost for this application.</para><para>I think it is a tremendous thing that the Vietnam veteran community is doing to try to get behind this bloke and get him and his family back here to Australia. The issue raised by Lex McAuley is that, once again, if the veterans do not help Mick, no-one else will. I think that is very true. It is very encouraging to see that people like Normie Rowe are prepared to put together a fundraising concert where all of the proceeds—apart from the administrative costs, of course—will go to this push to get Mick O'Mallon and his family back here to Australia.</para><para>I wish all of these people well in their endeavours to assist Mick. I know that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and a group of other veterans who were recently in Vietnam—I think last year—had the opportunity to meet Mick. I am sure that they, as leaders of their associations—the Vietnam Veterans Federation, the Vietnam Veterans association and the RSL—could collectively pool their resources and networks and help this bloke come home.

I refer to the first outrage: a 25 per cent fee rip-off inflicted by the Howard government on the students at La Trobe University in Bendigo. The decision by La Trobe University to increase HECS fees by the full 25 per cent, because of the Howard government's user-pays principle of higher education funding, has dealt a bitter blow to regional Victorian families who are already struggling to provide higher education for their kids. On the government's own figures, students attending La Trobe University in Bendigo in 2002 incurred a total HECS debt of nearly $6 million for that year. The figures, which I believe are an underestimate, were provided by the education minister, Dr Nelson, in reply to a question from me on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>. The answer showed that the debt incurred in just that year by students deferring payments of tertiary fees totalled $5,878. The Howard government has failed to reveal the total HECS debt incurred to date by La Trobe students, but I understand the total HECS debt accumulated by those students could be close to $50 million—little wonder that it will not come clean on the figure.</para></talk.start><para>The Howard government's fee rip-off has put one huge millstone around the neck of central Victorian students. They cannot afford to pay the heavily increased fees, and they have to go to new levels of debt for more years to pay the government back. The minister's answer shows that the Howard government, after taking office in 1996, dramatically jacked up tertiary fees at La Trobe University in Bendigo. They pushed them up from the existing flat rate of $2,442 per year for all courses, which they inherited under the Keating government, to three new big differential levels which are set in 2004 at $3,768 a year per course or one group of courses, $5,242 for another and $6,283 for another.</para><para>Under the 25 per cent fee increase imposed by the federal government policy on La Trobe University, these fees will murderously slam in one hit as follows: fees for band 1 courses, including arts, humanities and nursing, will rise in 2005 by $942 a year from $3,768 to $4,710. This is a massive $1,326 increase—a 54 per cent increase on the Keating government levels of 1996, when the rate was just $2,442. Fees for band 2 courses, including other health sciences, maths, computing, business and economics, will rise by $1,342 from $5,376 to $6,708. This is a Howard government increase of $4,266—a 175 per cent increase on the 1996 level. Fees for band 3 courses, including law at the La Trobe Bendigo campus, will rise by $1,572 from $6,283 to $7,854. This is an increase of $5,412 when compared with the 1996 levels, which represents an increase of some 221 per cent.</para><para>At present, the average HECS debt for students at La Trobe University in Bendigo, for all courses, is around $3,130 per year. This estimate is based on what I think are more accurate figures than the minister has quoted. So, on average, a three-year course for a student deferring fees at present costs around $9,390, a four-year course costs around $12,520 and a five-year course costs around $15,650. The impact of the devastating new 25 per cent increases is to jack up the average HECS cost of a course at Bendigo by $783 per year or by $2,346 for a three-year course and by $3,915 for a five-year course. In other words, a 25 per cent fee increase jacks up the average HECS cost of a course at La Trobe University by between $2,346 for a three-year course and $3,915 for a five-year course.</para><para>The Howard government is shifting the cost of education onto students and their families. They have turned Fawlty Towers—a familiar name for the La Trobe University at Bendigo—into a simple tax office. So what is the overall impact on the student population? On the education minister's figures, the total debt incurred for the whole population at La Trobe's Bendigo campus in 2002 was around $6 million. On those figures, students have now copped an extra $1.5 million in debt per year. Their total HECS debt for just one year will jump from $6 million to $7.5 million. Let us look at the likely impact on just one other group of students—those undertaking a computer course at La Trobe University's Bendigo campus. The 25 per cent hike in federal tertiary fees imposed on La Trobe University's Bendigo students will cost a computing student around $5,000 more in debt and take an extra two years to pay off.

There has been an increase in the number of new diagnoses of HIV amongst Indigenous Australians, from 13 in 2001 to 23 in 2002.  However, the overall number of infections in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples remains small (180 new diagnoses since 1993) and fluctuates considerably from year to year.</para><para>(2)	Australia's response to HIV/AIDS is considered to be among the best in the world, and has resulted in a sharp decline in deaths from AIDS since the mid-1990's.  The Australian Government spends a total of approximately $48 million per year directly on HIV/AIDS initiatives.  Of that $48 million, approximately $24 million per year is allocated through the Department of Health and Ageing for national HIV/AIDS education, prevention and promotion programs; HIV/AIDS research and surveillance; and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander sexual health programs.  Further funding is provided to States and Territories through the broadbanded Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs) for the development and implementation of local State and Territory HIV strategies, including support for HIV testing.  In 2002-03, States and Territories received a total of $124.2 million under the PHOFAs for national public health programs.</para><para>(3)	The World Health Organisation and UNAIDS estimates that public sector spending on HIV vaccine research and development amounted to US$430-US$470 million in 2001.  The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative reported in November 2002 that this expenditure accounts for less than 1% of global spending on health and pharmaceutical related research and development.  According to the UNAIDS Progress Report on the Global Response to the HIV/AIDS Epidemic 2003, although definitive figures are not available, it is likely that spending on vaccine research and development in 2003 will significantly exceed 2001 levels.</para><para>(4)	The majority of funding (around 70%) provided to the Australian Centre for Hepatitis and HIV Virology Research in 2003 was provided for HIV vaccine research and development. This constituted an amount of approximately $1.8 million.  In addition, in 2003, the National Health and Medical Research Council funded 9 grants specifically for research into HIV/AIDS vaccines, totalling an amount of approximately $675,000.  Funding for HIV vaccine research and development is only a small part of Australia's national research effort in HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C.  The Australian Government currently provides approximately $14 million annually for this national research.</para><para>(5)	The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria announced in July 2003, that without considerable increases in funding it will not have the resources to meet the anticipated cost of the next round of proposals it receives.</para><para>(6)	On 18 February 2004, the Australian Government Minister for Foreign Affairs announced that Australia would contribute $25 million over the next three years to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.</para><para>(7)	Yes.
